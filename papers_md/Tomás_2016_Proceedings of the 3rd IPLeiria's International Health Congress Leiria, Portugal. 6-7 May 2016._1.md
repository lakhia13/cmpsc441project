Health literacy, a more complex concept than knowledge,
is a re-
quired capacity to obtain, understand, integrate and act on health in-
formation [1], in order to enhance individual and community health,
which is defined by different levels, according to the autonomy and
personal capacitation in decision making [2].
Medium levels of Health literacy in an adolescent population were
found in a study conducted in 2013/2014, being higher in sexual
and reproductive health and lower in substance use. It was also no-
ticed that the higher levels of health literacy were in the area ado-
lescents refer to have receipt more health information. The health
literacy competence with higher scores was communication skills,
and the lower scores were in the capacity to analyze factors that in-
fluence health. Higher levels were also found in younger teenagers,
but in a higher school level, confirming the importance of health
education in these age and development stage. Adolescents seek
more information in health professionals and parents, being friends
more valued as a source information in older adolescents, which
enhance the importance of peer education mainly in older adoles-
cents [3].
As a set of competences based on knowledge, health literacy
should be developed through education interventions, encom-
passing the cultural and social context of individuals, since the
society, culture and education system where the individual
is
inserted can define the way the development and enforcement of
the health literacy competences [4]. The valued sources of infor-
mation should be taken into account, as well as needs of informa-
tion in some topics referred by adolescents in an efficient health
education.

Schizophrenia is a serious and chronic mental illness which has a pro-
found effect on the health and well-being related with the well-known
nature of psychotic symptoms. The exercise has the potential to im-
prove the life of people with schizophrenia improving physical health
and alleviating psychiatric symptoms. However, most people with
schizophrenia remains sedentary and lack of access to exercise pro-
grams are barriers to achieve health benefits. The aim of this study is to
evaluate the effect of exercise on I) the type of intervention in mental
health, II) in salivary levels of alpha-amylase and cortisol and serum
levels of S100B and BDNF, and on III) the quality of life and self-
perception of the physical domain of people with schizophrenia. The
sample consisted of 31 females in long-term institutions in the Casa de
Saúde Rainha Santa Isabel, with age between 25 and 63, and with diag-
nosis of schizophrenia according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Man-
ual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV-TR). Physical fitness was assessed by
the six-minute walk distance test (6MWD). Biological variables were
determined by ELISA (Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay). Psy-
chological variables were assessed using SF-36, PSPP-SCV, RSES and
SWLS tests. Walking exercise has a positive impact on physical fitness
(6MWD – p = 0.001) and physical components of the psychological
tests ([SF-36] physical functioning p < 0.05; [PSPP-SCV] functionality p <
0.05 and SWLS p < 0.05 of people with schizophrenia. The walking pro-
gram enhances the quality of life and self-perception of the physical
domain and physical fitness of people with schizophrenia.

The advancement of technology in diagnostic equipment was the
major driving force in the advancement of medical knowledge.
In
few decades, imaging methods went from two planes conventional
radiology to computed tomography in volumetric acquisition and
multiplanar reconstruction, with morphological analysis and quantifi-
cation of densities. With magnetic resonance we are able to perform
the analysis of tissue composition and to identify it´s changes in con-
text with each disease. Nowadays, molecular imaging methods en-
able the correlation of metabolism and diseases. The research and
knowledge acquired about the genome and the development of
genomics has given to the medical community the opportunity to
study genetic alterations linked to a large number of diseases.
New technology allows physicians a better diagnosis of a significant
number of syndromes and diseases, has seen in chronic degenerative
diseases and in oncological diseases. This big technological progress
is responsible for the advancement of personalized medicine and new
treatments, taking into account the biological and genetic characteris-
tics of each individual diseases. All the progress made in screening
methods has also lead the medical community to a more efficient
study of diseases with high prevalence in the general population.
The link between technological advancement seen today and the
early diagnosis of a large number of oncological diseases as well as
the development of a personalized medicine contributes not only to
the well-being of each patient but also to the practice of sustainable
medicine.

Ensuring adequate micronutrient status in children is a challenge,
particular in developing countries. In São Tomé e Príncipe, the Demo-
graphic and Health Survey reveals that more than half (62 %) of chil-
dren aged between 6 and 59 are anaemic [1]. Documents guiding
the Copenhagen Consensus [2] are very clear in demonstrating that
without micronutrient status correction there is no full development

in particular the cognitive capacity [3-5].

of human potential,
It is
thus essential that mothers know the consequences to better under-
stand the necessity of a balanced nutrition. Since 2011, WHO [6] has
been promoting the use of micronutrient powders (MNP) in coun-
tries with elevated anaemia prevalence in children, considering them
as a highly recommendable public health measure in fighting this
disease. In 2014, home supplementation with micronutrient powders
was proposed as a National Nutrition Policy strategy in São Tomé
and Príncipe [7].
The objective of this study is to describe families and communities’
reaction to the use of MNPs with emphasis on their acceptance,
utilization and promotion. This formative research contributes to ad-
just MNP messages to the culture and preferences of the target pub-
lic before the wider distribution of the MNPs.
The results of our study showed a good acceptance and correct
utilization of MNP. Regarding an effective communication, partici-
pants chose the colour of the package with an image of a saoto-
mean baby/child. The name brand “Vitaferro” was voted as most
popular as it is easy to pronounce and relates easily to MNP and to
anaemia. Some mothers also suggested a positive message motivat-
ing MNP use in the communication materials.

Safety culture of the patient: a reflexion about the therapeutic
approach on the patient with vocal pathology
Débora Franco
Centro de Linguística, Universidade de Lisboa, Lisboa, Portugal
BMC Health Services Research 2016, 16(Suppl 3):S6

Clinical practice raises issues pertaining to vocal quality, such as the in-
cidence and prevalence of dysphonia and the relapses in the process
of vocal rehabilitation. These issues merit a commitment of critical ana-
lysis to improve healthcare quality. The vocal use of each speaker, the
existence of bad habits and the presence of other pathologies are fac-
tors which compromise vocal health and can lead to dysphonia.
It has been concluded that body composition characteristics can in-
fluence the postural adaptations that an individual adopts over time,
h an impact on vocal health and glottic dynamics. Fatter individuals

BMC Health Services Research 2016, Volume 16 Suppl 3

will have compromised vital capacity and pneumophonic coordin-
ation, increasing the irregularities of vocal vibration and decreasing
the vocal
intensity. These individuals can develop postural adjust-
ments to improve the efficiency of the respiratory tract. However, a
head in hyper-extension will favour jaw descent with an impact on
vocal quality. The increase in cervical lordosis will increase the thor-
acic kyphosis and the kyphotic index, with differences having been
observed between normal and dysphonic individuals for
these
variables.
It is believed that a greater effectiveness of the intervention, redu-
cing the relapses, is possible if body morphology analysis is also in-
cluded in the evaluation protocols, permitting: (a) an identification of
risk factors of vocal pathology; (b) the forwarding to precise diagnos-
tic exams; (c) team planning of treatment; (d) postural intervention
to be included in the rehabilitation of dysphonia. Building a culture
of safety of the patient is finding our mission as health professionals.

Experience economy is the last segment in the evolution of the mar-
ket, and it is characterized by the fact that consumers do not acquire
goods, products or services, but experiences that they integrate in
their biography, and consequently in their identity. Customer Experi-
ence, possibly the latest revolution in business thinking along with
the digital transformation, seeks the design and management of truly
customer-centric experiences. This revolution is spreading across dif-
ferent sectors, among which the health sector should necessarily be
considered. This talk covers the fundamental ideas within the con-
cept of customer experience, as well as it provides information and
suggestions about how to design and deliver an optimal patient
experience.
Keywords: Experience economy, customer experience, patient ex-
perience, health care, customer centric culture.

Disasters affect emergency teams to varying degrees, causing trauma.
The risk factors for mental health can be determined according to the
experience of professionals in coping with these situations. The gravity
of the situation, as well as the behaviour and response of those present
will be different, depending on the extent of the catastrophe, such as
the number of deaths, destruction, duration and degree of rapidity of
the phenomenon.
The purpose of the study was to assess the psychological impact on
emergency crews after the natural disaster of February 20 2010, in
the isle of Madeira, Portugal. The professional group was comprised
of 405 individuals: firemen (41.7 %), military (32.8 %), police (17.3 %)
and health professionals (8.1 %). The assessment tools used were:
the list of life events and the peri-traumatic experiences question-
naire, adult version. Ethical
issues were considered as well as in-
formed consent.

The average age was 34.5 years, mostly male, married and in resi-
dence at the time of the event. The data show that there were sig-
nificant differences between the profession and the response to the
event, as well as in relation to Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD),
this being most evident in the group of firemen and military (p <
0.001; p < 0.001).
The results suggest the vital need for specific training for these pro-
fessional groups in the field of mental health, aimed at the preven-
tion of psychological disorders.

Background
The prevalence of musculoskeletal disorders related to work (MDRW)
is high in midwives. The risk factors are associated with the physical
environment, the nature of the occupation, the parturient, the type
of delivery and the new-born. Objective: Identifying the safety prac-
tices adopted by the midwives to prevent the MDRW.
Methods
Qualitative exploratory study. The inclusion criteria for the 12 partici-
pants were, the professional title of the midwives,
if they work in
childbirth blocks. For results analysis, Bardin’s propose of content
analysis was used. The anonymity and confidentiality of the results
was guaranteed.
Results
Concerns about equipment and materials manipulation as to pre-
vent low back overload in the initial positioning of the parturient
and the mobilization of the new-born stood out. Speech analysis
revealed difficulty in adopting preventive measures for the expul-
sive period, because the movement of pronation supination of the
upper limbs needed to facilitate the birth is done by increasing
muscular tension, making it difficult to maintain alignment and
body balance.
Conclusions
Participants report difficulties in maintaining the principles of bio-
mechanics especially in the expulsive period caused by the complica-
tions in controlling the parturient behaviour.

Background
Adverse childhood experiences are not only linked to mental health
difficulties but also to the inability to generate positive and affiliative
emotions. Individuals from these adverse backgrounds may also fear
and avoid compassionate feelings from others and being compas-
sionate for others and for themselves. Objective: This study aims to
test whether the impact of early negative memories in childhood on

BMC Health Services Research 2016, Volume 16 Suppl 3

psychological difficulties is mediated by fears of compassion (for others,
from others and for self).
Methods
The sample consists of 178 adolescents with ages between 12 and
18 years old (M = 15.53, SD = 1.96) from middle and secondary schools
in the central region of Portugal. Participants answered the following
self-report questionnaires: The Early Life Experiences Scale; the Fears of
Compassion Scales; and the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire.
Results
Results from Path Analysis showed that the full model accounted for
36 % of the psychological difficulties among adolescents. The recall
of threatening, subordination and devaluation experiences in child-
hood with parents had a direct impact on psychological difficulties.
These early adverse experiences also had an indirect effect in psy-
chological difficulties through both fears of compassion from others
and for self. A multi-group analysis for gender was tested and the
meditational model was equivalent for both genders.
Conclusions
These findings suggest that addressing adverse emotional memories
in childhood and fears of compassion (in others and self-to-self rela-
tionships) may be a valuable approach for preventive and interven-
tion actions in order to promote psychological adjustment in youths.

BMC Health Services Research 2016, 16(Suppl 3):O4

Background
The optimum age to give the first dose of the combined measles-
mumps-rubella vaccine (MMR) must balance the risk of disease and
the age of specific immunity induced by the vaccine.
Methods
A seroepidemiological study was conducted with 206 newborns, in
the Obstetric service of a Hospital of the District of Leiria. The study
followed all ethical procedures and was conducted under the ap-
proval of the ethical committee of the Hospital. At birth, a cord
serum sample was collected. Measles antibodies were measured in
cord sera, using Siemens Enzgnost’s immunoassay. Maternal vaccin-
ation history was ascertained through the analysis of individual re-
cords available at ACES Pinhal Litoral, Portugal.
Results
Among participants, 54 mothers had never been vaccinated with MMR,
62 had one dose and 90 had two doses. The concentration of measles
antibody increased with the age of the mother (r2 = 0.097, p = 0.001) and
was the highest in the newborns of mothers who had never been vacci-
nated against measles (μ = 1906,
IC 95 % = 1194-2857 mUI/mL; p <
0.001). According to a hypothetical model, and to the level of measles
antibody concentrations found at birth, 95 % of the children at 12 months
of age should still have a title of measles antibody above 40 mUI/mL.
Conclusions
Giving the first dose of MMR at 12 months of age, would be a good
decision if the half-life of measles antibodies in infants would be

44 days or less. Above that value, could be to compromise the effect-
iveness of the immune response.

Background
The aging process is multifactorial and progressive. A major goal in
this process is to be active, in order to maintain independence and
continue as long as possible an active life. Objectives: To evaluate
independence in activities of daily living of elderly;
the functional
and analyse the scoring in daily activities in relation to socio-
demographic variables.
Methods
A correlational study with elderly, registered in a health centre of
central Portugal. It was used the Barthel index (10 items) to estimate
independence in activities of daily life. The score
the functional
ranges from zero to hundred. The Spearman correlation was used,
with a statistically significant level of α = 0.05.
Results
A total of 62 elders were assessed, 34 (54.8 %) of them women, with
a mean age of 77.2 ± 7.5 years. The Barthel Index showed high in-
ternal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0.846). The average Barthel
Index was 95.5 ± 10.2, most have a higher level of independence,
however the elderly had more dependency for daily activities: bath-
ing and using the toilet. The relationship between age and daily ac-
tivities of the elderly was significant on the total score of the Barthel
Index. The age and the level of independence shown to be statisti-
cally associated.
Conclusions
The results show the reliability of the Barthel
Index. The age has
been identified as the key factor and therefore is consistent with the
results of other studies. This study may contribute to identify the fac-
tors that will promote the degree of independence.

smoking and total coronary risk (incidence of lethal and non-lethal
coronary events) in a cohort of 35-74 year-old patients followed for
10 years.
Methods
Longitudinal, observational study of a retrospective cohort followed
for ten years in primary care practices in Badajoz (Spain). A cohort of
968 patients (mean 55.7 year-old; 57.5 % women) without evidence
of cardiovascular disease was studied. Smokers were defined as
those who consumed any amount of tobacco daily during the year
before, or those who declared cessation of smoking within less than
one year.
Results
A 25.9 % of the patients were smokers (47.4 % of male and
10.2 % of
(51.5 vs
57.2 years, p < 0.001), with less prevalence of arterial hypertension
(45.4 % vs 61.5 %, p < 0.01), and lower HDL-cholesterol (45.5 vs
54.0 mg/dl, p < 0.001). During the follow-up,
they presented a
higher mortality, myocardial infarction events, and more coronary
episodes (14.7 % vs 9.2 %, p < 0.05). The final model of the logistic
regression multivariate analysis revealed that only smoking and
age are predictor variables of total coronary events, the greater
IC95%; 1.31-4.16;
odds ratio corresponding to smoking (OR: 2.33;
p < 0.01).
Conclusions
In patients aged 35-74 years followed during 10 years, smoking dou-
bles the risk of total coronary events. Primary health care and general
practitioners must keep their commitment to investigate and search
strategies that facilitate smoking cessation.

The sample used in this study consisted of all musicians of the Phil-
harmonic Society of Crestuma and the Musical Band of Avintes, each
constituted by fifty (50) musicians. All elements completed an indi-
vidual questionnaire about individual and work factors and then the
Nordic Musculoskeletal Questionnaire (NMQ).
Results
Neck, shoulders, wrists/hands, lumbar spine were main areas where
the musicians complained about pain. Drummers were the ones who
reported more intense pain in shoulders, wrists/hands and lumbar
spine. It was also observed that women had higher pain intensities
while compared to men. The pain seems to decrease with years of
practice, except in what concerns the lower back.
Conclusions
This study concluded that there is a high prevalence of musculoskel-
etal disorders (MSDs) in musicians and the lumbar and cervical spine,
shoulders and wrists/hands were the most affected areas.

Background
Hip fractures are a major health problem in elderly people, with great
impact on their quality of life and life expectancy, beyond increasing
dependence and institutionalization. Psychotropic drugs have been
associated with multiple health problems, and they increase the risk
of falls, which can cause fractures. Objectives: To analyse the risk fac-
tors for hip fracture in the population of a primary care practice in
Badajoz (Spain), and the possible association between hip fractures
and chronic use of psychotropic drugs.
Methods
Descriptive, observational study of 73 patients diagnosed with hip
fracture between 2007-2013 (75.3 % women; 24.7 % men), with clin-
ical history in the primary care practice.
Results
The mean age of the patients was 78.3 ± 12.6 years (79.5 % ≥ 70 years;
16.4 % ≥ 90 years), all women. 67.1 % had high blood pressure,
43.8 % cardiovascular diseases, 38.4 % dyslipidaemia, 30.1 % muscu-
loskeletal diseases and 21.9 % some kind of visual impairment. Medi-
cation with psychotropic drugs was registered in 50.7 %, highlighting
an important prescription among women (58.2 % vs 27.8 %, p <
0.05), mainly benzodiazepines (47.3 % vs 22.2 %, p = 0.053). However,
only 19.2 % had picked up on their history a diagnosis to justify such
a prescription.
Conclusions
Patients with hip fracture were women, with a mean age of 80.9 years
and a register of high consumption of psychotropic drugs (58.2 %),
particularly benzodiazepines (47.3 %). These results encourage a judi-
cious prescription of psychotropic drugs in general, and benzodiaze-
treatments, as
pines
recommended by the clinical practice guidelines.

Background
Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) is characterized by a marked fear or
anxiety in situations where the individual might be exposed to the
possible scrutiny by others. Post-Event Processing (PEP), which refers
to a post-mortem rumination wherein the subject reviews critically

BMC Health Services Research 2016, Volume 16 Suppl 3

Page 6 of 132

and with detail what went wrong in the social event, is considered
an important maintenance factor of SAD. Clinical practice seems to
indicate that rumination in patients with SAD, is mainly a self-critical
process frequently resulting in feelings of shame.
Aims: This study aimed to bridge the gap between cognitive vari-
ables (PEP) and evolutionary variables (Self-Criticism and Internal/Ex-
ternal Shame) in understanding Social Anxiety (SA), exploring the
mediator role of these evolutionary variables in the relationship be-
tween PEP and SA in a clinical sample of patients with SAD.
Methods
The sample was constituted by 32 subjects with SAD – 25 females
(78.10 %) and 7 males (21.90 %) – with an average age of 26.78 (SD
= 9.22), that filled several self-report instruments and answered a
diagnostic interview.
Results
Self-Criticism and Internal Shame fully mediated the relationship be-
tween PEP and SA. However, Sobel test only supported the full medi-
ation of Internal Shame.
Conclusions
These results suggest that SA does not directly depend on PEP levels
but from Internal Shame levels. In other words, Internal Shame is the
Internal
mechanism through which PEP impacts on SA. Therefore,
Shame seems to be an important health indicator to consider in the
intervention with this population. Limitations and clinical implications
will be discussed.

Background
The quest for continuous improvement of the quality of provided
care is the objective of nursing care. However, the insertion and per-
manence of a peripheral venous catheter has been associated to
complications, thus making a systematic evaluation of the perform-
ance of professionals and the management of health services import-
ant. Objective: Analyse complications
that caused removal of
intravenous catheters.
Methods
A prospective study with 64 patients of a health service of Portugal,
from July to September/2015. Included patients with age 18 years,
with a peripheral venous catheter. Descriptive analysis using SPSS.
Ethical requirements were met.
Results
Two hundred three (203) intravenous catheters, in 64 patients, most
elderly (section 95.3 %), with mean age of 80 years were evaluated.
The catheters remained inserted between one and 12 days (mean
2 days), 66 % of the devices were removed because of complications,
such as: removal by the patient (17.7 %), obstruction (17.2 %), infiltra-
tion (14.8 %), phlebitis (9.4 %) and fluid exiting the insertion site
(6.4 %). The prevalence of obstruction and infiltration per patient
was respectively 36 % and 39 %.
Conclusions
Obstruction and infiltration were the complications of higher preva-
lence that led to the removal and reinsertion of a new peripheral
venous catheter with the possibility of increased pain, infection and

hospital costs. Faced with the risk of compromising patient safety
and being able to contribute to the improvement of health care, we
suggest the inclusion of obstruction and infiltration in the indicators
of quality of care, in order to have systematic evaluation of results,
(re)plan and implement preventive measures.

Background
Falls have high incidence in elderly and are major responsible for ac-
cidental deaths. People with high depression and anxiety symptoms
have impaired balance and this is more problematic in the elderly
population. However,
it is unknown how anxiety and depression
symptoms affect the different systems responsible for balance and
balance confidence. Objective: Explore balance systems and balance
confidence differences between elderly with presence/absence of
anxiety and depression symptoms.
Methods
A quantitative
Socio-
demographic, anthropometric and general clinical data were col-
lected with a structured questionnaire. Balance confidence was eval-
uated with Activities-specific Balance Confidence (ABC) and balance
with Balance Evaluation System Test (BESTest) and Berg Balance
Scale (BBS). The level of significance was set at p < .05.
Results
One hundred thirty-six (136) elderly (75.9 ± 8.8 years old; n = 96 fe-
male), participated in this study. All BESTest sections were signifi-
cantly affected by the presence of anxiety or depression symptoms
(p < 0.001). Similar results were observed in BBS (p < 0.001). The Re-
active section presented the larger difference between present/ab-
sence of anxiety (49.4 ± 21.1 vs 84.2 ± 14.9; p < 0.001) and depression
(46.3 ± 30.3 vs 88.5 ± 15.3; p < 0.001) symptoms. Participants’ balance
confidence also decreased significantly in the presence of both
symptoms (anxiety: p = 0.010; depression: p = 0.001). The severity of
both symptoms influenced significantly the balance (BBS (anxiety:
p = 0.013; depression: p = 0.029); BESTest (0.001 < p > 0.046)) but not
the balance confidence (anxiety: p = 0.516; depression: p = 0.274).
Conclusions
The presence of anxiety and of depression symptoms significantly de-
crease balance performance and balance confidence in the elderly. The
severity of symptoms significantly decreases balance performance but
does not seem to significantly impact on balance confidence.

Background
Postural changes acquired during childhood and adolescence are a
risk factor for disorders of the spine in adulthood and may become
irreversible if not treated in time. The purpose of this study was to

BMC Health Services Research 2016, Volume 16 Suppl 3

evaluate the postural changes among students of basic schools in
the district of Porto.
Methods
Weight and height were measured. The "body chart" and visual
analogue scale for pain and static postural form for evaluation of
postural changes, backpack characteristics and additional physical ac-
tivity questionnaire were used.
Results
This study included 285 students, aged 11.46 years ± 1.32 years, and
weighing 43.36 kg ± 10.49 kg and with a height of 1.48 m ± 0.95 m.
Use of backpack: 97.5 % of the participants, 83.0 % use it in both
shoulders and 17.0 % only on one shoulder. In relationship to phys-
ical activity 58.0 % do it after regular school time, the most prevalent
physical activity was swimming with 21.3 % and 23.1 % for football.
Pain lifetime prevalence was 43.0 %. With regard to postural
changes, elevation of the shoulders was the most prevalent (78.0 %),
changes in iliocostalis angle (52.5 %) and flat feet (47.2 %), calcaneus
valgus (37.7 %) and scoliosis (25.5 %), anterior head projection
(63.0 %), anterior shoulder (45.2 %), pelvic anteversion (37.7 %), lum-
bar hyperlordosis (56.9 %) and knee recurvatum (24.2 %).
Conclusions
We conclude that postural changes found are according the postural
characteristics for
this age group and identification of changes
allowed earlier clinical referral and propose school postural education
prevention programmes.

Background
Stroke is the main cause of death in Portugal and it’s also one of the
pathologies involved in several physical and psychological comorbid-
ities and which often prevents stroke patients from having an au-
tonomous life. There are still several gaps related to the prognosis of
the two different types of stroke (ischemic and haemorrhagic) and is
relevant to know which type has the better longevity. Objective: The
main objective of the present study is to evaluate the survival rate of
both types of stroke, and simultaneously the mortality risk in those
patients.
Methods
A sample of 1367 individuals who suffered a stroke was collected in
Hospital do Espírito Santo de Évora, between 2010 and 2015, after
that the sample’s profile, risk factors and associated comorbidities
were studied. Then, we created a subgroup from the initial sample
with 311 individuals who suffered both types of stroke in the period
2013-2014 and performed a statistical analysis of survival and mortal-
ity risk.
Results
Individuals who suffered ischemic stroke have a lower mortality rate,
as well as an improved initial survival; Three months after the event,
the mortality risk becomes independent of the stroke type. We also
observed that age has an effect on survival.
Conclusions
Haemorrhagic stroke is associated with an increased mortality and
worse survival rate compared with ischemic stroke.

Background
Chronobiology is a discipline that studies the biological processes fol-
lowing predictable temporal sequences, focusing on the analysis of cir-
cadian rhythms and biological rhythms associated with the geophysical
basis. Any physiological function of living things can be analysed from
the perspective of chronobiology as a phenomenon with a significant
temporal and rhythmic dimension. Objective: To determine whether
the existence of chronobiological factors and circadian variations in-
volved in the development of locomotives diseases in adolescence.
Methods
Observational, descriptive, retrospective and quantitative study on
the adolescent population of Lanzarote (Canary Islands) from 2010 to
2015 Study. Data collection: computer system Drago. Statistical Ana-
lysis with SPSS 23.0 software.
Results
On a sample of 1,214 adolescents it was found a significant associ-
ation (p < 0.023) between gender, seasonal time and location of the
lesion, being more frequent in males 11-16 years, most of them in
autumn and winter and being the lower limbs in men (56 %) and
arms in women (42 %), the most affected areas. Highlighting the lack
of medical records in medical records regarding the etiology of the
lesion (37.2 %) and time of occurrence (89 %).
Conclusions
The teenage gender is a trigger factor in musculoskeletal disorders. The
prevalence of these diseases is higher in urban areas. The prevalent eti-
ology is trauma. The climate and geographical location of Lanzarote,
significantly influence the etiology and location of the lesion. We
should prepare educational programs on risk prevention at schools.

stratified by gender and age was studied. A questionnaire was used
including nutritional risk assessment using the Mini Nutritional As-
sessment (MNA).
Results
56.4 % (217) are women and 43.6 % (168) are men with an average
of 76.39 ± 7.18 years of age. The majority (62.9 %; 242) is married/civil
partnership and 28.6 % (110) are widowers. 37.8 % (134) relate some
degree of loneliness. We also noticed that 96 elderly (24.9 %) show
risk of malnutrition. Those who are married/in a civil partnership
have higher probability of normal nutritional condition when com-
pared with single or divorced (OR = 2.925); those with schooling have
higher probability of normal nutritional condition (OR = 2.287) com-
pared to those without schooling. The ones who mention less loneli-
ness present 1.5 to 4.7 higher probabilities of normal nutritional
condition compared with the ones who state any level of loneliness.
The ones who are functionally independent have higher probability
of a normal nutritional state than those who have any degree of
dependency.
Conclusions
Results highlight the need for specific protocols in health institutions to
identify old people at nutritional risk allowing a timely intervention.

Background
Therapeutic Education is structural to diabetic people’s self-control.
Although these questions have been a research theme of concern
over the past years, there is a shortage of tested educational pro-
grammes that allow discussion of its effectiveness. Objective: To de-
sign a lifestyle educational programme for diabetic patients.
Methods
An exploratory and descriptive approach was made, starting by char-
acterizing and understanding the context – a Primary Care Unit, as
well as the usual educational intervention developed. Data collection
included semi-directive interviews, observational moments and rec-
ord analysis. Supported by a theoretical framework (Orem’s Self-care
Theory and Empowerment perspective),
information was analysed
and discussed with the nurses, in group and individual interactions,
from July until October 2014.
Results
The result was a Lifestyle Educational Programme directed to people
with type 2 diabetes, focused on lifestyle and self-control behaviours,
to be implemented by primary care nurses. With a 24-week timeline,
the programme starts with a face-to-face nursing intervention,
followed by two educational group sessions, the first one focussed
on self-motivation and lifestyle generic behaviours, and the second
one centred on foot self-care and monitoring. At 12 weeks, the sec-
ond face-to-face intervention is done, complemented by a telephone
monitoring intervention after four weeks, ending with the last indi-
vidual moment, 24 weeks after the beginning of the programme.
Conclusions
The programme developed is a Complex Intervention, with several
components, including the intervention usually carried out by nurs-
ing professionals, in addition to which is added group and telephone
intervention, merged in an educational protocol that follows specific
sequential phases.

BMC Health Services Research 2016, 16(Suppl 3):O17

Background
Adherence to medication regimens is an indicator of health service
efficiency (WHO, 2003). It promotes improvements in clinical status,
safety and quality of life of individuals and leads to better financial
results, reflected by reduced use of health services and decreases the
risk of aggravation of disease and acute crises caused by inadequate
drug management. Objective: Describe the level and factors associ-
ated with the adherence to medication regimens in the elderly.
Methods
From a research-action perspective, we developed a descriptive,
quantitative and transversal study (2014), with random and acciden-
tal sample in a Madeira Island parish (n = 493) using the question-
naire “Measure Adherence to Treatment- MAT” validated for the
Portuguese population (α = 0.74).
Results
Mean age 70 years (σ ± 7.1); 68 % female; 70 % have 4 years of edu-
cation; 40 % consume 5 or more different drugs/day; with a mean of
adherence of 5.4(6). The main factors that influence adherence are
the problems of memory (40 %); In the MAT subscales 23.5 % non-
adherence was found; 13.5 % non-adherence by excess; 18.0 %-non-
adherence by deficit and 14.1 % other causes.
In the subscale of
non-adherence, the values observed were: 33.0 % failure to take the
medication; 30.5 % the neglect in the time of taking; 16.8 % abandon-
ment because they feel better and 15.8 % because they feel worse.
Conclusions
The results corroborate the findings of other studies and express the
priorities for action in this context. In partnership, specific objectives
were outlined and nursing interventions designed to enhance pa-
tient adherence to medication prescriptions.

Results
There were 2,143 hospitalizations (714.3/year) in the public health
system for cervical cancer of the GPA residents (3.4/10,000 inhabi-
tants/year). Hospitalizations and deaths of patients up to 44 years
represented 41.0 % and 27.9 % respectively. The average length of
stay was 7.4 days. Thirty-two (1.5 %) patients needed to use Intensive
Care Unit (ICU). The mortality rate reached 8.5 % with 183 deceased
patients (61/year). The average annual expenditure was $ 657,0 thou-
sand PPP (Purchasing Power Parity) and the average value per
hospitalization $ 919,78 PPP.
Conclusions
Hospitalization for and death from cervical cancer have occurred in
young women in GPA and it could be prevented if more emphasis
was given to preventive tests.

In many countries, health systems are guided by the principle of equal
access, which becomes a major challenge when it comes to high-
magnitude diseases, such as cancer. In Brazil, this is considered as a pub-
lic health problem due to its high incidence, mortality and difficulty in
accessing diagnosis and treatment. This research study aimed at analys-
ing the regulation of access to highly complex cancer care in a Brazilian
State, considering the normative criteria established under the Unified
Health System, the care model structure, and integrated and coordi-
nated network services. The research involved two stages: design of the
evaluation model and case study. The evaluation model consisted in 14
indicators, grouped into two dimensions - working condition and ad-
equacy of regulation - and was agreed by experts in consensus workshops.
Data were collected through direct observation, interviews with managers
and professionals from the State Regulatory Agency, and the review of in-
formation and documents from the regulatory sector data banks. The re-
search findings show that the performance of the Regulatory System in
regulating the access to highly complex cancer care in the State under
study is being implemented, although its ability to meet the patients’
health needs falls short of its potential. There are weaknesses in the imple-
mentation and adoption of Information and Regulation Systems and in the
availability of information with the potential to help the State manager’s
decision-making in highly complex cancer care.

Background
Access to health services means the timely use of personal health
services to achieve the best health outcomes. Several studies have
identified a multiplicity of impediments to health services accessibil-
ity by older adults including cost, cultural barriers and physical access
barriers. Objectives: This study takes part of a Gerontological Plan
currently being conducted in the Vila Nova de Gaia (VNG) Municipal-
ity. It focuses on the main difficulties observed in the older popula-
tion as perceived by professionals who assume a pivotal role in the
coordination of social care services at a parish level.
Methods
Twenty interviews were conducted and data was analysed based on
thematic content.
Results
Access to health care services was found to be an important difficulty,
namely due to the costs/affordability of health care visits and to the
lack/costs of transportation particularly for seniors living in rural areas.
Problems related to family care provision and medical care compliance,
low incomes and the absence of specialized services (e.g. neurocogni-
tive disorders) were also frequently mentioned constraints.
Conclusions
Findings are in line with the last WHO World Health Survey, which

Background
Usually sleep disturbances often precede depression, being an inde-
pendent risk factor for a first episode or recurrence of depression [1].
Young adults beginning college are entering a new phase with new
social contexts, demanding classes and variable sleep schedules.
These significant lifestyle changes are associated with lower sleep
quality [2] and with a higher prevalence of psychological distress and
depression [3]. Objectives: I) To study the prevalence of sleep difficul-
ties and depressive symptoms in college students and II) To analyse
the relationship between these two variables.
Methods
Seven hounded seventy-six (776) Portuguese students (64.3 % fe-
males) filled in the Beck Depressive Inventory II (BDI II) [4] and an
adaptation of a sleep self-response questionnaire [5].
Results
In the present sample 49.6 % students reported sleep difficulties,
which varied according to gender and age (p < 0.05). The prevalence
of difficulty initiating sleep was 25.4 %, of maintaining sleep was
20.5 % and of early morning awakening was 30.2 %. The prevalence
of depression was 17.4 %, highlighting the somatic dimension. Stron-
gest correlations were observed between sleep difficulties and de-
pression (r = 0.332; p < 0.001).
Conclusions
The results show a high prevalence of sleep difficulties associated
with depressive symptoms. It was found that approximately 1/5 of

the analysed students had depression. These results underline the
importance of developing prevention programs in higher education
for healthy sleep in order to promote better mental health.

Background
Research on mental health in higher education reported a high
prevalence of psychological distress among students [1]. The college
years represent a developmentally challenging transition to adult-
hood, and untreated mental illness may have significant implications
for academic success, productivity, substance use, and social relation-
ships [2]. Objectives: I) To study the prevalence of psychopathological
symptoms and medication use in college students and II) To analyse
the relationship between these two variables.
Methods
Seven hundred seventy-six (776) Portuguese students (64.3 % fe-
males) filled in the Portuguese version of the Brief Symptom Inven-
tory (BSI) [3, 4] and a self-response questionnaire about medication
use.
Results
20.1 % of the student’s present psychopathology, more prevalent in
females in several dimensions (Somatization, Obsessive-Compulsive,
Interpersonal Sensitivity, Depression, Anxiety, and Paranoid ideation),
being the Obsessive-Compulsive dimension the most prevalent.
50.1 % of the students had consumed medication in the last four
weeks: 14.7 % Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory, 14.0 % Analgesics
and antipyretics, 5.3 % Antihistamines and 1.7 % Psychotropic drug.
The prevalence was higher in females (75.4 %). Comparing students
with and without psychopathological symptoms we found significant
differences in relation to use of medication (p < 0.05). Students with
psychopathological symptoms use more Analgesics and antipyretics
and Psychotropic drugs (p < 0.05).

Conclusions
Results indicate a relevant prevalence of psychopathology, higher in fe-
males and a high prevalence of medication use. Students with psycho-
pathological symptoms use more medication. These results highlight
the importance of developing mental health intervention programs.

Background
There is evidence from the literature that an individual with ad-
equate health literacy (HL) has the ability to be responsible for its
own health as well as one's family and community health. However,
actions such as unprotected sexual intercourse (SI) and multiple part-
ners during adolescence are important risk factors to transmission of
sexually transmitted diseases (STD). Objective. To study the relation-
ship between HL, STD and risks behaviour in second and third years
of higher education studies, comparing students of health sciences
(HSc) vs. non-health sciences (NHSc).
Methods
A questionnaire was used to evaluate the HL level and sexual risk be-
haviours, and a blood sample was collected for ELISA screening of
HIV, HCV and Herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV 2), and Treponema
Pallidum (VDRL test).
Results
Higher levels of HL were found in HSc students (p < 0.001), and also
in those with higher level of confidence in condom use (p < 0.05). In
average, NHSc students had a higher number of sexual partners (p =
0.001). The practice of anal
intercourse is associated with younger
age at first SI, as well as a higher number of sexual partners. STD
prevalence (2.5 %), in particular in the case of HSV 2, was higher in
those who consume more alcohol to relax before a sexual encounter.
Conclusions
Students of NHSc show a lower level of HL, higher number of sexual
partners and higher level of practice of anal intercourse when com-
pared with HSc students.

Background
Alcohol abuse appears associated with numerous risk behaviours
among students, including suicide attempts. One in each four stu-
dents who attempted suicide admitted to having consumed alcohol
or drugs before the act (WHO, 2013) [1]. Objective: To identify the in-
fluence of alcohol consumption in suicidal ideation of higher educa-
tion students.
Methods
We resorted to a model of quantitative, cross-sectional, analytical, de-
scriptive and correlation research. Two hundred and sixty (260) stu-
dents of our institution (Health School of Viseu) participated in the
study. The evaluation protocol includes a socio-demographic ques-
tionnaire, the Involvement Scale for Adolescents with Alcohol Fil-
stead & Mayer (1979) adapted by Fonte & Alves (1999) [2] and the
Suicidal Ideation Questionnaire-QIS-Reynolds (1988) adapted to the
Portuguese population by Ferreira e Castela (1999) [3].
Results
We found that 69.9 % of students started drinking after the age of
15, and curiosity (61.3 %) was the main given reason. Of the 87.2 %
habitual drinkers, only 3.3 % reported drinking problems. It should
be noted that 3.1 % of
the students admitted having suicidal
thoughts. In our study there were no statistically significant associa-
tions between alcohol consumption and suicidal ideation (p > 0.005).
Conclusions
The results point to the importance of continuing to investigate the
association between alcohol consumption and suicide ideation. The
early onset of alcohol consumption associated with easy access to
such drinks and suicidal ideation are variables to consider in future
researches and in actions intending to promote healthier lifestyles
among higher education students.

Background
The transition from high school to university usually represents
changes in the lifestyle of the students. However, changes in the
quality of life (QoL) are not well known in this population. Objective:

The aim of this study is to analyse the QoL of university students by
gender and school year.
Methods
Participants are 198 undergraduate students (135 males and 63 fe-
males) at Faculdade de Ciências do Desporto e Educação Física of
the University of Coimbra (FCDEF-UC). Demographic variables and
physical activity were collected using a self-reported questionnaire.
QoL was assessed using the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-
Form Health Survey - SF-36v2. MANOVA one-way, and MANCOVA,
controlling for gender, were used to compare variables of interest
(p < 0.05).
Results
Males had higher QoL than females, specifically in the domains of vi-
tality (M = 61 ± 17, F = 53 ± 18; p =0.003), social functioning (M = 83 ±
18, F = 77 ± 21; p = 0.039), role-emotional (M = 81 ± 21, F = 74 ± 23;
p = 0.053), mental health (M = 73 ± 17; F = 66 ± 19; p = 0.005), men-
tal component score (M = 74 ± 15, F = 67 ± 16; p = 0.005), and over-
all SF-36 (M = 78 ± 11, F = 73 ± 13; p = 0.006). Students in the third
school year had higher role-physical (p = 0.045) and bodily pain (p =
0.034) than in the first school year, controlling for gender.
Conclusions
Male students had better QoL than women. Students in the third
school year had higher values in the domains of role-physical and
bodily pain. Further research in this area with university students is
recommended.

The adolescent antisocial phenomenon is an important matter for our
society due to the increase in frequency and severity of deviant con-
ducts during a developmental stage, when individuals face multiple
changes.
We present a study on antisocial manifestations and their relation
with gender, age, socioeconomic status, personality, social skills, self-
concept, and family environment in a sample of 489 adolescents,
that filled self-report measures to assess behaviour, personality, self-
concept, family environment and social skills.
Results show important gender differences that may explain why
boys have higher antisocial tendencies. While,
in boys, psychoti-
cism and family environment contribute to determine which indi-
viduals are more likely to have higher antisocial scores; female
antisocial tendency appears to be defined by individual disposi-
tions and social skills. Significant correlations between antisocial
behaviour, age, personality, social skills, self-concept and family
environment in boys and girls reveal the importance of individual
dispositions and of early prevention efforts focused on the individ-
ual and family.
Conclusions focus on the importance of dimensions for the preven-
tion of adolescent antisocial behaviour and reveal important gender
differences and trends on the evolution of antisocial behaviour
through adolescence. We demonstrate the importance of differences
between boys and girls in adolescent antisocial behaviour and of the
necessity to address this issue taking into account gender specific-
ities and vulnerabilities.

Escola Superior da Saúde da Cruz Vermelha Portuguesa, Lisboa,
1300-125, Portugal
BMC Health Services Research 2016, 16(Suppl 3):O27

Background
The mental health of students attending higher education in the area
of Health Sciences may be conditioned by factors which may affect
them as a person, their relationships and their academic perform-
ance, compromising their adaptation. Objectives: To identify the
main risk factors for mental health, associated with the academic life
experiences of students of Health Sciences and to contribute to the
implementation of prevention strategies of mental health problems
in these students.
Methods
The research dealt with a sample of 620 people, medical students,
nursing students and applied health students, namely: physiotherapy,
cardiopulmonary technology and radiography, whose average age
was 20.3 and ranged between 18 and 25 years old, 81 % being fe-
male. The instruments used were a Demographic Questionnaire; Aca-
demic Life Experiences Questionnaire [1,2] and Mental Health
Inventory [3].
Results
The results showed that attending the 1st year in the course of
physiotherapy, belonging to the female gender, being displaced,
having a lower career expectation, not being autonomous, showing
a negative perception of their cognitive skills, lower self-confidence,
decreased of psychological and/or physical well-being, academic dif-
ficulties resulting from deficient knowledge bases and high levels of
anxiety in situations of assessment, are associated with poorer men-
tal health.
Conclusions
This calls for special attention from the different structures of Higher
Education institutions, namely, governing bodies, teachers and aca-
demic services, to reduce the negative impact of these risk factors
and implement strategies to prevent the incidence of mental health
problems in this population.

Background
In Primary Health Care (PHC) the impact of health problems on the
individual’s health, interaction with the environment and on the qual-
ity of life guided by the International Classification of Functioning
Disability and Health (ICF), allows an approach to health indicators
and attention to the components of functionality, environmental and
personal contexts. Objective: To describe the functionality profile of
people registered in Family Health Strategies (FHSs).
Methods
A transversal study. Ninety-two people were attended in the physio-
therapy apprenticeship programme of UNISC, in PHC, starting from
the physiotherapeutic diagnosis guided by ICF, at four FHSs in Santa
Cruz do Sul (Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil), in 2015. Data presented in
relative frequency.
Results
The prevalent alterations were sensorial functions and pain (84 %),
pain (75 %), cardiovascular, haematological, immunological and re-
spiratory alterations (56 %), neuromusculoskeletal problems and
those related to movement (85 %), mobility of joints (73 %) and mus-
cular strength (50 %), structures related to movement (94 %) and
lower extremities (56 %). The limitations of activities and restriction
in participation was in mobility (66 %). The environmental factors of
larger occurrence were products and technology (56 %), support and
relationships (91 %), immediate family being a facilitator and barrier
(67 % and 14 %), and health professional facilitators (82 %). Services,
systems and policies (62 %) are added, especially services, systems
and policies of health (52 % facilitator; 4 % barrier).
Conclusions
The ICF is considered in the composition of health indicators sustain-
ing, expanding and guiding the actions of health, enlarging access
and people's accessibility to provide comprehensive attention and to
care.

risk factors,

Background
Cardiovascular disease is the main cause of disability and prema-
ture death worldwide, being associated to these clinical conditions
various cardiovascular risk factors leading to a higher prevalence
of cardiovascular disease manifested in different ways. Among the
various cardiovascular
it stands out dyslipidaemia,
diabetes mellitus, hypertension, smoking and family history of ath-
erosclerotic disease. Objective: The aim is to estimate the preva-
risk factors and cardiovascular disease,
lence of cardiovascular
such as acute myocardial infarction and stroke in Portalegre city's
population.
Methods
The present study is of the analytical, observational and cross-
sectional type in a random sample, consisting of 1,000 subjects and
collected between July 2014 and January 2015. Data were collected
by a questionnaire applied to the population under study.
Results
In 1,000 subjects there was a mean age of 52.5 ± 19.1 years and
54.7 % of subjects belonged to the female gender. The overall preva-
lence of hypertension was 35.0 % followed by hypercholesterolemia
with 32.3 %, smoking habits with 14.0 % and 15.8 % of ex-smokers,
diabetes present in 12.0 % of respondents and hypertriglyceridemia,

that was the less present in the population with 7.2 %. It was also
analysed cardiovascular pathology, being obtained a prevalence of
acute myocardial infarction of 4.2 % and 2.7 % for stroke.
Conclusions
The prevalence of risk factors proved to be high in the population of
the city of Portalegre, as well as the occurrence of the cardiovascular
events studied.

Demographical changes and the increasing proportion of older people
will generate new health needs in the coming years as well as huge
challenges to health and social systems. The growth in the number of
older people living alone in urban areas is particularly problematic be-
cause of the potential health risk that may be associated with social iso-
lation and loneliness.
In this paper we present the results of a longitudinal descriptive
and correlational study of the elderly population living in Portalegre
historic city centre. The purpose of the research is to monitor
trends between 2013 and 2015, regarding health status (self-assess-
ment of health status; self-assessment of the existence of changes
in health status and autonomy in performing everyday activities),
feelings of loneliness and symptoms of depression. The first evalu-
ation took place in January 2013 comprising a sample of 123 elders.
The second evaluation took place in October 2015 comprising 44
elderly people (79 cases had been lost between the 1st and the
2nd evaluations).
Results showed a deterioration of health status (although differences
were not statistically significant), changing the self-perceived un-
healthy elderly from 43.5 % to 58.2 % (p = 0.227 by McNemar's test)-
The same tendency was found in the percentage of elderly needing
help in performing everyday activities, changing from 5 % in 2013 to
14 % in 2015 (p = 0.289 by McNemar's test).
Concerning feelings of loneliness and symptoms of depression a
weakening was also found of elderly people’s status with potential
consequences on social and personal wellbeing.

Background
Sleep represents a basic human need, embodying several crucial
functions in the young adult phase. Objective: To evaluate the sleep
quality of higher education students.
Methods
A descriptive-transversal study with a quantitative approach. Non-
probabilistic convenience sample of 358 students from Instituto Politéc-
nico de Bragança (IPB). Data collection tools used: Socio-demographic
record and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI).

Results
The majority of the sample (54 %) presents bad sleep quality and the
remaining (46 %) good quality. Concerning gender, we can highlight
that the majority of males presents good sleep quality and the ma-
jority of the females bad quality. Concerning sleep quality, the results
match those of Pereira (2013) [1], who obtained a global PSQI score
of 7.74, with 76 % of the students considered to have bad sleep
quality and 24 % good quality. Data from national and international
literature state that university or higher education students present
bad sleep quality. Concerning the difference of sleep quality among
genders, the results corroborate those of Coelho (2014), [2] in which
females were more affected by bad sleep quality.
Conclusions
The majority of higher education students consider that they have
bad sleep quality and gender influences quality. Given the aforemen-
tioned, it becomes imperative to perform interventions that promote
sleep quality in this group.

Background
Cervical cancer is a public health problem in Brazil and worldwide,
due to the high mortality rates observed mainly in less developed re-
gions. Being the most preventable cancer, is of great importance its
early diagnosis and treatment. Objective: To analyse time trends in
mortality from cervical cancer 2000 to 2013 in the metropolitan area
of Florianópolis, state of Santa Catarina - Brazil, by age-specific groups
and its regions.
Methods
An ecological study of time series was conducted using data from
the National Information System on Mortality. Data on deaths from
2000 to 2013. Crude and specific mortality rates were calculated ac-
cording to age group and region. The existence of correlations was
analysed by the Spearman's correlation coefficient t.
Results
There was little variability in mortality trends from Cervical Cancer in
the metropolitan region, ranging between 3.43 and 2.24/100 thou-
sand, with a declining trend from 40 to 49 years (r = -0.547; p < 0.05).
Analysing the cities, in Florianópolis there was a declining trend from
60 to 69 years (r = -0.612; p < 0.05) and from 70 to 79 years (r = -0.701;
p < 0.01), while in the São José city there was an increasing trend in the
age group from 60 to 69 years (r = 0.539; p < 0.05).
Conclusions
The mortality trend of Cervical Cancer in the metropolitan area of
Florianópolis is stationary, with a decrease from 40 to 49 years. In the
city of Florianopolis there was a decreasing trend from 60 to 79 years,
and in the São José city there an increase from 60 to 69 years.

Background
Lack of adherence to treatment is a major public health problem.
Over 50 % of the Spanish population fails to comply with prescribed
treatments. The WHO defines adherence as "the degree to which a
person's behaviour corresponds with agreed recommendations from
a health care provider." Therefore, in addition to the clinical impact
also it has socio-economic implications. Objective: To determine the
level of adherence to treatment in a sample of over 65 with chronic
polypharmacy and diseases in an urban environment.
Methods
A cross-sectional descriptive study with a simple random sampling
from a Community Pharmacy Service in an urban environment by
applying the Morisky-Green Test.
Results
36.8 % of patients do not show good adherence in taking medica-
tion. However, the overall adherence to treatment increases with
age, especially among those over 71, with no statistical significance
between genders and, similarly, better adherence correlates with less
education of individuals, but not with their socioeconomic status.
Conclusions
The positive predictive value of the Morisky-Green Test can be a
good alternative to identifying groups at risk of non-adherence in
primary care, especially when our findings show that the older and
less educated patients achieved better therapeutic adherence, which
is conditioned by a greater dependence on health professionals in
determining the criteria.

Background
Arterial Hypertension (AHT) is a multifactorial systemic disease char-
acterized by high and sustained levels of blood pressure (BP).
In
Portugal a prevalence of 42 % is estimated among the adult popula-
tion and it is known to be closely related to cardiovascular disease.
Objective: To characterize the population of Castelo Branco district
regarding the prevalence, knowledge and AHT control rates, as well
as to determine cardiovascular risks (CVR).
Methods
Cross-sectional study performed in the district of Castelo Branco be-
tween 2010-2014 through survey application, BP measurements via

the auscultatory method and anthropometric data information. The
sample consisted of 11,139 individuals, 55.6 % female, aged between
18 and 101 years, with a mean of 58.17 ± 17.95 years. Data were ana-
lysed with SPSS® 20.0.
Results
The prevalence of AHT was 53.2 % (53.8 % in males and 52 % in
females). 6.8 % of the subjects had prehypertension; 24.1 % at
AHT grade 1; 8.1 % AHT grade 2 and 2.1 % AHT grade 3. Of the
4,199 individuals under antihypertensive therapy, 49.8 % had BP
values above normal. Regarding the CVR 51.1 % of subjects had
no significant CVR; 10.9 % had low risk; 19.0 % moderate risk
and 18.9 % high or very high risk according to the international
guidelines.
Conclusions
There was prevalence above the national average as well as a high

Background
Cervical cancer is a public health issue in Brazil and worldwide, due
to the high mortality rates observed mainly in less developed re-
gions. Being the most preventable cancer,
its early diagnosis and
treatment is of great importance. Objective: To analyse the trends in
cervical cancer mortality statistics over time in Santa Catarina State,
Brazil.
Methods
An ecological time series study was conducted using data from the
Brazilian National Information System on Mortality. Trends in the data
on deaths from 2000 to 2013 were identified using linear regression.
Crude and specific mortality rates were calculated according to age
group and macro-region.
Results
There was little variability in the cervical cancer mortality rates in
this state, ranging from 1.80 to 2.66/100,000, and this variation
showed no statistical significance. There was an increasing trend
for the age group 0-29 years, with a mean annual
increase of
0.01 % (p = 0.02), and a decreasing for the 40-49 years (0.16 %; p =
0.004). On analysing the health administration macro-regions, the
only significant increasing trend was observed for the Vale do Itajaí
(0.04 %; p = 0.02).
Conclusions
For the period of 2000 to 2013 the overall cervical cancer mortal-
ity in Santa Catarina State is trend stationary, but the mortality is
increasing for the age range of 0 to 29 years and decreasing for
the age range of 40 to 49 years. The only health administration
macro-region of Santa Catarina State which has registered a sig-
nificant increasing trend in cervical cancer mortality is the Itajaí
Valley.

Background
Recent studies have shown that sleeping problems, particularly dur-
ing adolescence, are an important public health problem. During
adolescence many biological, psychological and social factors inter-
act, resulting in shortening of sleep duration, excessive sleepiness, in-
somnia and delayed sleep phase syndrome. The aim of this study
was to determine the prevalence of sleep problems in adolescents.
Methods
In a cross-sectional approach we assessed 7,354 students (3944 fe-
males), aged 11 to 20 years from twenty-six schools of the district of
Viseu, Portugal. Data was collected using a self-administered ques-
tionnaire answered by the students in the classroom. Insomnia was
defined based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
Disorders IV criteria. Daytime sleepiness was assessed by the Epworth
Sleepiness Scale and we considered as "insufficient" less than 8 hours
of night sleep.
Results
The prevalence of “insomnia” was 8.3 % and of “insomnia symptoms”
21.4 %. The prevalence of “difficulty initiating sleep”, “difficulty main-
taining sleep”, “early morning awakening” and “non-restorative sleep”
was 8.9 %; 8.2 %; 6.1 % and 5.6 %, respectively. The prevalence of in-
somnia and symptoms of insomnia were higher among the female
gender (p < 0.001). Each symptom was more prevalent among the fe-
male gender (p < 0.001). The prevalence of daytime sleepiness was
33.1 % and of insufficient sleep 29.0 %. Both were higher among the
female gender (p < 0.001). Only 6.4 % of the adolescents reported to
lie down every night at the same hour.
Conclusions
Sleep problems in Portuguese adolescents are common. The results
of this study suggest the need for comprehensive programs to pre-
vent sleep problems in Portuguese adolescents.

Background
There is increasing evidence that obesity is associated with a decline in
health-related quality of life (HRQOL). Objective: This cross-sectional

study aimed to analyse the relation between body fat and HRQOL in
patients with type 2 diabetes.
Methods
The SF-36v2 questionnaire was administered to 95 individuals with
type 2 diabetes (47 women and 48 men; 66.23 ± 6.34 years old;
10.55 ± 7.55 years of diabetes; 37.47 ± 8.19 % of body fat) candidates
to Diabetes em Movimento®, a community-based lifestyle interven-
tion program developed in Vila Real, Portugal (NCT02631902). Body
fat was assessed by bioelectrical
impedance analysis technique
(Tanita, BC-418 MA). Pearson’s correlation coefficients were used to
evaluate the associations between each SF-36v2 scale (physical func-
tioning, PF; role physical, RP; bodily pain, BP; general health, GH; vi-
tality, VT; social functioning, SF; role emotional, RE; mental health,
MH) and summary scales (physical component score, PCS; mental
component score, MCS), and patient’s body fat.
Results
Negative and significant correlations were observed between body
fat and PF (r = -0.331; p = 0.001), BP (r = -0.324; p = 0.001), VT (r = -0.336;
p = 0.001), SF (r = -0.231; p = 0.025), RE (r = -0.280; p = 0.006), MH
(r = -0.310; p = 0.002), PCS (r = -0.234; p = 0.023), and MCS (r = -0.230;
p = 0.026), respectively.
Conclusions
High levels of body fat are associated with impaired HRQL in patients
with type 2 diabetes, possibly compromising the individuals' ability
to perform daily activities.

BMC Health Services Research 2016, 16(Suppl 3):O38

Background
Polypharmacy is frequent in elderly, and therapy adherence is a cru-
cial component to achieve the effectiveness of treatment, although
the complex therapies in elderly can lead to therapy non-adherence,
increasing costs and several health risks. Objective: To estimate the
prevalence of therapy adherence, polypharmacy and associated fac-
tors in elderly.
Methods
This cross-sectional study was based on a questionnaire, with the
MAT scale (Measure of Adherence to Therapy) validated for the Por-
tuguese population [1], applied to 159 elderly (≥65 years) living in
their home in Amares county,
in the north of Portugal. To assess
therapy adherence, those whose average adherence levels were ≥ 5
were called “adherent”, and considered as polymedicated seniors tak-
ing ≥ 5 drugs.
It was used descriptive statistics, correlations were
accessed using the qui-square test and adjusted residuals (AdR) for
variables categories, with a significance level of 5 %.
Results
The sample consisted mainly of females (54.7 % vs. 45.3 %), aged be-
tween 65 and 96 years old (mean 74.6), while 50.3 % was between
65-74 years old. The participants show good therapy adherence
(69.8 %), being highly polymedicated (58.5 %) with an average of 5.5
different drugs administered per day. Non-adherence was associated
with having mental disorders (p = 0.002) and respiratory system dis-
eases (AdR = 2.0), and seems to be related with being polymedicated
(AdR = 1.7) and bad health perception (AdR = 1.3). Having hypertension,

cholesterol, depression, mental disorders (p = 0.001), pain (p = 0.003)
and diabetes (p = 0.014) were also related to polypharmacy.
Conclusions
This study shows a considerable prevalence of therapy adherence

Background
Infection of the surgical site is one of the most frequent infections
associated with health care. Objective: To identify the prevalence of
surgical site infection in adults at a hospital in the North of Portugal.
Methods
A prospective study carried out at a hospital in the north of Portugal
in 2015. Inclusion criteria: having been hospitalized in surgical and
obstetrics services in the past 24 hours, aged 16 years or more,
undergoing colon surgery, gallbladder and caesarean section. A
sample of 579 participants was obtained. The characterization of
the patient and the surgery was performed using an inquiry appli-
cation in the first 24 hours after surgery, and the registration of the
infection at the time of occurrence within 30 days following the
procedure.
Results
Among the 579 participants 53.4 % were females, with an average
age of 57.1 years (17-97 years), 64.1 % underwent prophylactic anti-
biotic therapy, in 52.7 % the surgery was urgent, 6.6 % underwent
surgery laparoscopically, 70.0 % of the surgeries occurred in the sur-
gery department, of which 33.3 % were cholecystectomy. Predomin-
antly the wounds were clean (62.0 %). The average wait for surgery
was 7 days, for admission 12 days and average surgical time 59 mi-
nutes. There was a 6.0 % prevalence of surgical site infection and
Escherichia coli accounted for 47.8 % of them. The average time of
onset was 9 days and the organ/space was the most affected site
(48.6 %).
Conclusions
Prevalence of infection was 6.0 %. It is suggested to carry out further
studies that show factors associated with this type of infection.

Background
The Frailty Phenotype is a syndrome composed of
five criteria:
weight loss, endurance, physical activity, slowness and weakness. An
older person is considered to be frail if being impaired in three of
these domains. This study aims to identify predictive factors of the
frailty condition that may be considered for intervention.
Methods
A representative sample, stratified by age group, of elders living in
the community (n = 339) was assessed and logistic regression models
conducted.
Results
Predictive factors were gender (woman) OR 1.7, 95 % CI 1.0 – 2.8),
age (more advanced) (OR 2.8, 95 % CI 1.6 - 4.9) and educational level
(no schooling) (OR 2.6, 95 % CI 1.1 – 6.0). The bio behavioural vari-
ables and the low respiratory flow predicted the frailty condition (OR
3.3, 95 % CI 1.9 – 6.0). Geriatric indicators as falls (OR 3.3, 95 % CI 1.5 -
5.6), changes in sensorial processes (OR 2.1, 95 % CI 1.2 -3. 8; OR 2.1,
95 % CI 1.1 - 4.0 respectively), comorbidity (OR 1.8, 95 % CI 1.0 - 3.2)
were also predictors of frailty. Impairment in ADL increases the risk of
frailty (OR 2.1, 95 % IC 1.2 -3.5). The presence of depressive symptom-
atology (OR 4.2, 95 % IC 1.9-9.2) and cognitive deterioration (OR 2.9,
95 % IC 1.6 -5.3) are equally predictive of this condition.
Conclusions
These biopsychosocial predictors were all considered in an interven-
tion program.

Background
The 2015 update of the depression screening recommendations re-
flects the importance of screening during and after pregnancy. The
perinatal depression screening and early detection should combine
the evaluation of depressive symptoms and risk factors. Objective:
To analyse the predictive ability of the Perinatal Depression Screen-
ing and Prevention Tool (PDSP Tool) assessing both PD symptoms
and risk factors identified by our team (lifetime history of depres-
sion/LtHD, prenatal insomnia, increased depressive symptoms and
negative affect/NA at pregnancy) to identify postpartum major
depression.
Methods
Nighty-two (92) pregnant women (mean age: 32.64 ± 4.59 years) in
their second trimester (21.38 ± 2.41 weeks of gestation) completed
the PDSP Tool. At six (6.34 ± 1.66) weeks postpartum they were inter-
viewed with the Diagnostic Interview for Psychological Distress-
Postpartum, to determine if they fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for
major depression/DSM-5.
Results
4.3 % of the women showed major depression. The global correct
classification rate of the PDSP Tool was 53.3 %. False-negatives
1.1 %,
true-negatives 55.2 % and true-
positives 3.3 %. Considering the PDSP Tool components, high NA
showed the highest predictive ability: 100 % of women with high
NA at pregnancy (X2 = 11.21, OR = 2.190, p = .005) had major de-
pression in the postpartum.
Conclusions
Considering that false-negatives are worse than false-positives, the
finding that the PDS Tool identifies more than half of the women
who will develop postpartum major depression encourages us to
continue to develop efforts to succeed in this very difficult task of
identifying pregnant women who will tend to have major depression
in the postpartum.

Background
The aging process is associated with the decline of muscle mass and
strength and this loss is increased by diabetes, leading to the devel-
opment of physical disability in older adults with diabetes. Objective:
This study aimed to analyse the association between age and
muscle strength levels in middle-age and older patients with type
2 diabetes (T2D).
Methods
Ninety-three individuals with T2D (47 men and 46 women; 66.26 ±
6.32 years of age [55 to 80 years]) candidates for Diabetes em Movi-
mento®, a community-based lifestyle intervention programme devel-
oped in Vila Real, Portugal (NCT02631902), participated in a cross
sectional analysis. Upper limb muscle strength was assessed through
performance in the Seated Medicine Ball Throw Test (SMBT) and
lower limb through performance in the 30-Second Chair Stand Test
(30-SCS). Pearson’s correlation coefficients were used to evaluate
the associations between age and muscle strength levels, in both
genders.
Results
Negative and significant correlations were observed between age
and SMBT in men (r = -0.345, p = 0.019) and women (r = -0.314, p =
0.033), and between age and 30-SCS in women (r = -0.409, p = 0.005),
but not in men (r = -0.126, p = 0.403).
Conclusions
In general, the results showed a relation between aging and loss of
muscle strength in both genders in patients with T2D. However, men
seem more protected than women in the loss of lower limb muscle
strength.

In Brazil, there is a steady increase in life expectancy, due to the decline
in mortality and fertility rates, thus increasing the number of elderly.
With that index of Chronic Diseases has grown, with arterial hyperten-
sion as an example. This research aimed to analyse accessibility of the
elderly in the prevention of hypertension in a Family Health Unit. This is
a descriptive and exploratory study, with qualitative approach, performed

at a Family Health Unit in the municipality of Bahia, Brazil. It was con-
ducted with 16 elderly people, aged over 60 years, through a semi-
structured interview. The interviews were submitted to thematic content
analysis. The study was divided into the following categories: “You have to
be careful”, “have to do your exams every month”, “every year to stay
healthy”, respondents show access to knowledge on how to prevent high
blood pressure, citing changes in habits beyond just use of prescribed
medication. Respondents indicated that access to knowledge and informa-
tion in the prevention of hypertension happens through media, health pro-
fessionals, consultations, lectures, television, and conversation groups. The
orientation of the unit's health team contributes to changes in the lifestyle
of the elderly. Therefore, it is concluded that access to health education
and encouraging changes of habits in daily life are required for the acquisi-
tion of knowledge, assisting in self-care.

Background
Community Health screenings are an important part of the Pharmacy
Technician’s role as a health care provider. Objectives: To evaluate
the relation between anthropometric, physiological and biochemical
parameters and self-reported chronic conditions during community
health screenings.
Methods
The authors conducted an exploratory study including 60 individuals:
63.3 % had one or more chronic diseases and 36.7 % were healthy
individuals. For anthropometric measurements we obtained height,
weight, body mass index, waist circumference, body fat percentage
and muscle mass; for physiological assessment, blood pressure was
measured; biochemical variables evaluated were blood glucose, chol-
esterol and triglycerides in point-of-care testing.
Results
Self-reported chronic diseases consisted of 30 % cardiovascular dis-
eases, 26.7 % metabolic diseases, and 16.7 % of other diseases. Car-
diovascular patients had abnormal values of systolic blood pressure,
triglycerides and body fat. Patients with metabolic disorders showed
considerable differences in systolic blood pressure, blood sugar and
central adiposity compared to healthy individuals;
individuals with
obesity revealed high levels of blood pressure, cholesterol, triglycer-
ides, body mass index, waist circumference and body fat percentage.
There were a significant number of patients with abnormal values
that were neither diagnosed nor medicated.
Conclusions
Community health screening is of major importance for patients’
awareness of chronic diseases, and a fundamental role for Pharmacy
Technicians. These results show the need for further action with pa-
tients, in order to promote a correct follow-up with other health care
providers.

The indoor air pollutants may cause several effects on human health, al-
though there is a greater severity in risk groups, particularly among chil-
dren. The aim was to evaluate the Indoor Air Quality in kindergartens of
the Coimbra city, its structural and functional conditions, and respiratory
health of its occupants.
The study evaluated the air quality of 4 kindergartens, both inside
and outside the rooms. Air carbon dioxide (CO2), carbon monoxide
(CO), particles PM10 and PM2.5 volatile organic compounds (VOCs),
formaldehyde (H2CO), temperature (T,°C), relative humidity (Hr) and
Velocity were evaluated.
The results showed that on average every single parameter of the
sampled parameters exceed the limits set by legislation. However, it
was found that the maximum value of some parameters was equal
or exceeded the reference value, among them VOCs, H2CO, T°C, Hr
and Velocity. According to the occupants' respiratory health,
it
appears that there is a relationship between the concentration of
pollutants and the frequency of disease/symptoms perceived by
employees.

In anatomical pathology laboratories (APLs) the presence of several
chemical agents and other pollutants is common. These have repercus-
sions in air quality, representing a risk factor for the health of the workers
who handle them daily. In this regard, the occupational exposure of 19
anatomical pathology technicians of 3 APLs in the centre region of
Portugal to air pollutants was evaluated: formaldehyde (CH2O), volatile or-
ganic compounds (VOCs) and particles (PM2.5 and PM10).
The indoor air quality (IAQ) was evaluated by direct reading equipment
regarding the referred pollutants, as well as temperature, relative hu-
midity and air velocity. In addition to these measurements, question-
naires were distributed to obtain data regarding personal/professional
history of workers, occupational exposure characterization, APTs’ health
conditions and tobacco consumption data.
The study was of the observational type, descriptive-correlational
and cross-sectional
sampling was non-
(cohort). The type of
probabilistic. To proceed with the analytical collection of the evalu-
ated parameters, portable equipment of real-time reading was used,
namely the Q-TrakTM Plus – IAQ Monitor gauge,
label TSI, model
8552/8554, the Phocheck + gauge,
ion science (to measure total
VOCs), the Lightouse gauge, model Handheld 3016 IAQ to collect the
quantitative values of PM2,5 e PM10 and the PPM Formaldemeter
TM htV – IAQ Monitor gauge to evaluate the concentration of CH2O.
The results led to the assessment that in all APLs situations of expos-
ure above the protection threshold were verified. It was concluded it

Given the significant increase of time spent by the population in night-
life venues and the lack of indoor air quality (IAQ), there is a need to
study the possibility that this deprivation might affect the employees’
health through their exposure to this environment.
The main goal of this study consisted in assess workers’ occupational
exposure to environmental indoor air pollutants, in order to under-
stand its risk and interaction with people’s health.
Therefore, a data collection was held through the measurements of
concentration levels: volatile organic compounds (VOC’s), carbon di-
oxide (CO2), particles PM2.5 and PM10, in three different night-time
entertainment venues situated in the North of Portugal. For this
study, a sample constituted by 14 employees from those three night-
clubs was asked important and necessary questions to the execution
of this research.
The pollutants evaluated were the VOC’s with use of the equipment
branded as ION SCIENCE, model: Phocheck + 2000 – Fristcheck; CO2
with TSI equipment, model 8558552/8554, Q-TrakTM Plus – IAQ
Monitor with electrochemical cell direct reading; formaldehyde using
the handheld meter PPM Formaldemeter TM htv, 3 Parameter – IAQ
Monitor and finally the PM2,5 e PM10 were evaluated with a Light-
house Worldwide Solutions equipment, model: Handheld 3016-IAQ.
The results show that they infringe extensively the maximum con-
centration values set by law; one of the reasons is that the artificial
air vents are constantly turned off. Despite the strong evidences
found in this research it was not possible to associate the employees’
symptoms caused by pollutants with their occupational exposure.

Background
Breastfeeding is a priority of global strategy for women’s, children’s
and adolescents’ Health: 2016-2030 (World Health Organization,
2015) [1]. Objectives: To understand beliefs and attitudes and know-
ledge of young people towards breastfeeding and to assess the rela-
tion between the beliefs and attitudes of young people towards
breastfeeding and sociodemographic and academic variables.
Methods
Quantitative, cross-sectional and correlational study with a sample of
177 first-year students of the degree courses of a Portuguese School

of Health Sciences. A questionnaire with sociodemographic and aca-
demic data and "Adolescent breastfeeding beliefs and intentions
questionnaire” validated for the Portuguese population by Catarino,
Henriques and Dixe (2011) [2]. Ethical and legal procedures were
followed.
Results
These young people have an average age: X = 18.89, s = 1.56, and
80.8 % were female. 55.4 % live in rural areas, 54.2 % obtained infor-
mation about breastfeeding on television. It was found the level of
beliefs and attitudes (X = 82.59, s = 5.75) and perceived social barriers
(X = 16.46, s = 4.57) for breastfeeding is low. There are significant dif-
ferences between the beliefs and attitudes towards breastfeeding
and gender (z = 1374.0 and p < 0.001). Beliefs and attitudes are
mainly influenced by health professionals and the perception of so-
cial barriers is influenced by family and magazines.
Conclusions
This study confirms the importance of early intervention, the need
for specific training in breastfeeding and developing strategies to
promote and support breastfeeding in the community.

Currently, in Portugal and in the world, a marked increase has been ob-
served in the number of elderly and their
longevity. Due to this
phenomenon, more studies on ageing and all associated topics are
emerging.
Informal caregivers arise due to concern about the welfare
and health of the elderly. They devote their time, often full-time, in pro-
viding care for their relatives.
This descriptive-exploratory study aimed to understand and describe
the difficulties faced by each caregiver, their motivations, concerns,
and how to overcome them. For this, through a mixed methods ap-
proach, 14 interviews were carried out with 14 primary informal care-
givers and questionnaires to 30 secondary and tertiary informal
caregivers in the municipality of Leiria.
The quantitative data were analysed using descriptive statistics and
qualitative data were subjected to content analysis from the perspec-
tive of Bardin with coding in predetermined literature-based categor-
ies and also in emerging categories.
In this way, we characterized
informal caregivers and the elderly in their care and perceived the
the implications caused by the
economic and/or social needs,
provision of care and the level of training of each caregiver.
In
conclusion, we observed that training is not the biggest need
pointed out by informal caregivers, but rather the social, family

Background
The advance of education levels causes a greater visual effort in
school requirements and the teenagers are likely to present signs
and symptoms associated with vision disorders. This can be reduced
or avoided with the adoption of healthy visual habits. Objective: To
estimate the frequency of the more common visual changes in ado-
lescence, and to design strategies that promote prevention of visual
health in this age group.
Methods
A pilot study implemented in two schools in the centre of the coun-
try: one is in the city and the other one is in the suburb. It was ap-
plied a screening protocol, designed to identify refractive errors that
weren’t corrected and changes in binocular vision (focus and conver-
gence system). The size of the sample was 303 teenagers between
12 and 15 years, 158 were boys and 145 were girls.
Results
Around 10 % of teenagers have a refractive error uncorrected, 35 %
have binocular vision disorders and 55 % have normal binocular vi-
sion. The frequencies between rural areas and the suburbs, are sig-
nificantly different when we talk about refractive errors, there are
higher frequencies in rural areas.
Conclusions
It was found that the changes in binocular system, are the most
common visual changes and these are closely related with the excess
of use of the near vision. Knowing the relationship between these
changes and the higher risk of development myopia, it is important
to implement preventive strategies to adopt appropriate vision and
posture habits to relieve stress on the near vision.

Background
Amenable mortality (premature deaths that should not have oc-
curred given the availability of healthcare) is an important public
health theme in Europe and Portugal is one of the European coun-
tries with the highest rates. One of the causes may be the time
people need to reach the closest hospital. The aim of this paper is to
identify the association between geographic accessibility to the near-
est hospital
in mainland Portugal and the geography of amenable
mortality which occurred between 2009 and 2013.

Methods
Three methods were applied: To measure geographic accessibility,
the Municipal Time-Weighted Accessibility; to analyse amenable mor-
tality, a hierarchical Bayesian model was used to calculate the smooth
Standardized Mortality Ratio. Finally, we applied an ecological regres-
sion model to identify the association between both.
Results
Three major results came out from this study: 1. The mortality
amenable to healthcare presents low values in the north and high
values in the south; 2. On average, the population has good acces-
sibility to the closest hospital; and 3. For each additional ten mi-
nutes required to travel to the nearest hospital, the risk of dying
from an amenable cause of death increases by 0.3 % and the rela-
tive risk of those living over 30 minutes away from a hospital, is
13 % greater.
Conclusions
Geographic accessibility to healthcare services has an important role
in the health of the Portuguese population. As such, it is important
to implement policies and interventions that reduce the gap be-
tween the place of living and healthcare services.

Background
Increasing incidence of epidemic outbreaks of certain diseases and
its rate of spread from one community to the other has become a
major public health concern. Door handles are heavily contaminated
with microbes of faecal origin. Enterobacteriaceae are a large family
of gram-negative, facultative anaerobic, rod-shaped bacteria usually
motile. In humans, disease is produced by invasive action and toxin
production. Species not normally associated with disease are often
opportunistic pathogens. Objective: To determine the composition of
Enterobacteriaceae communities associated with door handle rest-
room surfaces.
Methods
35 door handles were analysed using sterile cotton swabs to obtain
specimens from door handles, were streaked on MacConkey and
CLED agar plates and incubated for a 24 h/48 h period at 37 °C. After
incubation, the number of resulting colonies was counted and char-
acterized based on margin, elevation, and colony shape. Gram-stain
procedure was used to assist in the separation of bacterial cells. After
a macro- and microscopic study was performed, colonies were ana-
lysed in regard to their biochemical characteristics.
Results
In 35 swab samples cultured, 80 % were positive. Isolation differenti-
ated bacteria arranged according their percentage as Enterobacter
32 %, Escherichia coli 25 %, Edwardsiella sp. 14 %, Proteus vulgaris
11 %, Klebsiella sp. 7 %, Klebsiella pneumoniae 4 %, Citrobacter 4 %
and Morganella morgani 4 %.
Conclusions
These results imply that Gram-negative organisms can be transmitted
through door handles. Three of these bacterial species are classified as

BMC Health Services Research 2016, Volume 16 Suppl 3

fecal coliform that can cause serious diseases. Preventive and inspec-
tion measures should be strengthened so that potential hazards indi-
viduals are daily exposed to can be avoided.

Background
Sticking with a rehabilitation programme is still a source of concern
to all healthcare professionals. However, the default rates associated
with participation in rehabilitation programmes are still very high. So,
regarding this subject, the main goal of this study was to determine
the influence of sociodemographic and labour factors in healthcare
professionals’ perception towards patient adhesion to rehabilitation
treatments.
Methods
Thus, we conducted a cross-sectional, descriptive-correlational study
with a non-probabilistic sample of 98 healthcare professionals,
58.16 % females, with a mean age of 39.80 years. They answered
questions about socio-demographic profiles in order to measure the
scale of patient adhesion to rehabilitation programmes.
Results
The score of healthcare professionals towards patient adhesion to re-
habilitation programmes is 6.48, a value above average. Study results
also reveal that strategies used by specialist nurses are more likely to
improve patient adhesion than those used by doctors. When it
comes to the methods used to promote patient adhesion there is a
higher score in cardio-respiratory pathology when compared to the
ones used in trauma and rheumatology. Healthcare professionals
who work with neurology patients have a higher score than the ones
who work with trauma and cardio-respiratory patients.
Conclusions
Study results suggest that there is still a long way to go when it comes
to finding strategies to improve patient adhesion to rehabilitation pro-
grammes. Study findings also suggest that academic contents should
be reviewed, as well as promoting public awareness campaigns to en-
courage patients to keep up with their rehabilitation programmes.

Background
Malnutrition is a modifiable risk factor for several diseases among eld-
erly. To develop appropriate nutrition policies to decrease malnutrition,
up-to-date information on the dimension of the problem is warranted.
Objective: To estimate the prevalence of malnutrition among Portu-
guese elderly (65+ years old) resident in nursing homes.

Methods
This nationally representative cross-sectional study collects data
through computer-assisted face-to-face structured interviews and an-
thropometric measurements. Elderly nursing homes were randomly
selected (national-wide sampling). In each home, all elderly with no
severe pathologies and who were not bedridden were interviewed.
Nutritional status was assessed with the Mini Nutritional Assessment
(MNA®) and body mass index was calculated.
Results
Overall, 660 elderlies (mean age: 84.3 years; SD = 6.9) participated
in the study (60 % of the target sample size). Undernutrition affects
5.6 % (95 % CI: 3.9-7.4) of them and 38.9 % (95 % CI: 35.2-42.7) are
at risk of it. Undernutrition was significantly more prevalent among
women (5.9 %) than men (4.8 %) and significantly increased with
age (1.2 % for 65-74 years old, 4.6 % for 75-84 years old, and 7.6 %
for 85+ years old). On the other hand, 27.4 % (95 % CI: 24.0-30.8) of
the elderly were considered obese, with significant differences be-
tween genders (33.3 % for women; 24.9 % for men) and age groups
(43.4 % for 65-74 years old, 37.7 % for 75-84 years old, and 22 %
for 85+ years old).
Conclusions
Preliminary results reveal a high prevalence of malnutrition (both
under- and over nutrition) among elderly living in nursing homes.
This highlights the importance of developing an electronic surveil-
lance system for early detection of malnutrition in the elderly.

Background
Emotional ability to perceive, use, understand and manage emotions
has been associated with mental health. Objectives: Analyse the dif-
ferences in emotional intelligence (EI) due to presence of mental ill-
ness; Correlate EI and perceived mental health knowledge.
Methods
Cross-sectional correlational study,
in a non-probabilistic sample of
672 Portuguese health students from Dietetics, Nursing, Physiother-
apy, Speech Therapy, Occupational Therapy. We applied a sociode-
mographic questionnaire and Emotional Intelligence Scale (WLEIS-P).
Students were mostly women (85.4 %), mean age of 21.16 (±4.17),
6.0 % with a diagnose of mental illness, 36.9 % reporting family with
mental illness.

BMC Health Services Research 2016, Volume 16 Suppl 3

Page 22 of 132

Results
Globally, students revealed good EI. Students with mental
illness
scored lower in EI on subscale of self-appraisal emotions (p = 0.000)
and emotional regulation (p = 0.015). However, students with mental
illness revealed higher “emotional appraisal of others” compared to
the ones without mental illness (p = 0.000). There are no differences
in EI related to mental illness in family. Positive significant correla-
tions were found between perceived knowledge in mental health
and EI (p = 0.039) as well as regulation of emotions (p = 0.039).
Conclusions
Health students with mental illness have lower emotional self-appraisal

Background
Falls are a major public health problem worldwide that has been
mainly studied in people older than 65 years old however, recently it
has been demonstrated that this problem might affect people at an
earlier age. Objective: To determine fall risk factors in a wider range
of age interval.
Methods
People older than 50 years were recruited in a primary care centre of
Portugal. Age, gender, falls history over the past 2 months, comor-
bidities, need of ambulatory aid and gait difficulties were collected
using Morse scale.
Independent t-tests and Chi-square tests were
used to examine statistical differences (p < 0.05) in these characteris-
tics between fallers and non-fallers. A logistic regression model was
built using as independent variables the statistically different charac-
teristics between the two groups and as dependent variable the fall
status (fallers or non-fallers).
Results
One hundred and forty participants were included (90 female;
71.33 ± 9.97 years; 31.4 % fallers). Fallers were statistically different
from non-fallers in: age (74.0 ± 9.9 years vs 69.9 ± 9.9 years, p =
0.03), gender (77.3 % vs 58.5 % female; p = 0.01); incidence of mul-
tiple comorbidities (70.5 % vs 48.0 %, p = 0.01); need of ambulatory
aid (55.0 % vs 17.0 %, p = 0.01) and incidence of gait difficulties
(79.5 % vs 44.7 %, p = 0.01). The odds of falling increased 2.6 in fe-
males (95 % CI 1.1-6.5), 3.5 in people that need ambulatory aid
(95 % CI 1.4-8.4) and 3.3 in people with gait difficulties (95 % CI
1.3-8.6). These three factors significantly contributed to explain
27.2 % of falls history variability (p = 0.01).
Conclusions
Gait impairments and female gender seem to explain almost 30 % of
fall risk in people older than 50 years.

Background
The older population is itself aging, and achieving an advanced age
is becoming more common worldwide. In Portugal, individuals aged
80+ represent 5.6 % of the total population and 26.5 % of the popu-
lation were aged 65 and over in 2011. Having a national profile on
this population will give important information to develop interven-
tion programs and identify the areas requiring most attention. Ob-
jective: This study aims to provide a profile of the Portuguese oldest
old, as given by the last national census data.
Methods
The characteristics of all residents aged 80+ (N = 532,219) were ana-
lysed considering socio-demographic information (gender, marital
status, education, type of residence, place of birth, income) and the
existence of difficulties in functional, sensorial and cognitive activities
due to health problems or ageing.
Results
The majority of the most aged are females (64.5 %), widowed
(53.9 %), and present low educational levels (46.1 % never attended
school and 31.6 % do not know how to read/write). Own pensions
constitute the main source of income (96.3 %) and the majority live
in private households (88.8 %), with 43.2 % currently living in the
place where they were born. The majority (73.0 %) reported major
difficulties in at least one functional activity – bathing/dressing, walk-
ing/climbing stairs, seeing, hearing, memory/concentration, under-
standing others/being understood.
Conclusions
The high percentage of oldest old living in private households and
the presence of functional limitations point to the importance of in-
formal care and community care services to support this population.
Further studies paying attention to their needs and utilisation of ser-
vices are required.

Volleyball practice leads to more precise movements and imposes a
higher injury risk on the athletes. The study investigates the prevalence
of injuries in volleyball athletes in amateur clubs in the Alentejo and Al-
garve regions and factors associated.
The sample consisted of 52 athletes aged between 18 and 47 years,
where 25 (48.1 %) were male.
A questionnaire was used with questions about aspects related to
sports, about injury mechanism and techniques to be used at the
time of injury. The athlete answered about the most frequent injury
(FI) related with the practice and/or the injury that most limited (LI)
and/or prevented them from practicing their sports activity (SA).
Thirty-eight (73.1 %) athletes reported having suffered some type of
injury, 29 (55.8 %) referring to FI and 29 (55.8 %) LI. The most preva-
lent type injury was ligament (27.6 % for FI and 44.8 % LI). The most
affected body areas in FI were shoulders, hands and fingers and an-
kles (27.6 % each) and the LI were the ankle (24.1 %) and knee
(20.7 %).
The most common injury mechanism was the impact with the ball
and repetitive movements (20.7 % each) for FI and LI. Females had
1.33 times (95 % CI: 0.38-4.58; p = 0.648) more probability of having
an injury, and older athletes (>25 years) had 1.88 (95 % CI: 0.51-6.37;
p = 0.362). Athletes with less practice of the activity (up to 5 years)
had 1.154 (95 % CI: 0.300-4.43; p = 0.835), those who train over
2 hours had 1.289 (85 % CI: 0.324-5.122; p = 0.718), and those who
are not in net line positions had 1.174 (95 % CI: 0.329-4.189; p =
0.805).
A high prevalence of injuries was observed.

Background
Shame is highlighted as a pathogenic phenomenon in well-being
and mental health. In fact, although shame has been considered as
an adaptive emotion, higher levels of this painful affect are strongly
associated with several psychological difficulties and different mental
health conditions. However, the association between external shame
and psychological quality of life does not seem to be linear. Objec-
tives: The present study thus aims to clarify the role of two emotion
regulation processes, decentring and acceptance, in the association
between external shame and psychological quality of life.
Methods
The sample comprised 359 participants (131 males and 228 females),
aged between 18 and 30 years old.
Results
The tested model explained 40 % of psychological quality of life and
showed excellent model fit indices. Results showed that external

shame negatively impacted on psychological quality of life with a dir-
ect effect, and also with an indirect effect through the mechanisms
of acceptance and decentring. These findings suggest that the im-
pact of external shame on psychological quality of life is partially
attenuated by the effects of higher levels of acceptance and decen-
tring abilities.
Conclusions
These findings seem to offer significant implications, emphasizing
the importance of targeting shame in the promotion of young
women’s psychological quality of life, through community interven-
tions that comprise the development of acceptance (the willingness
to contact with internal experiences) and decentring (the ability to
perceive internal experiences as transitory and subjective events).
Furthermore, longitudinal research should study the protective role
of these adaptive emotion regulation processes on psychological
well-being.

Background
Support social during deployment has proved to be a protective fac-
tor for psychopathology developed by war Veterans. The Deploy-
ment Social Support Scale (DSSS) of
the Deployment Risk and
Resilience Inventory (DRRI) has been used to evaluate the perception
of assistance and encouragement received in the theatre of military
operations from fellow unit members and unit leaders. Objectives:
This study aimed to translate and adapt to Portuguese the DSSS and
explore its factor structure.
Methods
Translation and adaptation of the scale were carried out by clinical
psychologists, army officers and an English native speaker. Items ad-
equacy and comprehensibility were first tested in a sample of 30 war
veterans. Subsequently, 306 Portuguese colonial war veterans com-
pleted the DSSS. Test-retest reliability was assessed in a subset of
115 participants. This subgroup completed the DSSS for a second
time approximately three weeks after the first administration.
Results
Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) indicated that the DSSS presented a
single-component structure composed by 12 items (the same of the
original version). Factor loadings ranged between .67 and .83. Ad-
equate values of internal consistency (α = .92), corrected item-total
correlations (ranged from r = .59 to r = .79) and temporal reliability
(r = .88) were obtained.
Conclusions
The Portuguese version of the DSSS shows adequate psychometric
properties. The results corroborated the structure of the DSSS found
in the original version. The scale is internally consistent and has a
good temporal stability.

Background
Acute viral bronchiolitis (AVB) is a disease characterized by acute in-
flammation of the bronchioles and increased production and secre-
tion of mucus that may be associated with bronchospasm. It mainly
infants being the most common cause of paediatric
affects
hospitalization in the first year of life. Objective: To describe the char-
acteristics of hospitalizations for BVA in the public health system
(SUS) of residents 0 to 2 years-old of the Greater Porto Alegre (GPA)
region, in southern Brazil, 2012-2014.
Methods
Analysis of hospitalizations with first-listed diagnosis ICD-10 J21.0
and J21.8 from the Hospital
Information System (HIS)/SUS publicly
available. Calculation of indicators by sex, age groups, stay, mortality
and spending.
Results
There were 7,091 admissions (2,364/year) in SUS for BVA of GPA resi-
dents (153.6/10,000 inhabitants/year). Males predominated (4,246 or
59.9 % vs. 2,845 or 40.1 % of females). Admissions of patients up to
1 year-old accounted for 99.2 %. Bronchiolitis by respiratory syncytial
virus (ICD-10 J21.0) accounted for 2,226 (31.4 %) hospitalizations. The
average length of stay was brief (5.3 days) and the mortality rate was
low (0.2 %) having 12 deceased patients (4/year) (5 males and 7 fe-
males). The average annual expenditure was $955.7 thousand PPP
(Purchasing Power Parity) and the average value per hospitalization
$404.33 PPP.
Conclusions
As hospitalizations for BVA conditions are sensitive to primary health
care interventions, these data can serve as a basis to identify weak-
nesses in the basic local network of health services.

Background
The European Innovation Partnership on Active and Healthy Ageing
(EIP on AHA) issued several key documents for launching and imple-
menting a collaborative partnership aiming to increase the average
healthy lifespan of Europeans by 2 years by 2020. Through cooperation

between all EU countries, evidence-based programmes for the pre-
vention, early detection, risk minimization and management of falls
must be implemented. Objective. To identify the population at risk
of falling (and of fractures) which may benefit from effective indi-
vidual interventions.
Methods
A descriptive, exploratory study was conducted with 213 participants
of a home-dwelling population (72.5 % female), with an average age
of 75.85 years, SD = 6.94.
Results
The population from Nordeste evidenced a probability of limited mo-
bility within the community, with a mean value of 13.45 sec in the
walking speed test. A mean value of 12.43 sec in the Timed Up & Go
test indicated a moderate risk of falling. Up to 36 % participants re-
ported having fallen in the last 12 months.
Conclusions
All together these results are an opportunity for the development of
a programme for fall prevention in the community, in a partnership
joining local health and social organizations. This will contribute to
the implementation of programmes adapted to the functional and
psychological demands of these older people from Nordeste, and
also to their daily life activities, in order to enhance strength, walking
speed, flexibility, balance and resistance, under the framework of the
collaborative initiative “Dar Vida aos Anos” of the municipality of Nor-
deste dedicated to those over 65.

Most physiological functions in the body follow a circadian rhythm.
There are several pathologies and biological processes like obesity or
aging, among others, that provokes chronodisruption in these rhythms.
It is well known that elderly people suffer from chronodisruption in most
of their circadian rhythms. Our aim was to elucidate if this trend may
begin in earlier stages. Thirty-two 32 people (aged between 40 and 65)
participated in this assay. Volunteers wore a wrist temperature logger
on their non-dominant hand for 3 days. Data were read in a computer
and analysed through Circadianware software. Chronobiological parame-
ters MESOR (the average value around which the variable oscillates),
amplitude (difference between the peak and the mean value of the
wave) and acrophases (the time at which the peak of a rhythm occurs)
were calculated and correlated with age. Our
results showed that
MESOR (p < 0.05; R = 0.4586), amplitude (p < 0.05; R = - 0.5178) changed
with age but not acrophase. We conclude from the present assay that
chronodisruption symptoms in temperature circadian rhythm in the eld-
erly begin to be expressed in a mature stage in humans.

Background
Dengue is considered a major public health problem in the world. It
is estimated that 80 million people are infected annually in 100 coun-
tries on all continents. The global changes that have taken place dir-
ectly interfere with the natural environment; relating them to the
climate and tropical diseases,
it can be seen that changes in
temperature alter the ecosystem, directly influencing the growth in
transmission of diseases caused by vectors, which includes dengue.
Objectives: To understand the consequences of temporal variability
of climate conditions on the occurrence of dengue in the population
of the Greater ABC metropolitan region of São Paulo and characterize
the temporal trend of dengue in the region in the period 2010-2013.
Methods
Analysis of numbers of dengue cases reported in the years under re-
view, complemented by the meteorological data (temperature and
humidity) and pollutant concentration data (PM10). Dengue in the
region had a higher incidence in 2010 and lower incidence in 2012.
Results
It was found that there is a statistical association between moisture
and PM10 with dengue cases reported. Though the temperature
does not statistically assume an association with reported dengue
cases, it was found that the temperature peaks coincided with the
epidemic peak of dengue.
Conclusions
High pollutant concentration (PM10) is associated with a decrease in
the number of dengue cases. It would be interesting to carry out future
studies related to environmental pollution and its influence on the mos-
quito Aedes aegypti development in all phases of its life cycle and de-
veloping strategies for better monitoring, campaigns and surveillance.

Background
Undetected visual dysfunctions affect academic performance. Thus
it's essential the implementation of programs for visual evaluation/
intervention in schoolchildren. Given that children with learning dis-
abilities in reading (LDR) can benefit from early intervention with vis-
ual therapy (VT), this study aims to estimate the frequency and
impairment in children with LDR, assess the
distribution of visual

impact of visual disturbances and the influence of VT on their quality
of life.
Methods
Seventeen children with LDR (9 ± 1 years), followed in speech ther-
apy/educational intervention in the paediatric service of "Centro Hos-
pitalar Cova da Beira" (Portugal), participated in this study. The
control group included 103 children without learning disabilities
(10 ± 1 years). The visual function evaluation included the applica-
tion of the Inventory of Visual Efficiency (COVD-QoL questionnaire),
and optometric measurement of various parameters of visual func-
tion. All children with LDR with altered visual function were advised
to conduct a VT plan.
Results
Children with LDR showed a higher percentage of visual function al-
terations (vergencial function, accommodation and ocular motility)
and reported more symptoms compared to control group. After a VT
plan was registered a significant improvement in most visual param-
eters assessed, and observed a significant
reduction of visual
symptoms.
Conclusions
This study shows that improvement of objective/subjective parame-
increasing comfort
ters of visual function reduce visual symptoms,
while carrying out schoolwork, improving the quality of life in LDR
children. This study suggests the importance of evaluation of visual
function in LDR children, as well as the benefits of VT and the im-
portance of a multidisciplinary approach.

Background
An adequate dentition is important for well-being and increase of
quality of life. Despite advances in preventive dentistry, edentulism is
still a major public health issue in Portugal. Objectives: Determine
the prevalence of edentulism and assess the oral rehabilitation and
oral/prosthetic hygiene habits in a sample of institutionalized elderly.
Methods
We conducted a cross-sectional study in a sample of 68 institutional-
ized elderly (79.4 % female), in which the average age was 78.3 ±
12.0 years old. Data collection was performed by applying a ques-
tionnaire about oral health behaviours and through an intraoral ob-
to determine the oral status and verify the
servation in order
condition of the oral rehabilitation of each participant.
Results
In the present study, 58.8 % presented total edentulism with no nat-
ural teeth in the oral cavity and 66.7 % had a removable prosthesis.
From the elderly that had a removable prosthesis, only 42.9 % pre-
sented satisfactory prosthetic retention and stability. Only 44.1 %
refer daily oral/prosthetic hygiene at least twice-a-day. From the total
sample, 29.0 % refer having toothache, 58.1 % refer dry mouth
and 67.7 % refer difficulty in chewing, even in the case of having

(p = 0.034).
Conclusions
A high prevalence of tooth loss was found in the sample studied and
also the need of improvement of the removable prosthesis is funda-
mental. Improvement in oral healthcare and oral hygiene habits is es-
sential to promote better oral health and quality of life among the
institutionalized elderly.

The low adherence to therapy of chronic patients undergoing long-term
treatment has been identified as a major factor responsible for the lack
of effectiveness of prescribed treatments.
In the present study, we have conducted interviews to patients over
the age of 18 that acquired their medications in a hospital pharmacy
of the north region of Portugal. Compliance with the treatment regi-
men and self-perception of health status were assessed by applying
the Morisky Medication Adherence Scale© (MMA-8-Item) and the The
Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire© (IPQ-B), respectively.
The association between gender and some types of disease was ob-
served for Psoriatic Arthritis and for the incidence of breast cancer in
women and lung cancer in males. Of the 11 patients, 3 reported to
have undergo therapeutic changes from the beginning of treatment.
These three correspond to patients with Hepatitis B and Psoriatic
Arthritis.
The results of therapy adherence show 90.9 % of adherence,
in
which 5 of the 11 respondents showed a high degree of adherence
to therapy and only 1 revealed lower levels of adherence. According
to the MMA-8-Item (n = 11) respondents do not associate the non-
adherence to oblivion of taking the medicines. However, the limiting
factors of adherence most mentioned were adverse effects associ-
ated with the medication and depressive states linked with the nega-
tive impact that the disease has on society.
Although this is a pilot study, our results have shown to be promis-
ing. Patients reported high adherence rates and it was verified a rela-
tionship between therapy adherence and the self-perception of
health.

The constitutional right to health can be considered as one of the
greatest social achievements of the post-democracy period in Brazil.

After 25 years of the implementation of the Unified Health System, al-
though undeniable advances have been observed, the guidelines for
universal access and comprehensive care in oral health still remain as
challenges.
In this sense, we performed an availability study (AS) of
oral health services with a focus on universal access and comprehen-
sive care.
The EA consists of a set of procedures that precede the stage of
evaluation for verifying the extent to which the object can be evalu-
ated. In this study the following steps were taken: (a) description of
oral health care by identifying goals and activities; (b) design of the
(c) development of an evaluation
theoretical and logical model;
matrix; (d) identification of stakeholders in the evaluation; and (e)
achieving consensus on the evaluation procedures.
The evaluative matrix of oral health care with a focus on universal ac-
cess and comprehensiveness was composed of five dimensions: ac-
cessibility; availability; priority of promotion and prevention actions;
articulation of promotion, prevention and recovery; and integral ap-
proach of individuals and families. For each dimension indicators
were discussed related to the level of dental care: management, pri-
mary care, specialized care, urgent and emergency services and hos-
pital care.
The EA proved to be appropriate and allowed the identification of
priority areas of oral health care for future evaluations.

Background
Respiratory changes are increasingly present, from an early age, ei-
ther because life is increasingly sedentary, or because city pollution
is increasingly present. Knowing that the circuits of the children of
the city of Coimbra, are apparently "clean", we assessed two groups
of children, using spirometry in the search for respiratory changes
denoting disease. Objective: to assess a population of children repre-
senting the municipality of Coimbra, in order to understand possible
respiratory changes.
Methods
We studied children who attend the 1st grade and those who at-
tend the 4th grade, using spirometry. The children were selected
among those who had no history of disease, nor evident symp-
toms and presented adequate collaboration. The results were
stratified to be representative of the population of the municipal-
ity of Coimbra.
Results
The results show a predominantly healthy population, with children
of the 1st grade (6-7 years old), presenting alterations to small and
medium airways in 7.0 % of the cases, with girls representing 4.3 %
of the sample. Only in 0.4 % of the children were we in the presence

group (9 to 10 years), the results showed 4.0 % of obstructive alter-
ations in peripheral airways and only in 2.0 % was obstructive re-
spiratory alteration observed.
Conclusions
We can say that the population between 6 and 10 years old presents
a good level of absence of disease, which cannot be unrelated to
good air quality of the city and low level of pollution.

Background
Admission to college and academic life both represent a particularly
susceptible period of emotional turmoil. This period can be exacer-
bated by the organization of the student’s identity, a result of devel-
oping maturity. In this context, meaning in life presents itself as a
variant with promising effect on the attainment of life goals. Object-
ive: To characterize the sample as to its life goals.
Methods
A simple descriptive study, performed during 2015 with students
from a college in the centre of Portugal. The sample answered to a
survey on Google Docs with open and closed-ended questions, with
the study’s goal as its basis. Data processing was accomplished using
descriptive statistic means.
Results
The sample had 242 subjects, mostly female (78.1 %, n = 189). To the
question “More than anything,
I want to…”, answers were “be
happy” (59.5 %, n = 144); “finish college” (4.1 %, n = 10); “start a fam-
ily” (2.9 %, n = 7); and “help others” (2.5 %, n = 6). We can point out
that a few subjects (12 %, n = 29) referred that they haven’t made
any progress in the pursuit of their life goals yet, such as “to be de-
sired”, “to be loved”, “to be happy” and “to enjoy life”.
Conclusions
Most of the sample’s subjects recognize they are achieving their
goals. Only a minority admits their lack of ability in succeeding. Des-
pite only being a few, they need holistic attention to guide them to-
wards a discovery of a real meaning in life.

Background
Demographic, social and health changes are at the origin of the
change in the place of death. The characterization of nursing care
needs to be documented in the Nursing Information System (NIS) in
use, and may represent an effective strategy to define training pol-
icies for nurses, for the organization of care as well as for the defin-
ition of areas of focus for research. Objective: To describe the main
needs for nursing care of palliative patients referred to the Hospital-
Support Team in Palliative Care of a hospital in central Portugal.
Methods
We conducted an exploratory, descriptive and cross-sectional study,
from the documentation of nursing care in the NIS in use. Our sam-
ple comprises the accessible population between September 1, 2012
and September 1, 2013, making a total of 276 patients.
Results
In this study, 53.99 % of patients have an oncological pathology, des-
pite the increase of referral of non-oncologic pathologies. Concerning
the needs of nursing care documented in the NIS, 68 % of nursing
focus is given to the dimension of function and 32 % to the dimension
of the person. The management and control of symptoms is one of the

main focuses in the available evidence, also found in the study with an
emphasis on function.
Conclusions
Despite the relevance of the physical dimension, it represents only a
part of total care, exposing the opportunity for improving nursing
care quality, regarding the psychological, social, cultural and spiritual
dimensions. The need emerges for appropriate training in the other
key areas of Palliative Care, particularly fatigue, grief, family, commu-
nication, comfort and spirituality.

Background
During the last decade, health institutions have been involved in the
process of moving away from paper-based and implementing elec-
tronic health information to support patient care. The documentation is
in fact an essential part of nursing practice, but will undoubtedly be re-
sponsible for a substantial portion of the overall workload of nurses. We
are confronted too often with opinions that contain a perception that
the use of computerized information systems (CIS) have a major impact
on the overall workload of nurses. Objective: To explore nurses’ percep-
tions and the real-time of CIS impact on the global nurses’ workload.
Methods
A cross-sectional survey was applied to collect data from 190 nurses
that use CIS in a hospital. For the analysis of real-time spent on the
CIS usage we collected the automated registered times of medicine
ward nursing users.
Results
Only a quarter (Q1) of nurses believes that the time spent with the
use of CIS is less or equal to 30 % of their global workload and 75 %
of the nurses (Q3) consider that is less or equal to 50 %, existing an
equal dispersion to the right and left of the median (40 %). The aver-
age of the real-time spent on CIS use was 16.7 % of nurses’ workload
(median: 17.1 % and standard deviation: 3.4).
Conclusions
Nurses have the perception that the time used in CIS has a high impact
on the workload. However, the analysis of “real-time” shows that the
time spent is overlapping the lowest times referenced in the literature.

transmission. This neurodegenerative disorder has late age of onset,
after 25 years of age and is a progressive autonomic sensory and motor
neuropathy. This disease is characterized by deposition of
insoluble
amyloid fibrils in connective tissue causing high dependency and pre-
mature death. Treatment options for patients with FAP are very limited.
Symptomatic treatment can control symptoms and improve the quality
of life of these patients.
This work aims to:
I) Understand the perspective of health profes-
sionals on self-care in FAP; II) Understand which behaviours and self-
care needs of patients are perceived by health professionals. This is a
part of a larger ethnographic study. A semi-structured interview was
conducted with eight privileged witnesses. The collected qualitative
data was analysed according to the method proposed by Miles,
Huberman and Saldaña.
The results obtained by analysis of the interviews allow us to have
two categories, namely self-care needs and self-care behaviours. The
needs identified by health professionals primarily relate to the in-
creased level of dependence that occurs with the evolution of this
illness.
The self-care behaviours are identified with the completion of pre-
symptomatic testing and the use of medically assisted procreation
techniques with pre-implantation testing and selection of free muta-
tion embryos. The health care professionals’ perspective of self-care
within the inherited genetic disease is expanded, but is mainly de-
rived from self-care needs and not from self-care behaviours.

Background
Physiotherapy intervenes in health-related physical fitness (HRPF).
However, normative values are lacking for prescribing exercise in
healthy and non-healthy populations, namely in adolescents. Object-
ive: The primary aim was to contribute for establishing normative
values of the measures most commonly used in physiotherapy to as-
sess HRPF. Secondary aims were to examine gender-specific differ-
ences and the relationship between HRPF and physical activity (PA).
Methods
A cross-sectional study was conducted with Portuguese adolescents.
Socio-demographic, anthropometric data and vital signs were first
collected. Then, HRPF was assessed through: body mass index (BMI),
incremental shuttle walk test (ISWT), quadriceps muscle strength
using hand-held dynamometry (HHD), modified sit-and-reach test
(MSRT) and timed up and go (TUG). Participants’ PA levels were
assessed using the "Physical Activity Index" (PAI).
Results
One hundred forty-one (141) adolescents participated (14.33 ±
1.34 years, 71 males). The proposed normative values for HRPF were:
BMI 58.95 ± 2.44 %;
ISWT 1251.19 ± 26.25 m; HHD 21.04 ± 0.69 Kgf;
MSRT 38.09 ± 1.75 cm; TUG 4.31 ± 0.13 s. Male adolescents were sig-
nificantly (p < 0.001) faster performing TUG (males: 3.75 ± 0.43 s; fe-
males: 4.88 ± 0.87 s), walked a superior distance in the ISWT (males:
1409.00 ± 265.63 m;
females: 1111.94 ± 251.10 m) and had more
quadriceps muscle strength (males: 23.77 ± 7.13 kgf; females: 18.70 ±
6.28 kgf) than females. Adolescents had moderate PA levels. Higher
PA levels were associated with better results in the MSRT (r = 0.592,
p < 0.001), TUG (r = -0.543, p < 0.001) and ISWT (r = 0.432, p < 0.001).
Conclusions
Findings are a contribution for HRPF normative values of tests most
commonly used in physiotherapy assessment of adolescents. The

associations between PA and HRPF suggest that future work should
encourage adolescents to adopt more active lifestyles in order to im-
prove their HRPF performance.

Background
Over the last years the teaching of nursing has been progressively
directed to the use of new methodologies, among which we high-
light the High-Fidelity Simulation (HFS), which allows nursing stu-
dents to have their first contact with the clinical practice within the
academic environment. Objective: To evaluate and correlate the
perception of learning, satisfaction and self-efficacy of nursing stu-
dents about HFS.
Methods
A correlational study with 139 nursing students was developed, using
the Portuguese version of the Nursing Students’ Perceptions of
Learning and Learner Satisfaction with Simulation Tool.
Results
Nursing students reveal a moderated perception of learning about
the HFS (3.649 ± 0.513 out of 5 points), a good level of satisfaction
(7.317 ± 1.065 out of 10 points) and a self-efficacy for the practice of
HFS (31.590 ± 3.974 out of 40 points). All correlations between per-
ception of learning, satisfaction and self-efficacy of the students re-
garding HFS were positive and highly significant (p ≤ 0.001), with
values between 0.991 and 0.385.
Conclusions
This study reveals that nursing students are satisfied with the prac-
tice of HFS, as well as shows a positive perception of learning and
self-efficacy about HFS. The fact that the correlations among these
three variables are highly significant and positive, demonstrate the
importance of the practice of HFS within the school environment,
which allows the development of experiences of high value for the
nursing students.

Background
Nowadays chronic diseases are the leading cause of death in Portugal
and in the world. Since most of these diseases have behavioural deter-
minants in their origin, and their control depends on self-care behav-
iours, including an effective management of the therapeutic regimen,
this is a key area in nursing. Objective: To identify the terms used by
nurses to describe the range of diagnosis customized in the Nursing
Practice Support System (SAPE®), focused on the management of the
medication regimen.

BMC Health Services Research 2016, Volume 16 Suppl 3

Page 29 of 132

Methods
A qualitative study. A content analysis process of nursing documen-
tation in SAPE® centred on the management of medication regimen
was conducted. An a priori analysis model was used – the ISO 18104:
2003 standard – Health informatics: integration of a reference termin-
ology model for nursing.
Results
There were 598 statements of nursing diagnosis identified centred
on “managing the medication regimen”. After the content analysis
process, and after excluding all conceptual redundancy, the state-
ments of nursing diagnosis were reduced to 30 clinically useful
syntaxes.
Thirty-two different terms for judgments about the focus were found.
After consensus, we reduced these to 2 terms: “impaired” and “po-
tential to enhance”. We found 20 “dimensions” for which the princi-
pal focus is put into perspective. After analysis, they were reduced to
6: knowledge; ability; awareness; meaninglessness; support, and fam-
ily support. Eight judgments associated with dimensions were found.
Conclusions
The proliferation of different statements of diagnosis reflect the same
reality which makes information management and production of in-
dicators more difficult. Studies that make a conceptual analysis of
nursing documentation are necessary.

Background
Hybrid systems imply multi-tasking as in post Fordist lean production
[1-2] and are relevant to complex organisations such as teaching
hospitals [3]. Nonetheless, they raise questions concerning levels of
leadership and responsibility [4], group working and relational coord-
ination [5-7] across different domains of practice [8]. Moreover, there
is a need to better understand how group operational effectiveness
is associated with clarity of job roles [9], workloads and motivation
[10] and their impact on the climate and quality of care [11].
Methods
A case study in a European university hospital based on a grounded
theory approach. Longitudinal data (2011 to 2015) from audio-taped
and semi-structured interviews (N = 64) with 41 health professionals
as managers (28 doctors and 13 nurses). Content analysis on the
basis of a newly developed coding system using MAXQDA software.
Originality: Locating the concept of hybrid management in terms of
the role of doctors as managers in the context of different logics, i.e.
distinguishing institutional logic (an NHS) from organizational logic (a
hospital) and operational logic (at unit and service levels).
Results and Conclusions
Doctors and nurses as managers need relative autonomy at oper-
ational levels which should be recognized by hospital administrators

Background
Time management affects the productivity and health of workers. At
health organizations professionals are exposed to heavy workload
and time pressure, labour demand indicators, in a highly competitive
and demanding health sector. Therefore, the application of time
management techniques is presented as an essential tool, with impli-
cations for productivity, well-being of workers and quality of health
care. Objective: analyse the dimensions of the Time Management Be-
haviour (TMB) scale in healthcare professionals.
Methods
A descriptive cross-sectional study, the TMB scale was used to evalu-
ate time management dimensions, consisting of 25 items answered
on a range varying between 1 and 5, where higher scores corres-
pond to higher levels.
Results
Of the 703 health professionals studied, 76.0 % were female with an
average of 41 years old. The dimensions of time management showed
values close to scale midpoint, with preference for organization pre-
senting the highest average (3.83) and mechanics of time management
dimension the lowest average (2.85).
Conclusions
The results showed that the time management dimensions: setting
goals and priorities, mechanics of time management and preference
for organization, have lower average values compared to other studies

Background
Contractualisation in the private sector may include performance-
related pay [1]. But this was not typical of Human Resource Manage-
ment (HRM) in the National Health Service (NHS) until the New Public
Management (NPM)-style reforms [2]. This paper draws on the per-
ceptions of clinical professionals of financial reward systems through
contractualisation in Primary Care to explore the links between clarity
of job roles [3], workloads and motivation [4] and their impact on
the climate and quality of care [5] and employee wellbeing.
Methods
Using a case study approach within grounded theory, content
analysis was carried out of six fully transcribed audio-taped semi-
structured interviews with 2 doctors, 2 nurses and 2 administrators in
two Unit Care Services in north of Portugal which were recently sub-
ject to NPM-style reforms.
Results
Although health professionals may welcome increases in pay, they
are not motivated primarily by financial rewards, but rather are com-
mitted to health as a public service. When contractualisation is only
partial for some rather than all employees, its outcome may be nega-
tive. Reward systems based on quantitative performance criteria may
compromise the climate and quality of care through lack of the clar-
ity of job roles and employee wellbeing.
Conclusions
Motivating health professionals needs a more holistic HRM approach
than performance-related pay and involvement of clinical managers
in its design and operational implementation.

Over recent years, patient safety has gained more importance in the
field of public health. Surgical safety is particularly relevant due to the
great number of perioperative complications which could be avoided
and can cause damage to the patient. This also implies major costs to
the healthcare organization, causing a great impact on its budget.
Through the analysis of a safety culture, measuring patient safety in a
healthcare institution is possible since they are influenced by each other.
Hence, the “Hospital Survey on Patient Safety Culture” (HSPSC) arises
due to the need for evaluation of patient safety in healthcare.
The aim of this work is to evaluate and promote patient safety in the
Operating Rooms (OR) of the Centro Hospitalar do Porto (CHP).
This descriptive study was conducted in the OR of CHP, where the
Portuguese version of the HSPSC was applied to the workers, namely
doctors, nurses, technicians, health care assistants and secretaries.
The results obtained show that in CHP teamwork within units has
great value, as this dimension has the highest percentage of positive
answers (63.4 %). The lowest percentage of positive answers is the
dimension of frequency of events reported (24.9 %). The workers’
perception of the degree of patient safety is divided between “very
good” (47.5 %) and “acceptable” (39.7 %). The strengths in CHP are
teamwork within units, efforts for the improvement of patient safety,
manager expectations and actions promoting patient safety. The
areas requiring intervention in CHP are those related to the system
of events reported, staffing and work between units.

Background
In an era of global ageing, the increasing proportion of older people
has a direct impact on nursing practice, and also on nursing edu-
cation, presenting unprecedented opportunities and challenges. Ob-
jective: To study difficulties and needs of pre-graduate nursing
students in the area of Geriatrics/Gerontology.

BMC Health Services Research 2016, Volume 16 Suppl 3

Page 31 of 132

Methods
A quantitative, descriptive study, with a non-probabilistic accidental
sample, constituted by 238 undergraduate nursing students of the
4th year of the Nursing School of Coimbra. Application of self-
administered questionnaires related to knowledge on ageing issues,
difficulties in caring for the elderly person in community and hospital
settings, after authorization of the institution and informed consent
of students.
Results
The study emphasizes the difficulties perceived by students and con-
sequent training needs combined with the reality of the various clin-
ical teaching contexts; notable is the nonexistence of a vision of care
that integrates the multidimensional systematic assessment of the
elderly, to support and sustain conditions for quality of life of the
elderly in community, family and social support.
Conclusions
This study presents relevant data about the difficulties experienced
by nursing students of the 4th year and their training needs, regard-
ing the care of the elderly, justifying the adequacy of the curricula of
the 1st cycle of studies in nursing, specifically the integration in the
curricula of the methodology of multidimensional functional assess-
ment of elderly. Their use in graduate nursing training will be an
asset for students to have an integrated vision of the elderly in the
community.

Sexuality is recognized as part of holistic nursing care, but its inclusion
in clinical practice and nursing training is inconsistent. Based on the
question "How students and teachers acknowledge sexuality in teaching
and learning?", we developed a study in order to characterize the
process of teaching and learning sexuality in a micro perspective of cur-
riculum development.
We used a mixed methods design with a sequential strategy:
QUAN → qual of descriptive and explanatory type. 646 students
and teachers participated. The quantitative component used ques-
tionnaire surveys. Document analysis was used in the additional
component.
A curricular dimension of sexuality emerges guided by a behaviourist
line and based on a biological vision. The issues considered safe are
highlighted and framed in steps of adolescence and adulthood and
more attached to female sexuality and the procreative aspect. There
is in emergence a hidden curriculum by reference to content from
other dimensions of sexuality but less often expressed. Theoretical
learning follows a communicational model of reality through ab-
straction strategies, which infers a deductive method of learning,
with a behaviourist approach to assessment. Clinical teaching ad-
dresses sexuality in combination with reproductive health nursing.
The influencing factors of teaching and learning of sexuality were
also explored.
We conclude that the vision of female sexuality taught and learned
in relation to women has a projection of care in clinical practice
based on the same principles.

Background
Entrepreneurship has been considered essential to create value, be-
ing a powerful driver of economic and social development. Academy
must invest in the development of entrepreneurial skills in students
(“Entrepreneurial Academy”). Objective: To analyse the psychometric
proprieties of the EMQ-Entrepreneurial Motivations Questionnaire.
Methods
Sample: 6,532 students from 17 polytechnic Institutes of Portugal.
Measure: EMQ, composed by measures of Entrepreneurial motives
for the business, Entrepreneurial influences, and Support Services.
Results
Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) for Entrepreneurial-Motives-for-the-
business (KMO = .921, X2 = 54387.94, p < .001) extracted 4 factors,
explaining 53.81 % of variance (EV): F1-Family security (19.92 % EV;
M = 4.07, SD = 0.67), F2-Prestige (14.60 % EV; M = 3.25, SD = 0.75), F3-
Independence (13.13 % EV; M = 3.33, SD = 0.75), and F4-Realization of
an opportunity (11.15 % EV; M = 4.08, SD = 0.56). This factorial structure
was supported by Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), with an accept-
able fit: RMSEA = .084. EFA of Entrepreneurial-Influences (KMO = .916,
X2 = 60584.93, p < .001), extracted 4 factors, EV 60.08 %: F1-Resources
availability (21.25 % EV; M = 3.86, SD = 0.68), F2-Stable customers and
incentives (19.70 % EV; M = 3.82, SD = 0.65), F3-Social and economic in-
stability (11.11 % EV; M = 2.96, SD = 1.06), and F4-Opportunities in the
sector and residence area (8.03 % EV; M = 3.29, SD = 0.95). This factorial
structure was supported by CFA, with an acceptable fit: RMSEA = .073.
EFA of Support-Services (KMO = .995, X2 = 57311.43, p < .001) extracted
2 factors, EV 58.43 %: F1-Financial support (32.59 % EV; M = 3.93, SD =
0.69) and F2-Prestige (25.84 % EV; M = 3.95, SD = 0.65). This factorial
structure was supported by CFA, with an acceptable fit: RMSEA = .090.
The health group showed scores mostly above global average in
factors.
Conclusions
EMQ showed adequate psychometric properties. The instrument is
useful for measuring entrepreneurships motivations in health.

Page 32 of 132

Background
The study stems from a project of the Health Indicator Monitoring
Unit (HIMU) of the Health School of Santarém (ESSS), developed in
partnership with the Cardiology Service of Nurses of an Urban Hos-
pital in nursing consultation (NC) with patients with Permanent Pace-
makers (PPMs) and Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillators (ICDs).
Nurses, as members of the multidisciplinary team, meet the needs of
the patient with PPMs and ICDs, promoting the ability for self-care,
whether in developing strategies to prevent health deviations or in-
tegrating new self-care behaviour.
It was imperative to know how
nurses develop the NC to carry out an assessment of the effective-
ness of the results in these patients. Objective: To characterize and
describe the nurses’ interventions in NC with patients with PPMs
and ICD.
Methods
Descriptive, qualitative and cross-sectional, exploratory design, devel-
oped with nurses (NC) with patients with PPMs and ICDs. Data from
nurses’ narratives of action and recording instruments were analysed
with Content Analysis.
Results
Three dimensions were identified: Initial Assessment, Nurse Interven-
Initial
tion and Intervention Evaluation (outcomes). The categories:
assessment - Function; Reason for the action; Intervention action of
Nurse - Observe, Manage, Attending; Inform. The result of the inter-
vention evaluation - structural and functional integrity of the person
and self-care action.
Conclusions
The nursing intervention in the NC shows an orientation to patient-
centred-care on their physical dimension and capacity for self-care.
Identified different ways of approach, but the concern for the well-
being, knowledge and training of the person, are cross-cutting ele-
ments for nurses.

Background
The drinking behaviour of university students has become a cause of
concern due to the occurrence of excessive consumption situations
during academic festivities, when, hypothetically, nursing students
should have better health behaviours than their peers. Objectives: (I)
to describe the drinking behaviour of nursing students; (II) to deter-
mine the prevalence of regular alcohol consumption among this
population; and (III) to relate the regular alcohol consumption to
gender and grade year.
Methods
Data was collected through self-reported questionnaires. This was a
descriptive and correlational study.
Results
The participants were 226 students, of whom 219 were female and
40 were male. Alcohol consumption was high; 68.9 % of the students
reported usually drinking alcoholic beverages. The majority (96.9 %)
already consumed alcohol at some time in their lives, and reported
consuming mostly in the company of friends (99.1 %). The majority,

67.3 %, had already been drunk at least once. Also, 27.2 % of the stu-
dents had consumed more than three alcoholic drinks on a single
occasion. Among the students who reported having been drunk at
some time, 2.2 % reported having had unprotected sexual
inter-
course when drunk.
Conclusions
The results are discussed within the question that these students,
although knowledgeable of the harmful effects that the consump-
tion of alcoholic beverages can cause, have a high prevalence of al-
cohol consumption. Some dangerous behaviours occur along with
alcohol abuse, such as driving under the influence of alcohol, or

Background
Based on evidence found during the empirical study we can affirm
that the nursing profession is affected by work stress. Objective:
Evaluate stress and engagement levels among nurses in health units
in Portugal and Spain and describe the stress-generating factors
among the surveyed nurses.
Methods
A comparative study on a transversal
level. Sample of 867 nurses
(504 Portuguese, 363 Spanish), female 83.6 % (78.6 % in Portugal,
90.6 % in Spain) and average age of 37. 77.2 % of the Portuguese
and 39.4 % of the Spanish nurses work on average 40 hours per
week. 60.6 % and 57.7 % of the Spanish and Portuguese respectively
have exercised their profession for 10 years. Pamela Gray-Toft’s Nurs-
ing Stress Scale (1981) [1] and Schaufeli & Bakker’s Utrecht Work En-
gagement Scale (2003) [2] were used.
Results
Globally, Portuguese nurses experience higher stress levels although
the difference with Spanish nurses is not statistically significant.
There are statistically significant differences between Portugal and
Spain in “Lack of help from colleagues” and also in the psychological
domain in general. Concerning Engagement, there are statistically
significant differences in the three dimensions, the p-value of the
Student t-test was under 5 %, highlighting that Spanish nurses are
more vigorous, dedicated and absorbed by their work.
Conclusions
Portuguese nurses perceive more psychological stress and mention
having less help from colleagues. Spanish nurses feel more vigorous,
dedicated and absorbed by their work.

Safe Staff Nursing emerges as condition for quality nursing care. It inte-
grates a quantitative dimension (number of nurses) and a qualitative di-
mension (mix of nurses’ competencies). It was intended in this research
to analyse the relationship between Safe Staff Nursing and patient satis-
faction with nursing care.
A quantitative and correlational study was carried out, with a con-
venience sample of 1,290 guests, 43 head nurses and 629 nurses. We
used the Evaluation of Patient Satisfaction with Nursing Care Scale”
(EASCCE18), and to identify patterns of nursing services/staff alloca-
tion we used the Cluster Analysis Technique.
Two allocation patterns emerged: the more secure allocation pattern
(Pattern A - 55.8 % services) the teams are more developed (nurses
with higher age, greater professional experience, more specialist
nurses), and the number of nurses observed is equal to or greater
than that estimated (by formula in the Normative Circular N.1, MH,
2006);
less secure allocation pattern (Pattern B - 44.2 % services)
characterized by nursing teams with less developed skills profiles
and the number of nurses observed is lower than estimated.
The results showed that patients in Pattern A services have higher
overall satisfaction levels (Average AP = 4.53) compared to Pattern B
(Average BP = 4.39), and the differences are statistically significant for
p ≤ 0.05 (t (41) = 2.502; p = 0.016). We concluded that the safe staff
nursing is a factor that positively influences patient satisfaction with
nursing care.

Background
Information and Communication Technologies have come to facili-
tate access and efficiency of healthcare, and promote a closer rela-
tionship between health professionals and patients.
Objectives: This study aims to assess the intention to use of eHealth
with nursing students, and to evaluate the influence of sociodemo-
graphic variables,
internet user profile and eHealth literacy on the
intention to use eHealth.
Methods
This correlational and cross-sectional study was applied in a sample
of 67 nursing students from a Portuguese School of Health Sciences
(85.1 % female and 14.9 % male), using the “eHealth Literacy Scale”
and the “Intention to use eHealth questionnaire”, drawn up accord-
ing to the “Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology”.
Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS software and non-
parametric tests were used to verify the statistical significance of
data, considering statistical significance for p < 0.05.

Results
Moderate scores (from 2.88 to 3.97 out of 5 points) were found in all
dimensions of intention to use eHealth (behavioural intention, per-
formance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, facilitating
conditions and expectancy of difficulties). Significant associations
were found between the intention to use eHealth and several socio-
demographic variables (age, gender, education), internet user profile
and eHealth Literacy index.
Conclusions
The intention to use eHealth by nursing students was found to be
only moderate, several predictors being found. These findings offer
implications for enhancing the nursing curriculum and for continuing
education opportunities. Increasing eHealth literacy has the potential
to change the adoption of eHealth and support improved patient
outcomes.

Background
Current challenges in mental health have led knowledge societies to
promote a review and discussion of policies and intervention strat-
egies with a positive impact in promoting the mental health of com-
munities. Community-Based Mental Health (CBMH) is an international
joint program between 8 European countries and 9 institutions of
higher education, since 2011. Objective: To promote collaborative
learning in community-based mental health as well as develop ac-
tions and community intervention strategies focused on the client.
Methods
The research aimed to evaluate the efficiency of the international
program (CBMH) with the use of post-program assessment and col-
lection of data from individual reports and the online questionnaire.
Results
The CBMH program was attended by 180 students of undergraduate
studies from different disciplines such as nursing (25 %), physiotherapy
(20 %), occupational therapy (15 %), social work (15 %), cardiopneumol-
ogy (12 %), speech therapy (8 %), art (3 %), psychology and other areas
(2 %). Students refer as main factors: the "content of keynotes," "diverse
and innovative use of teaching-learning methodologies", work in tuto-
rials with multidisciplinary groups "and" thematic workshops".
Conclusions
Students who participated in this program state expressively that it
had a very positive impact on the understanding of the phenomena
inherent to a mental health community-based approach, as well as
allowing the appropriation of knowledge and tools that make them
more competent in their field and cooperation with other areas. High
levels of students’ satisfaction with program, as well as in the devel-
opment and application of new teaching methods were some of the
strong points mentioned.

Background
The increasing number of graduated nurses, the reduction of em-
ployment opportunities in the country and the poor working condi-
tions/salary, causes many graduates to begin their nursing profession
finding themselves in a less positive context. This context may nega-
tively interfere with the satisfaction of nurses at work and nursing
care given. Objective: Characterize the satisfaction at work of gradu-
ates in nursing.
Methods
This is a descriptive study in a sample of 141 graduates between
2002 and 2014 in a nursing school of the Northern Region of
Portugal. The "Satisfaction Scale with the Professional Status of Nurse"
was created and validated based on literature review. It is a Likert scale
of 1 to 5 points: 1 – very dissatisfied and 5 – very satisfied. The scale
has five dimensions: working conditions, salary, interpersonal relations,
and personal and professional fulfilment.
Results
It was concluded that nurses feel more satisfied at work in the di-
mension interpersonal relationships (mean = 3.46, SD = 0.60), followed
by degree of personal and professional fulfilment (mean = 3.37; SD =
0.65) and the quality of working conditions (mean = 3.13, SD = 0.51).
The dimension that had a lower satisfaction at work was remuneration
(mean = 2.85, SD = 0.79).
Conclusions
Graduate in Nursing show average values of job satisfaction but
dissatisfaction with regard to remuneration. This satisfaction situ-
ation at work, for people who are starting their professional car-
look of the profession and society in
eer, requires a very special
general.
It also requires conducting more research studies to ex-
tend this study, and further study of some aspects relating to
minor levels of satisfaction presented and the quality of nursing
care provided.

Background
The National Breastfeeding Policy and Action Plan 2015-2020 recog-
nises the right that all mothers have for receiving clear and impartial
information so as to be able to make a fully informed choice on how
to feed their baby (WHO, 2015) [1]. Objectives: To identify the socio-
demographic, professional and contextual variables influencing the
attitudes of health professionals towards breastfeeding and to assess
the relation between attitudes of professionals and some sociodemo-
graphic, professional and contextual variables.

Methods
A quantitative, correlational and cross-sectional study of a sample of
122 health professionals of Portugal. A questionnaire was applied on
sociodemographic, professional and contextual data and “Scale of
Health professional attitudes to breastfeeding” [2].
Results
Health professionals with an average age of 42.75 years (s = 10.2), fe-
male (77.9 %), married or in union (79.5 %), working in a Family
Health Unit (64.8 %). The majority (88.5 %) did not attend training
courses in this area. They showed a positive attitude towards the
breastfeeding (X = 183.77). There are differences between attitudes:
the profession (χ2 = 8.863, p = 0.031), the nurse's area of expertise
(U = 24.00, p = 0.026), the duration of professional experience (r = -0.231,
p = 0.011) and that health professionals attended training in this area in-
fluenced more favourable attitudes.
Conclusions
This study confirms the need for specific training in counselling on
breastfeeding for health professionals and implementing repaired
promotion strategies for breastfeeding support.

Background
Nursing has revealed to provide continuity of care and the necessary
structure for the management of chronic disease [1]. Continuity of
care in the area diabetes assumes particular importance, once self-
care is a cornerstone of an effective treatment and requires a con-
tinuous support and supervision by nurses [2]. Objective: To assess
the frequency of nursing interventions directed to continuity of care
in education to people with diabetes in primary health care.
Methods
Cross-sectional study with 104 nurses, in primary health care, using
Diabetes Education Process Scale (DEP) [3]. The results were ob-
tained using descriptive statistics. All
inherent ethical principles
were respected in this study.
Results
The intentional sample, included 104 nurses who agreed to partici-
pate in the study, and currently provide nursing care to clients with
type 2 diabetes in primary health settings. The sample has an aver-
age age of 43 years (S.D. = 7.5), with maximum age of 62 years and
a minimum of 29 years, the majority (95.9 %) were female. Respon-
dents, on average, develop such interventions in a high frequency,
with a mean value of 3.80 (SD = 0.79), (4 corresponds to the max-
imum frequency and 1 minimum).
Conclusions
These nurses, on average, considering the frequency of interventions,
have developed therapeutic education respecting the continuity of

care. These interventions have major importance in self-care promo-
tion for the proper control of diabetes.

Background
Mental health stigma is still a major problem of our society and rep-
resents a big source of anguish for patients. This type of stigma is a
relatively common phenomenon among health professionals, and
represents a big obstacle to provide qualitative health care. Objec-
tives: To acknowledge mental health stigma level among health stu-
dents, and to know its correlation with the prevalence of diagnosed
in this
mental disorder and contact with a mentally ill relative,
sample.
Methods
A cross-sectional study, descriptive and correlational, was performed.
The sample, selected by a non-probabilistic of convenience sampling
is composed by 672 higher health education students of
method,
the Leiria’s district. Data was collected by a self-administered ques-
tionnaire, composed with sociodemographic questions and the Attri-
bution Questionnaire.
Results
Stigma levels in the sample tested were low to moderate. 33 stu-
dents have a mental disorder diagnose, most of them depression dis-
order (n = 23), and 224 students have contact with a mentally ill
relative. There are no statistically significant differences in stigma
level between students that have a mental disorder diagnose or have
contact with a mentally ill relative and those not.
Conclusions
Low to moderate stigma level in health students is a similar finding
when comparing to other studies in this area. Students who have
mental disorder diagnose or contact with a mentally ill relative
present the same stigma level when compared to those who haven’t.
This result shows that pedagogic intervention aiming to reduce this
stigma should be a priority in the higher health education to every
student.

Background
The globalization process has brought with it anxiety and anguish.
Greater access and interactivity and increased information exchange
replaces the core of the individual’s exposure to fear and discomfort.
The new education curriculum policy is in favour of more effective
and humane doctor-patient relationships. Humanization can be stim-
ulated with academic approaches.
In psycho-pedagogical support
services for medical students (PPSS), one of the purposes is to help
scholars to manage stress and frustrations and deal with social
is-
sues. Objective: To analyse the processes that occurred in PPSS and
their possible contributions to the humanization of medical students
in the light of a reflexive analysis of the literature.
Methods
Qualitative research of interviews, experiments and expressions of
medical students that were developed in PPSS activities and discus-
sions, were recorded in a systematic way. A literature review about
concepts and processes of humanization guided the analysis.
Results
The development of a humanistic individual
is a complex process,
consisting of experiments, individual psychological factors and social
contexts that influence the construction of the "humanized" person.
It was observed that the events and challenges have become a rich
space of experiences. Experiences, responsibilities, anxieties and suc-
cesses have been developed between students in context, in the in-
dividual or collective mind.
Conclusions
Medical education involves a process itself, generating specific fears
and anxieties. The sharing of solutions developed by PPSS and stu-
dents to reduce stress of this stage of life was considered effective
by themselves, reinforcing the importance of having a working PPSS
approach.

Background
Surgical Psychoprophylaxis helps the patient to deal with and to re-
lieve symptoms and other specific problems created by surgical
intervention situations. Goal: to get to know the means of hospital
psychologists acting with surgical paediatric patients in teaching hos-
pitals, during the preoperative period, as well as the surgery doctors’
perceptions about the surgical psychoprophylaxis.
Methods
A qualitative research, with the participations of six psychologists
and six surgery doctors who work in teaching hospitals in Brazil. The

BMC Health Services Research 2016, Volume 16 Suppl 3

Page 36 of 132

testimonials content was analysed through three synergic steps: de-
scription, inductive analysis and critical analysis, and after that, the
convergence points were analysed.
Results
Both the description and the inductive analysis indicate that the psy-
chologists’ activities refer to post-surgical appointments requested
by the doctors and nurses for the children operated on. Critical ana-
lysis stressed that the clarity each professional has about his or her
own functions and their ability to communicate with colleagues are
determinant for the appropriation of multidisciplinary action. Conver-
gence analysis revealed that psychologists and doctors have similar
conceptions about the need of the therapeutics interventions to in-
volve the parents; on the other hand, they differ in the granting of
legitimacy to the specialized discourse on surgical prophylaxis for
paediatric patients.
Conclusions
It is necessary to increase the doctors’ comprehension about how
surgical psychoprophylaxis actions at the above mentioned hospital
can take into account the needs and wishes of the population served
and satisfy the professionals involved.

Secção Autónoma das Ciências da Saúde, Universidade de Aveiro,
Aveiro, 3810-193 Aveiro, Portugal
BMC Health Services Research 2016, 16(Suppl 3):P17

Background
Patient-perceptions are related to several important health outcomes,
being determinant to treatment success and a consequent contribu-
tion to physiotherapy evidence. However, this information has not
been provided by most physiotherapy studies. Objective: To describe
patient-perceived outcomes in physiotherapy.
Methods
Patients doing ambulatory physiotherapy in private and public health
services were included. Sociodemographic data (age, gender) was
collected. At the end of the treatment a questionnaire with 10 topics
for physiotherapy outcomes was administered: 3 topics for general
function (daily activities independence; general mobility; fatigue and
tiredness); 2 topics for pain relief (pain intensity; antialgic medica-
tion); 5 topics for psychosocial factors (sleep pattern; self-esteem and
confidence; participation in recreational activities;
interaction with
friends and family members; participation in physical activities). Pa-
tients were asked to select maximum of 2 topics that have improved.
The frequencies of selected topics (%) were reported,
i.e. general
function (GF), pain relief (PR), psychosocial factors (PS) and the differ-
ent combinations between them.
Results
Seventy patients (53.63 years ± 16.69; 41 female) were included.
Sixty-three patients (90.0 %) referred to general function improve-
ment, 48 (68.6 %) referred to pain relief; 15 (21.4 %) referred to posi-
tive psychosocial impact. Moreover, patients reported simultaneous
improvement in: P and GF (N = 39; 55.71 %), GF and PS (N = 10;
14.28 %) and P and PS (N = 5; 7.14 %).
Conclusions
At discharge from physiotherapy,
improvement in GF is frequently
perceived by patients and most of the time it is combined with per-
ceived pain relief. Patients’ perceptions of psychosocial improvement
corroborate the positive impact of physiotherapy in a wide range of
life domains.

Background
The changing profile of nursing professionals have been configured
historically as a function of a dynamic labour market in health, which
in turn is influenced in the economic, social and cultural context. The
growing competitiveness of organizations requires a search for
health professionals who are more and more qualified and able pro-
fessionals. The need to increase assistance, management, research
and teaching skills, is gradually being incorporated in the professional
competencies. Objectives: To analyse competencies expressed by nurs-
ing managers and to identify areas of learning need in management.
Methods
A descriptive study of qualitative approach, with 20 interviews with
nurse managers analysed. We followed the methodological orienta-
tions recognized by Bardin (2009) [1].
Results
From the analysis of the interviews, the following main categories
emerged: professional practices; management of human resources;
skills development in nursing; material and equipment resources;
training and development of nursing practice and the improvement
of quality. The findings lend support to the body of knowledge that
recognizes the wide range of financial, operational, clinical, and hu-
man resource responsibilities of the nursing manager.
Conclusions
Today it is demanded that the manager in nursing should have a com-
bination of knowledge, attitudes and behaviours that are fluid in when
applied to different types of organizations. We need to construct a plan
of professional development for nursing managers, which is adjusted in
competencies and takes technical, ethical-politics, communicative and
the development of citizenship dimensions into consideration.

Background
The fundaments used by Portuguese physiotherapists that support
the interventions in upper limb rehabilitation are not known. Joining
clinical practice with clinical evidence is a current challenge. The goal
of this study is to find the state of the art of physiotherapists’ beliefs
in rehabilitation of upper limbs in stroke.
Methods
A national web-based survey focused in characterizing the profes-
sional profile of physiotherapists from Portugal working in upper

limb rehabilitation of patients with stroke was conducted in 237
health institutions (n = 462 physiotherapists). The total time of re-
cruitment was from August to December 2014.
Results
A total of 179 physiotherapists from 64 different locations in main-
land Portugal answered the survey, giving an approximate rate of
response of 38.7 %. For this study, 147 responses were eligible for
statistical analysis. The average age of
respondents was 30.95
(±7.02) years old and had on average 6.91 (±6.54) years of experi-
ence. For this sample, the first objective for rehabilitation in acute
and chronic stroke was to normalize tonus. In 13 questions about
scientific fundaments in rehabilitation of upper limbs post-stroke,
the majority of responses in 4 were in disagreement with evi-
dence. Only 3 questions reached a consensus (more than 90 %
agreement).
Conclusions
The fundaments for rehabilitation are the mirror of clinical prac-
tice in physiotherapy.
It is hard to find agreement among these
professionals, and some have contradictory elements according to
scientific evidence. It seems to be necessary to alert professionals
and future professionals to interventions with supported scientific
results.

Background
With the shift of death and dying from home to hospital,
in the
hospital death process, nurses are inevitably faced with death in
their professional context. Accompanying someone at the time of
death can be a privilege and an opportunity to give meaning to
life, but it is also a time of great exhaustion and emotional over-
load.
It involves having the ability to deal with the suffering of
people and one’s own emotions, which is not easy at all and for
which the nurse was neither professionally nor naturally prepared.
Based on this, the question is how the nurse can develop this
emotional competence and mobilize it in the context of care, en-
suring quality care and a dignified death for patients at the end
of life? Objective: To identify and better understand the strategies
developed by nurses to deal with the emotional impact of death
and dying.
Methods
An integrative literature review with research in the Institutional Re-
pository database of the Portuguese Catholic University and the Por-
tuguese Open Access Scientific Repository.
Results
Rationalization, the situation of denial,
forging ahead, avoidance,
false security, projective identification, patient relationship severance,
focus on routines and technique, team sharing, outside-work activ-
ities and family support strategies were identified during this study.
Conclusions
The intense emotional experience of end-of-life care can generate a
disproportionate workload and stress with negative consequences,
so it is important that nurses develop strategies that help them
deal with these experiences and keep their emotional and spiritual
health.

Nursing students’ opinion about the supervision relationship
during their first clinical experience
Laura Reis (laurareis@esenf.pt)
Escola Superior de Enfermagem do Porto, 4200-072 Porto, Portugal
BMC Health Services Research 2016, 16(Suppl 3):P21

Background
The first contact with a clinical reality always has a strong impact on
students, in so far as it is from this moment that practices developed
begin to gain significance. In the context of the relationship that is
established between the clinical supervisor and the student it is es-
sential that pedagogical interaction be vested, which is based on a
relationship of help in an atmosphere of trust and openness, thus
compelling their personal and professional growth. Objective: To
identify the skills that Nursing Students most value related to the
supervisor-student relationship.
Methods
We chose an ethnographic study within the framework of the qualita-
tive paradigm, in a longitudinal approach according to the logic of the
case study. As a data collection technique, we made use of the partici-
pants’ observations and semi-structured interviews. The study was car-
ried out by a 2nd-year class of a Nursing Course in a Portuguese Nursing
Faculty that was undergoing its first clinical experience in a hospital
context: 10 weeks in internal medicine and 10 weeks in general surgery.
Results
According to the students’ perspective,
the supervisory rapport
established diverged in relation to the clinical context. It is consid-
ered that in the context of medicine, contrary to the context of sur-
gery,
favoured a relationship of help,
listening, trust, respect, commitment, accessibility and development
of different areas of know-how.
Conclusions
It was ascertained that the students fundamentally valued the clinical
supervisors who had relational and socio-effective skills, and who
were able to provide development of positive affect.

The development of
relational skills is a complex and demanding
process. For the introduction of new teaching and learning strategies in
the Nursing Degree Course, the Nursing Relational Laboratory was de-
veloped with the support of the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation: this is
a pedagogical, dialogic and critical project, using sign language, drama
and analysis of emotions to develop relational skills. It aims to encour-
age the development of relational skills of students through active peda-
gogical action and interactional communication.
Methodology of action research in which the actors are 42 students
in the 1st year. Autoscopy sessions to perceive relational skills. Use of
a control group. Descriptive analysis and content of autoscopy and
instruments: Interpersonal Relations Inventory; Emotional thermome-
ters, Patient Health Questionnaire, Assertiveness Questionnaire and
Self-Efficacy Perceived Scale.

BMC Health Services Research 2016, Volume 16 Suppl 3

Students signed a "Letter of Commitment" to defend the ethical prin-
ciples of research. The first autoscopy was analysed under the light
of a defined grid. There are differences between autoscopy of stu-
dents in the control group and those who started the first year of
the course. They also effectively implemented a framework of con-
ceptual activities and, looked for other similar experiences with a visit
to Manchester Metropolitan University.
For Abreu (2001), one’s skills are not inborn nor static, but have a
strong personal touch and they progress through the course of expe-
riences that occur in the formative period, in comparison with others
and with himself, with the expectation that students will develop
technical and scientific skills and relational skills.

Professional satisfaction is an important phenomenon due to its influ-
ence on the human mental resources and physical health, on their atti-
tudes and on their behaviour, both professional and social. The purpose
of this study is to assess the actual level of professional satisfaction of
bioscientists working at a Lisbon hospital.
A modified questionnaire which allowed the data collection was used
for each subject, intended to characterize the sample, order the eight
dimensions of professional satisfaction as well determining their
levels by using a satisfaction scale. A statistical analysis was made by
descriptive methods, Friedman test, Student’s t-test for independent
samples and one-way ANOVA.
In a sample of 30 technicians (25.42 % of the target-population), the
most important dimension was Status/Prestige (7.12) and the least
important was Remuneration (3.12). Global satisfaction shows that
they are neither satisfied nor dissatisfied, although the dimension
Professional-Patient Relation had better results, in opposition to Re-
muneration, which had the worst outcome.
The study concluded that the sample’s level of professional satisfaction
is not affected by gender, qualifications, years of technical experience
and remuneration. The results reveal a state of accommodation and
lack of interest regarding labour, which might be a consequence of the
actual stagnation in their career. The replication of this study in other
public and private institutions is of the most relevance, in order to ob-
tain representative outcomes concerning the professional satisfaction
of bioscientists at a national level.

Background
Family health care nursing has been influenced by many variables that
are derived from both historical and current events within society and

the profession of nursing. In these variables are included issues related
with nursing theory, practice, education and research [1]. Objective:
This study aims to evaluate the relation between the importance of
family in nursing care and nurse’s sociodemographic and professional
characteristics.
Methods
Descriptive and correlational study of Portuguese nurses, through
the questionnaire about the importance of families in nursing care
(Importância da Família nos Cuidados de Enfermagem - Atitude
dos Enfermeiros,
IFCE-AE). The results were obtained using non-
parametric statistical tests.
Results
Respondents were 71 nurses aged 22 to 58 years old. The im-
portance given to the family by nurses surveyed did not vary with
age (r = 0.181; p = 0.789) nor with schooling (p = 0.190) or with the
specialty of nurses (p = 0.963). Child health and paediatric nurses
have assigned greater importance to the family (s = 18.5), and mental
health nurses were those who attributed the minor (s = 9.25). Also,
the emphasis on family was not associated with the professional cat-
egory (p = 0.963), the professional exercise time (r = 0.231; p = 0.870),
nor the context of the provision of care (p = 0.520). Although primary
health care nurses (s = 30.23) gave greater importance to the family
presence that differentiated health care nurses (s = 26.32).
Conclusions
The sociodemographic and professional characteristics evaluated
were not associated with the importance that nurses assign to the
family.

Background
Professional satisfaction in nursing constitutes an index of the quality
of care provided to the patients, and of the assessment of the orga-
nizations’ performance, being of particular relevance the study of the
rehabilitation nurses’ satisfaction in the context of renovations in
health services. Objective: To know the conditioning factors (positive
and negative) of satisfaction; to study the influence of the area of
care provided in the professional satisfaction; and to analyse the in-
fluence of socio-demographic and professional characteristics in the
perceptions of professional satisfaction.
Methods
It is a quantitative study, exploratory, descriptive and correlational.
The sample is constituted by 60 nurses, exerting functions in hospi-
tals (47) and in ACES (13). For the data collection, the Instrument of
Assessment of Professional Satisfaction (IASP, 5th version) was used.
Results
No significant differences were found regarding nurses’ professional
satisfaction, according to professional category, between specialist
nurses and nurses who, being qualified with the specialty, did not ac-
cede to this category. Men were the ones who presented more satis-
faction, mainly in the quality of the workplace scale (t = -2.26, p <
0.05), and particularly in the human resources policy (t = 2.24, p <
0.05) and moral (t = -2.23, p < 0.05) subscales. Moreover, CSP nurses
were also more satisfied with the improvement on the quality of care
(F(2, 46) = 4.99, p < 0.01). The non-recognition of specialized education

and the underuse of their competencies emerged as dissatisfaction fac-
tors, from the open questions.
Conclusions
These findings point to an investment in the profitability/recognition
of education, crossed by the deconstruction of gender disparities.

Background
Information Systems in Nursing are the support of nursing documen-
tation and constitute data repositories capable of being used as raw
material for the formalization of nursing knowledge. The Nursing
Practice Support System (SAPE), has an electronic format that inte-
grates the International Classification for Nursing Practice (CIPE) and
allows nurses to document their decision-making process at different
care levels. Objectives: To identify and specify nursing diagnoses de-
scribing the needs and nursing interventions that responds to the
needs of people with stoma, as well as specifying a referential integ-
rity relationship between them.
Methods
Based on a study of exploratory nature, analysis of content of the ac-
tive national customizations in SAPE in December 2011 was carried
out, subsequently validated by two experts. The final result was sub-
mitted to a focus group.
Results
Ninety-four (94) diagnoses and 165 nursing interventions were ob-
tained, as well as, 323 links between diagnoses and nursing interven-
tions related to the person living with a stoma. The diagnoses
documented by nurses take as their nursing focus knowledge and
capacity and, at times, lacked referential integrity between these and
the nursing interventions.
Conclusions
This analysis contributes to the systematization of the knowledge re-
lated to the subject and, therefore, to the formalization of this know-
ledge, enabling the future construction of a Detail Clinical Model of
Nursing related to the person living with a stoma.

Background
One of the new methodologies applied to the teaching of nursing is
High-Fidelity Simulation (HFS). This type of simulation allows the
nursing students to develop their clinical practice by using techno-
logical and sophisticated simulators. Recent investigations have stud-
ied the importance of HFS, through the level of perception of
learning and of satisfaction of the students. Since there is a lack of

instruments in Portuguese, we felt the necessity to translate and val-
idate two evaluation scales of HFS. Objectives: Translate, validate
transculturally and analyse the psychometrics features of two instru-
ments: “Nursing Students’ Perceptions of Learning using a High-
Fidelity Human Patient Simulator” and the “Learner Satisfaction with
Simulation Tool”.
Methods
A linguistic and cultural translation was conducted with 139 Portu-
guese nursing students. Internal consistency reliability and explora-
tory factor analysis were performed.
Results
The Scale of Perception of Learning of the Nursing Students about
HFS (SPLNS-HFS) has a Cronbach's Alpha of 0.942 and the Scale of
Satisfaction of the Nursing Students about HFS (SSNS-HFS) of 0.969.
Values of correlation of each item with the SPLNS-HFS are over
0.507, and of the SSNS-HFS over 0.633. The SPLNS-HFS shows a satis-
factory factorial analysis’, with unifactorial structure, and the SSNS-
HFS revealed two factors – Utility of Simulation (α = 0.956) and Func-
tionality of Simulation (α = 0.912).
Conclusions
The Portuguese versions of both scales are psychometrically reliable,
cross-culturally valid, and useful measurement instruments for asses-
sing the impact of High-Fidelity Simulation in nursing students.

Background
In the last decade the amount of evidence has increased indicating
that stakeholders’ training and education are key to the successful
adoption of electronic health records (EHRs). Also, it has been shown
that the availability of technical and training support during the ini-
tial
implementation is essential. Objective: We investigate the per-
ceived knowledge of EHRs and the motivation for adoption of EHRs
in physiotherapy practice.
Methods
A cross-sectional study was conducted using a questionnaire developed
with 27 questions. Among studied variables were: perceived knowledge
of technologies for electronic health records, number of training ses-
sions for adoption of EHRs, motivation related to adoption of EHRs.
Results
A random sample of 180 physiotherapists [mean(SD) age: 34.7(±10.3);
70.0 % female; mean and range of years of practice: 11.5 (1-40)] from
Portugal was surveyed. Perceived knowledge of technologies for EHRs
was low and very low for the majority of physiotherapists (72.2 %). Also,
most physiotherapists (75.0 %) reported not having any training related
to technologies for EHRs for physiotherapy. The lack of training related
with technologies for EHRs was perceived by the majority of physio-
therapists (82.2 %) as an important barrier to the adoption of EHRs for
physiotherapy. 75.0 % physiotherapists (74.1 % with age ≤ 40 years) re-
ported high motivation to learn about technologies related to EHRs for
physiotherapy.

Page 40 of 132

Conclusions
The findings indicate that overall, physiotherapists’ needs related to
training on technologies for EHRs for physiotherapy are generally not
met. Physiotherapists with expertise in informatics may help design
EHR systems that meet the needs of physiotherapy, and rigorously
evaluate the extent to which these technologies improve care.

Background
The Presence of stressors in medical training interfere with quality
of life. Physical Activity improves people's overall quality of life.
The learning requirements of a medical degree can interfere with
the healthy habits and consequently with the student's quality of
life. Objective: To analyse the relationship between standards of
Physical Activity and the quality of life of Medicine undergraduate
students.
Methods
Cross-sectional study, executed in the University of Southern Santa
Catarina (UNISUL), Brazil, with students from the 1st and 6th year of
medical school. The data was collected from March till July of 2014,
using the instruments WHOQOL-bref and of physical activity, the
IPAQ. Analysis on SPSS 18.0, compared to averages on T-test, with
p ≤ 0.05 and confidence interval 95 %. The project was approved by
the Ethics Committee for Human Research from UNISUL.
Results
One hundred nineteen (119) medicine undergraduates took part in
the study, 72.30 % females between 17 and 34 years of age, 87.40 %
single. In terms of physical activity, 36.10 % were active and 34.50 %
sporadically active. Better quality of life socially (60.40) and worst
(63.76) psychologically. Final year students had better quality of life
when it comes to the environment (p = 0.035). The very active had
better quality of life scores in all domains, without statistical sig-
nificance. The sedentary presented the lowest average social quality
of life.
Conclusions
When we associate the physical activity standard with the various
domains quality of life, it stands out that the individuals that are clas-
sified as “Very Active” present better average quality of life scores
across all domains.

The curricular skills for decision making education in a Nursing
Degree
Fátima M. Marques (fmarques@esel.pt)
Escola Superior de Enfermagem de Lisboa, Lisboa, 1700-063, Portugal
BMC Health Services Research 2016, 16(Suppl 3):P30

Background
In order for a nursing student to become a qualified professional he
needs a diverse set of skills, where decision-making is the cornerstone

of nursing care. Teaching skills should structure the curriculum so it is
centred on skills acquisition. Objective: To identify the curricular skills
for the teaching of decision-making in a Nursing Degree of a school in
Lisbon.
Methods
An exploratory study of qualitative nature, done with data collec-
tion through interviewing teachers and documental analysis of
the curriculum. The inclusion criteria for the 10 participants were:
being a member of the conceptor group of the school’s syllabus,
having experience as a professor of the school’s Nursing Degree
and being a course conductor on the school’s Nursing Degree. To
analyse the results, Bardin’s content analysis was used. Anonymity
and confidentiality of the findings were guaranteed.
Results
The order of the structural competences of the analysed curriculum
(curriculum and professor’s discourse) begins with the category ‘con-
sidering knowledge as a resource to be mobilized’, ‘working through
problems’ and ends in the category of ‘guidance for a smaller discip-
linary compartmentalization’.
Conclusions
The curriculum seems to be focused on the knowledge and the crit-
ical thinking that support effective decision-making. However, the
course’s structure can attenuate the development of the decision-
making apprenticeship in the care process.

BMC Health Services Research 2016, 16(Suppl 3):P31

Background
Health organizations are characterized by a complex work envi-
ronment, being influenced by the behaviour of those who work
there. Management strategies play a key role in human resource
management, namely in mobilization behaviours that can promote
satisfaction at work and decrease turnover. Objective: To analyse
whether nurses’ mobilization at work (collaboration;
improvement;
organizational loyalty; participation in civic life) influence job satisfac-
tion and turnover.
Methods
Sample: 338 nurses from a public hospital (mean = 38.63 years-old;
79.2 % females). Measures: I) Behaviours at work [1]: F1-participation
in civic life, F2-Collaboration; F3-Organizational
loyalty (37.58 %,
10.10 %, and 8.75 % of explained variance, respectively); II) Work sat-
isfaction [2] – unidimensional, 76.10 % of explained variance; and III)
(67.90 % of explained variance). All
Turnover [3]- unidimensional
scales showed good psychometric properties.
Results
The adjusted regression model of behaviour at work explained 20 %
of
the turnover. The
organizational loyalty (β = .29) and participation in civic life (β = .18)
were predictors of job satisfaction. Collaboration was not a significant
predictor (p > .05). Organizational
loyalty negatively predicted the
turnover (β = - .12).
Conclusions
The results contribute to best practices and improvements in the
quality of nursing care. It is important to look at the human resources

the overall satisfaction and only 3 % of

management taking into account their active role, their involvement
at work and their commitment to the organization. This seems to
enhance satisfaction at work and decrease of turnover. Nurses’
mobilization at work seems to improve the quality of health care
and the safety of the patients.

Background
Most entrepreneurial
ideas do not appear ready or finished. Any
business opportunity needs to be developed and improved through-
out the enterprise process. Educational
institutions may facilitate
the ability of the students in undertaking, identifying and building
business opportunities, enhancing their knowledge and formative
experiences along the learning process. Objective: Evaluate busi-
ness influences on the entrepreneurial ability of students of the
Polytechnic.
Methods
Correlational quantitative study, conducted with 1,604 students from
18 institutions of the Polytechnic of Portugal.
Data collection took place between July and November/2015, with
a questionnaire to assess the entrepreneurial profile, the Carland
Entrepreneurship Index (CEI) and sociodemographic variables of
students.
Results
We found four business factors that influence entrepreneurship:
"availability of funds" (4:13, SD = .67); "Having stable customers and
incentives" (3.99, SD = .58); "Social and economic instability" (3:08,
SD = 1.17) and "Opportunities in the sector and area of residence"
(3:36, SD = 1.05). On a scale ranging between 1 and 5, we obtained
an overall score of 3.86 (SD = .55), for the corporate influences on
entrepreneurship.
Conclusions
For students, entrepreneurial influences are important, with a greater
sense of fear with regard to economic instability, reinforcing the
need for further training and academic investment in business.

Background
Teaching and Learning through web-based learning platforms is a
complementary method of conventional teaching and learning ap-
proaches which has the potential to produce meaningful learning ex-
periences. The study of Pharmacology in the Pharmacy Degree of
the School of Allied Health Technologies is normally taught face-to-
face. With this paper we aim to describe an online approach to the
teaching of this subject. Objectives: To develop and assess two e-
learning modules for the teaching of Pharmacology.
Methods
Using the MIPO Model for instructional design, Moodle as an LMS,
and commercial software, we developed several learning objects that
make part of two different modules of Pharmacology. The modules
were offered as mandatory training for
the third-year students.
Knowledge retention was assessed 10 weeks later in a written exam.
Results
Two modules and five lessons were developed. Quality assurance
was assessed by the Web-Based Learning Environment Question-
naire. Students enrolled in both modules and engaged thoroughly in
learning activities and learning contents. All students had a good
performance in online quizzes. After 10 weeks, knowledge retention
was analysed via a written test. Students were grouped according to
their final achievement in the discipline. Students with high and
medium achievement grades showed greater knowledge retention
than other groups. There was no difference between genders.
Conclusions
An online environment was successfully designed and implemented
for complementing the teaching of Pharmacology. Knowledge reten-
tion does not seem to be associated with shifting the paradigm to
online learning, but is probably related to student characteristics or
motivations for learning.

Background
According to the Nursing Role Effectiveness Model, the structural

or indirectly influence the care outcomes through the process (ac-
tions developed by the nurses). Objectives: To identify the changes
that, from the nurses’ perspective, occurred during the provision of
care to patients with peripheral venous catheters (PVCs) between the
first and the second phase of the Action-Research (AR) study, and
the components that influenced these changes.
Methods
During the second phase of the AR study (December, 2011), a focus
group composed of six nurses was held at a medicine unit of a cen-
tral hospital. A script was used with six open-ended questions. All
ethical procedures were followed.
Results
Positive changes in nursing care provision to patients with PVCs were
identified related to the type of dressing used, patient monitoring,
aseptic care, and infusion rate. The nurses believed that some vari-
ables of the organizational component influenced those changes,
such as the centralization of the material used for catheterization or
the availability of materials, such as transparent dressings. The nurses
also valued the following aspects: knowledge of the research find-
ings of the first phase; training sessions on the topic; and, above all,
the nurses’ engagement throughout the process of change in care
provision.
Conclusions
Considering the model of analysis used, we found that the changes
identified in nursing care resulted from several factors, with the en-
gagement of the professionals themselves in the change process be-
ing considered a key aspect.

Peer feedback in the field of higher education, has been defined as an
advantageous process in the development of soft skills, improving the
learning outcomes of students, reflected in the professional skills to be
acquired. The implementation of peer feedback, generates by itself a set
of
individual and group dynamics, actively involving students and
teachers in this methodology, which simultaneously achieves the evalu-
ative and learning purpose.
Through a qualitative approach using the method of focus groups,
this study aims to present the perception of teachers on the concept
of peer feedback, its applicability in clinical training context in nurs-
ing, its influence on skills acquisition by students, and the strength
and threats during implementation.
The perception of peer feedback is described by teachers (n = 8) in-
volved in a focus group, which set guidelines for carrying out a par-
ticipatory action research project in nursing clinical training.
We conclude that peer feedback is a complex process which contrib-
utes to increased responsibility for the students but also for teachers
in a collaborative and integrative approach to learning and its evalu-
ation. It is evident that preparation and planning of implementation
are fundamental, suggesting that peer feedback will positively con-
tribute to students’ development, such as self-directed and self-
regulated learning, critical and reflective thinking, self-assessment
ability, decision-making, involvement, responsibility and autonomy.

Background
Critically ill intubated patients inevitably need endotracheal suction-
ing. There are innumerable complications associated with this pro-
cedure, including hypoxemia, atelectasis, tissue trauma, hypertension,
microbial colonization and bronchospasm. Best practices can reduce
endotracheal-suctioning-related adverse events. Objective: The aim of
this study is to describe endotracheal suctioning recommendations in
adult mechanically ventilated patients.
Methods
An integrative review. Research was conducted in B-on, PUBMED,
and RCAAP between 28 and 30 December 2015, including guidelines
and original articles from the last 5 years. We found 534 documents
and after analysing their abstract and methodological quality, five
documents were selected. Data were compiled in a chart in terms of
grade of evidence, acceptance and applicability.
Results
Strong evidence was found in the following recommendations: suc-
tion only when necessary, pre-oxygen before suction event, use of a
suction catheter half the endotracheal tube lumen size, use of the
lowest suction pressure possible, shallow suction, avoiding saline in-
stillation, use of sterile technique, avoiding disconnection from the
ventilator, use of closed suction when there is high FiO2 or PEEP or
risk of
lung derecruitment, suction duration less than 15 s and
monitoring.
Conclusions
Endotracheal-suctioning-related adverse events are frequent and can
be reduced by the implementation of practice guidelines. Nurses
need to have to knowledge of current best evidence in order to
make informed decisions. This review intends to be a step towards
safer practice.

Methods
This was a descriptive and transversal study. Nurses from the Central
Region of Portugal were asked to fill a staff satisfaction internet ques-
tionnaire based on the Professional Satisfaction Assessment Tool
(IASP).
Results
A sample of 1,126 nurses answered the questionnaire, 71.8 % of
them female. On average they were 39.7 ± 9.8 years old, ranging
from a minimum of 22 to a maximum of 65. The majority (69.0 %)

Background
The increasing number of graduated nurses, the reduction of em-
ployment opportunities in the country and the poor working condi-
tions/salary cause many graduates to begin their nursing profession
finding themselves in a less positive context. Schools are a factor that
can influence this initiation context in the profession. Objectives:
Characterize satisfaction with the nursing school.
Methods
This is a descriptive study in a sample of 141 graduates between
2002 and 2014 in a nursing school of the Northern Region of
Portugal. The "Satisfaction Scale with the Professional Status of
Nurse" was created and validated based on a literature review. It is a
Likert scale of 1 to 5 points: 1 – very dissatisfied and 5 – very satis-
fied. The factor analysis with orthogonal rotation Varimax type scale
– composed of 25 items – reveals good value for Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin
(0.901) and high internal consistency (α = 0.851). Three dimensions
were differentiated: career, professional self-fulfilment and social rep-
resentation of nursing.
Results
All dimensions have a degree of satisfaction with the school: skills
development (mean = 4.05, SD =0.46);
linking (mean = 4.01, SD =
0.52); centrality of the student (mean = 3.97, SD = 0.94); interpersonal
relationships (mean = 4.10, SD = 0.59); and the reference in nursing
education (mean = 3.90, SD = 0.60).
Conclusions
Graduates Nurses reveal themselves satisfied with the school, which
is a promoting factor to mitigate the difficulties in the job market.
Schools have to adapt ever more to the current contexts of the
learning/education process and work of nurses.

Background
Partnership is commonplace in life and is characterized by a relation-
ship and shared goals as well as common purpose. The research into
partnership as a phenomenon among organizations is scarce and
nowadays this partnership is more urgent than before to work more
effectively and with a greater sense of efficacy. Objective: To explore,
via a focus group, the supervisors’ representations about the partner-
ship between the school of nursing and the hospital.
Methods
Qualitative study. Five sessions following a focus group approach
were developed focusing on a discussion about the partnership be-
tween the school of nursing and the hospital. Eighteen supervisors
(eleven from the local hospital and seven from the academy) partici-
pated in this focus group (nine supervisors allocated equally in two
groups). Data collection also included interviews and field notes ana-
lysed according to qualitative content analysis.
Results
Three categories emerged as cornerstones of a framework. These cat-
egories are expectations related to clinical supervision, understand-
ing the partnership between the school of nursing and hospital and
a collaborative approach as a way to enhance the development of
quality references.
Conclusions
This study provides further support for the improvement of the part-
nership between the school of nursing and the hospital. It identifies
the need for a partnership between the school and hospital, which
includes preparation/joint planning and meetings.

Background
In college, students are faced with potentially disturbing life events,
and to adapt to the new context, they need to use coping strat-
egies [1]. Objectives: I) To understand more about the coping strat-
egies that college students use;
II) to evaluate the relationship
between coping strategies used by students with their age and
gender.
Methods
Correlational study performed in 2015, with 242 students from a col-
lege in the centre of Portugal, who have replied to a survey in Goo-
gle Docs consisting of the Toulousaine Scale of Coping [2] and a
sociodemographic and academic questionnaire. Data was analysed
using descriptive statistics and non-parametric inference.
Results
The study sample was composed by 242 students with a mean age
of 21.78 years old (SD = 4.78), being mostly female (n = 189/78.1 %).
The coping strategy used by both genders, but particularly by males,
is the “control”, having verified a positive and statistically meaningful
relation between the use of this strategy and age (p = 0.004). On the

BMC Health Services Research 2016, Volume 16 Suppl 3

other hand, the female gender uses social support, with statistical
significance (p = 0.001).
Conclusions
Coping strategies that students most commonly use are “control”
and “social support”, where male participants rely more on “control”,
and female on “social support”. We could also conclude that older
students use “control” more often and it’s verified a positive relation
between “control” and age.

Background
Health professionals need good emotional intelligence to deal with
patients, and to have effective communication, attending patients’
physical, mental and emotional and needs. Having good emotional
intelligence leads to a positive attitude towards mental health pa-
tients. Objectives: The aim of this study is to find the relation be-
tween mental health stigma and emotional intelligence in students
of a Portuguese health college.
Methods
This is a quantitative, descriptive and correlational study, with a non-
probabilistic sample of 672 students of a Portuguese health college
in a central region, which comprises students of Nursing, Dietetics,
Physiotherapy, Speech Therapy and Occupational Therapy. To collect
data, a questionnaire was used composed of sociodemographic
questions, the Portuguese version of the Attribution Questionnaire
(AQ-27) and the Emotional Intelligence Scale (WLEIS-P).
Results
The sample is mainly composed by female students (82.7 %) with
ages between 17 and 56 years old. The mental health stigma was
moderate (4.19; SD = 0.732), and emotional intelligence is good (3.62;
SD = 0.422). A negative correlation was found (R = -0.081; p = 0.037)
between help and emotional intelligence. Help (R = -0.152; p = 0.000)
and avoidance (R = -0.121; p = 0.002) have also a negative correl-
ation with the emotional assessment of the other person, and pity
is correlated with self-emotional appraisal
(R = -0.088; p = 0.022).
Dangerousness and use of emotions are positively correlated (R =
0.094; p = 0.015).
Conclusions
Emotional
intelligence can be negatively related to mental health
stigma, although dangerousness seems to engage with the use of
emotions. It is important to enhance emotional intelligence in health
students, in order to reduce mental health stigma.

Background
Health workers are among the stigmatizing agents as regards mental
health. It is important to look at this issue in future professionals as
they may play a role in changes in the future. Some studies on
health professionals show slightly higher levels of stigma in women,
while the fear factor decreases with age. Objective: This study aimed
to evaluate the level of stigma in mental health with health students
of a Portuguese health college and the relation to gender, age and
course.
Methods
A quantitative, descriptive and correlational transversal study was
conducted on a non-probabilistic convenience sample of 672 stu-
dents from dietetic, nursing, physical, speech and occupational ther-
apy courses. For data collection a questionnaire was used consisting
of sociodemographic questions and the Portuguese version of the
Attribution Questionnaire (AQ27).
Results
The study sample consists mostly of female students (82.7 %) with a
mean age of 21.16 years (SD = 4.18). The level of mental health
stigma of the sample is considered moderate (4.19; SD = 0.73), and
equal within gender. With age, there is an increase in the factors re-
sponsibility, aid and avoidance (p < 0.05), with a reduction in com-
passion, dangerousness and fear (p < 0.05). Stigma levels are lower in
students of occupational therapy, both in total score and in aid and
avoidance. Physiotherapy students had the lowest values of coercion
and segregation. All dimensions of stigma decrease during the
course (p = < 0.05) with the exception of aid and responsibility,
whose value increased (p < 0.05).
Conclusions
Factors were found in the sample that may be considered stigmatiz-
ing, which raises the need to rethink pedagogical strategies for the
reduction of stigma.

Background
It is well established that pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) is effective in
improving dyspnea and health-related quality of life of patients with
moderate-to-very-severe Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease
(COPD). However, the effects of PR in patients with mild COPD have

BMC Health Services Research 2016, Volume 16 Suppl 3

Page 45 of 132

been little explored. Thus, this study investigated the short- and
long-term effects of PR on patients with mild COPD.
Methods
This was a single-arm longitudinal study. A 12-week PR program with
exercise training and psychoeducation was conducted in the com-
munity. Outcome measures at baseline, post-PR, 3 and 6 months
were the 6-minute walk test (6 MWT) for exercise tolerance; the
Modified British Medical Research Council questionnaire for dyspnea;
1-repetition maximum on the chest press and leg extension exercises
for peripheral muscle strength; the Brief physical activity assessment
for self-reported physical activity and the St. George’s Respiratory
Questionnaire (SGRQ) for health-related quality of life.
Results
Thirty-two patients (65.94 ± 8.95 years, FEV1 86.7 ± 5.17 % predicted)
completed the program. After PR, significant improvements were ob-
served in all measures (all p < .004), with the exception of SGRQ
symptoms (p = .013) and impact (p = .104) scores. Compared to base-
line, significant improvements in the 6 MWT, leg extension exercise,
self-reported physical activity and SGRQ total and symptoms scores
were still observed 6 months after PR (all p < .002).
Conclusions
PR improves exercise tolerance, dyspnea, muscle strength, physical
activity and health-related quality of life in patients with mild COPD,
and most of these benefits last for at least 6 months. These data
suggest that PR should be part of the first-line management of pa-
tients with mild COPD. Further work is warranted prior to broader
implementation.

Background
In the phonological disorder domain, it is common to observe poor
phonological awareness skills and, consequently, a later or deficit lit-
eracy learning. As so, it is important that speech and language thera-
pists stimulate early phonological awareness to prevent reading and
spelling difficulties in children with phonological disorder. Objective:
This study investigated the effectiveness of a phonological awareness
programme for preschool children with phonological disorder. Sixty-
one Portuguese children, aged 4.0 - 6.2 years participated in this
study. Twenty-one children with phonological disorder and 40 typic-
ally developing children.
Methods
Children received 10 sessions focused on phonological awareness
abilities, specifically on syllabic and phonemic awareness (blending,
segmentation and manipulation). For ethical reasons, children were
not assigned to an intervention control group. Rather, all children
from a kindergarten were invited to participate in the programme.

Speech-language assessment and diagnostic were performed by a
speech and language therapist. Outcome measures of phonological
awareness ability (related to syllabic and phonemic units) were taken
before and after the intervention.
Results
Results revealed that both groups improved significantly after inter-
vention (p = 0.041 for syllabic awareness; p = 0.011 for phonemic
awareness). Despite significant differences between groups at pre-
treatment assessment, children with phonological disorder showed a
more significant improvement for syllabic awareness (p = 0.004).
Conclusions
The findings suggest that the phonological awareness programme
was effective in the improvement of syllabic and phonemic
awareness.

Background
Retirement is one of the major adult life transitions that can originate
different vulnerabilities. Implementation of a health promotion pro-
gram in this life stage can avoid vulnerabilities and contribute to pro-
moting health benefits. REATIVA, a Portuguese project funded by
Fundação para a Ciência e Tecnologia (FCT), has as its goal to
create a health promotion program to increase self-efficacy and
adaptation perception during the transition to retirement.
In this
work we present the efficiency of this program, called REforma
ATIVA_Program.
Methods
Quasi-experimental design study, involving 3 groups: 2 experimental
(EG1/EG2) and 1 control group (CG). The target population com-
prised recent retirees enrolled in the Health Administration Region –
Centre/Portugal. The effects of the program implementation have
been evaluated by applying an instrument
that measured self-
efficacy (General Self-Efficacy Scale, GSE) and perception of adapta-
tion to retirement transition (Escala de Posicionamento Face à Adap-
tação à Reforma, EPFAR). All participants have signed informed
consent. Data was processed using SPSS Program.
Results
There was a positive change in GSE and EPFAR on average, in all par-
ticipants who have undergone the REforma ATIVA Program (EG1/
EG2). The most notable evidence of its effect has been noted in
EPFAR,
in which was found, using MANOVA (Greenhouse-Gerssen
test), that there was a significant effect of the program in adaptation
to retirement over time (F = 17.405, p = 0.001; ƞ2 = 0.554; PO = 0.982).
Conclusions
The efficiency of REforma ATIVA Program denoted the added value
that an intervention of this nature can have in the promotion of indi-
vidual and family health during transition to retirement, conducting
to an active and healthy aging process.

Intimate partner violence is one of the most common forms of violence.
Although men are the main authors of violence, it is essential to include
actions to help them in order to produce a more effective result, be-
cause it is believed that they are able to recognize and take responsibil-
ity for the violence, using different forms of self-expression. However, it
is difficult to assess the results of these actions.
This research aims to analyse the relapse of violence after participa-
tion in a batterer intervention programme. It was conducted a case
study in a batterer intervention programme, where 86 men agreed
to participate. The Centres for Disease Control and Prevention - Fol-
low up questionnaire was used, adapted to be used in Brazil.
Most participants (61 %) were aged between 30 and 40, had studied
11 years (26 %), were employed (89 %), 60 % were separated, 56 %
had a new relationship and 19 % had no contact with the ex-wife.
About violence perpetration in the last 3 months, one reported com-
mitting physical abuse, 9 % psychological and 21 % reported one
situation when they felt like hitting their partner.
The majority of participants (84 %) said that nothing would lead
them to assault their partner, 31 % described behavioural changes
after participation in the programme and one reported no change.
The study concludes that batterer intervention programmes have
positive influence on participants; however, despite lower occurrence
of physical violence, there were critical situations and psychological
violence. Longer follow-ups including women are necessary, but this
intervention can be a way to decrease violence against women.

Background
Bowen Therapy is a noninvasive technique that uses a series of gen-
tle hand movements over muscles, tendons, ligaments, joints, nerves
and fascia to promote relief from musculoskeletal and related neuro-
logical complaints. Although little research-based effectiveness data
are available, some studies showed positive effects on pain percep-
tion, range of motion, functionality and lymphatic circulation. Object-
ive: To investigate the immediate effects of Bowen Therapy on the
mechanical properties – tone, elasticity and stiffness – of the erector
spinae and biceps femoris muscles and hamstring flexibility.
Methods
Twenty-one healthy individuals (mean age: 21.05 ± 3.79 years old),
9 male and 13 female, participated in a crossover study. They were

randomly allocated to a placebo intervention or a Bowen therapy
session with 8-day interval period. Before and after the interven-
tion, hamstring flexibility was assessed by the "Sit and Reach test”;
and the mechanical properties – tone, elasticity and stiffness – of
the erector spinae and biceps femoris muscles were measured bi-
laterally using a handheld mechanical
impulse-based myotono-
metric device.
Results
No significant changes were observed in muscle tone, elasticity or
stiffness with the application of the Bowen Therapy session, but a
significant improvement was observed in hamstring flexibility (34 to
42 cm, p < 0.001) in comparison with the placebo session.
Conclusions
A single session of Bowen Therapy immediately increases hamstring
flexibility, but do not change muscle tone, elasticity and stiffness in
healthy individuals.

BMC Health Services Research 2016, 16(Suppl 3):O86

Background
The incremental shuttle walk test (ISWT) is one of the most used
measures to assess cardiorespiratory fitness in clinical and research
settings. Reference equations to predict ISWT distance (ISWD) in dif-
ferent adult populations have been established. However, equations
for adolescents have been less explored. Objective: This study devel-
oped a reference equation to predict the ISWD for adolescents.
Methods
Healthy Portuguese adolescents aged 12–17 years were included.
Socio-demographic and anthropometric (body mass index [BMI])
data were first collected. Lung function was assessed with spirometry
and quadriceps muscular strength (QMS) with hand-held dynamome-
try. Physical activity level was evaluated through the Physical Activity
Index (PAI). ISWT was performed twice and the best ISWD was used
for analysis.
Results
A total of 125 participants (56 male; 14.6 ± 1.3 years) with normal
lung function (forced expiratory volume in one second 104.8 ±
14.9 % predicted) completed the assessment. According to PAI,
54.4 % (n = 63) of the participants were moderately active and mean
QMS was 20.7 ± 6.8 kgf. Participants walked on average 1254.0 ±
280.9 m [760–2250] in the ISWT. A multiple regression model showed
that sex, BMI, QMS and PAI were independent contributors to the
ISWD, explaining 54 % of the variability (p < 0.05). The reference
ISWD = 814.49 + (286.80 × sex) - (3.05 × BMI) + (8.83 ×
equation was:
QMS) + (22.30 × PAI), sex: female = 0, male = 1.
Conclusions
Sex, BMI, QMS and PAI were predictors of the ISWD in adolescents,
providing a simple reference to assess their cardiorespiratory fitness.
This equation is a valuable tool to interpret ISWD obtained from Por-
tuguese adolescents, with or without a health condition.

Background
Elderly people tend to experience higher levels of depression, anx-
iety, subjective pain and experiential avoidance when compared with
younger people. Recently, several studies have been giving empirical
support to mindfulness practice as a way to improve well-being and
life satisfaction. Objective: The present study aimed to test the bene-
fits of a Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) program in Por-
tuguese institutionalized elderly people, as a way to improve life
satisfaction and reduce psychopathology.
Methods
The present sample included 12 institutionalized elderly people, 9 fe-
males (75 %) and 3 males (25 %), with ages between 65 and 91 (M
= 82.58 years; SD = 7.87), that filled several self-report questionnaires
and were assessed with Mini Mental State Examination. Our exclusion
criteria were the presence of cognitive or sensorial
impairment,
illiteracy, and age under 65 years. They attended to an adapted
Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction program, with 48 sessions
(16 weeks) and they were evaluated before and after the intervention.
Results
The comparative analysis (Wilcoxon rank-sum test) revealed that de-
pression, anxiety, experiential avoidance and subjective pain decreased
significantly after the program. On the contrary,
life satisfaction in-
creased significantly.
Conclusions
The results suggest that the MBSR program is a useful intervention
to reduce psychopathology and increase life satisfaction in institu-
tionalized elderly people. The application of these interventions may
be very useful in elderly care institutions. Future research should en-
large the sample, include a control group and assess follow-ups.

Background
Reduced physical activity (PA) levels are associated with poor health-
related outcomes in patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary
Disease (COPD). PA-focused interventions complementary to pulmon-
ary rehabilitation (PR) have been developed to increase patients’ PA.
However, it is unknown whether PA changes are related to health-
related outcomes improvement. This study explored the relationship
between changes in PA and health-related outcomes in patients
with COPD.

Methods
Thirteen patients with COPD (65.6 ± 10.6 yrs) participated in a 12-
week PR programme plus a PA-focused intervention. Daily PA was
measured using accelerometers on weeks (W) 1, 7 and 12 and feed-
back was given to participants in the following weeks regarding:
daily steps; time spent in sedentary, light and moderate-to-vigorous
(MVPA)
intensity activities. Exercise capacity (6-minute walk test),
functional balance (Timed Up-and-Go (TUG) test) and health-related
quality of life (St George’s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) – Symp-
toms, Activities, Impact) were assessed at W1/W12. Correlations be-
tween PA data and health-related outcomes were performed at W1
and using the change scores (W12-W1).
Results
At W1, time spent in MVPA was correlated with exercise capacity (r =
0.817, p = 0.001) and TUG (r = -0.692, p = 0.009). Changes in MVPA
time were correlated with changes in TUG (r = -0.653, p = 0.016) and
SGRQ Symptoms (r = -0.588, p = 0.035). The latter was also correlated
with changes in sedentary time (r = 0.760, p = 0.003). No other signifi-
cant correlations were found.
Conclusions
Patients with better exercise capacity and functional balance were
also more physically active at W1. Nevertheless, findings suggest that
intervention-related improvements in symptoms and functional bal-
ance may contribute to PA changes in a greater extent than exercise
capacity. More research is needed.

Background
Nurses are engaged in patient education as an empowering patient-
centred approach increases self-management and self-control, mak-
ing this activity one of the most significant in nursing practice.
Objective: To evaluate the effect of a nurses’
lifestyle education
programme on type 2 diabetic patients’ metabolic control and self-
care behaviours.
Methods
A controlled before and after experimental study was conducted to
assess the effectiveness of the programme consisting of a sequence
of individual, group and telephone educational interventions, applied
over 24 weeks. 64 subjects completed the study in the experimental
group (EG) and 58 in the comparison group (CG) (CES RLVT process
number 039/CES/INV/2014). As it aimed to change self-care behav-
iours and increase metabolic control, Glycosylated haemoglobin,
Body Mass Index (BMC) and self-care activities (Summary of Diabetes
Self-Care Activities Scale) were assessed before and after the inter-
vention programme.
Results
Mean percentage change in glycosylated haemoglobin was more
significant in EG (–0.79 %, SD = 1.3) than in CG (-0.05 %, SD = .65),
while BMCs decreased in EC (-0.50 kg/m2, SD = 1.5) and increased
in CG (+0.04 kg/m2, SD = 1.2). Self-care activities showed positive
changes, more significant in the experimental group. Expected be-
haviours concerning food increased by a mean of 2 days/week and
physical activity 1 day/week in EG while in CG changes were lower
respectively). Daily foot

examination increased 1.8 days/week in EG and only 0.14 days/
week in CG.
Conclusions
The nursing educational programmed designed was effective in
people with type 2 diabetes, resulting in higher metabolic control
and more frequent self-care behaviours after the intervention was
concluded.

This study aims to explore the existence of changes in psychopatho-
logical symptoms and in emotional states,
in patients undergoing
treatment in a therapeutic community (applying the Change & Grow
Therapeutic Model), specialized in treating addiction disorders.
Methods
The sample consists of 32 patients with ages between 15 and
55 years old of both genders. Patients filled in a sociodemographic
questionnaire and the following self-report questionnaires: Depres-
sion, Anxiety and Stress Scale, Positive and Negative Affect Sched-
ule,
Internalized Shame Scale, Other as Shamer Brief, Aggressive
Questionnaire and the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale. These instru-
ments were administered at two distinct moments, with a five-
month interval.
Results
The results revealed significant differences between in the variables
studied when comparing the baseline and the second assessment.
After five months of treatment there was a significant improvement
in terms of psychopathological symptoms,
including fewer depres-
sive anxiety and stress symptoms. There was a decrease in negative
affect, internal and external shame, as well as in aggressive and im-
pulsive behaviours. An increase in positive affect was also found.
Conclusions
This is a novel study as it addresses and raises awareness of interven-
tion with the Change & Grow Therapeutic Model. This programme
shows promising results regarding psychopathological symptoms
and in emotional states.

Background
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is one of the main
causes for morbidity and death worldwide. Maintaining life quality,
autonomy and control over the disease involves the development of
self-management skills. Objective: To determine the cost benefit of a
nursing intervention program to promote self-management in COPD
compared to a conventional treatment.
Methods
A quantitative and retrospective study was developed based on a
post-factual documental analysis. A descriptive and exploratory ana-
lysis and a simulation to assess the robustness of results was per-
formed. Between 2010-2013, 2,469 cases of COPD patients attending
a Portuguese central hospital were analysed.
Results
This study evidenced that patients with more self-management skills
have lower costs and fewer inpatient and emergency episodes. Al-
though an increase in costs and number of nursing consultations is
observed, these have minor impact in total care costs. Overall, the
group under the intervention program registered a 67 % reduction
in hospital costs between 2010-2013. The program is cost-beneficial
for the health institution and has positive impact on the opportunity
cost related to time saving while searching for health care provision
services.
Conclusions
The nursing intervention programmes aimed at developing self-
management skills show positive impact on patients’ health condi-
tion and on health care costs. An increase in advantages deriving
from this long-term type of program is to be expected in the forth-
coming years.

Background
Selective uterine arterial embolization can be followed by pain, nau-
sea, vomiting and stress-induced catabolism. Development of im-
proved pain relief with multimodal analgesia and stress reduction by
regional anaesthetic techniques has provided important possibilities
for enhanced recovery. Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of a
multimodal analgesia protocol for the management of uterine artery
embolization in women for the relief of acute pain.
Methods
Observational, prospective study of 40 patients who underwent se-
lective uterine arterial embolization, with epidural catheter implanted
and intravenous administration of analgesia for postoperative pain
management. Pain intensity was measured by visual analogue scale
(VAS) during the first 24-48 hours after procedure.
Results
The mean age of the patients was 39.1 ± 6.79 years; we used a re-
gional anaesthetic technique with epidural anaesthesia or combined
spinal and epidural anaesthesia for perioperative period in com-
bination with Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and
paracetamol. 75 % of patients reported a VAS pain score below 3
point 24 hours after the procedure. 15 % of patients needed bolus

administration of morphine and 10 % of patients needed a local an-
aesthetic bolus of lidocaine 2 % for an adequate pain control. The
average length of stay in resuscitation area was 1.07 ± 0.26, with a
VAS < 3 to discharge. Degree of patient’s satisfaction after selective
uterine artery embolization was 7.8 ± 1.6.
Conclusions
Pain is a complex sensation that requires an interdisciplinary ap-
proach. Multimodal analgesia includes the association of analgesics
and local anaesthetic administered by different routes to achieve ef-
fective relief. This approach increases patient satisfaction.

Background
Inappropriate fluid management during major surgery may result in
fluid overload or systemic hypoperfusion. Perioperative goal-directed
therapy based on hemodynamic parameters in comparison with
“liberal” fluid administration appears to have different effects on
perioperative outcomes. Objective: We investigated whether indi-
vidualized goal-directed therapy would decrease fluid administra-
tion and improve postoperative outcomes.
Methods
Patients undergoing elective intraabdominal surgery were randomly
assigned to a control group (CG) with routine intraoperative care and
goal-directed therapy fluid administration group (GDT group), where
fluid management was guided by hemodynamic measures. The local
ethics committee approved the study. A total of 60 patients were in-
cluded in the study.
Results
Groups were similar with respect to demographics and baseline
hemodynamic variables. The median duration of resuscitation area
stay was significantly reduced in the GDT group (p < 0.05) and fewer
patients developed complications than in the control group (p >
0.05). The median amount of intravenous fluids was significantly
lower in the GDT group (p < 0.01). The total number of complications
was reduced in the GDT group (p > 0.05). There were no significant
differences in mortality between the groups.
Conclusions
In patients undergoing major abdominal surgery, implementation of in-
traoperative goal-directed hemodynamic strategies was associated with
a reduced length of resuscitation area stay, with a reduced amount of
intravenous fluids allowing us to avoid fluid overload and lower the in-
cidence of complications compared to “liberal” fluid administration.

Background
Development challenges of an adolescent are based on the search
for identity and parental independence. For adolescents with Spina
Bifida (SB) these challenges become particularly hard to overcome.
The development of functional skills in performing daily life activities
and self-management are crucial to facilitate their transition to adult-
hood. The main purpose of this study was to develop an educational
programme for self-management for adolescents with SB and evalu-
ate its effect.
Methods
Fifty-six (56) adolescents with SB, aged 10 to 18 performed the
programme in a Summer Camp environment, with a before and after
programme evaluation and 6 months later. The Functional Independ-
ence Measure and Self-evaluation functionality scale were used as
data collection instruments (quantitative approach) and 12 focus
group interviews, 8 with the adolescents on the last day of the
programme and 4 with their parents 6 months later (qualitative
approach).
Results
The results revealed that the programme induced statistically signifi-
cant differences in self-care, elimination, transfers and social cogni-
tion dimensions that persisted 6 months after the programme. Of
the psychoeducational strategies used in the programme,
they
highlighted the problem solving technique, roleplaying, mentoring
and modelling by lay-led programmes as those that most contrib-
uted to changes in the self-management behaviour of
these
adolescents.
Conclusions
The results suggest clear benefits in improving the functionality and
the development of self-management skills and, suggest that the
programme was highly effective. These results reinforce the import-
ance of using psychoeducational strategies within the nursing inter-
vention to promote mastery and the self-management competences
in young people with SB.

Background
Exercise has been reported as a way of attenuating the effects of
immunosenescence. Reductions in salivary anti-microbial proteins
(AMP) levels reflect reduced airway mucosal immune protection lead-
ing to upper respiratory tract infections. Yoga practice could be used
as therapy, as it doesn’t require strenuous effort and it could be eas-
ily adaptable to the necessities of the frail elderly. Objective: With
this study we propose to analyse whether chair-based yoga practice
can be used to attenuate the effects of immunosenescence in pre-
frail elderly women.
Methods
The final sample consisted of thirty-four elderly individuals (mean
age 84.21 ± 6.9 years) that participated in the study and were divided
into two groups: an exercise group (EG, n = 22) and a control group
(CG, n = 14). All subjects were evaluated before and after the exercise
program. The EG practised exercise 2-3 times per week for 14 weeks,

BMC Health Services Research 2016, Volume 16 Suppl 3

Page 50 of 132

and the CG was not involved in any exercise programmes. Saliva
samples were collected before and after 28 weeks. Differences be-
tween moments were analysed using the Student t-test.
Results
According to the results there were no statistical significant differ-
ences in the EG individuals after the 14-week exercise program in
the AMP concentrations, however the GC participants showed a dec-
rement of IgA and lysozyme levels (p ≥ 0.05).
Conclusions
Our results revealed that chair-based yoga practice was able to main-
immune parameters in frail elderly women, possibly
tain mucosal
preventing a decrease in quality of life, and that it can be used as a
therapy to attenuate the effects of immunosenescence.

Background
Diabetes is a metabolic disease emerging as a threat to human
health. Physical Activity is presented as a strategy for the treatment
and control of this disease. Objectives: To compare the benefits of
High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) versus Moderate Intensity Con-
tinuous Training (MICT) on several diabetes markers, namely HbA1c.
Methods
The sample comprised 10 diabetic individuals, aged 61.7 ± 9.37 years
old; with a body mass of 88.39 ± 2.54 kg; 163.7 ± 9.13 cm in height; a
body fat mass of 29.84 ± 12.74 kg; lean mass of 55.63 ± 14.47 kg, vis-
ceral
fat rating 14.4 ± 6.6 and a waist circumference of 109.8 ±
16.92 cm. Group 1 (HIIT, n = 5) performed a walk of 30 minutes at an
intensity of HRR60-65 %, and Group 2 (MICT, n = 5) performed a 20-
minute walk/run alternating 1 minute run at HRR70-75 % with 1 mi-
nute active recovery at HRR50-60 % for seven weeks, two times a
week. Fibrinogen, HbA1c, total cholesterol, HDL, LDL, triglycerides, C-
reactive protein, homocysteine, waist circumference, and VO2 max
were determined for the two groups.
Results
No differences were found between the type of exercise performed
between groups. HbA1c in MICT was significantly reduced (p = 0.043)
in post versus pre-testing; Homocysteine and Body Fat Mass was also
significantly reduced (p = 0.043) at the end of the HIIT protocol.
Conclusions
The type of exercise (HIIT vs. MICT) does not appear to induce differ-
ent outcomes on markers of diabetes, namely on HbA1c.

Background
Daily routines and the specific pressure ulcer (PU) care can cause dif-
ferent needs for the caregiver. This follows results of a study (2015)
where the main needs were identified of family caregivers of people
with pressure ulcers. In this work the nursing interventions for each
need are defined. Objective: To define the nursing interventions as-
sociated with the needs of caregivers of people with pressure ulcers.
Methods
A qualitative study. Questionnaire with open questions to twelve
domiciliary care nurses. Speech analyses with WEBQDA program. All
ethical aspects checked.
Results
For difficulties in positioning, the nursing interventions are: teach, in-
struct, demonstrate, train, assist and supervise positioning, provide
materials and literary support. When they refuse to contact with PU,
it is important to know the reasons, to explain the importance of the
treatment, to positively strengthen their performance and ascertain if
a secondary caregiver exists with competences to give treatment.
The low level of quality of life and the high level of burden require
health and social support, the use of scales for assessment, providing
a secondary caregiver and defining strategies to rest. When care-
givers need to be recognised, nurses may strengthen their import-
ance and encourage them to have time to themselves.
Conclusions
Main interventions are integrated into the autonomous nursing area.
To obtain health gains for the caregiver, nursing interventions may
be direct not only to the caregiver, but also with best care for the pa-
tient and to find health and social resources for both.

Recent studies have shown that a single bout of aerobic exercise im-
proves motor memory consolidation. However, few studies have ex-
plored the chronic effects of exercise on motor memory consolidation in
elderly people. The main purpose of this study was to investigate if a
six-month period of physical exercise could improve motor memory
consolidation in elderly people.
Thirty-eight (38) subjects of both genders, with a mean age of 71 years
old participated in the study. Subjects were divided into two groups: a
control group and an experimental group. Before the intervention of a
physical exercise program, subjects performed a Finger Tapping Se-
quence to measure baseline performance. After the intervention, the
assessment of the impact of exercise on motor memory consolidation
was held in three stages: Training, 1 hour after training and 24 hours
after training. For the analysis of the results, descriptive and inferential
statistics were used.
The Shapiro-Wilk test was applied to the normality distribution of
data and one-way ANOVA test for parametric statistics. When com-
pared with the control group, results showed a better performance
in motor memory consolidation 1 hour and 24 hours after training in

BMC Health Services Research 2016, Volume 16 Suppl 3

the experimental group. Nevertheless, these differences were not sig-
nificant (p ≥ 0.05).
It seems therefore that regular physical exercise
does not significantly improve motor memory consolidation capacity
in elderly people.

Background
The impression cytology of the ocular surface is a minimally invasive
technique that allows the analysis of conjunctival and corneal cells,
as an alternative to smears, biopsies and punches. Objective: The aim
of this study was to present a technique of collecting, fixing and
staining for impression cytology of ocular specimens.
Methods
Fifty (50) samples of bulbar conjunctiva taken from 50 ESTeSL volun-
teers were analysed. The material was collected on a strip of cellulose
acetate from Millipore, then fixed and stained with Papanicolaou
stain. The slides were analysed by three independent evaluators,
using an evaluation grid with the following parameters: cell size, de-
tail and nuclear membrane, detail and cytoplasmic membrane, ratio
N/C and tinctorial affinity. The final score per slide was obtained
through the sum of all considered parameters (scale 0 to 41).
Results
The filter paper with apex helped to correctly position the paper in
the eye and the procedure that was applied allowed an effective col-
lection of cells with 50-70 % of the filter surface being filled without
the need for topical anaesthesia. The SureThin fixative presented
quality in cell preservation,
in addition to being more economical.
The Papanicolaou staining technique proved to be ideal in the col-
ouring of ocular epithelial cells. This developed methodology pre-
sented a maximum score of 41 values in a 74 % response.
Conclusions
The presented method proved to be very effective in evaluating of
ocular cell samples, while simultaneously proving to be a very cheap
and comfortable technique for the patient.

Nowadays the regular practice of sport is an important way to preserve
the population’s health. One of the benefits of practising sport is related
to the maintenance and improvement of neuromuscular functions, espe-
cially the capacity to react to external stimuli and to promote move-
ment. The present study aimed to identify the effects of training on
Neuromuscular Reaction Time (NRT) in karatekas and non-karate athletes
with various ages and level of expertise.
NRT was considered as the time between the application of the audi-
tory stimulus and the onset of electrical activation of the first muscle
activated in the inferior limb to perform a front kick against a fixed
target (Mae-geri). The data were collected with surface electromyog-
raphy. The NRT was measured, analysed and compared in n = 46 par-
ticipants divided into four groups.
The results revealed that the first muscle to be activated in all groups
was the Tibialis Anterior (TA). However, there were no significant dif-
ferences between groups respecting NRT of this muscle. Neverthe-
less, significant differences were found between groups in NRT in the
Biceps Femoris (BF) and Gastrocnemius (GA) muscles. The results
show a differentiated neuromuscular time of recruitment in response
to the stimulus in some muscles, which could be associated with the
benefits of the sport practice on neuromuscular activity. We may as-
sume that the individuals that keep active in daily routine life skills
probably don’t decline at the cognitive process level. They change
and adapt due to the natural aging process.

It is estimated that constipation affects 20 % of the population in west-
ern countries, leading to a significant impact on people’s quality of life.
The administration of some types of fibres has significantly improved
the symptoms of constipation over 4-week periods of administration,
apparently increasing the frequency of defecation and having a protect-
ive effect on the intestinal flora. In addition to their effect on this path-
ology, fibres have been linked to beneficial outcomes in cardiovascular
diseases, diabetes, obesity, colorectal cancer and haemorrhoids. This
study focuses on the short-term evaluation of the benefits of fibres on
intestinal motility in constipated patients.
A quasi-experimental pilot study was performed, consisting of the
administration of 6.3 g of a blend supplement of six soluble and in-
soluble fibres (containing soy polysaccharide, cellulose,
resistant
starch, gum arabic, oligofructose and inulin) both at lunch and din-
ner, for 15 days. The sample included 5 patients diagnosed with
chronic constipation who frequently use laxatives, aged between 50
and 83, and who did not require a restricted-fibre diet.

BMC Health Services Research 2016, Volume 16 Suppl 3

Page 52 of 132

Participants obtained stools of type 3 and 4, according to the Bristol
stool form scale. The average daily bowel evacuations decreased and
all participants ended up taking laxatives after a short initial stop.
The supplementation with the fibre-enriched product did not cause
any adverse symptoms.
According to this study, the supplementation of chronically consti-
pated patients with fibres is ineffective in the reduction of obstipa-
tion, over a short-term period of 15 days. Besides, the dependence
generated by the use of laxatives is clearly demonstrated.

Background
This study evaluates the effectiveness of the decalcification pro-
cess, comparing water decalcifiers – Nitric Acid 10 %, for compact
bone, and Surgipath® Decalcifier® II (SD® II), for spongy bone – and
the new commercial formula, Fast Decalcifier, for both types. Ob-
jective: To compare the effectiveness of decalcifiers through the
study of morphology, preservation and quality of bone biological
samples.
Methods
One hundred and forty (140) blocks of histological samples of
compact and spongy bone of swine, previously fixed in 10 % for-
malin and impregnated in paraffin were used. The decalcification
process was evaluated for compact bone by weighing after
24 hours, cutting with a scalpel and by sound, while the spongy
bone was evaluated every hour within 24 hours through the
evaluation by palpation with forceps. The morphology preserva-
tion was evaluated by Hematoxylin-Eosin staining and presence
of calcium was checked by Von Kossa and Alizarin Red S
staining.
Results
The one-way ANOVA test indicates that were no statistically signifi-
cant differences compared with Fast Decalcifier (p-value > α = 0.05)
with SD® II for spongy bones. The Fast Decalcifier bone did not reveal
good results in compact bone which means that the decalcifier is ag-
gressive and doesn’t preserve the tissue architecture in the cases
with a high calcium level.
Conclusions
The new commercial formula, Fast Decalcifier showed a better per-
formance in the removal of calcium, in the preservation of morph-
ology and an adequate time for performance, proving to be the best
decalcifier for spongy bone compared with SD® II.

Musculoskeletal disorders (LME) are well recognized as work related dis-
eases (MSDs). Physical Activity can play an important role in preventing
MSDs and improving pain symptoms related to labour activity.
This research aimed to analyse the influence of a 10 week (bi-weekly)
exercise program (gymnastics and fitness) held in labour context, on
the reduction of musculoskeletal symptoms and well-being of factory
workers.
An exploratory longitudinal study design was conducted using a
sample of 20 factory workers. The Nordic Questionnaire for musculo-
skeletal symptoms and physical tests of strength and flexibility were
used to collect data in two different moments, T0 (before the inter-
vention) and T1 (after the intervention). There was a decrease of pain
complaints (25 % in the cervical region, 20.8 % in the shoulders, el-
bows 16.7 %, 8.4 % wrists, 12.5 % in the lumbar region, 20.8 % in the
knees and 8.3 % over the ankles/feet) and an increased sense of
well-being (feeling optimistic = 58.3 % and feel active = 66.7 %).
There were also statistically significant improvements in flexibility, re-
spectively in the trunk flexion (p = 0.000) and in the Reaching the
Left Upper Limb test (p = 0.000).
Exercise has become an essential element in promoting health and
improving quality of life, reducing the risk of developing chronic
diseases.

Background
Type 1 diabetes is one of the most prevalent chronic diseases in
school age, needing therefore knowledgeable staff in order to assure
a safe school environment. It is recommended that the school health

BMC Health Services Research 2016, Volume 16 Suppl 3

nurse should be the professional to plan, prepare and ensure (coord-
inate) training to school staff (ADA, 2014) [1]. Objectives: To evaluate
the effectiveness of an intervention program focused on the devel-
opment of knowledge of education staff on type 1 diabetes.
Methods
This is a quasi-experimental study, with a pre-post intervention
design with no control group, which included 81 educators. It was
implemented an intervention program by a school nurse with theor-
etical and practical components. Before and after intervention, it was
applied a questionnaire with socio-economic data and the Portu-
guese version of the “Diabetes knowledge Questionnaire” scale [2]
about type 1 diabetes.
Results
The knowledge improved with the intervention. Total score (ranging
from 0 -17) obtained before intervention was 11.10 ± 2.69 and after
this average rose to 13.84 ± 1.87, having a statistically significant dif-
ference (p < 0.001). Less knowledge was identified in healthy eating
and monitoring blood glucose, before intervention. After interven-
tion, worst scores were identified in the detection of hypoglycemia
signals and in intervention during hypoglycemia.
Conclusions
Knowledge is a basic condition for monitoring and for a correct inter-
vention in type 1 diabetes complications, such as severe hypoglycemia.
It is, therefore, necessary to develop effective intervention programs to-
wards the acquisition of knowledge by the school staff that supervise
students with diabetes.

Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathic Pain (DPNP) is a common complication
of diabetes, which affects a wide fraction of patients, and it’s likely to in-
crease due to the prevalence of Diabetes. Diabetic neuropathy is a com-
plication associated with patient age, illness course and hyperglycaemia
severity. DPNP pharmacologic treatment includes antidepressants, anti-
convulsants, and opioid drugs, among others. However, and given the
different pharmacologic options, pain relief is currently unsatisfactory in
most of the cases.
The aim of this study was to systematically review randomized con-
trolled trials of oral and topical pharmacotherapy for DPNP, including
studies published in peer-reviewed journals in PUBMED and unpub-
lished trials retrieved from ClinicalTrials.gov, reporting predefined ef-
ficacy and safety outcomes, published from 2010 on. Participants in
these trials included people with diabetes mellitus and diabetic per-
ipheral neuropathy who were given any treatment for diabetic per-
ipheral neuropathy. Data from the trials were reviewed by two
authors independently, and extracted using standardized data extrac-
tion sheets.
From the 29 selected trials, 11 were elected after exclusion criteria
were applied; these trials included drugs with different pharmacothera-
peutic profiles. Significant improvement of pain was only reported for

two trials: one with a serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor
and other with a cholinergic agonist of the nicotinic receptors. Both
these drugs present statistically significant differences in the intensity
of the pain when compared to placebo.
Further investigation in required to fully explain the mechanisms of
the nerve injury in in order to develop a target therapy for DPNP,
with more efficient pain control.

the development of new molecules.

Osteoporosis is a disease characterized by decreased bone mass and de-
terioration of bone microarchitecture. It is a highly prevalent condition
in western countries, and it is estimated to affect 5 % of the Portuguese
population. Advances in the research in the pathophysiology of the dis-
In
ease have been used for
addition, several clinical trials have been developed in order to deter-
mine the effectiveness of new drugs to treat osteoporosis.
The aim of this study was to systematically review randomized con-
trolled trials of oral drugs for osteoporosis treatment. The systematic
review was performed in electronic databases, particularly at Clinical-
Trials (www.clinicaltrials.gov) and PubMed (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.-
gov/pubmed), of which were selected only clinical trials of phase II
and III, in patients of female gender, published in the last five years,
which addressed any drug for the treatment of osteoporosis.
After inclusion and exclusion criteria, of the 132 studies, 34 were se-
lected to be included in the systematic review. These trials included
drugs of different pharmacologic profiles. Regarding drugs with ana-
bolic effects, molecules which stimulate bone formation, clinical trials
show efficacy for Romosozumab and BA 058, while for MK-5442 the
results were unsatisfactory. Regarding bone antiresorptive drugs,
Denosumab was reported in several studies to have high efficacy.
Other further promising drugs included ONO-5334 and Odanacatib,
which showed positive results in several clinical trials.
Despite the wide diversity of drugs under clinical trials, new pharma-
cological options should be developed to revert bone loss in this
highly prevalent chronic disease.

effect of an intervention Programme to Promote Hope (PPH) on hope,
quality of life (QOL) and comfort of people in palliative situation.
Methods
Fifty-six (56) palliative patients were randomly assigned to an inter-
vention group (n = 28) and a control group (n = 28). The intervention
group was provided with 3 PPE sessions (1 hour) for one week, while
the control group were submitted to the regular treatment. All pa-
tients were assessed with the Portuguese versions of the Herth Hope
Index, McGill Quality of Life Questionnaire and Holistic Comfort Ques-
tionnaire at pre-test/post-test, at one month follow up. The dropouts
resulted in n = 11 in intervention group and 12 in control group. Re-
sults were analysed using non-parametric statistics.
Results
Patients experienced good levels of hope, QOL and comfort. There
was no significant difference at the pre-test of outcome measures
(p > 0.05). After the intervention significant differences existed be-
tween the 2 groups in Hope and QOL, but no differences in comfort
levels. Follow-up hope levels decreased with significant differences
between the groups (p < 0.05). Differences in QOL were not found.
Comfort levels were significantly different in follow up, with higher
levels of comfort experienced by the intervention group.
Conclusions
A structural hope intervention programme in palliative patients in a
community setting had a positive effect on improving hope, quality
of life and comfort. More studies need to be developed to test the
intervention on a bigger sample.

Persons with intellectual disabilities (ID) usually present limitations in
adaptive behaviour and motor skills, which constitute a barrier to their
daily independent functioning. Our goal was to analyse the efficacy of a
Psychomotor Intervention (PMT) programme on adults with ID, in terms
of adaptive behaviour and motor proficiency skills.
The sample comprised 15 participants divided into 3 groups of 5 in-
dividuals each (A = ID, B = Down Syndrome and C = typical develop-
ment). Ages ranged from 22 to 31 years old (26.5 ± 3.76), 6 were
females and 9 males. All adults with ID were institutionalized and
adults without ID were selected by convenience. Portuguese versions
of the Adaptive Behaviour Scale [1] and of the Bruininks-Oseretsky
Motor Proficiency Test were applied [2]. After establishing a baseline,
a 3-month PMT Programme was designed for participants with ID,
focused on balance, global/fine motor skills, economic/vocational
activities and academic/verbal skills. A Kruskall-Wallis test compar-
ing pre-, post- and retention test scores of all groups was com-
puted and to compare intra-groups differences a Wilcoxon test
was performed.
Results showed statistically significant differences between groups
with and without ID, with the latter presenting higher scores after
the PMT program. Assessments showed great
improvements in
motor and adaptive skills, by the participants with ID.
Findings may indicate that PMT could strengthen and improve the
areas assessed, although these findings should be interpreted with
caution, due to the reduced sample.

Background
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, often disabling disease of the
central nervous system. Disability in MS is related with decline in
general functioning (e.g., mobility, gait, balance). The exercise therapy
is known to reduce the rate of functional decline in other diseases;
its effect in the treatment of MS remains relatively unex-
however,
plored. Objective: To determine the effect of exercise therapy in MS.
Methods
One patient with MS was included in a 6-week exercise program (2
sessions/week: progressive muscle strength, balance and aerobic ex-
ercises) conducted by a physiotherapist. Anthropometric (height;
weight) and sociodemographic (age; gender) data, stage of disease
(Abbreviated Expanded Disability status scale - AED) and functional
tests (5-meter walking test at comfortable speed– 5mWT; Functional
Reach test - FRT; 5 times sit-to-stand test – 5STS) were collected at
the beginning (T0) and at the end (T1) of the exercise program. Aver-
ages of two trials for each functional test were compared between
T0 and T1 and the remaining functional impairment was calculated
as a percentage of normative aged adjusted values (%).
Results
A female (52 years; 48 kg; 1.59 m) in a stage 4 of AED scale (ambulatory
without aid 12 h) participated in this study. From T0 to T1 the participant
increased the performance in: 5mWT (0.51 m/s ± 0.08 vs 0.64 m/s ± 0.01;
36.69 % vs 46.04 %); FRT (20.5 cm ± 2.12 vs 25 cm ± 0.71; 47.99 % vs
58.53 %); 5STS (19.45 s ±1.62 vs 16.55 s ± 2.47; 36.5 % vs 42.9 %).
Conclusions
The exercise therapy improved general functioning in one patient
with MS, getting functional scores close to/above 50 % of the ex-
pected value.

Background
In people with fall risk, the perceived inefficiency in dealing with falls
contributes greatly to restrictions in movement and therefore might
interfere with physical condition. However, this relationship has been
relatively unexplored. Objective: To explore the association between
physical condition and self-efficacy in people with fall risk.
Methods
People older than 50 years old with moderate fall risk (Morse scale)
were included in a fall prevention exercise programme. Age, gender
and Body Mass Index (BMI) were collected. At the end of the

BMC Health Services Research 2016, Volume 16 Suppl 3

Page 55 of 132

programme, self-efficacy (SE) was assessed, the physical condition
was characterized (% of normative aged adjusted values - % N) and
correlations between them were explored (Spearman test, p < 0.05).
Four questions (scoring: 0-not confident – 2-very confident) were
used to assess self-efficacy in: moving indoors; moving outside; walk-
ing on uneven surfaces; and participating in physical activities. Phys-
ical condition was assessed considering:
(I) mobility (5 metres
walking test at comfortable speed – 5mWT), (II) balance (Functional
Reach Test – FRT) and (III) endurance (Sit-to-stand test – STS) tests.
Results
Six females and one male (66.43 ± 11.70 years; 42.56 ± 4.24 kg/m2)
were included. At the end of the programme patients presented: bet-
ter self-efficacy in moving indoors (1.33 ± 0.81) and in participation in
physical activities (1.17 ± 0.75) items; walking speed at 0.66 ± 0.17 m/s
(51.10%N); 23.78 ± 4.65 cm in FRT (66.07%N); 14.70 ± 2.04 sec in STS
(58.97%N). Correlations were only significant between the STS results
and the total SE score (r = 0.87; p = 0.01).
Conclusions
High endurance capacity seems to be determinant for the improve-
ment of self-efficacy in people with fall risk.

Background
This paper intends to assess the effectiveness of shock waves in im-
proving shoulder calcifying tendinitis symptoms.
Methods
The sample consisted of 6 patients diagnosed with calcific tendinitis
of the shoulder, aged between 38 and 70 years of age (55.00 ±
12.93 years), 4 (66.7 %) females. The shoulder’s range of motion (with
goniometer), muscle strength (Muscle Testing), pain (Numerical Pain
Scale) and shoulder functionality (Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder
and Hand (DASH) scale) were evaluated. Five shock wave sessions
were conducted.
Results
The start and end values of the motion range were: flexion – 156.67
± 8.16 and 169.17 ± 5.84 (p = 0.020); extension – 31.67 ± 2.58 and
57.50 ± 42.98 (p = 0.026); abduction – 141.67 ± 28.57 and 160.00 ±
20.00 (p = 0.012); internal rotation – 44.17 ± 10.21 and 65.00 ± 5.48
(p = 0.001); external rotation – 73.33 ± 12.11 and 82.50 ± 12.55 (p =
0.020); horizontal adduction – 65.83 ± 13.57 and 80.00 ± 10.95 (p = 0.03)
and horizontal abduction – 29.17 ± 8.01 and 37.50 ± 4.18 (p = 0.105). As
regards the Muscle Testing, the initial value was 3.00 ± 0.00 and the
final value was 3.83 ± 0.41 (p = 0.025) for all movements. The initial and
final values of pain evaluations were, respectively: 6.67 ± 0.82 and
3.17 ± 1.17 (p < 0.001). The initial and final values of DASH were
49.31 ± 15.24 and 20.00 ± 10.13 (p = 0.005).
Conclusions
It was found that shock wave therapy improved symptoms in calcific
tendonitis patients.

This work had as its main objective the construction and pilot testing
of a preventive and universal parenting programme with ten sessions
designated as - Pacifier - for implementation in primary health care,
with parents of children aged 0 to 6 months based on a home-visiting
format.
Conceptual foundation and design was based on literature review
and evidence-based practices related to positive parenting and par-
ental education programmes. In order to explore its applicability and
impact we used a qualitative approach based on multiple case stud-
ies. Four mothers and two fathers – two couples and two mothers –
living in the Castelo de Vide region agreed to participate.
These four families showed great satisfaction with the programme
and would recommend it to other families. Parents’ sense of compe-
tence also shows improvements for most parents. This intervention
seems to have good potential for increasing parents’ level of infor-
mation and awareness about child development.
It needs further
analysis and could be an interesting instrument for improving par-
ents’ knowledge and competence in primary health care.

Imagery is a cognitive process that can play an important role on plan-
ning and executing different movements or actions. The main purpose
of this study was to ascertain whether the application of Motor Imagery
together with normal practice improved fine motor skills in disabled
individuals.
Forty-two (42) subjects with disabilities participated in this study,
with a mean age of 37.0 (SD = 12.0), and of both genders. Subjects
were randomly divided in two groups: a control group and an experi-
mental one. The study procedures were applied on five different
tasks of the Psychomotor Battery of fine motor skills (BPM). This in-
strument was applied on two stages, at the beginning of the study
(pre-test) and at the end of 4 weeks (post-test). Both groups per-
formed the tasks twice a week for a month.

BMC Health Services Research 2016, Volume 16 Suppl 3

Page 56 of 132

Motor imagery sessions were added on in the experimental group.
Participants on the experimental group were asked to mentally im-
agine themselves recreating tasks they had performed earlier on the
initial assessment. For the analysis of the results, descriptive and in-
ferential statistics were used. The T-test for independent samples,
and the T-test for paired samples were applied.
The results show a significant difference in all 5 tasks performed by
the experimental group (p ≤ 0.05) thereby, the subjects in this group
improved their fine motor skills. The control group however, just had
statistical differences in two tasks. These results, shows that motor
imagery, when used together with physical repetition of the move-
ment imagined, can improve fine motor skills in disabled individuals.

Background
Falls are the main reason for the high mortality and morbidity rate
among older people, and are the main cause of immobility and au-
tonomy loss. Walking programmes are a positive way of preventing
falls on apparently healthy elders. Objective: The objective of this
study was to analyse the effects of a walking programme on the fall
risk factors of older people, namely, the strength, balance and agility.
Methods
Five elders (63 and 83 years old) integrated an experimental group
that participated in a weekly walking activity supervised by an exer-
cise specialist for a sixty minutes’ period, throughout a nine months’
period. The evaluations took place in three moments, consisting of
functional fitness and physical activity tests.
Results
Results showed an increase in the vigorous activity score, walking
score, movement score and standing position score between the first
and the second moment of evaluation. There was as also a signifi-
cant decrease in the sitting position score, which confirmed the de-
crease in the sedentary behaviour of the participants. The pedometer
showed us a significant increase of steps, between the two moments,
and the variable related to walking, indicated positive average results
in the longitudinal evaluation (0.026 ≤ 0.05).
Conclusions
The walking programme induced positive results in some of the fall
risk factors in the older people, such as physical activity and cardiore-
spiratory fitness, therefore we believe that the quality of life of the
participants was improved. Finally, the observed decreased in seden-
tary behaviour can be an important message for interventions with
walking activity.

Interventions related to health education enable the
accomplishment and better control of wellness. Objective: Diagnose
the lifestyles and implement nursing interventions promoting healthy
behaviours.
Methods
An action-research perspective developed a descriptive study
(2012),
in a middle school of Madeira Island (n = 270), utilizing a
questionnaire adapted from the “Health behaviour in school-aged
children" from WHO (α = 0.72). After prioritization of areas, the nurs-
ing intervention programme integrated education sessions; a fair
and website with educational and interactive contents about phys-
ical exercise; nutrition; oral hygiene habits and knowledge of psy-
choactive substances.
In 2014 we evaluated the effectiveness of
intervention.
Results
There was a positive variation in percentage changes for healthier
behaviours specifically: realization of 5 or more daily meals (22.7 %);
water intake several times/day (75.4 %); brushing teeth after a meal
(1.6 %); use of dental floss (23.0 %); playing sport outside school
hours, 4 to 6 x week (6.5 %) and 2 to 3 x week (3.6 %) and a de-
crease of 4.6 % in respect of viewing TV 5 or more hours/day. There
was also a significant percentage increase in knowledge about psy-
choactive substances (56.0 %).
Conclusions
The results express the importance and contribution of the project to
significant gains in knowledge and some healthy behaviours being
necessary to prolong the intervention period to increase other be-
haviour modifications and to extend to similar populations.

Background
A person submitted to hip replacement, following hospital discharge
to his home, faces some difficulties related to the ability to do daily
activities, mobility and balance. Objectives: Evaluate the dependency
level in daily activities; mobility and balance grade; quality of life per-
ception and the effect of the rehabilitation programme.

Methods
A quasi-experimental study, with evaluations before/after programme
implementation, during one month. Thirty participants. Data collec-
tion tools: sociodemographic/clinical questionnaire; Barthel

Tinetti Test; WHOQOL-bref.
Results
The participants have a similar distribution regarding the sex vari-
able; the average age was 69.67 years and the BMI was above the
normal level on most cases. The dependency level was higher for the
following activities: having a shower; getting dressed; using the stairs
and moving to a bed/chair; lower mobility and quality of life per-
ception levels before the rehabilitation programme implementation.
After the implementation, there was significant evidence that the
functional independency level for all the daily activities, mobility and
balance and quality of life perception increased.
Conclusions
After the programme’s implementation most of the participants were
independent in their daily activities; they had a positive evolution
concerning balance and mobility and they had a positive perception

Population aging is one of the greatest contemporary public health chal-
lenges. With the change of demographic and population profile, effect-
ive therapies should be evaluated to provide better monitoring and
modulation of therapeutic approaches aiming to minimize the effects of
degenerative diseases.
This article studies the effects of melatonin in neurodegenerative dis-
ease and new possibilities for professional performance. It is a de-
scriptive study, based on a literature review, using a qualitative
approach and of an exploratory character. The literature review was
based on the inclusion criteria: articles related to the subject, pub-
lished between 2004 and 2014, containing the descriptors: mela-
tonin, neurodegenerative diseases, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. We
opted for the content analysis technique for data analysis.
The study showed the effectiveness of the use of melatonin in the
treatment of neurodegenerative diseases and its capacity to minimize
the neurological effects of Alzheimer's and Parkinson’s. Melatonin is
able to interact with nuclear receptors, exerting direct genomic action,
by altering the expression of apoptotic genes and thereby inhibiting
cell death. It has further potential neuroprotective activity, with findings
suggesting the effectiveness of this therapy.
The cellular and molecular mechanisms for this activity remain poorly
understood. Melatonin administration within this new professional
approach seems a viable practice to minimize the aggressiveness of

Background
Alcoholism and alcohol abuse represent a worldwide problem, asso-
ciated with considerable morbidity and mortality. A number of medi-
cinal plants are reported to have preventive and therapeutic effects
on alcoholism and alcohol abuse. The present review summarizes
the most common natural substances used in alcohol use disorders.
Methods
All relevant literature databases were searched up to March 2015.
The search terms were 'alcohol abuse', 'alcoholism', 'herbal medicine',
'phytomedicine'. Human, animal studies and re-
'natural products',
views were included.
Results
Recently, some plants drew the attention of researchers, namely,
danshen (Salvia miltiorrhiza Bge.), ginseng (Panax ginseng C.A. Mey.),
ibogaine (Tabernanthe iboga Baill.), kudzu [Pueraria lobata (Willd.)
Ohwi], and St. John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum L.). Reduction of
alcohol absorption appears to be a common feature among most of
the cited plants. A standardized formulation of kudzu produced
minimal side effects, and resulted in a modest reduction in alcohol
consumption in young non-treatment-seeking heavy drinkers. Hy-
pericum extract also reduced voluntary alcohol intake to a signifi-
cant degree in rat models. Danshen has no efficacy data, but can
reduce alcohol
intake in animal models. Other plants like Banis-
teriopsis caapi (Spruce ex Griseb.) Morton, Lophophora williamsii
(Lem. ex Salm-Dyck) J.M. Coult., and Thymus vulgaris L. are also
suggested to have beneficial effects in alcohol use disorders. Car-
nosine, a natural dipeptide, seems to be a promising compound
for the therapy of alcoholism.
Conclusions
Data suggest that some plants and other natural substances may
constitute novel and effective approaches for treatment of alcohol
use disorders.

Background
Given the high prevalence of diabetes in the population and in the
it’s crucial to raise awareness of the need for people to
elderly,
change their eating habits and adopt healthier lifestyles. Nutrition inter-
ventions emphasizing the promotion of healthy eating have been
shown to be an important point in Diabetes Mellitus treatment since it
fosters a better glycaemic control. Objectives: To determine the effect-
iveness of the implementation of a dietary programme in the amounts
of glucose and the lipid profile in patients with Diabetes mellitus.
Methods
A systematic review of the literature published in 2015 in PubMed/
Medline database.
It is intended to answer the research question:
"What is the effectiveness of implementing a dietary programme on
the blood glucose values and on the lipid profile of Diabetes Mellitus
elderly subjects?" After applying the inclusion criteria 6 articles were
selected from a total of 622.
Results
The implementation of a programme based on a higher dietary in-
take of polyunsaturated fatty acids, caloric restriction and intake of
probiotics significantly improves glycaemic levels as well as the lipid
profile in patients with Diabetes Mellitus.
Conclusions
It was found that the implementation of dietary programmes that
aimed for a healthy and balanced diet are fundamental pillars in the
treatment of diabetes mellitus, and its implementation should be
fostered.

Background
The increasing prevalence of knee osteoarthritis has become a world-
wide concern. Furthermore, the articular cartilage lesions, due to lack
of self-repair, represent a clinical challenge yet to overcome. In this
sense, several biological approaches have emerged as an alternative
treatment. Objective: Summarize the current scientific literature in
which concerns the autologous platelet-rich plasma (PRP) and hyalur-
onic acid (HA) effectiveness in the clinical, radiological and functional
outcomes in patients with knee osteoarthritis.
Methods
A comprehensive literature review was made to search for level I and
II human studies that assessed that assessed the clinical, radiological
or functional effectiveness of PRP or HA intra-articular injections on
the knee osteoarthritis. The search was made from 2005 to 2015 and
the databases used were: PubMed, Cochrane Library, Scopus, CINAHL
and SPORTDiscus.
Results
Overall, the most of the studies reported that the autologous PRP
intra-articular injections provided better results when compared to
the HA intra-articular injections. Both biological approaches showed
superior results when compared to placebo. However, when compared

to each other, the autologous PRP showed better results concerning
the reduction of pain and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medication
intake, improving the quality of life and the knee functionality. Both
biological approaches showed to be safe, without significant side
effects.
Conclusions
These presented biological approaches showed to be safe and effect-
ive in reducing the symptomatology and increasing the quality of life
in patients with knee osteoarthritis. Hence, it is suggested the imple-
mentation of intra-articular injections of autologous PRP and HA in
the current clinical practice.

Background
The burden associated with ankle osteoarthritis has been increasing
in the elderly community. Several biological therapies have been
suggested as an effective treatment to this pathological condition.
Objectives: This study’s aim was to assess the effectiveness of autolo-
gous platelet-rich plasma (PRP) and hyaluronic acid (HA) intra-articular
injections in patients with ankle osteoarthritis.
Methods
A computerized database search from 2005 to 2015 was carried out
on PubMed, Cochrane Library, Scopus, CINAHL and SPORTDiscus da-
tabases. It included human studies that assessed the effectiveness of
autologous PRP or HA intra-articular injections in patients with ankle
osteoarthritis. The exclusion criteria were as follows: reviews and
meta-analyses; clinical commentaries or technical notes; single study
cases; animal studies. The reference lists of the most relevant papers
were screened for additional studies.
Results
Both therapies were shown to be safe and effective in reducing pain
and improving clinical and functional outcomes when compared to
control or placebo groups. There was a slight superiority of the
autologous PRP intra-articular injections over HA, regarding pain re-
duction and improving ankle functionality. Several methodological
limitations across the literature were pointed out, such as: different
timing, concertation and preparation modes of the injections; differ-
ent outcome scores used; different follow-up timings; lack of control
groups or randomized allocation.
Conclusions
Autologous PRP and HA injections showed promising results in
patients with ankle osteoarthritis. High evidence level studies
(randomized controlled trials) are needed to assess clinical super-
iority between PRP and HA intra-articular injections to treat ankle
osteoarthritis.

Background
Diabetes Mellitus is a chronic disease with repercussions at a global
level. The diabetic foot ulcer is one of the major complications of the
diabetic foot, and that with bigger
repercussions on a social-
economic level. The action of nursing along with the multidisciplin-
ary team is essential to obtain health gains. Objective: Analyse the
impact of primary prevention measures in diabetic foot ulcer inci-
dence in patients with Diabetes Mellitus.
Methods
This study is a systematic literature review, which follows the Cochrane
method, reviewing articles published 2004-2014.
Results
There were three randomized studies, one non randomized study
and three cross quantitative studies included. They highlighted foot
self-care and health education as a practice of primary prevention of
the diabetic foot ulcer. The method of temperature evaluation is a
simple procedure with extreme importance. Although nurses guide
their patients for prevention, there are still non-studied subjects. It is
fundamental to evaluate all strategies of health education, as well as
the nursing records. The patient and family should be trained to self-
care and for the surveillance of the lower limbs.
Conclusions
There are biopsychosocial factors affecting the incidence of diabetic
foot ulcers in patients. The knowledge acquired by the patients does
not always translate into the practice of self-care. Nursing records are
key to ensuring the continuity of care.

Violence is a complex phenomenon and the adoption of acceptable be-
haviours or not is influenced by culture and society, therefore, an early
intervention is extremely important. This study is a quantitative, longitu-
dinal and quasi-experimental, pre-test and post-test type, without con-
trol group. We aimed at: I) evaluating the knowledge that students have
about dating violence; II) evaluating existing conflicts in dating relation-
ships between young adolescents; and III) evaluating the effectiveness
of intervention by peers using the theatre of the oppressed in know-
ledge about dating violence.
In the first moment (M1), a research protocol was applied composed
by: Group I - Conflict in Adolescent Dating Relationships Inventory
(CADRI) [1] and Group II - Knowledge about violence in dating rela-
tionships. Group II was evaluated in the second moment (M2). A
non-probabilistic convenience sample consisted of 49 students, 17

females and 32 males, aged between 14 and 21 years old. Generally,
students do not have affective-sexual relations ruled by violence, ei-
ther as victim or as a perpetrator.
The level of knowledge about dating violence increased after the
completion of the intervention by the oppressed theatre (M1 = 32.8,
SD = 6.1 and M2 = 37.1, SD = 6.1) and there are statistically significant
differences, proving the effectiveness of it (t = 4.265, p < 0.005). The
study results highlight the relevance of this intervention and the im-
portance of becoming aware of the phenomenon of dating violence.

Regular physical activity has a positive impact on cognition and brain
function. Recent studies have shown that even a single bout of aerobic
exercise can improve memory and declarative learning. The main pur-
pose of this study was to investigate if a six-month period of physical
exercise could improve motor memory consolidation in elderly people
in pedal dexterity. 34 subjects of both genders, with a mean age of
71 years old participated in the study. Subjects were divided in two
groups: a control group and an experimental one. Before the interven-
tion of the physical exercise programme, subjects performed a Tapping
Pedal Test to measure baseline performance. After the intervention, the
assessment of the impact of exercise on motor memory consolidation
was held in three stages: Training, 1 hour after training and 24 hours
after training. For the analysis of the results, descriptive and inferential
statistics were used. The Shapiro-Wilk test was applied to the normality
distribution of data and one-way ANOVA test for parametric statistics.
When compared with the control group, results showed better perform-
ance in motor memory consolidation 1 hour and 24 hours after training
in the experimental group. Nevertheless, these differences were not sig-
nificant (p ≥ 0.05). It seems therefore that the regular physical exercise
does not significantly improve motor memory consolidation capacity in
pedal dexterity of elderly people.

Background
Whole body vibration exercises consist in performing exercise on a
platform which transmits mechanical stimuli (vibration) to the anatomic
area in contact with the platform and which propagate throughout the
body. Objective: The aim of the present study is to analyse the electro-
myographic response of the thigh muscles exposed to different vibra-
tional frequencies, when compared to a non-vibration condition.
Methods
Eight male participants (mean age 24.13 ± 1.55) were randomly ex-
posed to two synchronous vibration frequencies (25 Hz and 50 Hz)
and a non-vibration control procedure during squatting, while moni-
tored with surface EMG.
Results
For the dominant and non-dominant semitendinosus muscles there
is significant increase in muscle activity at 50 Hz exposure. For the
dominant biceps femoris muscle, the myoelectric activity significantly
increased during both 25 and 50 Hz conditions, when compared to
control. There was no statistically significant influence of vibration on
vastus medialis oblique and vastus lateralis muscle activity, both for
dominant and non-dominant sites and for the non-dominant biceps
femoris muscle.
Conclusions
Exposure to vibration has no influence on quadriceps muscles (both
vastus medialis and lateralis) and the non-dominant biceps femoris
muscles. However, increase in hamstring activity was found for the
dominant side and for the semitendinosus muscle of the non-
dominant side. The primary finding in this investigation is that iso-
metric squatting in a vibrational condition did not change agonist
muscle activity, but had some degree of change in antagonist or syn-
ergist muscle activity.

Background
Work can contribute to positive mental health, providing financial
support, a life goal and a feeling of usefulness, or for its deterior-
ation, due to poor work conditions. This means that work, which
mostly involves stressful tasks, can cause mental health disturbance
or worsen pre-existent mental health diseases. There are various pol-
icies and entities that argue the need for mental health promotion
programmes, which empower people to deal with work distress and
improve workplace conditions. Objective: To identify effective work-
place mental health promotion interventions.
Methods
This systematic review was performed according to the Joanna
Briggs Institute orientations, using the main descriptors “mental
health”, “mental health promotion”, “occupational health”, “employee
health” and “workplace”, at the MEDLINE, CINAHL and Cochrane da-
tabases. Only publications between February of 2009 and February of
2014 were considered. After meeting inclusion and exclusion criteria, six
articles were selected and a narrative synthesis of the data was made.
Results
All the effective interventions performed were developed in a group
setting, using a range of psychotherapeutic and psychoeducational
techniques (mainly cognitive-behaviour therapy, stress management
techniques, coping strategies and problem resolution techniques).

None of the interventions were developed considering the em-
ployees’ exposure of their own needs, and some studies emphasized
possible constraints when considering different settings.
Conclusions
Evidence shows that there are effective workplace interventions to
promote mental health; however, there’s a gap in considering the
real employee needs in their development. It’s necessary to develop
personalized interventions to promote mental health based on em-
ployees’ opinions and their own needs.

‘Elderly OR Older adults’,

Background
The perception of body image in older people seems to be carried in
a special way. However, the aspects linked to 'physical and func-
tional' health and the psychological well-being associated with men-
tal health seem to be more preponderant. Objective: This systematic
review aims at reporting the effectiveness of participation in exercise
programmes on the self-perception of body image in elderly women.
Methods
A systematic literature search of qualitative research (QR) studies was
conducted using main electronic database and specialized sources
such PubMed, SciELO, SPORTDiscus and PsycoINFO, articles pub-
lished between 2006 and 2016. The following were used as descrip-
‘Physical
tors in the English language:
activity or Motor activity’ or Physical Exercise, ‘Body Image’, ‘Qualita-
tive research OR Qualitative study OR Qualitative’. PRISMA and TREND
statement positioning were used to obtain and assess the quality of in-
formation. From the 58 articles found, 6 were included because they
fulfilled the inclusion criteria. An inductive content analysis was per-
formed on the extracted findings to identify emerging elements on the
self-perception of body image in elderly women.
Results
Three themes related to the self-perception of body image in elderly
women emerged: empowerment, social contacts, self-esteem.
Conclusions
Adherence to exercise programmes seem to be effective for a positive
self-perception of body image assessment in the elderly. Findings
showed that qualitative research can provide in-depth information
about the elements that influence the assessment of body image of in
older women. Multidisciplinary mixed-methods studies are recom-
mended to establish quantitative relationships complemented with in-
depth qualitative information.

Background
Aging involves changes in psychomotor performance such as bal-
ance and fine/gross motor skills. Few studies are focused on psycho-
motor skills among the elderly population due to the absence of
valid psychomotor instruments. Objective: This paper aims to de-
scribe the translation and validation procedures of the Portuguese
version of Éxamen Geronto-Psychomoteur (P-EGP), [1].
Methods
The P-EGP was applied to 497 participants, with and without dementia,
according with original guidelines: all applicants were psychomotor ther-
apists specifically trained for P-EGP administration. Socio-demographic
data were collected between January 2013 and September 2014.
Results
Results demonstrated excellent internal consistency (α > .90) and
total P-EGP score (α = .92) was superior to the original (α = .83). Stabil-
ity coefficients (test-retest), were above .60, showing strong stability.
Factor analysis revealed three main component structures (physical
constraints, motor and cognitive prevalence) accounting for 48 % of
the overall variance. All domains were strongly correlated. P-EGP dif-
ferentiated between people with and without dementia across the
different domains, except on Joint Mobilization of Upper and Lower
Limbs. Participants’ psychomotor profiles are presented, focusing on
the skills most influenced by the dementia process and which may
be the goal of psychomotor therapy.
Conclusions
The P-EGP demonstrated adequate scores of reliability and validity. It
was necessary to make specific changes in some items to clarify in-
structions and adapt it to the Portuguese context. P-EGP domains
are highly correlated, which reinforces the “psychomotor construct”
and sensitivity to the presence of dementia. Further research should
be conducted on this area. Practical recommendations will be given.

Depression is one of the most common mental disorders affecting
the quality of life of individuals. Due to their specificity, the elderly
population is particularly vulnerable. The aim of this communication
is to assess the prevalence of depressive symptoms in the elderly
population of three southern European countries: Portugal (PT) Spain
(ES) and Italy (IT).
In the present study we use a shorter version of the test from the
Centre for Epidemiologic Studies - Depression Scale (CES-D8), using
data from the elderly Portuguese, Spanish and Italian samples from
the sixth round of the European Social Survey: PT (N. = 647); ES (N. =
371); IT (N. = 188).
The CES-D8 is a scale aimed at evaluating the frequency of depres-
sive symptoms experienced during the week preceding interview
and consists of eight items measured on a Likert scale with ranging
from 0 to 3 points.
The analysis focused on two indicators drawn from the scale: I) num-
ber of “high depressive symptoms” accounted for in situations where

5 or more symptoms on the survey manifested “all or almost all of
the time” during the week before the interview; II) scale score, deter-
mined by the sum of the results in each of the responses, varying be-
tween 0 and 24.
Results reveal a relatively high percentage of the elderly population
with “high depressive symptoms” (PT = 2.2 %; ES = 3.4 %; IT = 4.4 %).
The average values of the scores obtained in CES-D8 were the fol-
lowing: PT (M = 7.66; SD = 4.69) ES (M = 7.28; SD = 5.07) IT (M = 7.37;
SD = 5.16). The observed differences are not statistically significant F
(2, 2374) = 0.509; p = 0.601).

Background
Deliberate self-harm (DSH) is a serious public health problem due to
its high prevalence during adolescence and its link to psychological
impairments. Despite the theoretical emphasis on the role of emo-
tion dysregulation in DSH, few studies have analysed this relationship
among a community sample of adolescents. Objective: The current
study aims to compare adolescents with and without DSH in emo-
tion regulation processes and psychopathological symptoms, and to
examine the contribution of maladaptive emotion regulation pro-
cesses to predict DSH.
Methods
The sample consists of 180 adolescents with DSH and 180 adoles-
cents without a history of DSH. The total sample is aged between
12 and 18 years old (M = 14.98, SD = 1.77) and was recruited in
middle and secondary schools (mean of years of education = 9.54,
SD = 1.63).
Results
A one-way ANOVA showed that adolescents with DSH reported
higher levels of maladaptive emotion regulation processes, such as
dissociation,
rumination, experiential avoidance and self-criticism
than adolescents without DSH. Adolescents with DSH also experience
higher levels of depression, anxiety and stress symptoms than ado-
lescents without DSH. Results from logistic regression analyses
showed that the full model accounted for between 26 % and 35 %
of DSH. The best predictors of DSH are depressive symptoms, being
female and the most severe form of self-criticism (self-hate). When
this form of self-criticism was not included in the equation analysis,
other risk emotional factors for DSH emerged, namely dissociation
and lower levels of self-compassion.
Conclusions
These findings unveil the emotional risk factors for DSH in adolescence.

Background
Hansen’s disease is a curable nosologic entity caused by Mycobac-
terium Leprae with a predilection for the peripheral nervous system
which is associated with incapacities, with higher prevalence among
men. Given that it is an infectious-contagious disease, the following
are useful strategies for diminishing its sequels: early diagnosis,
monitoring patients and household contacts, promoting educational
campaigns. Objective: To assess the degree of disability in people
with Hansen’s disease.
Methods
An observational study conducted in 104 Brazilians diagnosed with
Hansen’s disease. Most were male (60.6 %) with an average age of
37 years, dark-skinned (49.0 %) and had completed basic education
(34.6 %). Data collection was authorized and supported in the Notifi-
able Diseases Information System.
Results
The operational and clinical classification of Hansen’s disease re-
vealed that 47.1 % were paucibacillary and 52.9 % were multibacil-
lary. 32.0 % were diagnosed with the borderline type and 26.0 %
with the tuberculoid type. At the time of the diagnosis 25.0 % had
a physical disability. The level of physical disability (LPD) was the
following: Level 0 - 73 (70.19 %);
I - 17 (16.35 %) and 9
II deformities. LPD was not registered in 5
(8.65 %) had level
cases.
Conclusions
Physical disability associated with Hansen’s disease is significant and
a public health problem in Brazil. Thus,
it is urgent to implement
measures for the eradication of this endemic disease and for the
control of its sequels.

Background
Diabetes mellitus (DM) is one of the most prevalent chronic diseases,
being responsible for high rates of morbidity and mortality.
In
Portugal its prevalence is about 12.7 %. Quality of life (Qol) can be in-
fluenced by the individual physical and mental health, social environ-
ment and personal beliefs. Self-esteem is related to the sense of
personal value or self-worth and may be a relevant aspect of coping
with chronic disease. Objectives: To explore the existence of differ-
ences between type 1 and type 2 diabetes patients regarding Qol
and self-esteem. Gender differences in these two groups of patients
were also investigated.
Methods
Participants were 333 with a DM diagnosis for over a year who com-
pleted World Health Organization Quality of Life (WHOQOL-Bref) and
the Rosenberg Self-Esteem (RSE]. The study had a cross-sectional design.
Results
Patients with type 1 DM show significant higher scores in all Qol di-
mensions as well as in self-esteem (p < 0.05) when compared to type
2 DM patients. Concerning gender differences type 1 male patients

and type 1 female patients do not differ. When considering type 2
DM, men score significantly higher than women in self-esteem (p =
0.002) and in general Qol (p = 0.036), physical (p = 0.008), psycho-
logical (p < 0.001) and environment (p = 0.001) dimensions.
Conclusions
Independently of being male or female type 1 DM patients show
better Qol and higher self-esteem. Regarding type 2 DM it seems im-
portant to integrate Qol and self-esteem in the overall treatment ap-
proach, particularly with women.

Background
Motor coordination is an important predictor of physical activity and
health in childhood. However, childhood competence levels in many
countries are lower than desired. Due to the many different motor
skill instruments in use, children’s motor coordination across coun-
tries is rarely compared. Objective: This study aimed to examine the
gross motor coordination of children from Brazil and Portugal.
Methods
The cross-sectional sample included 121 boys (61 from Brazil) aged
8 years old from schools in Brazil and Portugal. The subjects com-
pleted morphological measurements. Motor coordination was evalu-
ated using a 4-item battery (Körperkoordinationstest für Kinder-KTK):
walking backward on balance beams (WB), moving sideways on
boxes (MS), jumping sideways across a wooden slat (JS), and hop-
ping for height on one leg (HH). The percentage of predicted mature
stature was used to assess the somatic maturation. MANOVA and
MANCOVA (with waist circumference as covariate) were used to
examine the independent effect of country on morphological vari-
ables, somatic maturation and KTK items. Significance level was set
at 5 % for all inferential statistics.
Results
Our results showed a significant country effect (Wilks’λ = 0.547; F =
23.993; p < 0.05) and suggested that Portuguese boys attained better
performance compared to Brazilian boys in JS and HH. The current
results suggested that they are country-related and not substantially
explained by biological maturation.
Conclusions
The low levels reported by Brazilian boys in JS and HH may be the
result of maturity status and cultural differences in physical activity
contexts such as physical education and sports participation.

Background
In the second half of the 20th century,
life expectancy of African
people was considerably lower than Caucasians, identifying the need
to study the differences between racial and ethnic groups so that
health measures can be taken. Objective: To verify if there are electro-
cardiographic differences between African and Caucasian individuals.
Methods
The sample includes a total of 122 individuals, collected between Oc-
tober 2011 and January 2012. All the individuals answered a personal
questionnaire and did a conventional 12-lead electrocardiogram. The
study included individuals from both races and genders, with a sed-
entary life style, without alcoholic habits, non-smokers, non-obese,
with similar sociodemographic conditions, with no kind of disease as-
sociated, with ages between 19 and 35 years, and who had agreed
to take part in the study by signing an informed agreement.
Results
With this study, we were able to confirm that individuals of African
race have more prevalence of negative T waves and/or biphasic in
V1 (p < 0.001), V2 (p = 0.014) and V3 (p = 0.043), higher prevalence of
ST-segment elevation in V1 (p < 0.001), V2 (p = 0.001), V3 (p = 0.010)
and V4 (p = 0.027), a higher dispersion of QT interval (p = 0.001) and
left ventricular hypertrophy (Sokolow-Lyon
higher prevalence of
index – p < 0.001).
Conclusions
Although we found statistical differences in the average values and
in the prevalence, we did not actually verify electrocardiographic dif-
ferences between the racial groups. In spite of all the study results,
we conclude that they have no pathological value, and are therefore
considered as normal variations.

Background
Violence is intentional use of force or power in the form of a threat
or effectively, against oneself, another person, group or community,
which leads to or is most likely to result in injury, death, psycho-
logical harm or developmental disorders. Brazil displays an increased
tendency of the notifications in all kinds of violence. Objective: Ana-
lyse the factors related to types of violence notified in the city of Pal-
hoça, Brazil, during the period 2010-2015.
Methods
Cross-sectional study, with analysis of 890 records of notification/per-
sonal investigation of domestic violence, sexual and/or other types of
violence. Data obtained from Notifiable Diseases Information System.
Analyses in SPSS 20.0, Chi-square test with p ≤ 0.05. Approved by the
Research Ethics Committee of University of Southern Santa Catarina
No 1.370.313.
Results
Prevalent in females (53.1 %), older than 18 years (99.7 %), white
(66.2 %), low educational level (38.7 %), single (40.5 %), urban zone
(98.2 %) occurrence in the home (54.0 %), have suffered violence
other times (32.2 %), have disabilities/disorders (13.7 %), pregnant
women (2.7 %). Male aggressor (75.7 %), partner/boyfriend (20.3 %),
alcohol use (24.5 %). Higher incidence of physical violence (83.1 %),
followed by sexual (10.8 %) and psychological (9.4 %) violence. Phys-
ical force as a means of aggression (58.7 %), cut injury/blunt trauma
(58.2 %), self-harm by 19.7 %. Death in 1.4 %. Significant correlation

(p ≤ 0.05) between physical violence with physical/mental disability
and mental illness, suffering violence other times, male sex and alco-
hol abuse.
Conclusions
There was a higher report of physical violence on female adults per-
formed by family members, associated with male aggressors and al-
cohol abuse.

Background
The tinnitus or Tinnitus is the subjective perception of a continuous
noise in the ears or head in the absence of noise to justify it. It af-
fects 25 % of the general population and in most cases is associated
with hearing loss. Objective: To determine the prevalence of tinnitus
in users attending otolaryngology consultations and examine the
sociodemographic characteristics of the study population.
Methods
A descriptive observational, cross-sectional and quantitative study
among users of the Canary Health Service (Spain), who are undergo-
ing a "total audiometry or pure tone" after referral to ENT Hospital
Jose Molina Orosa. Data collection period was from January to April
2015, respecting the right to confidentiality, privacy and freedom, as
well as the voluntary nature of participation.
Results
Of 412 patients who attended the consultation of Otolaryngology, 84
patients with tinnitus were included in the sample. The study deter-
mined that the prevalence is 20.3 %, with a predominance of women
among the group aged 41-60 years. 77.3 % of patients had hearing
loss associated with tinnitus, and, on average, adaptation to symp-
toms in patients was associated with hypertension, depression and
insomnia.
Conclusions
The degree of adaptation of the patient with tinnitus needs an ac-
ceptance of living with it. Health education programmes for the pre-
vention and improved quality of life for people who suffer from this
symptom are recommended.

Background
The national and international

BMC Health Services Research 2016, Volume 16 Suppl 3

Page 64 of 132

significantly, becoming the chronic disease with the highest inci-
dence in children and adolescents in Portugal. Objective: To describe
the difficulties parents experience in the management of therapy
and nutrition, evaluate the difficulties in the management of the dis-
ease of their children, describe the strategies used by parents in the
management of therapy and feeding their children.
Methods
A descriptive exploratory study of qualitative nature was developed,
conducted through semi-structured interviews. An intentional sample
consisting of ten parents was used, followed in endocrinology con-
sultation of the Paediatric Hospital of Coimbra from July to August
2014. Data were analysed using the content analysis technique, ac-
cording to Bardin (2009) [1].
Results
Through the analysis made of the parents’ discourse, five main cat-
egories emerged corresponding to the difficulties experienced in the
therapeutic and nutrition management of their children: nutrition
control and calculation of units of insulin in the day nursery, negative
feelings that the children associated with the illness, negative feel-
ings experienced by parents, complexity of the calculations and,
finally, parents’ opinions and suggestions.
Conclusions
The difficulty of parents in the calculations inherent in this process was
evident. Parents rarely delegate functions associated with therapeutic
and nutrition management to childcare professionals, claiming insecurity
and lack of knowledge. It was also remarkable to experience negative
feelings both by children and by parents associated with the disease.

Background
In the present research literature, e-mental-health is associated with
benefits such as improved access to mental health care including on-
line self-help services and psychotherapy [1]. However, the evidence
base on attitudes towards e-therapies from the users´ perspective is
very limited [2]. Objective: The aim of the study was to explore atti-
tudes towards e-mental health in the general population. A further
goal was to identify the utilisation of publicly available online health
services.
Methods
To measure attitudes towards standardised guided e-therapy, 436
German-speaking persons (M = 29 years, SD = 10.13; 78 % female) com-
pleted a 17-item-questionnaire that contains items on different aspects
of e-therapies, including statements that reflect commonly proposed
benefits and risks. Factor analysis (extraction method: Promax) resulted
i.e. “usefulness (of e-
in a two-dimension-structure of the measure,
therapies)” and “comparability (to face-to-face- therapies)”. The feasibil-
ity of the measure was confirmed by a recent pilot study (n = 1.546).
Besides, online habits regarding health issues were examined.
Results
Attitudes towards guided e-therapies were overall neutral (“useful-
ness”) or tended to be rather pessimistic (“comparability”). The major-
ity of participants reported not having heard of e-therapies before

(57 %), whereas e-counselling was attended by 11 %. Additionally,
57 % reported searching online for health information only rarely or
occasionally. Websites of physicians or psychologists were viewed as
the most trustworthy resources.
Conclusions
Research with the scope on attitudes towards e-mental health is at
an early stage. The results could be biased due to the selective sam-
ple. The further development and validation of measures is strongly
recommended.

Violence against children and adolescents is a serious public health
problem worldwide and health professionals have an important role in
the identification and treatment of cases. This work investigated the per-
ception of health professionals about violence against children and ado-
to propose possibilities for action and the drafting of a
lescents,
pamphlet to be used in the training of these professionals.
The study was developed in Belém-Pará-Brazil in the period 2011 to
2014, from the application of two structured questionnaires with
174 health professionals. The data were analysed via the BioEstat
5.3 programme.
The results pointed out that about 30.00 % of health professionals
never identified child or adolescent victims of violence. Neglect
was perceived by 60.74 % of professionals; however, only 19.05 %
of these reported having it notified. Sexual violence was the least
referred to (24.14 %), but exhibited a higher rate of notification
(50.00 %). Physical violence was notified by 39.47 % of profes-
sionals who identified it, and psychological violence by 34.88 %.
Among the upper level professionals, 50.00 % said they did not
know the means of notification and 86.11 % never used it. The
main doubts described by health professionals were: how to iden-
tify signs and symptoms of violence (48.61 %), the process of noti-
fication of cases (27.77 %) and how to deal with the victims and
the families (25 %).
The results demonstrated the urgent need for a policy of continued
education focused on health professionals, thus ensuring full protec-
tion for children and adolescents. The guide is in the wrap-up phase
and application.

Marital violence may be included in domestic violence (DV), since this is
a type of violence that occurs in an intimate relationship between two
partners or spouses and which, because it happened in an intimate
space, is not easily identifiable. It affects multiple dimensions of health
in all members of a family.

relational and transversal study using a quantitative methodology.
Apart from a sociodemographic questionnaire, we used the Inventory
of Marital Violence (IVC).
Among the 504 men and women respondents in the Algarve region,
statistically significant differences were not found in any of the types
of violence suffered. In terms of incidence of domestic violence in
this sample we found that 49.4 % had experienced psychological vio-
lence, 10.1 % reported having experienced some episode of major
physical violence, 30.8 % reported having experienced minor physical
violence, 42.9 % said they had been abused in the socio-economic
context and 42.9 % had never been a victim of sexual violence.
About 60 % of the participants stated that they had already been vic-
tims of some form of violence. Psychological violence and socio-
economic violence are those with higher values, exceeding 40 % of
respondents. Minor physical violence and sexual violence also had
poor values, having both been reported by more than 30 % of re-
spondents. Major physical violence is the least reported with an ap-
proximate value of 10 % of the participants.

Background
Non-adherence to treatment is a motive of concern by the scientific
community, since it is considered as an important problem of public
health. Approximately 50 % of patients with ischemic heart disease
(IHD) do not get a clinical benefit, due to low adherence to treat-
ment (AT). Objectives: Determine the prevalence of AT and relate the
influence of several clinical factors in AT.
Methods
A cross-sectional study,
involving 254 patients with IHD, attending
follow-up consultation at the hospital. Patients had a mean age of
66.9 ± 11.6 years; 74.0 % were male; 73.2 % were “married”; 69.3 %
had education up to the “4th grade”. We used socio-demographic
and clinic questionnaire and Measure Treatment Adherence.
Results
The prevalence of non-adherence of patients with IHD was 50.4 %.
Patients who adhered more to treatment were those who: I) were di-
agnosed with “acute myocardial infarction with ST elevation” com-
pared to those who had “unstable angina”; II)had the disease “1 year
ago” compared to those who had “4 years ago”; III) had the first epi-
sode of acute coronary syndrome compared to those who relapsed;
IV) had “1 risk factor” compared to those who had “4 and 5 risk
factors”; V) were treated with “primary angioplasty” compared to
those that enjoyed “conservative” treatment; VI) were asymptom-
atic compared to those that reported “limitation or severe limita-
tion to activities”.

Conclusions
The results are consistent with previous studies, confirming the low
prevalence to AT regarding the cardioprotective medication. Some
clinical factors in AT proved to be predictors of adherence.

BMC Health Services Research 2016, 16(Suppl 3):O123

Background
Considering the classic literature on the effects of religiosity on
health, well-being, and risk behaviours, the issue of the influence of
religiosity on optimism has been less studied, especially when con-
trolling for life satisfaction. In states of illness, variables such as opti-
mism and life satisfaction assume an important role. Objectives: To
analyse the role of religiosity in optimism factors (externality vs. in-
ternality) in groups characterized by states of illness or health, con-
trolling for life satisfaction.
Methods
The sample consists of 264 patients with chronic diseases or hospital-
ized due to a given pathology (M = 52.49; SD = 17.69 years old;
64.4 % female), and a comparison group composed of 315 healthy
individuals (M = 40.63; SD = 16.63 years old; 78.8 % female). All partic-
ipants answered the CRSV Questionnaire (2011) composed of several
measures of religiosity, optimism and life satisfaction (with good psy-
chometric properties).
Results
For ill participants, we didn’t find an association between religiosity
and optimism measures when controlling for life satisfaction, both for
externality (β = .02) and internality optimism (β = .00); in these patients,
life satisfaction predicted internality (β = .65) more than externality op-
timism (β = .25). For healthy participants, religiosity predicted life satis-
faction (β = .19) and optimism (β = .16 for externality optimism; β = .14
for internality optimism); both internality (β = .86) and externality opti-
mism (β = .88) were associated with life satisfaction.
Conclusions
Religiosity only influences optimism in healthy individuals. For ill par-
ticipants, optimism was only anchored in life satisfaction, and intern-
ality optimism was promoted more by life satisfaction than optimism
based on external causes. For healthy individuals,
life satisfaction
equally promotes internality and externality optimism.

Background
Diabetes mellitus type 2 is one of the non-communicable diseases with
increasing prevalence, associated with strong physical, emotional and
socio-economic repercussions. Therefore, it requires new integrated ap-
proaches to prevent and combat the disease, based on the evidence
already being produced. Objective: This study aimed at assessing
knowledge, empowerment and quality of life of people with type 2 dia-
betes, being followed in Alto Minho Region of Portugal.
Methods
This correlational descriptive study was conducted on a random sam-
ple of 537 individuals, 277 of them in primary care (clusters of health
care centres, ACES). The questionnaire encompassed a sociodemo-
graphic and clinical characterization part, together with the DES-SF
(empowerment), DKT (knowledge) and EQ-5D (quality of life) scales.
Results
Individuals’ mean age was 64.7 ± 11.7 (ACES) and 62.3 ± 12.9 (hos-
pital). Concerning empowerment and quality of life we found similar
mean scores in both settings 3.7 ± 0.9 and 0.6 ± 0.3 in ACES, and
3.7 ± 0.7 and 0.6 ± 0.3 in hospital. On the other hand, knowledge
was higher in the hospital (66.7 ± 12.4) vs. primary care (59.7 ±
16.3), especially in non-insulin treated individuals. Men followed
in hospital also showed higher empowerment than women al-
though having similar knowledge. The highest knowledge deficits
were related to hypoglycaemia handling, meaning of haemoglo-
bin HbA1C, ketoacidosis signs among the insulin treated, and the
care of the feet. Younger and less educated individuals showed
higher knowledge of quality of life and empowerment.
Conclusions
There is lack of knowledge in fundamental aspects of the disease’s
management, followed by an unrealistic feeling of empowerment,
taking into account the evidence produced. Local intervention strat-
egies should consider these findings.

Background
Hypertension increases the risk of cardiovascular diseases and is
highly prevalent worldwide, reaching more than a quarter of the Por-
tuguese population. Poor antihypertensive therapy adherence has
been identified as the main cause of failure to control hypertension.
Objective: To estimate the prevalence of antihypertensive therapy
adherence and related factors.
Methods
This cross-sectional study was based on a questionnaire, with MAT
scale (measure of adherence to therapy) validated for the Portuguese
population [1], applied to 122 hypertensive patients from Bragança
county,
in northern Portugal. To assess therapy adherence, those
whose average adherence levels were ≥ 5 were called adherent. De-
scriptive statistics were used, correlations were accessed using qui-
square test, with a significance level of 5 %.
Results
The sample consisted mainly of females (59.1 % vs. 40.9 %), aged
between 31 and 92 years old (mean 69.8). The participants show
high antihypertensive therapy adherence level (82.8 %). Only mari-
tal status is related to therapy adherence, with married or widowed
people being those who least adhered to antihypertensive treat-
ment (p = 0.04).

Conclusions
This study shows that a high prevalence of hypertensive patients ad-
hered to the antihypertensive therapy prescribed, the married or
widowed being those who least adhered to treatment.

The literature reports that Body Mass Index (BMI) changes are directly
related to sexual interest. Individuals with overweight and obesity self-
report fewer sexual partners and are less likely to have a romantic rela-
tionship compared to their non-obese counterparts.
The objectives of this work are to know the level of perceived sexual
achievement,
in overweight people with the Binge Eating Scale
(BES) and to study the association between age and the perception
of quality of sex in people with overweight are the objectives of
this work.
An exploratory and quantitative study was developed, based on a
sample of 218 patients of both genders, aged between 18 and
65 years. Data was collected in various hospitals of northern and cen-
tral Portugal with the Sexual Satisfaction Index (SSI) being used for
this purpose.
Of all participants, 64.5 % expressed overweight. On a scale of 0 to
100, the SSI was, on average, 26.7 (SD = 14.6). On average, Individuals
with severe poor scores on the BES registered the highest level of
sexual dissatisfaction. There were, statistically, significant differences
in the SSI, among individuals with and without overweight. Dissatis-
faction is greater the more advanced the age of participants. Con-
trary to what is reported in the literature, there was no difference
between individuals with and without overweight according to the
number of sexual partners.
The results obtained with this research are consistent with the litera-
ture, except for those concerning the number of sexual partners.

Background
Hypertension is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease, while
physical activity is associated with decreased risk of developing
hypertension. Objective: To assess the level of physical activity and
associated factors in hypertensive individuals registered in the Family
Health Strategy in a Basic Health Unit (BHU) in the city of Palhoça,
Santa Catarina, Brazil.
Methods
A transversal study with 134 hypertensive patients in a BHU in the
period of June to November, 2015. The International Physical Activity
Questionnaire (IPAQ) was applied. Analyses were carried out in SPSS
18.0, the averages were compared with the t-test (p ≤ 0.05) and a
95 % confidence interval was established.
It was approved by the
Unisul Research Ethics Committee.
Results
Women (59.8 %), medium age of 64.94 years old (SD 12.7), not work-
ing (78.4 %), smoking (16.4 %), of which 68.2 % smoke more than 20
cigarettes a day. Active in physical activity (42.6 %), irregularly active
(41.5 %) and 6.2 % sedentary. Hypertension lower than 159/99 mmHg
(78.8 %), diabetics (38.8 %), obesity (32.8 %), kidney disease (20.9 %),
heart disease (17.9 %). 76.8 % use up to 2 antihypertensives.
In
smokers, the highest level of physical activity is associated with a
consumption of less than 20 cigarettes a day (p = 0.008).
Conclusions
The hypertensives accompanied by the Family Health Strategy in the
City of Palhoça, Brazil, perform regular physical activity, maintain low
blood pressure and use up to two antihypertensive drugs. Smokers with
a consumption of more than 20 cigarettes a day are more sedentary.

Exercise is an important way of promoting health and quality of life of
the elderly, retarding functional decline associated with aging which
tends to be related to a more positive health perception. This study
aimed to examine how some functionality indicators are associated with
perception of health of the elderly living in rural areas involved in a mu-
nicipal programme.
The sample was composed by two hundred and seventy-nine (279)
subjects (237 females and 42 males, 72.0 ± 7.6 years; 28.8 ± 4.3 kg/m2),
participating in the "Celorico a Mexer" municipal programme. Waist-hip
ratio (WHR), blood pressure (BP), functional fitness and health status
perception ("Current health" and "Health compared to others of the
same age") was measured.
WHR was 0.96 ± 0.06, with women presenting the highest values (t =
10.902; p = 0.000). BP average was 136.7 ± 9.7 mmHg for SBP and
76.5 ± 10.4 mmHg in DBP. Considering Health Perception, 13.6 % of
seniors feel that they have bad health, 29.0 % have poor health,
45.5 % reasonable health, 11.1 % good health and 0.7 % think it is
very good.
Men consider their health significantly more positive than women
(U = 3577.5, p = 0.002). Compared to other individuals of the same age,
17.6 % do not know, 17.6 % consider their health to be poorer, 48.2 %
think their health identical and 16.5 % say they have better health. Men

perceive their health better than women (U = 3821.5, p = 0.010).
In
functional capacity, women showed a better physical performance than
men. It is necessary to develop campaigns for me for the maintenance
of regular medical consulting, as well as the adoption of a better
lifestyle.

Background
The prevalence of diabetes mellitus is increasing globally and has be-
come a major public health problem. In Portugal, the latest preva-
lence indicates more than 1 million people living with diabetes with
aged between 20 and 79 years. Type 2 diabetes mellitus is more
prevalent in 80 % to 90 % of cases. To prevent the complications as-
sociated with type 2 diabetes, therapy frequently also includes medi-
cations for control of blood pressure, dyslipidaemia and other
disorders and it is essential that there is good adherence to the treat-
ment regimen. Objective: To characterize the adherence to medica-
tion of patients with type 2 diabetes.
Methods
We developed a cross-sectional study in a sample of 357 patients
from primary care centres in Coimbra. Data collection was conducted
through the Morisky Green adapted questionnaire.
Results
In total, 160 men (44.8 %) and 197 women (55.2 %) participated in
the study. The mean age was 67.48 (SD ± 9.5). We obtained good re-
sults of participation, with 88 % of people having high adherence,
10 % intermediate adherence and only 2 % poor adherence.
Conclusions
Our sample of diabetics has a high adherence to therapy. Despite
these results we found some factors that interfere with adherence to
therapy, including age, employment status and gender.

Background
The increase in life expectancy has been accompanied by increased
incidence of chronic diseases. The multi-comorbidity (MC) appears as
a frequent condition in the population, especially in the elderly
people. The epidemic of obesity seems to be the most significant ag-
gravating factor of this population. Objective: To investigate the asso-
ciation between body mass index (BMI) and multi-comorbidities (MC)
in elderly people living in rural and urban areas.
Methods
This is a cross-sectional study conducted in the city of Ibicuí-Bahia,
Brazil. The sample consisted of n = 310 elderly participants (≥60 years),
registered by the Family Health Strategy Program, living in the urban
and rural contexts of the city, randomly selected, 56.5 % female and
43.5 % male (71.62 SD = 8.15 years). BMI was calculated through the
standard formula. MC were identified by the individual's self-report and
by consulting the medical file. In addition, we applied a biosocial ques-
tionnaire to obtain information about gender, age, marital status, family
conditions and use of medication.
Results
Multiple linear regression analysis by gender revealed that only sta-
tistically significant associations emerged between “BMI”, “hyperten-
sion”, “coronary heart disease” and “hypercholesterolemia” in women
(p ≤ 0.001). For the male gender, only “hypertension” is associated
significantly with BMI (p ≤ 0.005).
Conclusions
Evidence suggests that the “BMI” has statistically significant associa-
tions with “cardio-metabolic diseases”, reinforcing its role as a pre-
dictor of cardiovascular risk and its association with MC’s, especially
in elderly women of low socioeconomic status.

Background
Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) is essentially conceptualized as
an emotion dysregulation disorder characterized by a persistent pat-
tern of volatile interpersonal relationships, unstable self-identity, in-
tense and labile affect,
impulsivity and self-damaging behaviours.
Many of the pervasive and severe behaviours present in BPD have
been recently conceptualized as forms of experiential avoidance.
Objectives:
I) Explore if individuals with BPD are significantly dif-
ferent from individuals with Generalized Social Phobia (GSP) and
individuals from the general population in several psychological
processes (metacognition and rumination) and in negative affect. II)
Test whether the impact of these psychological processes on nega-
tive affect occurs through experiential avoidance in the three sam-
ples under study.
Methods
The BPD sample consisted of 73 psychiatric outpatients with a mean
age of 28.99 (SD = 7.61), GSP comprised 69 psychiatric outpatients
with a mean age of 27.51 (SD = 7.79) and non-clinical sample in-
cluded 49 individuals with a mean age of 31.31 (SD = 10.61).
Results
Multivariate analysis of variance showed that there is at least one sig-
nificant difference between two or more samples in all studied vari-
ables. Path Analysis showed: a) an indirect effect of rumination on
negative affect through experiential avoidance, both in BPD and GSP;
b) an indirect effect of metacognition on negative affect through ex-
periential avoidance in the three samples under study. Multi-group
analysis indicated the invariance of the structural models analysed.

Conclusions
Rumination, metacognition and experiential avoidance are present
in a higher degree in BPD. It is possible that experiential avoidance
represents an emotional regulation function that might incorporate
different pervasive cognitive processes, such as rumination and
metacognition.

Background
The vulnerability, social exclusion, and mental disorder status identi-
fied in an exploratory study conducted in 2014, which characterized
the public bathhouse users in the city of Lisbon, as well as their
health status, led to the need for the creation, in March 2015, of a
communitarian mental health nursing consultation. Objective: To
analyse the needs for nursing care in the population that uses public
bathhouse.
Methods
This is an exploratory, retrospective, descriptive and documental
study. Documental analysis of clinical records from patients who
were consulted from March 2015 to January 2016 (starting from one
of the researcher’s analysis model).
Results
Twenty-seven patients are in clinical records and 47 consultations
were carried out. We are dealing with a population with an average
age of 52 years [26-84]; Gender – 16 (59.0 %) male and 11 (41.0 %)
female; Marital status – 13 (48.0 %) single, 6 divorced, 4 married/con-
sensual union, 2 widowers and 2 unknown; Employment status – 16
(59.0 %) unemployed, 6 retired, 3 (11.1 %) employees and 2 un-
known; 12 (44.4 %) are homeless.
In this nursing consultation the
nursing diagnoses of greatest frequency in descending order were
the following: Decreased psychological well-being, 17 (63.0 %);
Hypertension, 14 (52.0 %); Reduced self-esteem and inefficient health
behaviour, 11 (41.0 %); Use of substances, 8 (29.6 %); Anxiety, 8
(29.6 %).
Conclusions
The overview of nursing diagnoses confirms, as a result of vulnerabil-
ity and social exclusion, evidence of mental suffering and difficulty to
develop adaptive strategies.

Background
Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a chronic demyelinating, autoimmune, in-
flammatory and degenerative disease with an unpredictable develop-
ment. Objectives: This study aims to assess the Quality of Life (QoL)
of people with MS, analyse their sociodemographic and clinical pro-
file and the relationship between these variables and QoL.
Methods
This is a cross-sectional study of correlational type, using quantitative
methods. It presents perceived QoL as dependent variable and as in-
dependent variables sociodemographic and clinical profiles were
considered. Data collection was done using a sociodemographic
form and a QoL assessment tool related to health – MOS SF-36v2.
Results
Sixt-seven persons with MS are involved In this work, of both gen-
ders (82 % females) with a mean age ± standard deviation (SD) of
42.0 ± 11.7 years (between 20 and 71). The results show that the par-
ticipants obtained higher scores of QoL is the Mental Health dimen-
sion (M = 58.96) and lowest in Vitality dimension (M = 42.07) of the
SF-36v2. Statistically significant, moderate and negative differences
between age and QoL were found in Physical Function (r = - .568,
p ≤ .05) and Physical Performance (r = - .438, p ≤ .05).
Conclusions
The results show that older people have lower QoL scores in Physical
Function and Physical Performance dimensions and that people with
feelings of fatigue and loss of balance present low QoL, significantly
lower in all the dimensions of the SF-36v2. Taken as a whole, the re-
sults of this study seem promising in terms of understanding the per-
ception of QoL in people with MS.

Background
Health care in pregnancy/maternity in the host country tends not
meet the expectations and health needs of immigrant women, justi-
fying the need for more adjusted nursing care practices for the
needs of this target group. Objective: To identify elements which
characterize the interaction between immigrant women and nurses
during prenatal care to postpartum, from the perspective of migrant
women.
Methods
In an interpretative paradigm, using Grounded Theory, 30 semi-
structured interviews were conducted with pregnant
immigrant
women (from several countries) to 6 months postpartum in Health
Units, from February to March 2015, after approval by the Ethics
Commission for Health ARSLVT.
Results and conclusions
From the results of the focused coding five categories emerged: the
established communication between nurse-immigrant woman; the
meaning attributed to nursing information/orientation about preg-
nancy/maternity; the emotional response to the behaviour and nurs-
ing interventions; the trust built between immigrant women and
nurses; putting the nursing guidelines into practice. From a compre-
hensive analysis of the interrelation of these categories arose the rec-
ognition and safety of women in attitudes, and nursing interventions
in relation to maternal and foetal well-being, information and adher-
ence to health behaviours. But the host also needs acceptance, to be

respected and understood during the interaction with the nurse. Re-
garding that this interaction is influenced by the situation of the
pregnant woman/mother, with cultural characteristics and personal-
ity changes, adjustments and difficulties, these results will allow the
continuation of this study, in order to build a comprehensive theory
on the interaction between the nurses and migrant women.

Background
Arterial hypertension constitutes a major risk factor for the develop-
ment of cardiovascular disease and cognitive impairment, which anti-
hypertensive medication can prevent or minimize. Patients’ beliefs
about their illness play an important role in blood pressure control,
as they can determine behaviours that patients adopt to cope with
their illness, namely adherence to antihypertensive medication. Ob-
jective: To identify patients’ perceptions of hypertension and assess
associations between those beliefs and medication adherence.
Methods
63 hypertensive patients, 69.8 % females, aged 54-95 years (M =
69.02; SD = 10.07), 96.8 % of whom were diagnosed over a year pre-
viously and prescribed with antihypertensive medication completed
the Revised Illness Perception Questionnaire (IPQ-R) and a 7-item
medication adherence measure (Medida de Adesão aos Tratamen-
tos – MAT).
Results
Most patients perceived their hypertension as a chronic and cyclical
condition that can be controlled by their own behaviour and medica-
tion intake, and that elicits negative affective responses. Patients re-
ported a high level of medication adherence (M = 5.41; SD = 0.55,
with 7 as highest possible score) and a low frequency of non-
adherent behaviours, with 20.6 % stating that they did not take
medication because they forgot it. We found significant negative cor-
relations between adherence and hypertension timeline (cyclical)
(rs(63) = -0.27; p < 0.05), hypertension consequences (rs(63) = -0.50; p
< 0.01) and emotional representations (rs(62) = -0.37; p < 0.01).
Conclusions
These findings, suggesting an association between illness percep-
tions and non-adherence behaviours in hypertension, strengthen the
importance of patient-centred interventions starting from patients’
beliefs, preferences and needs, could lead to a better understanding
of illness and enhancing patients’ active engagement in blood pres-
sure control.

Background
According to results from the World Health Organization (2002), vio-
lence in intimate relationships is a phenomenon whose incidence
covers the most diverse populations on a universal scale, with severe
including death. Being a complex problem,
health consequences,
there is an increased need for research and prevention/intervention.
Objectives: Considering previous research,
this exploratory study
aims to examine the relationship between intimate partner violence,
interpersonal trust in the intimate partner and hope for the future.
Also, the prevalence of violence in intimate relationships will be
addressed.
Methods
The sample includes 302 subjects (202 women and 100 men), aged
18 to 63 years (M = 29, SD = 10.78). Data collection was performed
through a sociodemographic questionnaire, the Portuguese adapta-
tion of the Rotenberg´s Specific Trust Scale-Adults, Scale of Beliefs
about Marital Violence, the Inventory of Marital Violence, and the
Scale of the Future.
Results
Results show the existence of weak negative associations between
interpersonal trust and violence. Although modest, some significant
positive relationships between certain factors of hope and inter-
personal trust were found. Age, gender and socioeconomic status
play an interesting role. Results also reveal a worrying prevalence
of violence in intimate relationships, whether in present or in
past relationships.
Conclusions
In sum, the study characterizes the quality of intimate relationships,
showing some negative associations of interpersonal trust with vio-
lence and positive associations of interpersonal trust with hope. In-
terpretation of these findings and limitations of the results as well as
suggestions of its possible use in future research are also presented
and discussed.

Background
Quality of life (QOL) is a key outcome measure and is progressively
being used in the intellectual disability (ID) field. There is an emer-
ging body of evidence concerning personal-environmental character-
istics influencing QOL. Personal factors with impact on QOL were
identified as demographic (e.g., gender, age) and human functioning
(e.g., IQ, adaptive behaviour) variables. Environmental factors involve
perceived social supports, residential settings, inclusion, employment
status, community interactions, geographical location, and organization
culture. Identify predictors of QOL is crucial to know how these deter-
minants can be used by practitioners to enhance personal outcomes
and focus on personal-environmental
interactions that influence the
QOL of each individual. Our goal was to examine factors that influence
QOL on people with and without ID. This information is important to
meet challenges and overcome barriers that people with ID face. Two
groups of characteristics were analysed, namely: personal
(gender,
diagnosis, age, health status) and environmental determinants (living
arrangement, employment status, education level).
Methods
Data were collected from 1,929 Portuguese adults: 1,264 individuals
with ID and 665 participants without ID. QOL was assessed by the
“Escala Pessoal de Resultados (EPR”), the Portuguese version of the
Personal Outcomes Scale (POS).

Results
Results supported that QOL is influenced by individual and environ-
mental factors and the health status was the highest QOL’ predictor
among all participants.
Conclusions
Findings encourage a strong work in Portugal, highlighting changes in
policies and services based on the QOL framework. Furthermore, sup-
ports should enable the participation of adults with ID in community-
based settings, recognising their personal talents.

Background
The assessment of people with aphasia (PWA) should include the
evaluation of specific disorders of language and the aphasia impact
on their activities and their participation in the society. The Commu-
nication Disability Profile (CDP) has thus been translated and adapted
to European Portuguese. Objective: CDP – Portuguese Version con-
tent validation.
Methods
An expert panel of eleven PWA was consulted. The adopted method-
ology (participatory workshops) fostered panel group integration, so
that critical spirit and discussion could be enhanced. Data have been
processed by a qualitative analysis programme.
Results
Concerning the Form, the expert panel was unanimous to consider
that CDP is not suitable for Portuguese PWA and so part of the sug-
gestions refer to adapting it to the Portuguese society and culture. In
terms of Content, the panel considered the CDP’s Ambiguity and
Relevance categories as valid, constituted by important items that re-
flect PWA’s reality, covering their needs. In the category of Clarity,
CDP was considered clear but incomplete in the areas of Activities
and Participation.
Conclusions
The CDP – Portuguese Version is incomplete in the areas mentioned
above. However, the consequences of aphasia in terms of Activity,
Participation, Context Factors and Emotions can be measured with it.
The suggestions proposed by the expert panel have complemented
the instrument gaps, having been integrated in a new version of the
CDP.

at the cellular level as well as on muscle enzymes. Modifications are
also seen in terms of lipid profile, caused by the faster rate of me-
tabolism of these molecules. The aim of this paper was to study the
variation of biochemical and haematological parameters on football
players.
Methods
Blood samples were drawn from 18 football players undergoing an
8 hour-a-week training program. The following parameters were
tested:
lactate dehydrogenase
(LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST); red blood cells (RBC) and
their indices, haemoglobin and haematocrit.
Results
The lipid profile showed that the HDL-Cholesterol mean (=53.33 mg/
dL) was above the value determined as target (37.00 mg/dL). The
LDL-Cholesterol mean was below the target-value, as it was for the
triglycerides. There were no significant differences between the real
mean and the target value for total cholesterol. All creatine kinase
(CK) values were above the target-value of 77 UI/L. The values ob-
tained for lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and aspartate aminotransfer-
ase (AST) tests did not show any significant difference from target-
values. No major differences from the target values were seen in
terms of the haematological parameters.
Conclusions
The results of this study have shown that the practice of physical ex-
ercise has caused a modification in the subject's lipid profile, espe-
cially on the HDL-C values. Concerning muscle enzymes, the only
altered value found was for creatine kinase (CK). The so called sports
anaemia was not confirmed.

Background
Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is characterized by a chronic, re-
lapsing inflammation of the intestinal system which causes symp-
toms such as abdominal pain, bloating, diarrhoea, and weight loss.
Although the majority of IBD patients experience body image dissat-
isfaction, which presents substantial implications for patients’ quality
of
life, the mechanisms associated with this link are not clearly
understood. Objectives: The aim of this study was thus to explore
the role of chronic illness-related shame in the association between
IBD symptomatology and body image dissatisfaction, while control-
ling for age, BMI and surgery.
Methods
Participants included 161 adult IBD patients (52 males and 109 fe-
males), that reported demographic and medical data and completed
self-report measures.
Results
Results from path analyses revealed that age and IBD symptomatol-
ogy significantly predicted illness-related shame with effects of -.23
(p < .01) and .43 (p < .001), respectively. Further, IBD symptomatology
presented a total effect of .43 on body image dissatisfaction: a direct
effect of .23 (p < .001) and an indirect effect through the mechanisms
of illness-related shame of .20 (C.I. from .13 to .29). The model ex-
plained 22 % of chronic illness-related shame and 38 % of body
image dissatisfaction, and revealed an excellent model fit.

Conclusions
These findings suggest that higher IBD symptomatology leads to
higher levels of body image dissatisfaction in IBD patients. Further,
part of this effect seems to be mediated by the experience of chronic
it seems that, to diminish IBD pa-
illness-related shame. Therefore,
tients’ body image dissatisfaction, treatment programmes should ad-
dress shame feelings and promote self-compassion abilities.

Background
Current scientific evidence has reported associations between inad-
equate sleep patterns and overweight/obesity. Epidemiological stud-
ies show a curvilinear relationship in "U-shape" between inadequate
sleep and obesity, resulting in consequences on individual and public
health levels. Objectives: To identify the association between over-
weight/obesity and inadequate sleep patterns among adults.
Methods
We conducted a systematic review of the literature, using a search in
PubMed, Cochrane Library, SciELO and Google Scholar. We identified
studies published between January 2008 and November 2015. Inclu-
sion criteria were previously defined, then the selected studies were
assessed for their quality and later analysed. By applying the "Scale
to critically assess a paper describing a prospective, randomized and
controlled clinical trial" in the included studies, it was found that of
the four studies that formed the textual corpus, three were consid-
ered of quality (final grade ≥ 75 %).
Results
Inadequate sleep patterns increase the risk of weight gain and con-
sequently of overweight and obesity in adults. This was a result sup-
ported by the data presented in the studies analysed (systematic
literature review, longitudinal studies of clinical intervention, random-
ized and controlled trials, cross-sectional analytic studies). Over-
weight/obesity are associated with inadequate sleep-wake patterns,
namely the "short" duration of sleep in adults.
Conclusions
An association is suggested between decreased sleep duration and
increase in weight. Longitudinal and experimental studies, using ob-
jective and repeated measures of sleep, are important to define a
causal relationship between sleep deprivation and obesity.

manifestations and comorbidities resulting in poor sleep quality or Ob-
structive Sleep Apnoea (OSA) with a prevalence of around 10 %. Ob-
jective: To identify the frequency of disorders sleep in COPD patients.
Methods
Cross-sectional study that evaluated 23 patients with COPD in the
Programme of Santa Cruz Hospital. All were submitted to the Berlin
questionnaire (BQ) to assess the probability of OSA and the Epworth
Sleepiness Scale (ESS) that evaluates the possibility of dozing in eight
everyday situations and establishes diagnosis of excessive daytime
sleepiness (EDS). The results were expressed as mean ± standard de-
viation and analysed with Student’s t-test.
Results
Average age was 63.22 ± 8.4 years, body mass index (BMI) 26.3 ± 5.7
Kg/m2, 57 % male, expiratory volume forced in the 1st second 36.46 ±
16.12 % predicted and the classification of COPD as very severe
(43.5 %). Frequency of EDS was 8.7 % (n = 02) and 22 % presented high
probability of OSA (n = 05). The analysis of clinical variables in COPD
stratified by high probability of OSA and absence of OSA showed no
significant difference between groups, but there was an overweight
trend in COPD with high probability of OSA (BMI 30.16 ± 6.31 Kg/m2 vs.
25.24 ± 5.24 Kg/m2, p = 0.08).
Conclusions
COPD patients presented a high probability of OSA compared to the lit-
erature, where the prevalence of this sleep disorder is around 10 %.

Background
In Portugal there is a lack of scientific reflection on the maternal
health care advocated for immigrant women [1]. Knowing that in
2009 were born 1,0350 children of resident foreign women in our
country [2], emerges the need to understand not only the difficulties
of immigrant populations on the access and use of services, but also
the speeches, practices and challenges that health professionals face
on provision of maternity care to these women.
Methods
The present study adopted a qualitative methodology for collecting
(semi-structured interviews) and analysing the data (thematic analysis).
This study was based on privileged information obtained from fourteen
health professionals that provide care to pregnant immigrant women.
Results and conclusions
The data shows that health care professionals had misinformation
about the immigrant legal rights and free access to maternal health ser-
vices, they face many dilemmas in providing care to women who fol-
low their cultural values, beliefs and perceptions especially if the
behaviour portrayed does not conform to the norms of the health care
system. When facing this situation, they know that they need to re-
spond using a culturally sensitive approach by incorporating cultural
competency into their practice but many times they don’t know how
to do it. They also face communication difficulties specially when the
immigrant women don’t speak or understand Portuguese language.
Some of the interviewed showed discourses of stigmatization and regu-
lation of knowledge in favour of biomedical knowledge. These
speeches, practices and challenges can enhance the vulnerability of
these women.

Background
Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease that
can develop auditory and vestibular disorders, explained by a change
associated with the autoimmune disease and justified by vasculitis in
the cochlea which may involve the striavascularis, the spiral ligament,
or internal auditory artery, or immune complexes, which instead of
vasculitis, are the cause of minor stroke of the capillaries or arterioles
in the temporal bone. Objective: To study auditory and vestibular dis-
orders in individuals with SLE and identify the variables in SLE dis-
ease that could justify possible audiovestibular changes.
Methods
A literature review of articles since 2007 was performed with a search
made in scientific databases as Elsevier, B-on, Medline, PubMed and
Google Scholar using the keywords “autoimmune disease, lupus, sys-
temic lupus erythematous, auditory system, vestibular system, hear-
ing loss, vertigo, dizziness” in English and in Portuguese. After the
search strategies, five articles in accordance with pre-established in-
clusion criteria were selected.
Results
Audiovestibular tests performed in patients with SLE indicated bilat-
eral sensorineural hearing loss with the highest incidence in the high

frequencies and unilateral vestibular disorders.
that vertigo and tinnitus were the most commonly reported symp-
toms and duration of the disease appears to influence the integrity
of the auditory and vestibular system.
Conclusions
By the analysis of articles was possible to conclude that the involve-
ment of the auditory and vestibular system should be considered as
one of the elements of the clinical picture of SLE, and the matter
should be explored by the scientific community.

Background
Mental health problems have been reported as one of the principal
causes of incapacity and morbidity. According to the World Health
Organization, approximately 15 % of adults aged 60 and over at a
global level suffer from a mental disorder, and dementia and depres-
sion are the most common neuropsychiatric disorders in this age
group.
In the oldest old population, a higher deterioration is ex-
pected, which is thought to increase the risk of incidence of mental
problems. Objectives: The aim of this study is to examine inpatient
episodes with a mental disorder as primary diagnosis between 2000
and 2014 in very old patients in mainland Portugal.
Methods
All inpatient episodes of hospital admissions by patients aged 80 years
and older due to mental disorders during the study period were con-
sidered. Exploratory descriptive analyses of data regarding the number
and kind of mental disorder diagnosis on admission were performed.
Results
A total of 16,430 inpatient episodes were analysed. Delirium, demen-
tia and amnestic and other cognitive disorders (60.1 %), alcohol-
related disorders (17.7 %) and mood disorders (8.6 %) were the most
common diagnoses. An analysis by age group revealed that in octo-
genarians and nonagenarians, delirium, dementia and amnestic and
other cognitive disorders were the most common diagnoses, but in
centenarians these were outweighed by alcohol-related disorders.
Conclusions
Findings from this study document the high rate of dementia as a
primary reason for hospitalization in the oldest old and corroborate
previous data regarding mental health in the older population in
general. Further studies should examine the prevalence of medical
comorbidities in patients with mental disorders.

the postural control in children with CP during sitting position in the
following tasks: I) simply sitting (baseline); II) observing the modelling
of a plasticine ball; III) molding a plasticine ball; and IV) idem III) with
closed eyes.
Methods
Five children of both sexes were analysed, with 12 ± 1 years old, and
CP levels I and II [2]. Data were obtained by filming at 240 Hz in vertex
and C7 points, for kinematic (Kinovea) and recurrence analysis [3].
Results and conclusions
Compared to the condition I), in condition II) children were more de-
terministic, periodic and complex but less stable. The focus on move-
ments implied a reorganization of postural control. In conditions III)
and IV) children were less deterministic, periodic, stable and complete
at C7, but more periodic, stable and complex at vertex, probably due to
the need to stabilize the head. When performing a functional motor
task (conditions III and IV), children changed their pattern of postural

control, with likely increase in degrees of freedom, anchored in stabiliz-
ing the head.
The introduction of a visual focus (condition II) caused a postural ad-
justment probably resulting from the activity of mirror neurons.
When performing a functional task (conditions III and IV) the postural
adjustment was anchored in fixing the head and trunk release.

The experience of self-care in the elderly with COPD: contributions
to reflect proximity care
Helga Rafael (hrafael@esel.pt)
Escola Superior de Enfermagem de Lisboa, Lisboa, 1700-063, Portugal
BMC Health Services Research 2016, 16(Suppl 3):P73

Background
Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) leads to changes in
different areas of life and poses several challenges in self-care. It pre-
sents a resource for elderly people to remain in their own homes,
while containing an important source of knowledge of personal iden-
tity. We aim to understand the importance of the home in self-care
management in elderly patients living with COPD and to put proxim-
ity care in perspective.
Methods
It follows a phenomenological-hermeneutic approach, based on 16
interviews conducted with persons between 65 and 100 years old.
The narratives were interpreted in accordance with Paul Ricoeur’s In-
terpretation Theory, following the stages of naive understanding,
structural analysis and comprehensive understanding.
Results and conclusions
One of the themes that emerged was "Limiting the living space to
home". Through this experience, elderly people lived in discontinuity
and continuity. Home is linked to the experience of discontinuity of
self-care when it is felt like a limited space, of closure. Home is linked
to the experience of continuity when it means (re)construction of
personal identity, ability to preserve, acquire or adapt self-care habits,
maintaining integrity. The elderly interact dynamically with their
houses, in a movement between opposing feelings.
For these participants home is a very important place of care. Policy
guidelines should include proximity care, patient-centred care or care
in their homes, for as long as possible, giving priority to the preserva-
tion of identity elements of each. Self-care experience must be lived
with congruence with the individual health design and continuity
with integrity, personal identity and human dignity.

Background
In this presentation we will feature the process of building cultural
competence in nursing, from the study of the clinical practice with
immigrants in primary health care contexts, in Portugal.
Methods
We developed an inductive study of ethnographic orientation, with
participant observation; analysis was developed of discursive material
of ethnobiographical interviews and narratives of 52 nurses and im-
migrants, and two focus groups with these different types of partici-
pants – at different moments.
Results
We identified difficulties in cultural contextualization of people cared
for by nurses, more visible at the level of knowledge of particularities
in the communication process, in the use of family members as inter-
preters, diversity of religious beliefs and about health and illness,
roles and socio-familial control.
Conclusions
Regardless of the individual motivation of nurses to care for immi-
grants, they have the capacity for adequate management of unpre-
dictability in cultural encounters. This management emerges as a
central element of the professional development and of the con-
struction of cultural skills – in a gradual distancing of nurses from
their own ethnocentrism. However, the management of unpredict-
ability is made especially with an "advance” for initial assessment
and care planning,
in accordance with the professional standards
and dominant organizational culture, and sometimes there is a cul-
tural misfit. The management of unpredictability in successive mo-
ments promotes adjustments in clinical practice with immigrants; it
occurs together with a process of awareness by professionals, explor-
ing how to experience the health-illness transitions in different ways.

Background
To develop and validate a speech and language screening instrument
(Rastreio de Linguagem e Fala, RALF), which aims to quickly identify
children who may be at risk of a speech-language disorder and need
to be referred to a detailed speech and language assessment.
Methods
A sample of 203 Portuguese children (n = 109 males, 94 females)
aged 3.0 to 5.11 were recruited. 133 presented a typical language de-
velopment and 70 a primary language disorder. Speech-language as-
sessments and diagnostics were performed by a licensed and certified
speech and language therapist. Subject selection criteria for disordered
children included: I) language score below -1.5 SD, the mean of the
Language Test-ALPE (Teste de Linguagem – TL-ALPE), a standardized
language instrument;
II) speech sound disorder identified through a
spontaneous speech sample; III) absence of another condition such as
hearing impairment, emotional or behavioural difficulties, autism,
neurological
impairment or general developmental difficulties. RALF
and TL-ALPE’s scores were crossover. Sensibility as well as specificity
were calculated for three age groups (3, 4 and 5 years).

Results
Sensibility values were 95 %, 96 %, 83 % and specificity values were
85 %, 84 % 71 % (for 3, 4 and 5 age groups, respectively). Results re-
vealed that RALF was able to discriminate typically developing chil-
dren from disordered speech-language developing children.
Conclusions
RALF is a valid instrument that can be used by health professionals
to assist on the screening and identification of children who may
need a speech and language detailed assessment.

Background
In sport, nutrition must ensure a supply of nutritional require-
ments, to provide sufficient calories to supply the high energy
costs associated with daily sports, either in training or in compe-
tition. They must deal with the high nutritional requirements of
the athletes, promoting and maintaining a high level of physical
and mental welfare, so that the athlete can engage in his sports
discipline.
The aim of this study is to characterize the nutritional habits and body
composition of bodybuilding practitioners in order to obtain muscle
hypertrophy.
Methods
These individuals were selected from the gyms of São Martinho do
Bispo, in Coimbra. The sample was composed by 17 male athletes,
aged between 19 and 39 years. Nutritional assessment was per-
formed using the food frequency questionnaire (FFQ), supplied by
the Department of Hygiene and Epidemiology, Faculty of Medicine
of Porto, and also by the 24-hour questionnaire. Body composition
was determined through skin folds, weight, waist circumference and
height of the individual.
Statistical analyses were performed using the SPSS statistical
programme (Statistical Package for the Sciences), version 19.0.
Results and conclusions
Data analysis concluded that athletes have a high protein intake with
a low consumption of carbohydrates. However, they have an energy
and fat intake within the range recommended by the literature.

Background
The objective assessment of lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI)
in children is challenging. Computerized adventitious respiratory
sounds (ARS) are valuable to assess adult respiratory diseases; how-
ever, its application in children with LRTI is unknown. Objective: This

BMC Health Services Research 2016, Volume 16 Suppl 3

Page 75 of 132

cross-sectional study explored ARS potential to identify a LRTI and
monitor its severity in children aged less than years.
Methods
Twenty-two (22) children aged ≤ 2 years (G1: 11 healthy; G2: 11 LRTI)
and 18 aged 3-5 years (G3: 9 healthy; G4: 9 LRTI) were recruited from
three healthcare institutions. Respiratory distress was assessed with
the modified Wang Score. Computerized respiratory sounds were re-
corded following the international guidelines. Wheeze (occupation
rate and frequency) and crackle (mean number and two cycle dur-
ation -2CD) parameters were analysed per respiratory phase using
developed algorithms. Comparisons were established using Mann-
Whitney and correlations with Spearman’s tests.
Results
Children with LRTI presented a higher expiratory wheeze occupation
rate [G1: 2.15 (1.67-3.11) vs. G2: 4.73 (2.59-9.31) p = 0.001; G3: 2.80
(1.89-5.16) vs. G4: 5.17 (2.64-18.63) p = 0.07] and more inspiratory
crackles [G1: 0.25 (0.14-0.44) vs. G2: 0.52 (0.22-0.92); p < 0.001; G3:
0.50 (0.25-0.72) vs. G4: 0.70 (0.33-1.55) p = 0.03] than healthy children.
No differences were found for other ARS parameters. Moderate to
strong correlations were found between ARS and children’s respira-
tory distress (0.35 < r < 0.51; p < 0.05).
Conclusions
Wheeze occupation rate and mean number of crackles were the pa-
rameters that most differed between healthy children and children
with LRTI and that most correlated with the respiratory distress score.
Those parameters may be useful to objectively diagnose and monitor
children with LRTI.

Background
Computerized respiratory sounds, especially adventitious respiratory
sounds (ARS), have been increasingly used to monitor lower respira-
tory tract infections (LRTI). Although this measure has shown to be
reliable in patients with stable chronic diseases, its variability and reli-
ability in acute conditions is unknown. This cross-sectional study
assessed the variability and reliability of computerized respiratory
sounds in patients with LRTI.
Methods
Ninety-seven patients with LRTI
(57 females; 54.82 ± 17.18 years)
were recruited from one central hospital. Three repeated respiratory
sound recordings were taken simultaneously from seven anatomical
locations. Normal respiratory sound (NRS) intensity, mean number of
crackles and wheeze occupation rate (Wh%) were analysed with vali-
dated algorithms. Intra-subject reliability was assessed with the intra-
class correlation coefficient (ICC 1.3) and Bland-Altman plots. Inter-
subject variability was assessed with the coefficient of variation (CV).
Results
Relative reliability was moderate to excellent for NRS intensity and
mean number of crackles (0.42 < ICC < 0.80), except at trachea (0.29 <
ICC < 0.74), and poor to excellent for Wh% (0.18 < ICC < 0.86). Absolute
reliability demonstrated no systematic bias between measures. Inter-
subject variability was acceptable for NRS intensity (14 % < CV < 25 %)
and high for crackle and wheeze parameters (49 % < CV < 211 %).
Conclusions
NRS intensity seems to be the most reliable marker to monitor
patients with LRTI. More research is needed with controlled flows

and volumes to confirm these results since NRS are always pro-
duced during breathing whilst ARS are superimposed events on
NRS hence, timing may not be perfectly repeatable from breath to
breath.

Background
The Personal Wellness Index/Satisfaction with life in general (PWI/
SLG) is a questionnaire designed to measure subjective well-being
(SWB). The PWI was based on the Comprehensive Quality of Life
Scale [1] and is validated for
the Portuguese population [2].
Objective: To confirm the unifactorial structure of the "Personal
Wellbeing Index" in people with chronic kidney disease (CKD) on
hemodialysis.
Methods
The random sample included 159 people with CKD on hemodialysis
in a Nephrology Service and two clinics in the region of Lisbon,
Portugal. Data collection was carried out between March and June
2015. The AMOS software was used for a confirmatory factor ana-
lysis (CFA), with the maximum likelihood method. The adjustment
ratios were used: ratio Chi Square and the degrees of freedom
(X2/gl); goodness-of-fit
index (CFI),
Tucker-Lewis index (TLI) and root mean square error of approxima-
tion (RMSEA) [3-4].
Results
The results of this study [X2/df = 1.871; GFI = 0.96; CFI = 0.97; TLI =
0.95; RMSEA = 0.07] show a good fit to the hypothesis of the solution
of a factor, which confirms the solution proposed in the original ver-
sion [1] and the Portuguese version [2].
Conclusions
The Portuguese version of "Personal Wellbeing Index in people with
CKD has a single factor. The personal well-being Index or satisfaction
with life in general is suitable for measuring the impact of interven-
tions in nursing in people with CKD.

Background
Phonological awareness development is crucial in the beginning of
the schooling process, as it is a key precursor of reading and writing
skills. However, data on phonological awareness development of
European Portuguese (EP) school aged children are scarce. Objective:
The current study aimed to determine which phonological skills are
acquired in school aged children (6.00 - 6.11 years) and whether
there are differences between phonological awareness levels or not.
Methods
A total of 80 EP typically developing children aged between 6.00 and
6.11 years participated in this study. We used a valid and standard-
ized instrument – Language Test: Pre-school Language Assessment
(TL-ALPE) to collect data on phonological awareness skills. Descrip-
tive statistics were used to determine which skills were acquired in
the age range considered. Furthermore, Wilcoxon test for paired
samples was performed to detect differences between syllabic
awareness and phonemic awareness performance, as the sample
data did not follow a normal distribution.
Results
Syllable identity is considered an acquired and established skill, as
children showed 86.88 % accuracy in this task. Syllabic segmentation
as well as phoneme identity are acquired but not established, with
68.75 % and 71.25 % accuracy, respectively. The lowest scores were
achieved in phonemic segmentation (15.25 % accuracy) and this skill
was considered non-acquired by the age of 6 years old. Significant
differences were found between syllabic awareness and phonemic
awareness levels (p = 0.000), the first presenting advantage over the
second.
Conclusions
The present study is a valuable contribution, as it expands the litera-
ture on school aged children’s phonological awareness development.

Background
Given that the growing autonomy towards parents and the inter-
action with peers are particularly important aspects concerning the
development of self-identity, it is crucial to assess early memories as-
sociated with feelings of safeness or threat in the interaction with
peers. Objectives: I) To examine the psychometric characteristics of
the Early Memories of Warmth and Safeness Scale in interaction with
peers (EMWSS- Peers); II) to explore the relationship between EMWSS-
Peers and the global measure of early positive memories with attach-
ment figures (EMWSS); III) to investigate the impact of positive emo-
tional memories in depressive and anxiety symptoms.
Methods
Three hundred fifty-five (355) adolescents (152 boys), aged between
12 and 18 years old, completed the Early Memories of Warmth and

Safeness Scale (EMWSS – global measure), EMWSS in interactions
with peers, and the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scales (DASS-21).
Results
The EMWSS-Peers showed a single-factor structure, excellent internal
consistency (α = .93), and test-retest reliability (r = .86). Memories of
warmth and safeness regarding interaction with peers showed
moderate negative correlations with anxiety and depressive symp-
toms, and a moderate positive association with warmth and safe-
ness memories concerning the interaction with attachment figures.
Additionally, early positive memories revealed a significant and in-
dependent contribution for the prediction of anxiety and depres-
sive symptoms.
Conclusions
The EMWSS-Peers proved to be a reliable and valid instrument for
the assessment of warmth and safeness feelings in the interaction
with peers’ context. These results suggest that positive emotional
memories can act as protective factors regarding psychopathological
symptoms.

Background
An estimate of 386,000 cases of non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL) oc-
curred in 2012 (2.7 % of all cancers). Diffuse large B cell lymphoma
(DLBCL) is a heterogeneous group of haematological malignancies
and forms the most common type of aggressive non-Hodgkin
lymphoma. Objective: To evaluate cellular and molecular effects of
high doses X radiation in DLBCL cells.
Methods
Farage cells were exposed to 0.5-60 Gy of Ionizing Radiation (IR).
Cell viability and proliferation were assessed by trypan blue assay
and cell survival by clonogenic assay. Cell death was assessed by
flow cytometry (FC) and optical microscopy. Cell cycle, mitochon-
drial membrane potential, reactive oxygen species, GSH and BAX/
BCL-2 were measured by FC. DNA damage was evaluated using
comet assay. Total and phosphorylated P53 was assessed by west-
ern blot.
Results
IR induced cytotoxic and cytostatic effects in Farage cells in a dose
and time dependent manner with an LD50 of 1.73 Gy. Cell death
occurs mainly by apoptosis with an increase in BAX/BCL-2 ratio

BMC Health Services Research 2016, Volume 16 Suppl 3

Page 77 of 132

and significant increase in Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) produc-
tion. We observed cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase and significant
increase in DNA damage and in P53 total and phosphorylated ex-
pression levels.
Conclusions
High doses of IR induce a time dose dependent response which
leads to increased ROS production, DNA damage with increased P53
expression and activation expressed by elevated pP53 levels, result-
ing in G2/M cell cycle arrest and increased later apoptosis/necrosis
cell death. Our results showed that single shot IR induces effects in
different cell components and its comprehension is essential to
choose treatment planning.

Background
Prolonged intensive physical training causes structural and functional
cardiovascular adaptations, however these modifications can be mis-
interpreted as pathological. The aim of this study was to describe the
cardiovascular structure and functionality, by transthoracic echocardi-
ography, in young competitive artistic gymnastics athletes.
Methods
This study was conducted in a population of feminine artistic gym-
nastics athletes, with ages between 12 and 15 years old. All individ-
following the
transthoracic echocardiography,
uals underwent
defined study protocol. Statistical analysis of the study variables was
made using descriptive statistics, Shapiro-Wilk test, T-test, Wilcoxon's
test and Pearson's correlation. The results were considered statisti-
cally significant when p value < 0.05.
Results and conclusions
With regard to left cardiac structure and functionality, there were no
statistically significant changes, however the athletes had larger left
atrial area (15.35 cm2), which is common due to pressure increase
during exercise practice, especially in a combined isometric and iso-
tonic training.
In the diastolic function, the mitral E wave velocity (1.08 m/s) and
the mitral E/A ratio (2.31) were significantly higher. There was a cor-
relation between years of practice and both mitral A wave velocity
and mitral E/A ratio. These findings suggest a supernormal diastolic
function as a consequence of the left ventricular relaxation and com-
pliance enhancement.
With this study it was possible to verify, that all variables used to
analyse structural and cardiovascular functional adaptations, mea-
sured by transthoracic echocardiogram, were within normal values,
taking in consideration the paediatric and adult Guidelines. There
were found statistically significant differences for the left atrial area
and left diastolic function.

Background
In 1987 three unrelated English families were reported with an al-
leged subgroup called Apae. The Apae positive family members
showed a divergent antibody and lectin reaction pattern of erythro-
cytes. The lectin Helix Pomatia had strong reaction, polyclonal anti-
bodies (Ab) anti-A had weak response and monoclonal Ab anti-A had
no reaction, suggesting a controversy. Swedish researchers found ev-
idences leading to abolish the subgroup Apae and establishing in-
stead the FORS blood group system (accepted by ISBT 2012 as blood
group system 31). It’s important to know the prevalence of the Ab to
make the right decisions in transfusion medicine. For that reason, are
needed cells containing the Fs saccharide, such as sheep erythro-
cytes, to search the Ab. Objective: Study the anti-Forssman (anti-Fs)
antibody frequency.
Methods
Plasma from a total of 800 blood donors was included in the study.
Sheep erythrocytes were crossed with blood donor plasma using the
tube technique. Plasma from Apae individual was used as negative
control and anti-Fs (M1/22.25.8HL cell line supernatant) was used as
positive control.
Results
In 800 blood donors, one was negative for the presence of anti-Fs Ab.
Conclusions
Sheep erythrocytes are suitable to search the human anti-Fs. In this
blood donor population (n = 811) we found one individual
lacking
the anti-Fs. Those results contribute to the data of being a rare blood
group.
It would be interesting to study the cells of the individual
lacking the anti-Fs to understand if it is a FORS+ individual and if can
have impact in transfusion medicine.

Background
The perception of threat (the fear for one’s safety and well-being)
during exposure to war proved to be a major risk factor for develop-
ment of psychopathology developed by war Veterans. The Perceived
Threat Scale (PTS) of the Deployment Risk and Resilience Inventory
(DRRI) is one the most widely used self-report instrument to assess
this construct. Objective: This study aimed to test the two-factorial la-
tent structure (Threats Combat and Non-Threats Combat) of the PTS
adapted to Portuguese Colonial War Veterans (modified version), pre-
viously found through Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA). The internal
consistency and discriminant validity of this scale were also analysed.
Methods
Three hundred and ten (310) males from the general population of
Portuguese Colonial War Veterans completed the PTS-MV (PTS-Modi-
fied Version), PTSD Checklist-Military Version (PCL-M), Beck Depres-
sion Inventory (BDI) and the Anxiety and Stress Scales of DASS-21.
Results
Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) showed that the re-specified first–
order two factor model has a good fit to the data (GFI = .92; TLI = .93;
CFI = .94; RMSEA = .06; PCFI = .79) and adequate factorial validity. Also
an adequate internal consistency was obtained (Treats Combat: α = .82;
Non-Treats Combat: α = .83) and a good discriminant capacity regard-
ing PTSD, depression, anxiety and stress symptoms.
Conclusions
CFA corroborates the two-factorial structure of the Portuguese Ver-
sion of PTS previously found by the authors. The scale is internally
consistent and has a good discriminant capacity.

Background
Continuous blood pressure (BP) monitoring provides important infor-
mation about the cardiovascular system condition. Invasive methods
are accurate but denote increased risk. Non-invasive methods are
safe but less reliable and don´t provide continuous information. An
alternative approach for a continuous, non-invasive measurement of
BP is based on changes in pulse transit time (PTT). PTT is defined as
the time delay between the R-wave of the electrocardiogram (ECG)
and the peak value of the photoplethysmogram (PPG) signal ac-
quired in the patient finger on the same cardiac cycle.
The main goal of this work is to estimate the PTT using different
methodologies found in the literature, such as derivative based ap-
proaches and Discrete Wavelet (DWT) and Hilbert-Huang (HHT) trans-
forms, and compare the results with ground truth values obtained
manually.
Methods
Several ECG and PPG signals were obtained from a public physiologic
signals database and from real data using in vivo patients. A derivative

based approach to find the R waves and the PPG peak values was im-
plemented to estimate the PTT. Then, a previous signal processing
using DWT and HHT was applied. Results provided from each method-
ology were compared with ground truth values.
Results and conclusions
Globally all methods had similar results when using the database sig-
nals. However, using real data, the derivative based approach per-
formed poorly. Due to noise, non-stationary and non-linearity nature
of physiologic signals, methodologies that incorporate DWT or HHT
provide accurate results.

Background
Continuous and reliable blood pressure (BP) monitoring during
standard clinical manoeuvres provides important information about
the cardiovascular system condition. Common invasive methods
are accurate but denote increased risk. An alternative approach is
based on changes in pulse transit time (PTT) defined as the time
delay between the R-wave of the electrocardiogram (ECG) and the
peak value of the photoplethysmogram (PPG) signal at the same
cardiac cycle.
The main goal of this work is to estimate BP variations derived from
PTT changes during typical clinical autonomic manoeuvers associ-
ated with BP variations (e.g.
limb elevation, orthostatic
changes, and Valsalva). Furthermore, the validation of these blood
pressure variations was also addressed.
Methods
Using the commercial equipment BIOPAC MP35, a set of ECG and
PPG signals were acquired from healthy individuals during the man-
oeuvers, and PTT is calculated. Afterwards, the variations of BP were
computed using a mathematical relationship and a blood pressure
variation curve was obtained.
To validate the accuracy of this method, BP curves derived from PTT
were compared with well-known pressure variation changes associ-
ated with the autonomic manoeuvres, from which the pressure pro-
file is well documented in physiological studies. BP variations behave
accordingly to responses from feedback mechanisms to maintain
homeostasis.
Conclusions
This work establishes a diverse approach to assess BP changes, which
proved to be reliable and accurate. The use of this methodology is
an alternative to invasive and uncomfortable methods.

Background
Social participation has been extensively used in research and policy
reports in health and social care as an outcome, since the World
Health Organization published the International Classification of
Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) in 2001. Objective: To de-
scribe the development and validation of a questionnaire to measure
participation of adults (Activities and Participation Profile related to
Mobility; APPM) in their everyday activities.
Methods
The instrument was constructed within the frames of the ICF; the
items are supported by results from previous studies and focus
groups. The instrument’s internal consistency was assessed using
Cronbach’s alpha coefficient. The content validity of the question-
naire was evaluated by linking the 18 items to the ICF. For construct
validity, it was conjectured that the need for assistive technologies
(AT) help of the arms to stand up from a chair, being sedentary and
presence of falls were a mirror for more severely impaired perform-
ance, leading to a major limitation of activities and restrictions on
participation relating to mobility. Criterion validity was investigated
by correlation with FES.
Results
One hundred and fifty community dwelling adults (mean age 68.71 +/-
9.09 years old) participated in the study. The APPM demonstrated good
internal reliability (alpha 0.90), indicating good homogeneity. All prede-
fined hypotheses involving expected differences between groups and
significant correlations between FES and APPM were confirmed.
Conclusions
The APPM demonstrated good psychometric properties and can be
used as a reliable and valid measure to assess community dwelling
adults' social participation over the age of 55 years.

Background
EASYCare is a multidimensional
for assessing self-
perception of the health care needs of the elderly population in pri-
mary health care. The latest version of this tool is the EASYCare-2010
Standard. Objective: This study aimed to validate the EASYCare-2010
Standard in older Portuguese people.
Methods
The sample comprises 244 participants with 65 years old or over re-
cruited at Primary Health Care Centres from the Portuguese National
Health Service. The World Health Organization Quality of Life Assess-
ment Instrument-Short and the Tinetti test were considered for con-
struct validity.
Results
Results from this study revealed a two-factor model through Categor-
ical Data Principal Component Analysis. The internal consistency of
this instrument had highly acceptable levels. The results also showed
that in the polytomous items of EASYCare-2010 Standard some of

the categories were not considered at all or only by a small number
of participants.
Results
The EASYCare-2010 Standard factors were named “mobility and activ-
ities of daily life” and “general well-being and safety” and were asso-
ciated with measures of quality of life with a moderate correlation
with balance and gait. The instrument could be simplified, replacing
polytomous with dichotomous items.
Conclusions
This study showed that the EASYCare-2010 Standard in Portugal is a
valid and reliable comprehensive geriatric assessment tool for older
community-dwelling people. However, the reduction and simplifica-
tion of items should be equated in a new revised version. More stud-
ies are needed in other countries using EASYCare-2010 Standard to
certify the results obtained.

Background
The assessment of range of shoulder flexion in clinical settings is usu-
ally performed in supine position. However, this assessment position
may not accurately reflect the impairments in shoulder mobility ob-
served in several real-life situations that involve sitting or standing
upright positions. This study aimed to assess the interrater and
intrarater reliability and agreement of range of shoulder flexion in
the upright position through photographic assessment.
Methods
Ten asymptomatic volunteers (4 males, 70.50 ± 10.29 years) partici-
pated in the study. They were photographed in the sagittal plane
while performing maximal shoulder flexion. Shoulder flexion angle
was then determined with computer-assisted digitising software.
Raters 1 and 2 independently performed the measurements once
and twice (respectively) using the standard goniometry landmarks:
lateral epicondyle of the humerus, lateral midline of the thorax, and
the centroid of the virtual glenohumeral joint region. Interrater and
intrarater reliability were calculated using Intraclass Correlation Coef-
ficients (ICC2,1) and agreement parameters using the 95 % limits of
agreement (LoA), standard error of the measurement (SEM) and min-
imal detectable change (MDC95).
Results
Excellent interrater (ICC2,1 = 0.98 95 % confidence intervals [95%CI] =
0.93–0.99, SEM = 1.54°, MDC95 = 4.28°) and intrarater (ICC2,1 = 0.99,
95%CI = 0.98–0.99, SEM = 0.85°, MDC95 = 2.36°) reliability and agree-
ment results were found. The LoA followed the same trend (intrarater
LoA: -2.80°–1.91°; interrater LoA: -2.04°–6.51°).
Conclusions
Assessment of range of shoulder flexion in the upright position using
photographic analysis is highly reliable and provides acceptable
measurement error to be used in clinical practice. Further research is
necessary to validate this measurement against ’gold standard’ mea-
sures (e.g., 3D motion tracking device).

Human tissue loss or end-stage organ failure resulting from an injury or
a disease is a major health care problem in the world as the trans-
plantation of tissues or organs in these patients is severely limited by
availability of compatible donors.
In this context, three-dimensional
biofabrication techniques have emerged as powerful tools to produce
functional homogeneous/heterogeneous substitutes (scaffolds), which
have a huge potential to fulfil biological and mechanical requirements
in order to achieve the full tissue regeneration.
Accordingly, several 3D biofabrication techniques have been developed
and tested to produce anatomically correct biological substitutes
through the use of computer-controlled 3D devices to accurately de-
posit biomaterials, drugs/growth factors/cells into precise geometries.
Given the multitude of 3D scaffolds applications, ranging from in vitro
studies using a combination of 3D biocompatible and biodegradable
structures with drugs/growth factors/living cells to in vivo implantation
in order to pursue the full tissue regeneration, 3D biofabrication tech-
niques can have a significant impact on the future of health care and
well-being.
Advantages, drawbacks, results and capabilities of these kind of 3D
scaffolds, techniques, ex vivo and in vivo studies are detailed. New
directions in research on biofabrication for full tissue regeneration
are also pointed out.

Traditionally, additive manufacturing (AM) uses digital information from a
computer-aided design (CAD) file that is later converted to a stereo-
lithography (STL) file format in order to produce a physical part. The sur-
faces of a 3D computer model are approximated by a set of triangular
facets and then sliced to generate a series of layers for fabrication. The STL
file format has become the standard for the data input of AM systems.
Digital information contained in the STL standard format is related to
the vertex co-ordinates, which define each triangle and its outer nor-
mal. Despite of some STL file improvements focused on solving over-
lapping surfaces, gaps, and intersections between facets, this is not
suitable for multimaterial additive biomanufacturing. Despite others
approaches have also been developed, mainly focused in biofabrica-
tion processes, they are not able to deal with multimaterial scaffolds.
To overcome the above mentioned drawbacks, a novel multidimen-
sional computer approach for biofabrication is presented, allowing
the production of biological multimaterial substitutes with tailored
properties improving mechanical and biological performance in tis-
sue engineering applications.

Background
There is a shortage of a validated instruments to evaluate the effect-
iveness of rehabilitation interventions in adolescents with motor im-
pairment. The purpose of this study was to develop an instrument to
measure functional
independence perceived by adolescents with
motor impairment, and evaluate its psychometric qualities.
Methods
Based on the Functional Independence Measure scale (FIM) we de-
veloped a self-report multidimensional
instrument, to assess func-
tional
independence in adolescents. Ratings are made on an
oriented format with five points, 1 (I can’t), 2 (I can with much help),
to 5 (I can without help). The final version of the instrument (16
items), were tested on a convenience sample of 101 adolescents with
motor impairment. The pilot test served not only to test their under-
standability, but also to evaluate their psychometric qualities (sensi-
tivity, reliability and validity).
Results
The final version of SSFIA 16 items (Motor Domain) psychometric
qualities was assessed by Internal consistency (Cronbach’s α = 0.938,
split-half using Spearman & Brown correction α = 0.869). Construct
validity was evaluated using principal factor analysis method with
varimax orthogonal rotations, and revealed a tridimensional structure
and explained 74.6 % of the variance (elimination, self-care and
transfers). We found good support for convergent (FIM scale rp =
0.83 and rp > 0.5 between items) and discriminant validity (average
variance extracted analysis).
Conclusions
The good psychometric qualities showed a clear evidence that the
newly developed instrument provides a sensitive, reliable and valid
tool to assess the functionality (motor domain) in adolescents with
motor impairment.

Methods
Quantitative study with a sample of N = 687 (89.2 % nurses and 10.8 %
physicians of 50 units of medical and surgery services from Portuguese
hospitals, age > 35 years, 75.8 % female). Measure: Organizational Trust

Results
According to eigenvalue >1, two factors were extracted with Explora-
tory factor analysis (EFA) for Organizational Trust (KMO = .891, X2(66) =

(33.70 % EV; M = 4.62, SD = 0.90), F2-Avoid opportunism (27.17 % EV;
M = 3.52, SD = 1.10). Reliability was good (Cronbach’s α = .88 and α = .85
for F1 and F2, respectively). The item-factor correlations showed values
greater than 0.74, consistent with construct validity. This factorial struc-
ture was supported by Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), with a good
fit: CMIN/50 = 1.92, RMSEA = .047 (LO90 = .033, HI90 = .061), NFI = .955,
CFI = .978. Both “Honesty” (F1) and “Avoid opportunism” (F2) were
equal across gender, F(1, 397) = 0.39 and 0.52, respectively, p > .40, and
also across nurses and physicians, F(1, 322) = 1.72 and 0.25, p > .25.
“Honesty” and “Avoid opportunism” shared 28 % of the variance and
were not influenced by years of work.
Conclusions
The Organizational Trust Inventory-Short Form (OTI-SF) in health ser-
vices showed adequate psychometric properties. The instrument is
useful to measure organizational trust in health services.

Background
The burden associated to work-related musculoskeletal disorders is
increasing and the need for research about technologies that allow a
better understanding of this problem is well identified. The use of
thermal imaging in occupational health research has been increasing
but not to assess physiotherapy related tasks. Thermal symmetry re-
flects normal physiology and is defined as the degree of similarity
between the skin temperature of two regions of interest mirrored
across the human body longitudinal axis.
Methods
Fifteen (15) physiotherapy final year graduation students (age: 25.5 ±
5.4 years; BMI: 22.9 ± 2.8 Kg.m-2) underwent thermographic evalu-
ation before,
immediately after and 5 minutes after a passive hip
hyper-extension mobilization task performed at a rate of 20 mobiliza-
tions per minute, during 4 minutes. The region of interest selected
for analysis was located in the area of both upper trapezius muscles.
Thermal images were obtained using a calibrated FLIR A325 camera
with 320 x 240 resolution, 70 mK sensitivity and ± 2 % accuracy. Pre-
viously published recommendations were followed to capture ther-
mal images.
Results
The passive mobilization task induced statistically significant changes
in skin temperature. Thermal symmetry values increased from 0.1 ±
0.1 °C before the mobilization task to 0.4 ± 0.2 °C immediately after
the task and 0.5 °C 5 minutes after. Statistically significant differences
were found between thermal symmetry values before and 5 minutes
after the task (p < 0.01).
Conclusions
The findings of this study provided interesting data regarding task
asymmetry. Thermal symmetry values reflected the increase in skin

temperature observed in the dominant side as a result of the
mobilization task.

Background
Every year 15 million people suffer an episode of stroke, worldwide.
During the recovery therapy, the evaluation of patients' progress is
carried out by doctors and specialized therapists. The application of
technology in health care has attracted the attention of engineering
for the support of recovery therapy practices. Nowadays, advances in
information and communication technologies allow the creation of
systems to support and evaluate the physical recovery of people that
help health professionals evaluating the recovery of their patients. Objec-
tives: The main objective of this work is to gather the requirements to im-
plement a system focused on monitoring the upper limb rehabilitation of
post stroke patients, establishing a link between main hospitals and pa-
tients when they are recovering at home or in proximity centres.
Methods
We used ethnographic methodology to examine the daily routines of
patients in the recovery process. The information gathered was com-
bined with interviews with therapists and medical doctors about the
monitoring of the recovery process and therapy practices.
Results
The characterization of patients’ daily routines in the rehabilitation
process, the exercises performed and the major physiological data
required for monitoring rehabilitation recovery instruments was car-
ried out. A combined perspective and analysis of the rehabilitation
process is in an engineering-ready format for prototype implementa-
tion and pilot deployment.
Conclusions
The results of this study allow the specification of an innovative
digital platform for stroke rehabilitation and patient monitoring,
using pervasive technologies embedded with patients’ daily life with-
out requiring explicit interaction of the patients or changes in daily
routines.

Background
Paranoid ideation is consistently found to be a thought process that
is present across the population continuum, and a theme that most
people find in their everyday thoughts. However, it is important to be
able to distinguish subclinical or less severe forms of this phenomena

from more clinical manifestations of paranoid beliefs. Objective: To pro-
vide preliminary data on the psychometric properties of the Portuguese
version of the Paranoia Checklist in a mixed sample (47 patients and
157 healthy controls).
Methods
Self-report questionnaires were completed by 202 participants, with
the aid of a psychologist when necessary.
Results
The PC has shown excellent internal consistency (frequency, convic-
tion and distress subscales α > .96) and is a brief and simple measure
capable of distinguishing between a clinical and non-clinical group
of participants regarding the dimensions of frequency and conviction
of paranoid thoughts. Participants from the clinical and non-clinical
groups did not present statistically significant differences regarding
the distress resulting from the paranoid thoughts.
Conclusions
Overall, the clinical population presented increased scores in all di-
mensions of paranoia in comparison to the healthy controls, similarly
to the original studies with the English version of the checklist. The
assessment of paranoia has been shown to be a continuum process
common to clinical and non-clinical groups. The PC is a psychomet-
rically sound measure to assess different paranoid thoughts on a
multidimensional perspective and with sensitivity to distinguish
groups of patients and healthy individuals, being suitable for use
both in clinical and research settings.

Background
Morningness-eveningness, also known as chronotype, reflects dem-
onstrable inter-individual differences in the peak timings (but not in
the amount) of several circadian rhythms. The Composite Scale of
Morningness (CSM) by Smith et al. (1989) [1] is one of the most
widely used tools to access it. It has been long used in research in
Portugal, but very few detailed reports exist about its psychometric
properties in younger ages and student samples in our country. Ob-
jective: to report reliability and validity data about the Portuguese
version (Pt) of the CSM in high school and university students.
Methods
Three hundred eighty-seven (387) high school students (7th to 12th
grades, 51.5 %F) and 1654 undergraduates (1st to 3rd grades, 55.0%F)
completed the CMS-Pt version [2], plus a set of self-report questions on
sleep patterns in order to examine the questionnaire validity.
Results
As to internal consistency, Cronbach alpha coefficients were 0.81 in
each sample (high school and undergraduate students). Corrected
item-total correlations ranged from .27 to .55 (high schoolers) and

from .31 to .59 (undergraduates). As to validity, lower morningness
scores were associated, as expected, with later sleep-wake schedules
and mid-points of
sleep. Correlations between morningness-
eveningness scores and sleep patterns were generally larger for sleep
schedules variables than for time in bed or sleep durations, suggest-
ing convergent and discriminant validity, respectively. Scale structure
agreed with previous literature reports.
Conclusions
The CSM-Pt version is a reliable and valid tool
to measure
morningness-eveningness in adolescents and young adults’ stu-
dents with ages ranging from 12 to 25 years old.

Background
Patient satisfaction with nursing care appears as an important indica-
tor for the evaluation of Structure factors – allocation of nurses, and
Process factors – providing nursing care. The research aimed to
evaluate the psychometric properties of the Patient Satisfaction with
Nursing Care Scale (SUCEH21) in a Hospital, and also the reconstruc-
tion and validation of the scale’s new version.
Methods
We carried out a quantitative study, cross-sectional, sample of 1,290
patients admitted in 43 services, from 8 Portuguese hospitals. Con-
firmatory factor analysis (CFA) did not allow the confirmation of fac-
torial structure.
The original model was composed by 6 factors and 21 items and re-
vealed an unacceptable quality of adjustment (χ2(176) = 5050.132; p =
0.000; χ2/gl = 28.694; GFI = 0.765; PGFI = 0.583; RMSEA = 0.147). The
model is valid only with 3 factors, ending up with a total of 13 items
(χ2/gl = 6.017; p = 0.000; GFI = 0.958; PGFI = 0.600; RMSEA = 0.062).
Results
The exploratory factor analysis (EFA) studies confirm the number of
factors found (Quality of Care, Quality of Information, Quality of Nurs-
ing Care) and 18 items. We found that the 3 factors are individually
more extensive, covering the aspects that included the 6 initial fac-
tors. The final version of the Evaluation of Patient Satisfaction with
Nursing Care Scale (EASCCE18) has an index of reliability (α = 0.875)
and validity (total variance explained of 71.5 %) higher than those
presented by SUCEH21.
Conclusions
Psychometric studies demonstrate this is a potential tool for the re-
search and monitoring of patient satisfaction with nursing care.

Background
Cost-utility analysis (CUA) cannot be developed when the condition-
specific measures do not allow calculation of quality-adjusted life-
years (QALYs), as they do not provide utility scores. The revised ver-
sion of the fibromyalgia impact questionnaire (FIQR) is the most
common fibromyalgia specific questionnaire. The main aim of the
current study was to develop a mapping algorithm which enables
FIQR scores to be transformed into utility scores that can be used in
economic analyses.
Methods
Data was obtained from 192 Spanish women with fibromyalgia aged
between 23 and 83 years old. Several multi-attribute utility (MAU)
instruments (EQ-5D-5 L, AQoL-8D, 15D and SF-6D) were selected to
develop a mapping algorithm from FIQR. The “transfer to utility re-
gression approach” was the technique selected for mapping analysis.
Two models were calculated: I) using the total score of FIQR as inde-
pendent variable and II) using the score in the three domains of
FIQR. Age was included in both models.
Results
There were relevant differences between utility scores of the four
analysed MAU instruments. All FIQR sub-scales were significantly cor-
related with the utility score of all MAU questionnaires (p < 0.0001).
The predicted mean utilities using ordinary least squares (OLS) or
generalized linear model (GLM) were always identical (up to three
decimals) to the observed means. Both OLS and GLM showed good
performance, with relatively low error values. The best model for esti-
mation of FIQR utilities from MAU instruments differs depending on
the MAU questionnaire.
Conclusions
The current study enables CUA using data from the most used fibro-
myalgia specific disease questionnaire.

Background
In Portugal, there are few validated instruments to assess resilience
in the adolescent population. Our main objective was a preliminary
adaptation and validation of the Rating Scale of Resilient Self (RSRS)
to Portuguese adolescents. Additionally, in the same sample, we ex-
plored the associations between resilience, self-harm and suicidal
ideation in adolescence.

Methods
226 adolescents (male, n = 139, 61.5 %; age range = 12-18 years) filled
in a protocol consisting of a sociodemographic questionnaire, the
Rating Scale of Resilient Self (RSRS), the Impulse, Self-harm and Sui-
cide Ideation Questionnaire for Adolescents and the Self-concept
Scale.
Results
The RSRS showed good internal consistency (α = 0.857) and good
temporal stability (r = 0.720). A principal component analysis showed
that RSRS has three factors: external support;
internal personal
strengths; coping strategies. Resilience was negatively correlated with
self-harm and suicidal
ideation and positively correlated with self-
concept, confirming the divergent and convergent validity of RSRS.
There were high levels of resilience in this sample (M = 58.69, SD =
6.67). In the total sample, 61.5 % (n = 139) presented suicidal ideation
and 26.5 % (n = 60) self-harm behaviours.
Conclusions
The RSRS presented good psychometric properties. It can be consid-
ered a valid and useful instrument, and can be safely used in the
evaluation of resilience in Portuguese adolescents. With this study
we extended the range of valid instruments for the measurement of
resilience in adolescents and contributed to the advance of research
in the area of adolescence in Portugal.

Background
Pressure ulcer incidence represents an indicator of healthcare quality.
Several instruments are used in clinical practice to assess and identify
patients at risk of developing pressure ulcers, however the prevent-
ive interventions were not always fully implemented and the inci-
dence of pressure ulcer in inpatient setting is still high. Some studies
reported a correlation between pressure ulcer development and the
length of stay. Objectives: To identify the day of the first pressure
ulcer development in inpatient setting.
Methods
Retrospective cohort analysis of electronic health record database
from adult patients, admitted to medical and surgical areas in a Por-
tuguese hospital during 2012, without any pressure ulcer at the ad-
mission. The development of the first pressure ulcer was associated
with the length of inpatient stay.
Results
From a sample of 6,572 participants, 153 (2.3 %) developed their first
pressure ulcer during the length of inpatient stay. The median length
of stay was 6 days (Q25 = 3 days; Q75 = 10 days), being the max-
imum 134 days. During the first week, 80 participants (52.3 %) devel-
oped their first pressure ulcer. The highest frequency of participants
that developed their first pressure ulcer occurred on the 5th day
(minimum 2nd day; maximum 82nd day) and the median was on the
7th day.
Conclusions
Our study showed that the first week was particularly critical for pres-
sure ulcer development and should be a period of highest nursing
surveillance and preventive interventions. However, more studies are
needed to better understand the correlation between time and pres-
sure ulcer development.

BMC Health Services Research 2016, 16(Suppl 3):O165

Background
Self-criticism is characterized by self-blame and negative self-
judgements, often associated with the onset of psychopathology and
interpersonal difficulties. Two forms of self-criticism were conceptual-
ized: the inadequate self (feelings of inadequacy or deficiency), and
the hated self (more intense feelings of self-disgust and aggressive-
ness directed towards the self). On the other hand, the reassured self
was conceptualized as the acceptance of past failure and mistakes,
which is believed to be a protective factor against psychological
problems. Objective: This study is aimed at adapting and presenting
preliminary findings on the Forms of Self-Criticizing and Self-
Reassuring Scale for Portuguese children (FSCSR-C).
Methods
A sample of 127 children participated in this study and were adminis-
tered a research protocol including the FSCSR-C. Results: after deleting
items that presented reliability and saturation problems, exploratory
factor analysis with orthogonal rotation yielded a 3-factor solution that
explained 49.33 % of the total FSCRS-C scores. The measure revealed a
good internal consistency of the 3 factors found in the exploratory ana-
lysis: Inadequate self (α = 0.66), hated self (α = 0.73), reassured self (α =
0.69). Convergent and divergent validity were established with mea-
sures of shame and emotional intelligence.
Conclusions
Self-criticism can make individuals more vulnerable to psychopath-
ology in adult life, and that such internal relationship models may
arise early in childhood. Findings indicate that the FSCRS-C is and ad-
equate measure to assess self-criticizing and self-reassuring in chil-
dren with 8 years old or above. The FSCRS-C may constitute an
important contribution for future research and in the development
of preventive and intervention strategies for children.

BMC Health Services Research 2016, 16(Suppl 3):O166

Background
Experts recommend that the perinatal depression screening should
combine the evaluation of depressive symptoms and of psychosocial
risk factors. Objective: To analyse the predictive ability of the Perinatal
Depression Screening and Prevention Tool (PDSP Tool) assessing both
PD symptoms and risk factors previously identified by our team (life-
time history of depression/LtHD, prenatal insomnia, increased depres-
sive symptoms and negative affect/NA at pregnancy) to identify clinical
relevant postpartum depression.

Methods
Ninety-two (92) pregnant women (Mean age: 32.64 ± 4.59 years) in
their second trimester of pregnancy (21.38 ± 2.41 weeks of gestation)
completed the PDSP Tool; at six (6.34 ± 1.66) weeks postpartum they
completed the Postpartum Depression Screening Scale (PDSS-21), in
order to determine if they scored above or below the PDSS-21 cut
off point for clinical depression (>40).
Results
Eighteen women (19.6 %) presented PDSS-21 scores > 40. The global
correct classification rate of the PDSP Tool was 65.2 %. The false-
negative rate was 4.3 %, the false-positive rate was 35.9 %, the true-
negative rate was 44.6 % and the true-positive rate was 15.2 %. Con-
sidering the PDSP Tool components, 61.0 % of the women scoring
PDSS-24 > 43 at pregnancy (X2 = 14.24, OR = 7.37); 38.9 % of women
with LtHD (X2 = 14.24, OR = 7.37) and 66.7 % of women with high NA
at pregnancy (X2 = 17.64, OR = 9.38) (all p < .001) presented PDSS-
21 > 40 in the postpartum.
Conclusions
Clinically it is a very difficult task to identify the pregnant women
who will have significant depressive symptoms in the postpartum.
Our preliminary results are encouraging, by showing that using the
PDS Tool can help we identify approximately two-thirds of these
women.

Background
Poor sleep and insomnia symptoms (e.g., difficulties in initiating or
maintaining sleep, early morning awakenings,
light sleep) are
amongst the most common sleep complaints in adult’s populations,
and especially in older ages. The Basic Scale on Insomnia com-
plaints and Quality of Sleep (BaSIQS) [1] was developed as a brief
tool to access sleep quality and insomnia complaints, in alternative
either to longer questionnaires (such as the PSQI, the Pittsburgh
Sleep Quality Index) or to single item assessments, and has already
shown appropriate psychometric properties in higher-education
samples. Objective: To assess the reliability and validity of the
BaSIQS in non-student adults with varying age ranges and in the
elderly.
Methods
Sample 1 comprised exclusively 60 elderly people (65 % women)
from 66 to 89 years old, 30 institutionalized and 30 non-
institutionalized. Sample 2 comprised 227 participants (52.2 % men)
from 20 to 79 years old. Participants completed the BaSIQS and two
questionnaires relevant for insomnia in order to examine scale valid-
ity (GSES-Glasgow Sleep Effort Scale and GCTI-Glasgow Contents of
Thought Inventory).
Results
As to internal consistency, Cronbach alpha coefficients were 0.73
(sample 1) and 0.84 (sample 2). Corrected item-total correlations
ranged from .28 to .61 (sample 1) and from .52 to .69 (sample 2).
Moderate to large associations were found between the BaSIQS,
GSES and GCTI, supporting construct validity. As expectable, women
and older individuals had higher sleep difficulties in all scales.

BMC Health Services Research 2016, Volume 16 Suppl 3

Page 85 of 132

Conclusions
BaSIQS shows suitable reliability and validity in young, middle-aged
and elderly adults, so that it may constitute a practical tool to briefly
assess perceived sleep quality and insomnia complaints.

Background
Skin cancer is becoming increasingly relevant due to its high rates of
incidence and mortality, being early detection of skin markers the
key for successful treatment. Digital
image processing (DIP) tech-
niques can quantitatively describe dermoscopic images, reducing the
effects of inter and intra individual differences in classification, re-
sulting from the subjectivity of human eye assessments. Moreover,
quantitative markers enable the use of automatic classifiers, which
should be regarded as an additional tool
in diagnosis. Objectives:
This work employs image descriptors and classification algorithms,
aimed to describe and differentiate cancerous from non-cancerous
skin images.
Methods
Texture and shape characteristics from 104 images were extracted,
representing 166 features. Subsequently, four groups were defined:
Texture, Shape and Local binary patterns (TSL); Texture and Shape
(TS); Texture and Local binary patterns (TL); and Texture (T). Next, the
ReliefF feature selection algorithm was employed to rank features.
For each group, the 10 %, 20 %, 40 % and 80 % of the best features
were selected. All subsets were used to construct models using four
machine learning (ML) methods implemented in the Weka frame-
work: J48 Decision Tree, Support Vector Machines, Nearest Neigh-
bour and Random Forest.
Results and conclusions
Among the ML used algorithms, J48 classifiers were considered
promising after reaching the higher score in a sensitivity derived
metric (14.01 in 16.00) when compared with the others.
Once the obtained ML classification reveals to be competitive, when
comparing with other related works, the results strengthen the idea
that DIP can be useful to provide a second opinion regarding skin
cancer diagnosis.

Background
Population health research primarily aims to find answers to various
health issues and the integrity of the results is largely determined by
the quality of the information produced. Objectives: To assess the
test-retest reliability of the data collected during home interviews
conducted by field interviewers in the Study of Health In Pomerode
(SHIP-BRAZIL) in partnership with the University Ernst-Moritz-Arndt
University of Greifswald in Germany.
Methods
Eight questions in the household questionnaire SHIP - BRAZIL study
were administered twice with an interval of 15 to 20 days, from May
to August 2015, with 85 participants. Test-retest reliability of the re-
sponses was estimated by the kappa statistic.
Results
Kappa coefficients ranged from 0.59 to 0.90. The Kappa values for
stratification by gender ranged from 0.71 to 0.92 in females and
0.64 to 0.94 for men. For ages they ranged between 0.54 and
0.90 in participants aged 40 years or more and 0.77 to 1.0 in par-
ticipants of 39 years old or less. By level of education they ranged
from 0.48 to 0.88 in participants with primary education and 0.82
to 0.92 in participants with high school and college. There was
no significant variation in agreement among sociodemographic
subgroups.
Conclusions
The high Kappa values indicate good reliability and reproducibility of
the data collected with the household questionnaire SHIP - BRAZIL
study between May-August 2015 ranging from moderate to perfect
agreement, ensuring the applicability of these data in future actions
of promotion and prevention of health.

Background
The exposure to sun ultraviolet radiation has important implications
on public health. The intensive and intermittent solar exposure is as-
sociated with well reported complications and the younger popula-
tion is a target due to the increase of malignant pathology of skin.
The aim of this study was to characterize sun protection and sun ex-
posure behaviour among medical students from Nova Medical
School (Lisbon).

Page 86 of 132

Methods
We performed an exploratory, descriptive and cross-sectional study.
This study included 186 students from the Faculty of Medical Sciences
of the Nova Medical School, Universidade Nova de Lisboa, between the
ages of 17 and 39. The information was acquired by self-administered
questionnaires that collected information about sociodemographic and
behaviour variables including sun exposition and the used methods to
protect from sun exposition.
Results
High prevalence of solar exposure has been verified among the stu-
dents. The association between sociodemographic variables and the
use of sunscreen has not been proven, except when it comes to
“age”. There has been evidence of association between lower photo-
type and the anuse of Sun Protection Factor (SPF) 6-10. The practice
more used was “to find a shadow” and the less used was “use of hat,
cap or scarf on the head”.
Conclusions
This study revealed a high prevalence of solar exposure in the sum-
mer, sunburns and low adherence to protective measures, except for
the use of sunscreen. However, the pattern of use is unsatisfactory
when compared to the recommended guidelines, foreshadowing a
potential risk of development of associated complications. Hereupon,
the necessity of change in the behaviour of solar exposure and pro-
tection of students stands out.

Background
Spirituality is used by pregnant women as a coping strategy and in-
cludes: the need for respect; the individual’s quest for individual
fulfilment; and the meaning of life and the experiences to which
they are subject. Objectives: To identify the sociodemographic
characteristics of pregnant women; determine the level of spiritu-
ality of pregnant women and to assess the relation between the
level of spirituality and some sociodemographic, obstetric and clin-
ical variables.
Methods
A quantitative, correlational and cross-sectional study, with a sample
of 143 pregnant women in prenatal consultation in the central re-
gion of Portugal. A questionnaire was applied on sociodemographic,
obstetric and clinical data and the "Scale for the assessment of spir-
ituality in the health settings" Pinto and Pais-Ribeiro (2007) was used.
Results
Participants/pregnant women had an average age of 32.13 years (s =
4.93), are married/have partners (74.1 %), Portuguese (95.8 %), cath-
olic (86.0 %), with secondary education (42.7 %) and live with the
father of the unborn child (93.0 %). The sample included women in
their first pregnancy (31.5 %), who desired the pregnancy (98.6 %),
with a diagnosed disease (18.2 %) and previous abortion (16.1 %).

value (Xmed = 12.5).
It was verified that there are significant differ-
ences between the level of spirituality and: nationality (U = 203.0; p =
0.035) and education (X2 = 7.89; p = 0.019).
Conclusions
This study showed the need for spirituality as the focus of nursing
care, the importance of this in the transition process, justifying the
need to include assessment tools of spiritual well-being in clinical
settings.

Background
Polypharmacy is associated with drug–drug interactions, adverse
increased mortality and rising costs.
drug events, hospitalization,
Older cancer patients are potentially vulnerable to polypharmacy be-
cause cancer treatment often involves exposure to chemotherapy
and other adjunctive or supportive medication. Furthermore, the
majority of elderly patients with cancer have pre-existing medical
conditions requiring pharmacotherapy. This study allowed us to
characterize the drugs administered to elderly patients undergo-
ing chemotherapy treatments and to investigate the prevalence
of polypharmacy.
Method
This was an observational and transversal study of older cancer pa-
tients admitted to three different medical centres of both genders
aged > 65 years old undergoing chemotherapy treatments. The
medication review included patient self-report and medical records.
This study included 559 elderly patients. Mean age was 71.9 years
(SD = 0.2). 44 % were women. Mean number of medications re-
ported was 5.
The total number of medications used for the 559 patients was 2699,
58 % of them corresponding to drugs administered out of cancer
treatment contexts.
Results
When analysed individually, the most prescribed drugs were Proton
Pump Inhibitors (261/559; 47 %); HMG CoA reductase inhibitors (161/
559; 29 %); Anxiolytics, Benzodiazepine derivatives (149; 27 %); Drugs
for Functional Gastrointestinal Disorders, Propulsives (106/559; 19 %)
and Analgesics and Antipyretics, Anilides (96/559; 17 %). The preva-
lence of polypharmacy (> = 5 medications) was 48 %.
Conclusions
Polypharmacy is prevalent in older people with cancer. A careful as-
sessment of the medication used in older patients needs to be part
of the routine evaluation to minimize risks associated with polyphar-
macy. However, more research is needed to identify strategies to
simplify patients’ medication regimens.

Background
Caregivers are often subject of huge physical, emotional, psycho-
logical, spiritual, social and financial demands, which can seriously
compromise their quality of life (QOL). Objective: To translate, adapt
and validate the Quality of life in life threatening illness-family carer
version (QOLLTI-C) of Cohen et al (2006) [1], to the Portuguese cul-
ture, for caregivers of people with chronic and advanced disease.
Methods
We applied a questionnaire consisting of demographic data and the
QOLLTI-C to 314 caregivers of patients with palliative needs. The
sample is predominantly female (84.1 %; 264), with an average age
of 63 years old (±11). Through the process of validation and cultural
adaptation, we followed the methodological steps recommended by
international guidelines. The study of the items and respective reli-
ability was done according to two criteria: determining the Pearson
correlation coefficient and the Cronbach's alpha (α). The construct
validation was done by factorial analysis. Throughout the study,
Helsinki Declaration Principles were followed.
Results
The QOLLTI-C-PT has an internal consistency with 13 items, α = 0.780,
a 0.736 KMO, and a Bartlett's sphericity test of 1189.967 (p < 0.001).
Using the Kaiser criterion, we obtained four factors that explain
61.89 % of the total variance: Factor 1 – social domain (items 1, 12,
13, 14, 15); Factor 2 – Spiritual domain (items 9, 10, 11); Factor 3 –
Psychological domain (items 3, 4, 5) and Factor 4 – Physical and
emotional domain (items 7, 8).
Conclusions
The instrument showed an adequate factorial validity and reliability, in
the sample under study, and can be used to access QOL in Portuguese
caregivers.

Background
Shame is a social emotion with specific and adaptive functions, in-
volved in complex human behaviour and social
interactions. The
study of shame gained increased interest in several research fields,
particularly in mental health, as an involuntary response associated
with self-consciousness,
loss of status and self-devaluation. Early
shame experiences have been consistently reported as an import-
ant factor in the development of psychopathology, emphasizing
the importance of evaluating shame and the negative representa-
tions of the self from an early age. Aims: This study’s goal
is to
adapt and present preliminary psychometric data on the Other as
Shamer Scale to Portuguese children (8 years or over), a scale

devised to assess external shame (how one believes one appears in
the eyes of others).
Methods
A sample of 127 children participated in this study and a research
protocol was administered including the OAS adapted for children
(OAS-C).
Results
Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) was computed and the one-factor
solution explained 48.85 % of the total variance of the scale. The
measure also showed good internal consistency (α = .84). Convergent
and divergent validity was found with measures of self-criticism and
self-reassurance, and emotional intelligence.
Conclusions
The OAS-C is a brief and adequate measure of external shame in chil-
dren, with the potential to be used by professionals in clinical and re-
search settings. Moreover, the availability of a widely used measure
of external shame will also facilitate transnational and cross-cultural
studies by warranting score comparability across several countries
and also across the lifespan.

Background
Emotional intelligence (EI) has been linked to effective communica-
tion in education environments, better study skills, stress and conflict
management, and academic and workplace success. Measuring EI
could provide information to access and monitoring emotional skills.
Objective: To test psychometric properties of the Portuguese version
of Wong and Low Emotional Intelligence Scale (WLEIS-P) in a sample
of Health care students.
Methods
We applied a questionnaire consisting of demographic data and
WLEIS-P to a sample of 672 health care students in Dietetics, Nursing,
Physiotherapy, Speech Therapy and Occupational Therapy, mostly fe-
males (85.4 %), M = 21.6 years old (±4.17). The process of validation
followed the methodological steps recommended by international
guidelines. The study of the items and respective reliability was done
by determination of Pearson correlation coefficient and the Cronba-
ch's alpha(α). Construct validation was done by factorial analysis.
Helsinki Declaration Principles were attended.
Results
The WLEIS-P applies to students has a good internal consistency with
16 items, α = 0.825, a 0.825 KMO, and a Bartlett's sphericity test of
3691.523 (p < 0.001). Using the Kaiser criterion, we obtained four fac-
tors that explain 61.52 % of the total variance: Factor 1- Self-
emotional appraisal (items 1,2,3,4); Factor 2- Emotional appraisal of
others (items 5,6, 7, 8); Factor 3 – Use of emotion (items 9,10,11,12)
and Factor 4 – Regulation of emotion (items 13, 14, 15, 16).
Conclusions
WLEIS-P revealed an adequate factorial validity and reliability in the
sample of health students, better than previous Portuguese valid-
ation, therefore it can be used to access Emotional
Intelligence in
Portuguese students.

Background
The innovative and transformative use of information technology im-
proves professional practice, helps in the management and establish-
ment of public policy and in knowledge creation. The platform
SISREDE, created in 2002, stores the medical card of citizens of the
public system, and was considered the most advanced platform in
the country. Besides the monitoring and reporting of prevalent dis-
eases, like hypertension, it even allows access to SISPRENATAL, part
of the system that receives the data of pregnant women. Objectives:
To compare the assistance indicators of prenatal from SISREDE/
SISPRENATAL data and the whole volume of attendance regis-
tered on computers managed by professionals for the use of such
resources in Etelvina Carneiro Health Centre, located in the North
of Belo Horizonte.
Methods
Technicians from Belo Horizonte Council and researchers have
created specific training for doctors and nurses involved in the
unit’s prenatal assistance. After such preparation, the productivity
of a quarter year was compared from national and state prenatal
assistance.
Results
The minority of professionals received previous training to use the
system and/or were unaware of what was needed within the proto-
col for prenatal assistance and generating trusted indicators. The
numbers after the intervention demonstrated an exponential
im-
provement of prenatal assistance indicators.
Conclusions
The making of health indicators contributes to public policy and re-
source management.
There are several
limitations for such data effectively reflecting
Health Care Centre assistance. The professional specialization for the
system’s management and the intrinsic delays for such this relate to
a lower index than the actual number of assistances.

Background
Hope has been defined as a dynamic life force, an important phe-
nomenon in the promotion, maintenance and sustenance of life. At
this level there are several strategies that promote hope that have
been described in the literature, including the involvement of the ex-
tended family, especially in its relationship with the anguish of expe-
riences in parents of children with special health care needs.
Objective: To identify the resources and hope interactions in an
inter-generational perspective on child family with cerebral palsy.

Methods
This qualitative study was conducted with a sample of parents of
children with cerebral palsy in the area of influence of Administração
Regional de Saúde (ARS) of Lisboa and Vale do Tejo. For data collec-
tion and treatment, semi-structured interviews and content analysis
were used, respectively.
Results
From the parents' perspective the Hope genogram was co-constructed.
They identified the family as a network of support and encouragement.
Optimism, self-efficacy of mothers in caring for their children and the
acceptance of their health condition were valued as positive psycho-
logical factors. From the analysis of indicators emerged personal attri-
butes, relationships and bond established with other family members.
Hope was valued in the coping process, playing a significant role in the
adjustment of mothers to children's health.
Conclusions
Hope genogram is an instrument that facilitates the assessment of
the internal and external structure of the family of children with cere-
bral palsy. It allowed the identification of stories of hope as well as
personal attributes and patterns of hope promoters as interactions
established among members.

Background
The quality of life related to postpartum health is influenced by sev-
eral factors. Purpose: The aim is to analyse the quality of life related
to the health of women immediately postpartum.
Methods
It is a cross-sectional, correlational study, performed in a public hos-
pital of reference in Piauí, Brazil. Two hundred and seventy-two (272)
women in immediate postpartum were interviewed between Febru-
ary and June 2015. A questionnaire with clinical data and the scale
for the evaluation quality of life - Short Form Health Survey (SF-36)
were used.
Results
The sample was composed by young mothers, living with a partner
(76.8 %); with an average of 10 years of study; 74.3 % didn't follow
gainful occupation. In assessing the quality of life related to health
from the SF-36, the average total score was 69.94. The association
between type of delivery, attending professionals and the mean
scores of the Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) showed that the do-
mains of physical limitations (41.37), pain (67.53), vitality (62.75), so-
cial issues (74.78), limitations due to emotional problems (58.05) and
mental health (75.86) had higher mean scores for vaginal delivery
performed by a nurse, in which the statistically significant domains
were pain, vitality and mental health. There was a significant associ-
ation with age and the domains of functional capacity and general
health, as well as education and the "functioning" domain.
Conclusions
The results indicated that vaginal delivery performed by the nurse
promotes better scores in quality of life related to health of mothers.

Background
Cervical cancer is considered a serious public health problem. Object-
ive: To analyse the influence between social determinants and
women’s beliefs regarding Pap smear and cervical cancer by using
the scale Health Belief Model Scale for Cervical Cancer and Pap
Smear Test.
Methods
Cross-sectional study conducted in a primary care unit in Fortaleza,
Brazil, with 175 women. For data collection, it was used the socio-
demographic and gynaecological characterization form based on the
Model of Social Determinants of Health involving individual, prox-
imal, intermediate determinants and influence of social networks, be-
yond the scale. Data was collected in May 2015.
Results
Women over 30 years old had better perception regarding cervical
cancer seriousness (p = 0.024); women with menarche over 11 years
old had high health motivation (p = 0.052); women with less educa-
tion had many barriers to realize the preventive exam (p = 0.000) and
better perception of cervical cancer seriousness (p = 0.000). Concern-
ing the perception of cervical cancer seriousness, stood out women
with a partner (p = 0.030), pregnant women (p = 0.010), those who
have sex currently (p =0.029) and those who currently owned partner
(p = 0.020). Those with income less than one salary had lot of barriers
to realize the preventive exam (p = 0.000).
Conclusions
The social determinants of health influenced health beliefs for cer-
vical cancer. Therefore, to intervene in such determinants may con-
tribute to decrease the morbidity and mortality caused by this
disease.

BMC Health Services Research 2016, 16(Suppl 3):O180

Background
We aimed to test the Portuguese version of the Anxiety Sensitivity
Scale 3 – ASI-3-PT factor structure, by comparing the fit of the data
for a unidimensional and a multidimensional hierarchical approach.
Methods
We recruited a sample of 322 college students (mean age = 22.26;
SD = 5.75) of which 76.3 % were women. We tested the goodness of
fit of two models, conducting a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). In
Model 1, we proposed that Anxiety Sensitivity should be understood
as a unidimensional construct, with the items directly contributing to

a global score. In Model 2 we proposed that Anxiety Sensitivity is or-
ganized into different domains (social concerns, cognitive concerns
and physical concerns), with the items contributing to the global
construct but also, and to some extent, operating as independent.
Results
Results showed Model 2 to be the best fitting, where items loaded
onto a first-order factor which in turn loaded onto a second-order
factor which represents anxiety sensitivity. Model 1 had a poor fit to
the data (χ2 135 = 787.08, p < 0.001, CFI = 0.79; RMSEA = .12 (90 %,
.13), while the fit indices of Model 2 were satisfactory (χ2
CI = .11;
132 = 402.26, p < 0.001) CFI = .91, RMSEA = .08; (90 % CI = .07; .09).
Conclusions
In sum, the ASI-3-PT is an instrument aiming to measure the Anxiety
Sensitivity construct. Factorial analysis suggests it can be used as a
screening tool, assessing an Anxiety Sensitivity Global Index as well
as the Anxiety Sensitivity subscales of Physical, Social and Cognitive
Concerns.

Background
The transition to higher education can affect lifestyle-related factors.
Objectives: To identify lifestyles of higher education students and
analyse the influence of self-esteem and psychological well-being.
Methods
Correlational cross-sectional study. A total of 4,314 students partici-
pated in the study. Online questionnaires were used: Estilo de Vida
Fantástico (Fantastic Lifestyle Assessment) [1]; Questionário de Bem-
estar Psicológico (Psychological General Well-Being Questionnaire)
[2], and Escala de auto-estima de Rosenberg (Rosenberg Self-Esteem
Scale [3].
Results
Most students (85.3 %) have a healthy lifestyle. Lifestyle is strongly
correlated with self-esteem and psychological well-being (p < 0.001).
While analysing the association between self-esteem and psycho-
logical well-being and the various lifestyle domains according to gen-
der, a positive and significant correlation (p < 0.001) was found
among female students, except for the Smoking domain (p = 0.393);
in relation to psychological well-being, positive correlations were
found in all domains. Among male students, positive and significant
correlations (p < 0.001) were found in most lifestyle domains and
self-esteem, except for the Smoking (p = 0.992), Alcohol and other
drugs (p = 0.181) and Other behaviours (p = 0.442) domains; in rela-
tion to psychological well-being, positive and significant correlations
(p < 0.001) were found in most lifestyle domains, except for the
Smoking (p = 0.458) and Other behaviours (p = 0.128) domains.
Conclusions
Based on the results, higher education institutions should support
intervention projects to maintain high levels of psychological well-
being and self-esteem, promoting healthy lifestyles.

Background
Recognized as an important measure of outcome of health interven-
tion, the assessment of quality of life (QOL) is only now being used
in the field of intellectual disability (ID) and has never
in Portugal
been addressed to persons with permanent support needs/signifi-
cant disabilities. Therefore, and with the author’s permission, the
Escala of San Martin [1] was translated into Portuguese and a psy-
chometric study was initiated.
Method
Measuring the content validity of the instruments was one of the first
steps to accomplish, which was studied using descriptive (literature
review) and empirical evidence (experts’ quantitative analysis). After
the processes of translation and back-translation, products were
compared and discussed by 10 experts who agreed (after doubts
and language clarification) on a pre-final version, which was pre-tested
with a sample of 50 institutionalized adults (over 18 years in age) with
severe/profound intellectual disability/permanent support needs. 2-3
weeks after, the scale was re-administered to the same participants.
Data obtained from the expert committee were analysed.
The Content Validity Index (CVI) was determined for each item, as well
as for the entire scale and its average. A minimum of 0.75 was used.
Results and conclusions
Results pointed out the relevance of all
items, with a moderate/
strong agreement between experts. The study’s results are also dis-
cussed in terms of reliability and validity. Further research on psycho-
metric properties is being carried out.

Background
Obesity is considered by the World Health Organization as the global
epidemic of 21th century and is very common among children.
Obesity affects the quality of life of children and related specific

interventions are very costly and ineffective. Therefore, there is an ur-
gent need to further understand the determinants of obesity in
childhood. The hypothesis that breastfeeding has a protective effect
against obesity has been discussed and needs to be further clarified.
Objective: To systematize and discuss the most recent research on
childhood obesity and breastfeeding.
Methods
The following keywords “breastfeeding” AND “early weaning” AND
“obesity” were searched on Web of Knowledge, B-On, CINAHL, Nurs-
ing Centre, EBSCO-HOST, PubMed, Web of Science, Medline and Li-
lacs databases. Only literature published between 2004 and 2014
was considered.
Results
A total of 158 studies were screened but only six correlated breast-
feeding with childhood obesity (<18 years) and therefore were in-
cluded. These six studies demonstrated that there is an association
between breastfeeding and childhood obesity (i.e., early weaning in-
creases the child chances of being obese), despite the high import-
ance of other multifactorial risk factors (e.g., genetic, physiological,
environmental, behavioural, cultural and psychological).
Conclusions
This systematic review demonstrated the importance of breastfeed-
ing for childhood obesity prevention, but also highlights the rele-
vance of exploring multifactorial obesity etiologic models in future
related research.

Background
Patient-reported outcome measures are unique instruments to assess
the impact of a condition on a patient, as well as the efficacy of a
treatment. The Foot and Ankle Ability Measure (FAAM) is a specific
self-reported measure of the foot/ankle region that measures phys-
ical function in musculoskeletal conditions. To our knowledge, there
is only one other self-reported measure of this region adapted to
Portugal. Objective: To culturally and linguistically adapt the FAAM to
the Portuguese population.
Methods
The cultural and linguistic adaptation of the FAAM followed a se-
quential methodology. After gaining authorization of the original au-
thor, a sequence of translations and back translations were made
and consensus versions were obtained. The last consensus version,
similar to the original version with respect to semantics, was deliv-
ered to a committee of two experts in the area, who analysed the
idiomatic, experiential and conceptual
target version for semantic,
equivalences, producing a pre-final version. This pre-final version was
used on a 10-patient committee with foot/ankle problems, to assess
the contents’ equivalence in an applied situation.
Results
Semantic equivalence was obtained by the translations, back transla-
tion and clinical review. Content equivalence was obtained by the
patient committee, with 10 subjects (37.5 years [27-52], 60 % men,
with different conditions, occupations and academic qualifications),
who described the instrument as “appropriate” and “easy to under-
stand”. The average completion time was 5 minutes.

Conclusions
The Portuguese version of FAAM was obtained, with semantic equiva-
lence and content validity with the original version. The remaining psy-
chometric properties are being analysed.

Background
The importance of patient-reported outcomes (PRO) in assessing the
health status of individuals is recognized. The Patient-Rated Wrist
Evaluation Score (PRWE) is a specific PRO to assess the impact of
pain and functionality relating to problems in the wrist/hand joint
complex. Objective: To translate and linguistically validate the PRWE
for the Portuguese population.
Methods
The cultural adaptation of PRWE followed the sequential method-
ology. With the authorization of the author of the original measure,
we proceeded with translations, back translation and reached con-
sensus of the different versions produced in order to obtain an iden-
tical measure to the original from the semantic point of view. The
final consensus version, created in this process, was subjected to a
clinical review panel (2 experts in the field) to verify the technical
and semi-technical terms of the questionnaire. Subsequently, the
final version was analysed in a cognitive debriefing that included 9
patients with problems in the wrist/hand joints.
Results
Semantic equivalence was obtained by the consensus obtained in
translations, back translations and clinical review. The content validity
resulted from analysis and consensus of the panel of patients (43.8 ±
22.3 years; 55.5 % male, with several clinical conditions of the wrist/
hand, and different professions and qualifications) who described the
measure as "accessible", "adequate", "easy to fill out and understand",
taking on average 3 minutes to complete.
Conclusions
The Portuguese version of PRWE was obtained, with semantic equiva-
lence and content validity to the original measure. The remaining psy-
chometric characteristics must be analysed.

BMC Health Services Research 2016, 16(Suppl 3):P79

Background
Quality of life is an important issue for public health, especially be-
cause it involves aspects inherent to the individual. MIDAS consists
of 35 questions, which feature seven distinct domains associated
with patients with AMI. Objectives: To conduct the cross-cultural
adaptation of the instrument "Myocardial Infarction Dimensional As-
sessment Scale" (MIDAS) for the Brazilian Portuguese language.
Methods
This is a methodological study, according to Guillemin methodology,
concerning the translation and cultural adaptation of the MIDAS in-
strument. Steps: translation, reverse translation, unification evaluation
of authors, a panel of judges and pre-test were used to test the tech-
nique for face validity in the pre-test. This study was approved by
the CEP UFES (191425/2012).
Results
In the translation two translations were obtained, and in comparing
them there was agreement in over 90 % of the terms, eleven terms
were discussed and evaluated again. The back-translation was sent
to the authors, after this assessment, the latest version was referred
to a panel of judges to check the semantic, conceptual, cultural and
idiomatic features. Seven items were discussed by the judges. The
pre-test involved 20 patients, none of whom questioned any of the
issues. In addition to the equivalence stated by the judges, it had
face validity.
Conclusions
It can be said that the MIDAS is culturally adapted to be applied to
the population of Brazilian Portuguese language, being an instru-
ment of easy application, useful for clinical and good understanding
by the population, with coverage of several fields that permeate the
quality of life of the patient after infarction.

Background
The Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire (TFEQ) is one of the most
widely used instruments to assess unhealthy eating behaviours. Al-
though the TFEQ original version comprised 51-items, the explora-
tory factor analysis of the Portuguese version revealed that several
items were problematic. In 2000 Karlsoon [1] and collaborators devel-
oped a shorter version comprising 18 items (TFEQ-18) that signifi-
cantly improved the instrument’s psychometric properties. The TFEQ-
18 comprises three subscales: cognitive restraint –tendency to re-
strict food intake; uncontrolled eating – tendency to overeat as a re-
sult of a loss of control over the intake and subjective feelings of
hunger; emotional eating - tendency to overeat in response to nega-
tive emotional states. Objective: The current study aims at perform-
ing a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) of the Portuguese version of
the TFEQ-R18 and analyse its psychometric properties.
Methods
The sample included 282 women with overweight and obesity seek-
ing nutritional treatment with a mean age of 44 years old (SD =
11.30) and 11.54 (SD = 3.92) years of education. Mean Body Mass
Index (BMI) was 31.40 (SD = 4.53).
Results
The CFA confirmed the three-factor structure of TFEQ. Three items from
the cognitive restraint dimension presented poorer local adjustment
and were excluded. The final model revealed an acceptable model fit

to the data (GFI = .90, CFI = .93, TLI = .91, RMSEA = .075). Furthermore,
all three dimensions presented good psychometric properties.
Conclusions
The Portuguese version of the TFEQ comprises 15 items and is a useful,
reliable and robust instrument to assess distinct patterns of unhealthy
eating behaviours in individuals seeking nutritional treatment.

Background
Experiential avoidance is widely associated with mental and health
problems and diminished quality-of-life. Nevertheless, weight-related
experiential avoidance patterns are yet little explored.
In addition,
research suggests the importance of developing content-specific
measures to capture relevant contents for specific populations. The
Acceptance and Action Questionnaire for Weight-Related Difficulties
(AAQW) was developed to target experiential avoidance patterns re-
lated to weight thoughts, feelings and actions. Preliminary data sug-
gested a five-factor structure and adequate psychometric properties.
Nevertheless, AAQW factor structure still requires further examin-
ation. Objective: This study aims to explore the factor structure of
the Portuguese version of the AAQW and analyse its psychometric
properties.
Methods
The sample comprised 249 overweight and obese adult women
seeking nutritional treatment, with a mean Body Mass Index (BMI) of
30.88 (SD = 4.22). Sample mean age was 44.45 (SD = 11.03), with a
mean of 11.87 years of education (SD = 3.89).
Results
The original five-factor structure was not replicated. In fact, a three-
factor structure was the better solution explaining 50.94 % of
AAQW’s total variance. The Portuguese version of AAQW comprised
15 items distributed in three factors (food as control, emotional
avoidance and self-stigma), identical to the ones found in the original
study. Furthermore, AAQW showed good internal consistency (α = .81)
and convergent validity.
In fact, AAQW was related to general psy-
chopathology and psychological inflexibility, eating psychopathological
symptoms,
including binge eating and decreased obesity-related
quality-of-life.
Conclusions
Taken together, our findings suggest that the Portuguese version of
AAQW seems to be useful and reliable instrument to assess weight-
related experiential avoidance.

Background
The concept of positive body image marks a shift on the study of
body image. Based on holistic love and respect for the body, this
concept involves accepting one’s body’s unique features, attending
to body needs in a health-promoting manner, and resisting to the in-
ternalization of societally-prescribed beauty ideals. Objectives: Given
the lack of Portuguese validated instruments of positive body image,
this study aimed to validate the Portuguese version of the Body Ap-
preciation Scale-2 (BAS-2).
Methods
The present study used a large female sample, with ages between 18
and 50 years old. An Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) and a Confirma-
tory Factor Analysis (CFA) were conducted to analyse BAS-2’s structure.
Results
Results from the EFA demonstrated the BAS-2 to be a unifactorial 10-
item scale, which explained approximately 70 % of the variance. Also,
all
items revealed good factor loadings and the scale showed ex-
cellent internal consistency. The BAS-2 also presented temporal reli-
ability, and good convergent (with self-compassion) and divergent
validities (with BMI, self-judgment, body image-related experiential
avoidance, eating psychopathology, and depression). Moreover, the
CFA revealed good local and global adjustments.
Conclusions
The BAS-2 was revealed as a short and reliable measure of positive
body image, that is, the ability to love and accept one's own body
(including the aspects inconsistent with societally-prescribed ideals)
and to appreciate its uniqueness. This measure seems to provide an
important contribution for research and the development of inter-
ventions focused on the cultivation of a balanced, comfortable,
confident and happy relationship with one’s own body.

Background
Dietary restraint, the intentional restriction of caloric intake for the
purpose of weight loss, is assumed of particular concern due to its
association with eating disorders, and due to its detrimental effect
on health and psychological well-being, even at subclinical
levels.
Objectives: This study aimed to validate for the Portuguese popula-
tion the Dietary Intent Scale (DIS), a measure of dietary restraint.
Methods
The sample comprised 1,077 participants (415 males and 662 fe-
males), aged between 14 and 34 years old.

BMC Health Services Research 2016, Volume 16 Suppl 3

Page 93 of 132

Results
Results revealed that DIS presented a Cronbach’s alpha of .92 and that
three items did not contribute for the scale’s internal consistency.
Therefore, and since their content was similar to other items, these
items were excluded. A confirmatory factor analysis revealed the ad-
equacy of the final 6-item DIS, showing good local (SRWs between .64
and .94) and global adjustments (χ2(8) = 12.07, p = .148; CFI = 1.00;
TLI = 1.00; RMSEA = .03, p = .876). Furthermore, the model showed
invariance between genders. Finally, DIS revealed and temporal validity
(r = .82) and good convergent validity (eating psychopathology, eating
restraint, inflexible eating, body image-related experiential avoidance
and cognitive fusion, depression, anxiety, and stress)
Conclusions
DIS seems to be a valid measure of eating restraint, highly correlated
(r = .73) with the instrument that is considered the “golden” measure
for eating psychopathology screening and diagnosis (EDE-Q). More-
over, since the DIS only presents 6 items, enabling fast administra-
tions,
it may represent an advantage in relation to other existing
measures for community research in the field of eating difficulties.

BMC Health Services Research 2016, 16(Suppl 3):P84

Background
Marital violence is probably one of the most frequent specific forms
of domestic violence. Its impact on the functionality, relationship and
affectionateness of families is unquestionable, as well as their reper-
cussions. The main objective of this study is to construct and validate
an instrument to assess the type and intensity of marital violence,
through brief measures, with objective and easy answers for the gen-
eral population.
Methods
The marital violence inventory (MVI) is the result of a triangulation of
methods, in the first qualitative stage in the collection of significant
units through interviewing people with and without a history of vio-
lence and in the second stage with the use of quantitative methods
and transforming these units into 39 items distributed on a Likert-
type scale of frequency, on six response levels spread over four
scales (domains): psychological, physical, socio-economic and sexual.
Results
From the factorial analysis of the results of 504 participants (183 men
and 321 women) from the general population, 32 items were kept
for study and obtained a five-factor structure with the emergence of
the separation of the physical domain into two factors we named
Physical Major and Minor; these showed good psychometric capabil-
ities with a KMO between 0.759 and 0.921. In the analysis of reliabil-
ity (internal consistency, Cronbach's alpha), we obtained values
between 0.82 and 9.25.
Results
The results of the development and validation test inventory indicate
this is an easy response instrument, with evaluative diagnostic cap-
abilities in the health context and which can be applied to Primary
and/or Differentiated Health care, or even by social and law enforce-
ment agencies.

BMC Health Services Research 2016, 16(Suppl 3):P85

Background
Non-invasive assessments of continuous blood pressure variations,
imposed by homeostatic mechanisms, establish a major challenge in
medical instrumentation. The use of portable and low cost devices,
joined with the ability to integrate physiological signals enables con-
tinuous monitoring during daily tasks. Objective: This work aims to
present a device to measure blood pressure variations by means of
electrocardiogram (ECG) and photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals.
Moreover, the validation of the derived blood pressure values, were
also addressed.
Methods
The prototype, based on a low cost development platform (Arduino),
acquires the patient ECG and PPG signals to automatically calculate
the PTT (pulse transit time). Blood pressure signal is influenced by
thickness, diameter and elasticity of the vessel wall and blood dens-
ity, whose variations are sensed by PTT. The instantaneous heart beat
and pressure values can be shown on the prototype display or sent
to a remote mobile device. All this information is stored in a standard
memory card, in a format that allows subsequent reading and ana-
lysis by several software applications.
Results
To validate the acquisition system, the device was tested in a set of
healthy individuals during daily tasks. The robustness of the system
was compared with a commercial equipment BIOPAC MP35, and
both results match.
Conclusions
According to the results, this system could be a low cost and port-
able alternative to assess continuous blood pressure variations to be
used in several clinical evaluations related with blood pressure
changes.

persons. Objective: To develop a self-administered questionnaire ex-
ploring nursing students’ perceptions of the difficulties in caring for
the elderly (SPDCE).
Methods
The development of the scale proceeded through three phases: the
first phase was a literature review and exploratory interview with stu-
dents after clinical training. The second phase was related to the def-
inition of theoretical dimensions and design of the tool; the review
of instruments by a panel of specialists and the pre-test were part of
the third phase. The study was designed to select items, identify di-
mensions, measure reliability, content and construct validity.
Results
The SPDCE consisted of 34 items. Factorial analysis grouped the
items into three categories that define areas in for the elderly: a)
physical health, mental health and activities of daily living subscale,
b) social and economic resources subscale c) services use subscale.
Cronbach’s alpha was 0.98 for the entire questionnaire. The factor so-
lution explained 75.8 % of the variance.
Conclusions
The SPDCE appears to measure with adequate reliability and validity
the attributes of exploring nursing students’ perception of the diffi-
culties in caring for the elderly within the clinical setting. The instru-
ment is easy to complete, making it a suitable instrument for nursing
teachers to evaluate nursing students’ self-perceived difficulties in
nursing care for the elderly as a means to support and sustain condi-
tions for quality of the care provided to the elderly.

Background
The growing demand of older people to health services and the in-
creasing number of elderly people living with chronic illness makes
us reflect on the importance of providing nursing care that responds
to the real needs of the elderly in hospital context. The Comfort is
one of the needs of the elderly hospitalized with chronic disease [1]
and the lack of an instrument to measure comfort level, was the
main motivation for the development of this study. Objectives: To
develop and validate an instrument able to measure the comfort of
elderly hospitalized patients with chronic illness.
Methods
There has been conducted a methodological research study. The
sample has 70 hospitalized patients with at least one chronic disease.
Data collection was performed by using a questionnaire outlining
demographic and social health issues and the application of the
comfort rating scale built by us.
Results
Patients were aged between 65 and 99 years; 54.3 % were women
and 45.7 % were men. The majority of the patients (65 %) had heart
disease and 37.1 % felt that their health situation is bad. The fear of
remaining sick and becoming a burden for the family decreased the
comfort level of the patients. On the other hand, the hope of getting
better and the opportunity to talk with other patients were factors
that had a positive effect on comfort level.
Conclusions
The results highlight that elderly hospitalized patients with chronic
disease have several comfort needs, and that it is crucial to measure
them with the appropriate scale.

Background
Paternal quality of life in postpartum is at present a priority in studies
of the family cycle, with the purpose of defining and facilitating inte-
grative interventions for their adjustment to the parental role. Ob-
jective: to develop a self-administered questionnaire to assess the
quality of paternal life postpartum.
Methods
The development of the scale proceeded in three phases: I) literature
review and exploratory interview to students after clinical training; II)
definition of theoretical dimensions and design of the tool; II) review
of instruments by a panel of specialists and the pre-test made the
third phase. The study was designed to select items, identify dimen-
sions, measure reliability, content and construct validity.
Results
The Postpartum Paternal Quality of Life Questionnaire (PP-QOL)
consisted of 35 items. A factorial analysis grouped the items into
five categories of paternal quality of life: a) psychological/baby; b)
socioeconomic; c) relational/partner; d) family/friends relational; e)
health/functional status. Cronbach’s alpha was 0.74 for the entire
questionnaire. The factor solution explained 51.8 % of the variance.
Conclusions
Results emerging from the preliminary study validate the instrument
of postpartum paternal quality of life questionnaire (PP-QOL) and
allow its use in the context of clinical practice, specifically in the con-
text of primary health care, in order to identify the real needs of fa-
thers and the allocation of services to this particular group of care in
the area of reproductive health, with implications for their quality of
life after the birth of their offspring.

Background
Diabetes Mellitus is a condition that affects 14 % of the Portuguese
population. One in every 4 patients develops diabetic foot ulcers

(DFU) due to poor blood flow, which can lead to cell death and
consequent amputations. This severely affects the quality of life of
patients and contributes to significant costs to health systems. Ob-
jective monitoring methods are needed to predict their occurrence
and assess treatments.
Methods
Infrared thermal imaging is a modality for capturing and recording
skin surface temperature (SST) in a non-contact, non-invasive, non-
ionizing, inexpensive and fast manner. SST is associated with periph-
eral blood flow, which is controlled by the autonomous nervous sys-
tem. Planar foot incidences were taken from 40 healthy controls and
80 patients with different types of diabetic foot ulcers:
ischemic,
neuropathic and neuroischemic. Regions of interest (ROI) were mea-
sured and thermal symmetries calculated against the non-affected
limb.
Results
Results demonstrated that in patients developing and with DFU
there is a higher value of thermal symmetry than in healthy controls
at same ROIs location (p < 0.05).
Conclusions
The findings of this study provide valuable indicative information to
use this method for screening patients at risk of developing diabetic
foot ulcers, since there is an inflammatory process that increases SST
before the occurrence of the wound and for treatment assessment,
since the SST decreases significantly when there is no neuropathic
and vascular activity in a necrotic situation. This method can be used
to reduce the occurrence of diabetic foot ulcers and consequent de-
crease in the collateral costs to health care systems.

Background
Pressure ulcers (PU) are developed due to pathological changes in
blood perfusion of the skin and underlying tissues. The risk of devel-
oping ulcers becomes higher in patients in the ICU, because besides
the mobility limitations imposed on patients for their clinical condi-
tion, the need for more stringent controls, associated with more
complex therapies, there are other risk factors in addition, such as
sedatives,
level of consciousness changes, use of vasoactive drugs
and hemodynamic instability.
The aim of this study is to report the experience in handling PU in
an ICU of a public hospital in the interior of Bahia.
Methods
This is a descriptive study-type experience report, about the profes-
sional experience of intensive care in an ICU of the General Hospital,
Feira de Santana, Bahia. The report relates the experiences of the
year 2015.
Results
It observed a high rate of incidence and prevalence of PU in the ICU,
with the regions most affected being the sacral and trochanter. Also
it has been identified as occurring in sites with low prevalence in
population studies, such as the occipital region and calves.
Conclusions
These alarming data refer to a sense of duty that the provider has to
be aware of the consequences that the PU can trigger for the pa-
tient, his family and the institution. It prolongs hospital stays, make
recovery difficult, increases the risk of development of complications

and represents an increase in the physical and emotional suffer-
ing of patients by reducing their independence in carrying out
daily activities.

Background
The difficulty of implementation of the association technique, using
the inductive term (word or phrase) activated by speech, can derail a
deal, when there is impoverishment or disagreement on the vocabu-
lary/understanding of the term used, or temporary or permanent
cognitive restriction, from the one evoking. Objectives: To create and
culturally adapt images to support the preparation of the free word
association technique, validating them for use among low-educated
elderly people from the perspective of urinary incontinence in the
aging process.
Methods
Cultural validation of images for contextual reality, operationalized in:
I) creation of images to portray the chosen everyday situations;
II)
obtaining consensus for these images by a committee of experts and
people from the community, using the Delphi technique and III)
Technical application of the free word association with and without
image support (Technique of Free Word Association Initiated by Im-
ages- “TALPDI”).
Results
Five slides were designed with images covering thematic diversity
after a ≥ 90 % consensus to ensure full agreement among evaluators.
Fifty (50) elderly people participated. The comparison of the non-
use/use of
images between participants improved evocation of
93.2 %.
Conclusions
The creation and cultural validation of images favoured the capture
of representational content using the TALPDI.

help from informal caregivers who are often unprepared for the de-
mands of providing care. Evidence has shown that combining en-
hanced informal caregivers’ practical skills, face-to-face interventions
and telephone support can reduce negative consequences for care-
givers, such as burden or depression. Objective: To evaluate the im-
pact of an intervention to reduce burden by using telephone
support delivered to informal caregivers, who take care of older
people after a stroke, at home.
Methods
A quasi-experimental method, which included 3 months of follow-
up, was conducted with 174 patients. The Control group (n = 89) re-
ceived usual care available provided by healthcare units and the
InCARE programme was implemented in the experimental group (n
= 85), 1 week, 1 and 3 months, telephone support, counselling care-

facilitate the caregiver’s adjustment to stroke demands,
increasing
knowledge and practical skills to support their decision-making. Data
collection took place between February 2014 and December 2014.
Results
The experimental group had a significant lower level of burden in
comparison with the control group 1 and 3 months after InCARE
intervention.
Conclusions
Telephone support does not replace face-to-face interventions imple-
mented based on structured programs, however, they are an aid for
diagnosis and an important complement to all types of interventions
that promote health gains of this group of informal caregivers and
stroke survivors.

Background
Hope is a crucial factor in the lives of those who care for people with
chronic and advanced disease. Therefore, the main objective of this
study was to identify the predictors of hope of informal caregivers of
people with chronic and advanced disease.
Methods
This is a correlational study conducted with 314 caregivers of people
with advanced and chronic disease who were admitted in medical
services or on an outpatient regime in Portuguese hospitals. We con-
ducted a structured interview to collect demographic data, caring ex-
perience and health of patient and caregiver, hope (Hope Herth
Index, HHI-C) comfort (Holistic Comfort Questionnaire, HCQ-C) and
quality of life (Quality of Life in Life Threatening Illness, QOLLTI-C).
Throughout the study, Helsinki Declaration Principles were followed.
Results
The 314 caregivers, mostly female (84.1 %) with an average of
63 years old (±11) had good levels of hope (3.06 ± 0.49), comfort
(4.23 ± 0.83) and quality of life (6.15 ± 1.12). The caregivers inter-
viewed took care of patients mainly with neoplasms (85.0 %) and se-
vere dependence, for about 17.2 months (±16.25) and they spent
about 6.2 (±3.79) hours a day taking care of them. They considered
their health as poor (7.83 ± 1.8) and felt quite tired (7.75 ± 1.79). After
performing a multiple linear regression, we verified that the explana-
tory variables of caregivers’ hope were: comfort, quality of life, time

spent on caring, health status, fatigue and self-perception of their
own health.
Conclusion
Nursing interventions should be focused on caregivers' comfort,
quality of life and health status in order to maintain their hope while
caring for their relatives.

Background
In Portugal, the National System of Communicable Diseases Surveil-
lance is a health information system for the monitoring of a number
of communicable diseases and other risks to public health. The exist-
ence of a list of communicable diseases, now updated, dates back to
1949. With the introduction of a new communicable diseases infor-
mation system in June 2014, it would be appropriate to evaluate its
functionality and quality. Objective: The aim of this study was iden-
tify the quality of the information recorded into the National System
of Communicable Diseases Surveillance.
Methods
The evaluation of filling data was made based on attributes adapted
from the rules used for evaluating surveillance systems in Public
Health of the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention.
Results
Based on the attributes "Simplicity/Acceptability" and "Completeness"
it was found that full information was filled in 77.4 % of the cases; in
relation to the "Data Quality” it was found that in 65.0 % of the cases
the information was properly filled. In 90.5 % of the cases was ob-
served "Information Consistency" and in 51.8 % of the cases "Infor-
mation Conformity". As to "Transmission Timely" information, it has
been found that, depending on the user input, it should be faster.
Conclusions
It can be concluded that it is an innovative system with great poten-
tial for improving and very useful for the rapid transmission of infor-
mation, communication between the different levels and quality
validation and upcoming reviews and system upgrades are expected.

Background
Resting Metabolic Rate (RMR) is the energy spent in activities neces-
sary to maintain normal homeostasis and body functions. In the XX
century, Harris and Benedict conducted a study using calorimetry to
the measurement of basal metabolic rate. This study analysed phys-
ical variables (age, weight, height) and physiological data expressing
the results in two formulas, one for males and another for females.

BMC Health Services Research 2016, Volume 16 Suppl 3

Studies indicate that the data obtained in the equations are the
same as those obtained by indirect calorimetry, however other stud-
ies question these results. Objective: Study the correlation between
the RMR using indirect calorimetry and Harris-Benedict formula in a
group of workers of granite industry.
Methods
A quantitative cross-sectional study was developed. Data collection
was performed using a sample of 30 men from two companies of
granite industry. Data collection was done using anthropometric
measurements and the RMR assessed using the Fitmate, Cosmed®.
Statistical analysis of the data was performed using the statistical
software Statistical Package for Social Sciences version 22.
Results
The sample comprised 30 men, with a mean age of 39.8 (SD = 13.9)
years. The RMR measured was in average of 1,741.0 (SD = 281.7) Kcal,
and the Harris and Benedict Formula resulted in an average of
1,785.0 (SD = 229.2) Kcal. RMRs objectively measured and calculated
varied on average 4.1 (SD = 14.6) % and were significantly correlated
(=0.539; p-value = 0.01).
Conclusions
The Harris-Benedict formula overestimates the RMR value at around
4.1 %, as previously mentioned.

Background
The use of Emergency Departments (ED) by non-urgent patients has
shown a significant increase, creating major challenges for the health
system, as well as political and financial constraints. Objectives: a) to
characterize the profile of non-urgent ED users; b) to identify the de-
terminants of non-urgent ED use.
Methods
This cross-sectional study included 357 non-urgent users of a Portu-
guese ED. Data collection was conducted through questionnaire and
electronic medical records. Results were analysed using descriptive
statistics and parametric tests. This study has been approved by the
ethics committee of the hospital.
Results
Data analysis showed that non-urgent users are mostly female, retired,
with lower education levels and with an average age of 54.51 years.
Most users visited the ED by their own initiative, and only 18.3 %
sought previously the primary healthcare. Most of them had access to
a family doctor and the clinical motivations for the ED visit lasted for
18.8 days. Patients who considered the ED as the most appropriate ser-
vice to treat their situation, had a higher number of previous ED admis-
sions (p < 0.05). Abusive ED use seems to be associated with a high
consumption pattern of global healthcare. Several reasons for the non-
urgent ED use were identified.
Conclusions
A public discussion involving clinical, political and community stake-
holders is imperative. Non-urgent users’ characteristics should be
taken into account when designing a program against the misuse of
ED, namely regarding the timely identification of hyperusers and the
adequacy of the healthcare accessibility.

Background
The interest of researchers on the assessment of physical fitness of
children is crucial in a society where the activity/motion constraints
are higher and may affect their health. Objectives: I) to study the im-
pact of an oriented programme of physical activity through “Curricu-
lar Enrichment Activities” on the physical fitness of children and II) to
observe if the results are within healthy regular parameters.
Methods
We used as measuring instrument the battery of tests of Fitness-
gram©, with methodological procedures according to The Cooper
Institute's Application Manual for Aerobics Research [1]. The sample
consisted of seventy children attending the 1st Cycle of Education,
aged between 6 and 9 years old, with data collected in 2 separate
moments with a time interval of three months. Statistical procedures
used in the comparison of variables were performed through the
chi-square and McNemar tests.
Results
In both moments of evaluation most children obtained test results
that may be considered appropriate, in terms of healthy and good
organic functions. The test results evidenced a statistically significant
improvement between the two moments of evaluation.
Conclusions
Children improved their physical fitness levels from the 1st to the
2nd moment of evaluation. Thus, this leads us to conclude that the
intervention developed during the programme of “Curricular Enrich-
ment Activities” brought benefits and a positive impact on their
health levels.

Background
Several factors contribute, positively or negatively, for the quality of
sleep. One of the positive factors is regular physical activity. Physical
activity should be perceived as having multiple benefits and not be
reduced to the evident and proved results for the body and heart.
Objective: To estimate the impact of physical activity in the quality of
sleep in school-age children from 7 to 9 years old.
Methods
The sample was collected in the several existing learning centres of
the city of Almeirim, consisting of 128 individuals (55.5 % feminine
and 44.5 % masculine) in 2014. The data collection for the study con-
sisted in the use of two questionnaires: Children Sleep Habits Ques-
tionnaire and Sleep Self Report.

BMC Health Services Research 2016, Volume 16 Suppl 3

Page 98 of 132

Results
90.6 % of the sample practices weekly physical activity and 60.9 %
shows a sleep disorder, being more prevalent among the female
gender. It was possible to infer that the older the children were, the
less probability they had for having a sleep disorder.
Conclusions
There isn’t any positive relationship between the weekly practice of
physical activity and a sleep disorder. Children who practice light,
moderate or vigorous physical activity can show a reduction in the
quality of their sleeping patterns. Nevertheless, the results highlight
a considerable percentage of children with some kind of disorder,
which may signal a possible underreporting of the lack of quality
sleep of this population.

Background
Arterial Hypertension (HTA) is a chronic disease with high morbidity,
mortality and a socio-economic impact. Information and Communica-
tion Technologies (ICT) facilitate the access to the necessary informa-
tion for HTA self-management. Nowadays,
there is a lack of
knowledge of the utility, ease and interest expressed by people with
HTA for the use of ICTs in accessing the information for the disease’s
self-management. Objective: to characterize both ICT’s potential and
HTA patients’ global needs for information.
Methods
Quantitative, exploratory, descriptive and cross-sectional study using
phone interviews and a stratified random probability sample of 391
patients on the National Program of Cardiovascular Disease Preven-
tion list within a Local Portuguese Healthcare Unit.
Results
People with HTA manifest a higher information need not only to in-
tegrate self-management in their everyday life, but also to motivate
the significant people to help them in their daily life and to increase
their knowledge on the available resources within the community.
People with a lower education level ultimately display a lower techno-
logical literacy, lower access, lower use and more difficulty in the use of
information resources, preferring the use of voice and image devices.
People with a higher education level and technological
literacy are
younger and admit to use and value more Web-Based technologies.
Conclusions
Younger and higher educated people present a higher potential use
of ICTs. Although displaying a higher intent towards the use of voice
devices, older and less educated people mention having significant
people that may help them in accessing the health information
through ICTs.

Background
Fall rates have been found to be higher in haemodialysis (HD) pa-
tients than in the general older population. Post-dialysis fatigue,
polypharmacy, dialysis related hypotension, chronic kidney disease-
mineral and bone disorder, have been recognised as risk factors for
falls peculiar to HD. However, little attention has been paid to the
psychosocial factors related to falls risk in this population. Objectives:
This study aimed to analyse the association between falls risk and
psychosocial variables (anxiety, depression and social
isolation)
among older adults undergoing HD.
Methods
A cross-sectional study was conducted. Sociodemographic and
health-related data were collected through a structured question-
naire. Risk of falling was assessed with the Five Times Sit to Stand
(FTSS) test and isometric muscle force (IMF). Anxiety and depression
were assessed with The Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Social
isolation was measured with The Lubben Social Network Scale-6
(LSNS-6). Descriptive and inferential analyses were performed.
Results
Seventy-two HD patients (mean age: 62.29 ± 14.5; 69.4 % male) have
participated. Falls risk varied according to age, education, self-rated
physical and mental health, visual and hearing impairment, and his-
tory of falls. Significant statistical differences were found between
anxiety and IMF (p = 0.011) and between depression and FTSS (p <
0.01) and IMF (p = 0.033) scores (i.e., falls risk increase with anxiety
and depressive symptoms). A significant correlation was observed
between IMF and LSNS-6 (rs = 0.368; p < 0.01).
Conclusions
The findings suggested that psychosocial factors are related with in-
creased risk of falling among HD older patients. Fall preventive strat-
egies should also include psychological and social support to patients
undergoing HD.

Background
The use of Non-Invasive Ventilation (NIV) has been increasing in clin-
ical practice, however, the evidence has shown that its implementa-
tion may lead to development of ulcers of the face. Objective: to
determine the prevalence of face ulcers on the face of patients ad-
mitted in an Intermediate Care Unit (ICU) submitted to NIV and to
identify the factors associated to its development.
Methods
A prospective study conducted in a ICU between September and
December 2015. Inclusion criteria of: age ≥ 18 years, patients admit-
ted to the ICU, submitted to NIV and without ulcers of the face at
the time of admission, lead us to a sample of 30 participants. Data
were collected through a questionnaire, the Braden and Glasgow
scale.

Page 99 of 132

Results
The prevalence of ulcers on the face was of 26.7 % with a mean on-
set time of 3.3 ± 1.1 days. Participants were mostly males (70 %), with
a mean age of 74.2 ± 10.3 years. Those who have developed an ulcer
showed an older average age of 76.5 years, 16.7 % were changing
sensitivity, 16.7 % had the facial skin intact and dry, 26.7 % used
reused masks and 16.7 % had an ulcer Grade II. There was a statisti-
cally significant positive correlation between the development of an
ulcer with the number of hours of daily NIV, the number of days of
NIV, days of hospitalization, and a negative correlation with the level
of consciousness.
Conclusions
We observed a high prevalence of ulcers. Thus, this emphasizes the
need for further research to increase knowledge to subsidize ulcer
prevention interventions in patients with NIV.

Background
Hospitalization causes significant changes in the lives of the eldery,
due to factors such as the environment, changes in routines, loss of
functional capacity, among others. Therefore, it is crucial to identify
the contextual factors that emerge as discomforting. Objectives: To
identify the limiting factors for comfort on hospitalized elderly.
Methods
It is a descriptive study using qualitative methods of data gather-
ing, guided by the ethnographic method. Semi-structured inter-
views were conducted with 20 elderly patients, audio-recorded and
submitted for content analysis [1]. The patients were selected from
admissions to the medical services of a Central Hospital, in Lisbon.
There was participant observation in order to understand the situ-
ational experiences, based on previously structured scripts [2].
Results
Regarding the action context, the factors that emerged, that cause
discomfort included environmental conditions (light, noise, equip-
ment, colour, temperature, natural or artificial elements of the envir-
onment); quality of food; the absence of activities as well as the lack
of human resources and time to care.
Conclusions
Comfort nursing care is challenged by the unpredictability of circum-
stances surrounding the satisfaction of multiple health needs and re-
sources for caring. The action context, related to all its elements, can
be limitative of the humanization and completeness in geriatric com-
fort care, which has a negative impact on the comforting experience
of the elderly in hospital.

Background
According to the World Health Organization (2015) [1], physical activ-
ity translates into significant health benefits and the lack of its prac-
in non-transmitted
tice constitutes a fundamental
diseases. Objectives: to determine physical activity levels in adults
that go (N = 150) or do not go (N = 206) to a gym and relate them
with health self-perception (from mediocre to very good).
Methods
Data was collected through the International physical activity ques-
tionnaire (IPAQ) and analysed using SPSS 23 for Windows.
Results
In accordance with the minimal weekly referential of vigorous (75`)
and moderate (150`) practice recommended by WHO, we found that
98.6 % of practitioners achieved the recommendations, against the
54.8 % of non-practitioners. Only 27.6 % of non-practitioners against
63.3 % of practitioners achieves or surpasses the weekly moderate
activity referential recommended by WHO for additional health bene-
fits (300`).
In contrast with different health states of participants, some signifi-
cant differences manifest (p < .05) in frequency and duration of di-
verse physical activity types, but not in the sitting time. Also, in the
same analysis, divided in practitioners and non-practitioner’s sub-
groups, no significant differences where observed (p < .05)
Health states Good and Very Good revealed themselves statistically
in contrast (p > .05) of frequency and duration of moderate and vig-
orous activities, between practitioners and non-practitioners, with
the first having advantage, the same not happening in light activities
and in sitting time.
Conclusions
Results confirm recent studies [2, 3] and highlight the urgent neces-
sity of promoting physical activity as a health and well-being pro-
moting factor in populations.

Background
This is a demographic transition scenario with implications in all
areas of social life: it is unacceptable to face aging without reflecting
on the problems around opportunities for older people,
including
satisfaction with social support. Social support is particularly import-
ant to facilitate an independent and fulfilling life in the community
for the elderly. Objectives: To assess the satisfaction of elderly people
with social support (individuals aged over 65 years) living in the dis-
trict of Bragança, by applying a sociodemographic questionnaire and
the Satisfaction Scale with Social Support (ESSS) of Ribeiro (2011) [1].
Methods
Starting from the elderly population living in Bragança district, we
developed an observational, analytical and cross-sectional study with
a quantitative approach, with a sample of 517 subjects, mostly fe-
males (54.9 %; n = 284); aged between 65 and 74 years old (45.3 %;
n = 234); married or living in consensual union (61.9 %; n = 320); resi-
dents in rural areas (69.8 %; n = 361); with sons and daughters
(89.0 %; n = 460); and illiterate (50.7 %; n = 262).
Results and conclusions
The sample under study has average social support, which allows us
to infer that the elderly is, in general, satisfied with the social support
which they have, and the support received from friends is that which
gives them more satisfaction, expressing less satisfaction with family
support. It is observed that most of the variables are, in the case of
the elderly, determinants of their satisfaction with social support.

Background
Traumatic brain injury is a major cause of acute brain injury and the
leading cause of death among persons aged less than 50 years. Brain
Injury is a public health concern that demands ongoing an epidemio-
logical study, increased efforts to prevent occurring injuries, and re-
search to advance medical options and therapeutic interventions.
Objective: To assess the factors associated with death by Traumatic
Brain Injury in a General Hospital.
Methods
Cross-sectional study, conducted at the Regional Hospital of St. Jo-
seph, Brazil, with 75 patients diagnosed with traumatic brain injury
admitted to the Intensive Care Unit from January/2010 to December/
2011. Analysis by SPSS 20.0, Chi-square test with p ≤ 0.05 and a confi-
dence interval of 95 %. Approved by the Research Ethics Committee
of University of Southern Santa Catarina, No 855.750.
Results
Prevalence in men (81.3 %), average age of 36.09 years (SD 15.35).
The major cause of accidents were traffic accidents (54.1 %). The
length of stay in the intensive care unit was 6-15 days (35.8 %), with
severe classification in the Glasgow Coma Scale (77.1 %), pneumonia
complications (16.0 %), and death in 37.1 %. Significant associations
were found between death and severe classification (p = 0.022), period

of time in the intensive care unit of 1 to 15 days (p = 0.051), use of a
catheter to evaluate intracranial pressure (p = 0.002) and tracheostomy
(p = 0.044).
Conclusions
Death by traumatic brain injury is associated with aspects related to
the severity of the condition, use of catheter to evaluate intracranial
pressure and tracheostomy.

Background
The inability of the National Health Service and sociodemographic
changes have contributed to increase the number of elderly who are
beneficiaries of informal care at home. However, the literature reveals
association between exercising the role of caregiver and burden,
which in turn is influenced by the health status of receptor. Object-
ive: To assess the burden of family caregivers of dependent elderly
in self-care and correlate the burden of family caregivers with health
status of the receptor.
Methods
Cross-sectional analytical study. Were eligible 30 dyads of care com-
posed by family caregivers and the dependent elderly in self-care.
Collection of data was held by structured interviews and analysis by
SPSS.
Results
Most of caregivers are female (77 %), in average with 74 years, mar-
ried (73 %), with education below 4th year (76 %). Predominated the
lower middle class (73 %). With regard to burden, 63 % had moderate,
30 % severe and 7 % extreme high. The Pearson coefficient revealed a
statistically significant correlation between the burden caregivers and
many variables of receptors like number of wounds (r = -0.499; p =
0.009); number of health complication (r = -0.645; p =0.003); drug com-
plex (r = 0.326; p = 0.035); dependence in AVDS (r = 0.355; p = 0.021);
AIVDs (r = -0.349; p = 0.025); pressure ulcer risk (r = 0.292; p = 0.041) and
cognitive impairment (r = 0.578; p = 0.011).
Conclusions
Family caregivers with higher levels of burden care for receptors with
less number of wounds, less number of health complications, lower
risk of pressure ulcers, lower dependence on Activities of Daily Liv-
ing/Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (ADLs/IADLs) more complex
drug regimens and cognitive impairment. These data revealed the
need to elaborate assessment tools and customized/efficient inter-
vention programs.

Background
Day centres receive the elderly with self-care problems but usually
do not have nursing care. For this reason, it is unknown what are the
needs/problems potentially sensitive to nursing care. Objective: To
conduct a multidimensional health diagnosis, centred in the elderly
that attend day centres.
Methods
Quantitative study, observational, cross-sectional which focused on
68 users, with more than 65 years, from three day centres of Oporto.
Results
It is a very old population (mean 80 years), predominantly female
(86.8 %), low educated and socially isolated. Dominated by situations
of suspected cognitive impairment (51.5 %) dependence in instru-
mental activities of daily living (91.2 %), basic activities (41.2 %) and
mobility (17.6 %). However, the phenomena considered most rele-
vant for nursing practice were: the presence of pain (66.9 %); the risk
of falling associated with loss of balance (64.7 %), direct relationship
with the number of falls in six months (n = 59); the fear of falling as-
sociated with physical inactivity (70.6 %); polypharmacy (75.0 %) and
the inability to manage the drug regimen associated with loss of
cognitive ability and mobility, as well as vulnerability of social and fi-
nancial character.
Conclusions
We observed a set of phenomena sensitive to nursing care that
should be seen as opportunities to develop intervention projects and
contractually new health indicators targeted to these social facilities.

Background
With the demographic ageing and the increase of very old persons,
a new concept appears with greater importance in elderly health
and family care: frailty. Among old persons (with or without path-
ology) ageing may decrease their biologic and psychological reserves
to cope with stress, or some events. The elderly frail need more so-
cial and health support because the danger of institutionalization or
death is high. Objective: To study how the elderly understand frailty.
Methods
This is an exploratory study in a sample of 113 persons of 65 years
or over of both sexes who want to and were able to participate. We
interviewed to data saturation.
Results
The majority (93.8 %) are 80 years old or over. 65.5 % were female,
54.0 % considered themselves a frail person. Age, mobility constrains,
health problems, loss of abilities, loneliness, weakness, less ability to
cope with stress, grief and losses are mentioned as situations in-
volved in the definition of frailty.
Conclusions
Fifty-four (54 %) of the elderly felt they were frail. The reasons why
they think a person is frail are in agreement with the literature con-
cept of frailty and expressed in some scales to measure frailty. It will
be interesting to go on with this study and survey the elderly living
in other situations (e.g. at home).

Escola Superior de Saúde, Instituto Politécnico de Santarém, Santarém,
2005-075 Santarém, Portugal
BMC Health Services Research 2016, 16(Suppl 3):O195

Background
The theory of self-care is a reference to the practice of nursing care.
A change in the person's health status compromises their ability to
care for themselves. Self-care is a nursing-sensitive outcome. Object-
ive: To assess therapeutic self-care as a nursing-sensitive outcome.
Methods
Correlational study; simple random sample with application of a
therapeutic self-care scale.
Results
Two hundred and eighty-eight (288) clients participated in the study,
53.8 % females, aged between 19 and 95 years old and only 18.4 %
having higher education. By factor analysis we obtained two factors
(managing medications and symptoms and performing daily life ac-
tivities) with 52.8 % of the total variance explained and with good in-
ternal consistency (α = .87). The younger (F = 5.27; sp ≤ .006) and
more highly educated (F = 4.91; p ≤ .000) evaluate "managing medi-
cations and symptoms" more positively. Those who have the 2nd
cycle or higher education have higher average values (F = 3.88;
p ≤ .002) for "activities of daily living". The lower number of hours re-
quired for client care corresponds to highest average value in both
dimensions obtained (F = 2.41; p ≤ .02 and F = 3.32; p ≤ .001). Using
multiple linear regression, it was found that the centrality of care ex-
plains 19.0 % of the variance of therapeutic self-care (R2 = .19; F =
58.20; gl = 248; p = .000).
Conclusions
Therapeutic self-care is a nursing-sensitive outcome. The results of
the socio-demographic variables seem to be related to quality of
care, from which the clients focus emerges and which, we believe,
not only depends on the hours of nursing care. Centred care predicts
therapeutic self-care.

Background
Liver transplantation is indicated worldwide for the treatment of liver
diseases in advanced stages and most successful solid organ trans-
plantation with one-year survival 83-91 %. After transplantation, an
improvement in the patient's perception regarding their health and
quality of life (QOL) occurs. Objective: To evaluate the quality of life

pital in Santa Catarina in 2009, compared with patients who are on
the waiting list for the same type of transplant.
Methods
Case-control study with 38 cases and 54 controls. Data collected on
Santa Catarina SC transplants, Brazil, in December 2013. Excluded pa-
tients who underwent liver transplantation intervivo; Double liver-
kidney transplant; transplanted or queued with positive HIV test. Spe-
cific instrument Liver Disease Quality of Life (LDQOL). Analyses in

Committee of University of Southern Santa Catarina No 384.389.
Results
Frequency in male cases (89.5 %), age above 50 years (65.8 %) and re-
tired (72.4 %). Statistical significance (p ≤ 0.05) in almost all domains of
quality of life in transplant: liver symptoms, sleep, memory, sexual func-
tion, hope, social interaction, concentration, concern about the disease,
effects of the disease and hepatic stigmata. Conclusions
The quality of life in patients undergoing liver transplantation was
high in all aspects compared to patients on the waiting list for

Innovative expertise related to the promotion of positive ageing is
crucial to deal with the rapid growth of the ageing population in
modern societies. Higher education plays an essential role in the de-
velopment of new models of training in health professions. Never-
theless, the perspectives and the diversity of needs of the recipients
of care can enrich the (re)conceptualization of education on ageing
and health. Objectives: The main aim of this study was to explore
older people’s views on the competences of health professionals
working with elderly populations in different European countries.
Methods
A qualitative study was conducted in Austria, Finland, Lithuania,
Portugal, Turkey, and the U.K. A convenience sample of 16 partici-
pants was selected in each country (N = 96). Semi-structured inter-
views were used for data collection according to a common
interview script. Thematic analysis was performed throughout the 96
interviews.
Results
Older people’s views are structured around four major themes. These
emphasize individuality and dignity of service users, as well as their
personal and social background; effective communication and rela-
tional orientation of professionals are also highlighted. Technical
expertise, training in gerontology and ageing, vocation, commit-
ment and ethical recommendations are also part of participant’s
discourses.
Conclusions
Despite the cultural differences that can be found in European coun-
tries,
interpersonal sensitivity, and person-centred care represent a
relevant aspect for older people when they focus on the compe-
tences of health professionals. Hence, some changes may in fact be
necessary to improve in European health education and training
within the near future.

Background
The wellness construct, as measured by satisfaction with life is under-
stood as a trial process in which individuals generally estimate the
quality of their respective lives based on their own criteria. For the
assessment of satisfaction with life, it is inseparable from the evalu-
ation of positive and negative feelings of each individual. Objective:
The objective was to analyse the differences and correlations de-
pending on the number of hours of exercise and practice context,
satisfaction with life and feelings of active Portuguese adults.
Methods
The study sample consisted of 560 Portuguese adults of both gen-
ders, aged between 30 and 64 years. The Satisfaction with Life Scale
(SWLS) and the Scale of Positive and Negative Affect were used. The
parametric tests one-way ANOVA and the coefficient of linear Pear-
son correlation were used.
Results
The results revealed a growing trend in the levels of life satisfaction
and positive feelings with the increased volume of hours of weekly
exercise, yielding an inverse relationship in the face of negative feel-
ings. There were also significant differences when compared be-
tween groups in levels of life satisfaction and positive and negative
feelings.

Conclusions
Apparently the increase in the volume of hours of weekly exercise
promotes an increase in life satisfaction and positive feelings, with
benefits for individuals who practise exercise in both group and indi-
vidual contexts.

The incidence of new cases of breast cancer increases every year in
Brazil, as well as mortality rates that are higher possibly because this dis-
ease is diagnosed in advanced stages. The objective of this study was to
investigate the therapeutic itinerary of women diagnosed with breast
cancer in the city of Santa Maria- RS.
This is a retrospective cross-sectional documentary study in which
records of women diagnosed with breast cancer were
medical
analysed.
Data collection was conducted from August 2013 to January 2015 in
two public referral centres in the diagnosis and treatment for munici-
pal breast cancer. Four hundred seventy-five (475) records were ana-
lysed, and of these 91 contained all the necessary information.
It was observed that the predominant therapeutic itinerary diagno-
sis was followed by surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy. The
time between the procedures mostly followed the deadline estab-
lished by the Ministry of Health and histological types of higher
prevalence in the current study was invasive ductal and invasive
lobular.
It was observed that patients’ therapeutic itinerary confirms the find-
ings in the literature of better disease prognosis and the time
elapsed between diagnosis and treatment initiation is in accordance
with the public policy recommendations.

The breastfeeding prevalence at 4 months: Maternal experience as
a determining factor
Dolores Sardo
Escola Superior de Enfermagem do Porto, 4200-072 Porto, Portugal
BMC Health Services Research 2016, 16(Suppl 3):O201

Background
The protection, promotion and support of breastfeeding (BF) is a
public health priority, taking into account the benefits for the child,
mother and society. BF prevalence depends on psychological, cul-
tural and social
factors of the mother [1]. Knowledge and the
mother's previous experience is critical for the BF success. Objectives:
To identify the prevalence of BF at 4 months and to evaluate the ef-
fect of the prior maternal experience in BF prevalence.
Methods
We performed a quantitative, descriptive and cross-sectional study in
a Portuguese population.
The sample was non-probabilistic,
intentional (n = 286) of mothers who were married or with a partner
(86.7 %) and average age was 31 years old. Data was collected with
a self-report questionnaire at 4 months after delivery.
Results
The BF prevalence at 4 months is 72.7 %, but only 51.0 % do so ex-
clusively. 20.3 % of mothers have previous experience of BF. Women

with previous breastfeeding experience tend to breastfeed longer
now, with statistically significant differences (U = 19.500, p = 0.000).
However, the variables studied only previous experiences and BF
duration was statistically significant (U = 19.500, p = 0.000).
Conclusions
Previous maternal experience positively influences breastfeeding
prevalence at 4 months, although this is still low according to WHO
guidelines [2]. As health professionals, we should be able to identify
difficulties early and support
their
decision.

Background
Even though it is common, normative, predictable and usually de-
sired, parenthood is one of the most dramatic developmental transi-
tions in the family life cycle,
likely to cause imbalance and
vulnerability. Objective: This study aimed to explore the influences
on the health and well-being of parents during the first 6 months of
transition to the exercise of the parental role.
Methods
Grounded Theory. Data collection from semi-structured interviews
(total of 60 interviews). Use of constant comparative method and
theoretical sampling in the process of data collection and data ana-
lysis, undertaken in a simultaneous and recursive manner. Participa-
tion of five fathers and five mothers (couples).
Results
They describe the category of living on the edge of one’s capacities,
which is composed by the subcategories of feeling exhaustion and
weariness, perceiving exhaustion and weariness in the wife, releasing
emotions and feeling less exhaustion and weariness, that explain the
consequences of the discovery of the impact that the birth of the
child has on the parents' lives, and upon realizing all the tasks and
responsibilities of parenthood.
Conclusions
The adaptation to parenthood is not easy, linear and fast. It involves
numerous situations that generate stress and emotional disturbance,
tied to tiredness, sleep disturbance, work overload and readjust-
ments of the dynamics of life, which affect the mother especially.
The antenatal and postnatal preparation for this impact should,
therefore, be encouraged and effective, as a focus of nursing
intervention.

Background
The self-determination theory suggests that humans have several basic
psychological needs that are innate, universal and essential to health
and well-being, namely autonomy, competence and relation percep-
tion. The wellness construct, measured by satisfaction with life is under-
stood as a judgment process in which individuals generally estimate
the quality of their lives based on their own criteria. Objective: The ob-
jective was to analyse the differences by gender, of the self-determined
and wellbeing levels of Portuguese active adults’ motivation.
Methods
The study sample consisted of 560 Portuguese active adults of both
genders, aged between 30 and 64 years. The instruments used were
the Behavioural Regulation in Sport Questionnaire (BRSQ), the Basic
Psychological Needs Scale Exercise (BPNES) and also the Satisfaction
with Life Scale (SWLS).
Results
The descriptive analysis revealed that female gender individuals had
higher average levels of external regulation, identified regulation and
integrated regulation, as well as autonomy, competence, relation per-
ception and satisfaction with life. Men had higher average values of
demotivation, introjected regulation and intrinsic motivation.
Conclusions
We did not identify significant gender differences in motivation dimen-
sions. However, when comparing the dimensions of basic psychological
needs and life satisfaction between genders, women showed signifi-
cantly higher levels of autonomy perception, competence and relation
perception, as well as well-being, when compared to men.

BMC Health Services Research 2016, 16(Suppl 3):P97

Background
Thought needs to be given to ways that lead to understanding and
practising geriatric care as well as identifying the actions of health
professionals, requiring an understanding of the meaning/signifi-
cance of care. Objective: to know the ways and means of giving
comfort as perceived by the hospitalized elderly.
Methods
A descriptive study with a qualitative approach, guided by the ethno-
graphic method. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 20
elderly patients, audio-recorded and submitted to content analysis.
The patients were deliberately chosen, having been admitted to a
medical service of a hospital in Lisbon. There was participant obser-
vation in order to understand the situational experiences, based on
previously structured scripts [1].
Results
The ways and means of giving comfort are contextualized within the
person’s resilience and help to maintain and restore capabilities,
allowing better support in moments of discomfort. Among the ways
and means of giving comfort used by nurses, emerged aspects re-
lated to communication (touch, smiles, humour, silence/uncondi-
tional presence),
information/clarification; relationship of empathy/
complicity; respecting the decision/will of the individual; relief of dis-
comfort through massage. This study also highlights particular mo-
ments of comfort such as family visits, the initial contact and hygiene
and personal arrangements.

Conclusions
Geriatric care is based on the meeting/interaction between the
actors under the influence of the context in which it arises. The
purpose of the different ways and forms of seeking comfort is to
facilitate/enhance comfort, relieve discomfort and/or invest in po-
tential comfort.

the parties (TI), (AB), (MM), (MH), (SU); peer reviewed articles.
Results
Of the 408 articles analysed it was possible to identify data that are
essential to the diagnostic process. After a content analysis process,
this data assumed different statuses: data that are manifestations, i.e.
data which arise as a premise and are indispensable to diagnosis
identification (e.g.: doesn´t take medication) and data that are com-
peting factors for the diagnosis. These data are those which often
have a causal relationship with the diagnosis (e.g. person, illness and
medication regime characteristics).
We also find that many of the dates are more related with adherence
than with managing therapeutic regime.
Conclusions
Since data collection is the first step of the nursing diagnosis process,
nurses must improve their knowledge based on scientific evidence,
to better identify the needs in nursing care in this area.

Background
The contemporary world instigated by new technologies is resulting
in changes in our perceptions and thus in society. This fact predis-
poses rising fears and mental conflicts, especially in children. Carl G.
and Maurice Merleau-Ponty’s grounded work reflects this today, with
its concerns about being in its totality. The psychological, cultural
and social make art a therapeutic experience, where the child can
deal with their social and personal skills. Objective: To allow thera-
peutic experiences in art therapy that promotes mental health of
children and can be used as a tool for social rehabilitation.
Methods
A phenomenological qualitative study, applied to a group of 27 chil-
dren 09-10 years in the State public school from São Paulo, Brazil, in
2013. Registration and understanding through camera recordings of
interviews and reports. The artistic techniques and materials were
varied in accordance with the engagement established with each
child. Ethical aspects were respected.
Results
Relations with perception and space were key concepts to art thera-
peutic activities collaborating in their cognitive and affective connec-
tion. The expansion of the concept of expressive therapies using
techniques and materials collaborated with the externalization of be-
ing symbolic. The process developed led to union and group trust,
helping the children to share their fears, anxieties and stored feelings
and position themselves positively in regard to their conflicts.

Conclusions
Therapeutic art activities experienced by the children enabled the
significance of the symbols preventing and promoting mental health.

Chitosan biofilms have been object of study and of application to sev-
eral industrial and research fields, such as to winemaking, food science,
tissue engineering, drug delivery and clinical
rehabilitation, among
others. Chitosan can be obtained by deacetylation of chitin, naturally
present in the exoskeletons of crustaceans, invertebrates, insects and
cell walls of some fungi. The use of chitosan from different sources
presents not only important advantages in terms of extraction and
purification of this polysaccharide, but also in terms of the different
chemical

biofilms.
In order to evaluate the properties of
fungi-extracted chitosan
and to compare them with the features presented by chitosan
obtained from crustacean sources, we have analysed the chemical
properties presented by chitosan extracted from two fungi,
namely, from Absidia coerulea and Cunninghamella sp., grown in
different culture media (YM and PDB). Chitosan solutions were
analysed by refractometry, circular dichroism (CD), UV-visible
spectroscopy and solution 1H NMR, while chitosan biofilms were
analysed by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and optical
microscopy.
Fungal chitosan presents exclusive chemical and physical properties,
in what concerns the degree of deacetylation of the polymeric
chains, viscosity, thermal resistance and structural conformation in
solution. Features that are also influenced by the composition of the
growth media used for cell culture, and that can be used industrially
as advantages.

Background
The progressive aging of the population and the families’ increasing
difficulty in being available to provide care are creating a new reality:
older people as caregivers of dependent older people. The increase
in the number of these caregivers, the consequences for their own
health and the importance of their role have turned informal care
into a highly relevant area for nursing, particularly regarding family

education in home care provision. Objective: This study aims at iden-
tifying the reasons why informal caregivers undertake the provision
of care to dependent older people at home, as well as the impact of
care provision on informal caregivers.
Methods
A qualitative design was used, combined with phenomenographic re-
search processes. The study was conducted in the district of Coimbra
with nine informal elderly caregivers of dependent older people. Data
were collected through semi-structured interviews and observation.
Ethical aspects were followed and formal authorizations were obtained.
Results
In most cases, home care is provided by women in the 71-80 age
group. The following dimensions emerged from interview analysis: mo-
tivation to care for the family member and caring task: perceived
needs. Caregivers highlighted the physical, social, economic, and emo-
tional burden. However, they also pointed out positive aspects, such as
personal satisfaction, sense of duty, and family and social recognition.
Conclusions
This study reveals that women are the ones who usually provide care
to the dependent elderly. The caring task has a negative impact on
the life of the caregivers due to its overburden.

characteristics.
Methods
A retrospective cohort analysis of electronic health record databases
of adult patients, admitted to medical and surgical areas in a Portu-
guese hospital during 2012, without any pressure ulcer on admission.
The development of the first pressure ulcer was associated with age,
gender, type of admission, specialty units, first Braden Scale score,
length of inpatient stay and ICD-9 diagnosis.
Results
From a sample of 6,572 participants, 153 (2.3 %) developed their first
pressure ulcer and the odds were significantly higher for those ad-
mitted through the emergency service [OR = 3.64 (95 % CI, 2.20-
6.05)], with Braden Scale scores ≤ 16 [OR = 4.82 (95 % CI, 3.45-6.73)]
and/or with length of inpatient stay longer than 20 days [OR = 8.35
(95 % CI, 5.92-11.78)]. Older participants, in the age group 70-79 [OR
= 9.87 (95 % CI, 1.35-71.84)] and ≥ 80 [OR = 17.75 (95 % CI, 2.46-
128.19)] also had higher odds. Participants with “traumatisms and
fractures” and “infectious diseases” had a higher incidence (6.6 %
and 5.3 % respectively).
Conclusions
The participants that developed the first pressure ulcer during the
length of stay differ from those that remain without pressure ulcers
in the variables “admission”, “Braden Scale score”, “length of in-
patient stay” and “age”. There were no differences between “gender”
and “specialty units”. The ICD-9 diagnosis could be an important risk
factor for pressure ulcer development.

BMC Health Services Research 2016, 16(Suppl 3):P104

Background
Technological society often carries an increased sedentarism among
adolescents. These can integrate exercise into their free time, with
clear health benefits. Self-efficacy, first described by Bandura (1982)
can be described as feelings of adequacy, efficiency and competence
to tackle the problems and underlies the choices and effort spent in
activities or accomplishments. Objective: to investigate associations
between self-efficacy and physical activity in adolescents.
Methods
This is a cross-sectional survey, with data collected through self-
administered IPAQ (International Physical Activity Questionnaire) and
General Self-Efficacy Questionnaire (GSQ - General Self Efficacy Ques-
tionnaire, adapted by Ribeiro (2011)) [1]. Two schools participated in
the survey (convenience sample).
It was possible to distribute the
students (n = 358, aged 14 to 18) into three groups: with sedentary
behaviours, with a moderate physical activity and presenting intense
physical activity. The scores obtained from the General Self-efficacy
scale, allowed to evaluate this parameter, specifically in such areas as
resistance to adversity,
initiative and persistence and social
effectiveness.
Results
A statistically significant difference in self-efficacy was found be-
tween the sedentary adolescents (GSQ: 38-101, mean 73.7) and ado-
lescents with intense physical activity (GSQ: 33-105, mean 80.4).
Adolescents with intense physical activity have a higher self-efficacy
(ANOVA with Bonferroni correction = .02).
Conclusions
Higher self-efficacy may be associated with more physical activity.
Health promoting strategies which promotes self-efficacy may be ap-
propriate to boost up healthy habits.

important risks (e.g. counterfeit medicines). Objective: This work in-
tends to characterize the habits of online customers of medicines/
medical supplements in Portugal.
Methods
A structured inquiry was applied to 872 people with questions re-
garding the knowledge and the practices of online medicinal prod-
ucts acquisition.
Results
The majority of respondents (75.5 %) knew about this possibility, but
only 8.4 % had online purchasing activities. The respondents who
never bought medications online pointed out reasons like preference
for the community pharmacy and lack of trust in virtual pharmacies.
Among those who have resorted to the online acquisition of me-
dicinal products, the better prices and convenience were the main
reasons cited. The slimming preparations and products for enhance-
ment of physical abilities were the most frequently acquired. A par-
ticular concern is the fact that many respondents did not take any
precaution when choosing a website (43.8 %).
Conclusions
According to these findings the Portuguese population has great
confidence in healthcare professionals and still has a small adherence
to the acquisition of medicinal products online. However, people
need to be educated for this new paradigm since the Internet and
social networking sites have an increasing impact in the marketing
of medicinal products.

In order to promote actions that encourage healthy eating practices,
autonomy and self-care, nutrition/cooking workshops were developed
in the outpatient waiting room of a college hospital. They included an
oral presentation by the Nutrition students, using a flip chart as a vis-
ual aid. The benefits of various ingredients used in the recipes were
discussed, as well as preparation methods and storage. The oral pres-
entation was followed by a tasting of the food made that day. Fifty-
four (54) workshops took place between 2014 and 2015, totalling
1,775 participants.
Several topics were approached, such as homemade energy supple-
ments, how to use leguminous plants, healthy and flavoured olive
oils, and organic produce.
The audience comprised patients and their family members, profes-
sors, students and employees. Participants indicated that the tasting
was their preferred portion of the workshop (40 %), followed by the
lectures (32 %) and the brochures (28 %). An average of 99 % of the
participants considered that the information was relevant and stimu-
lating for adopting healthier habits. All participants of all workshops,
would recommend the workshops to other people.
Finally, 96 % of the participants declared they were highly satisfied
with the activity. Students got to exchange experiences with the par-
ticipants, and broaden their skills as educators. For the participants, it
was a time for building healthier habits in a casual environment that
favoured closer integration between all those involved.

Background
Safety culture of an organization holds special meaning for patients,
payers, managers and caregivers, being a phenomenon likely to be
assessed in the various dimensions that integrates. Objective: To as-
sess the safety culture of the paediatric patient perceived by health
professionals.
Methods
Quantitative study of descriptive nature. A non-probabilistic sample
was made up of 258 health professionals in functions in paediatric and
neonatal services of Centro Hospitalar e Universitário de Coimbra and
Hospital Dr. Nélio Mendonça, Região Autónoma da Madeira (RAM). The
instrument was based on the Hospital Survey on Patient Safety Culture.
Results
Most professionals consider the patient safety “good” or “very good”.
The dimension "teamwork" stood out positively, being the "patient
safety support by management" and "response to the non-punitive
error" considered problematic. More than 79 % of the professionals
did not notify events/occurrences in the last 12 months.
Conclusions
These data suggest that it is necessary to invest in a safety culture
that promotes voluntary reporting and non-punitive error and ad-
verse events.

Background
Body image is understood as a multidimensional construction that
broadly describes the internal representations of the body structure
and the physical appearance of the individual in regards him/herself
and others. Sexual self-awareness (ACS) can be understood as the
evaluation that each of us makes of his/her feelings and actions re-
lated to his/her sexuality and sexual behaviour, describing what each
of us thinks about sex and what we feel about behaviours. Objective:
Identify dimensions of sexual self-awareness and body image in sex-
ual satisfaction of the young.
Methods
Correlational descriptive study, a convenience sample of 84 students

exist between having/not having a partner and the ACS (Student t =
2,965; GL = 82; p-value = 0.004) showing that those who mention
having a partner have a higher average ACS (average = 3.812; SD =
0.412) compared to those without (average = 3.496; SD = 0.563). No

Background
Foods are no longer only recognized for their role in providing es-
sential nutrients for normal body activity and function. Since from
the late 1980s, emphasis has been credited to their content in sub-
stances capable to promote health and wellbeing. Those functional
foods (FF) can benefit body functions beyond nutritional effects, in a
way that improves the state of health and wellbeing. To improve in-
terventions, it is advantageous to understand the consumer’s per-
ception, namely at regional level, towards FF. Objectives: To assess
consumers' attitudes regarding FF, as well as to characterise social,
demographic and economic aspects associated with the consump-
tion of FF, in a Portuguese population.
Methods
A survey was carried out, among a Portuguese population (N = 120),
in order to collect information on their socio-economic profile and
on the constructs knowledge, motivation and attitude related to FF.
The constructs were modelled as latent variables, divided in its fac-
tors, with the statistical assessment done by factorial analysis (FA).
Results
The FA validated two different constructs, the attitudinal and the mo-
tivational. Those constructs were factorized as follows: one focused
in foods, a second with the degree of knowledge in health benefits
and the third concerning the fortification and supplementation of
food.
Conclusions
These results can be used as a basis to improve communication ef-
forts regarding consumption of FF as a means to improve health and
wellbeing.

longitude and coordination of care in health care networks.

The work process of primary care in Brazil must be based on complete-
ness,
In
Brazil, the municipal management guarantees structural and procedural
conditions for the implementation of coordinated actions, based on
these principles.
This research evaluated the work process of primary health care of
271 municipalities and 1,399 health care teams of a state in southern
Brazil. A model consisting of 22 indicators was developed, aggre-
gated into two dimensions. The Structural Conditions dimension
covers Infrastructure, Personnel and Technological and Logistical
Support so that the teams can carry out their activities. The Proced-
ural Conditions analyses: Link and Territorialisation, organization of
work and Coordination of Care. The model validated and agreed on
by experts in the area allowed the identification of strengths and
weaknesses subject to intervention. Data was used from the External
Evaluation of the National Programme for Improving Access and
Quality of Primary Health Care (known as PMAQ-AB), phase 2.
The evaluated universe represented 91.9 % of the municipalities of
the Brazilian state. The study identified management advances in
structural conditions, especially in permanent education and in the
technological and specialized supply. About the procedural condi-
tions, barriers were observed on the continuity of care and work
organization with a highlight on: popular participation, intersector-
ial and shared actions, monitoring and accountability of the user.
Efforts must be made on awareness and training of professionals in
the exercise of their duties guided by the principles of Primary
Health Care.

Background
Human intestinal tract presents important non-pathogenic microor-
ganisms relevant for health. Dysregulation of this microbiota can
cause diseases and poor nutritional status. Probiotics are used for in-
testinal regulation and disease prevention, either as supplements or
as food components. Objectives: The purposes of this study were to
isolate, select and characterize the lactobacillus present in the milk of
Amazonian buffalo. This aimed at the production and evaluation of
in order to produce a Pro-
the probiotic potential of this product,
biotic food in the future.
Methods
Samples of milk from two female buffalos were used in this study, in
Macapá-AP, Brazil. Lactobacillus were isolated in Merck Research la-
boratories, and were characterized by breathing tests, Gram and
Catalase tests, and identified by Polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
They were submitted to stockpiling simulation, to viability, curves of
growth, sensibility to antimicrobials, cellular surface adhesion tests
and antagonism in vitro.
Results
Based on the samples of buffalo milk, 21 microorganisms of six spe-
cies of lactobacillus were isolated: Lactobacillus acidophilus (33.33 %),

salivarius (9.53 %). All species showed satisfactory results in terms of
growth curves and sensibility tests. In the adhesion tests, stockpiling
simulation and antagonism, the presence of L. acidophilus was more
pronounced when compared to other species.
Conclusions
L. acidophilus is considered a probiotic microorganism and is widely
used in dairy products industry. This fact supports the possibility of
producing a Probiotic food, made from the milk of Amazonian buf-
falo, in the near future.

Background
Road accidents are a leading cause of death of Portuguese children.
The correct use of restraint systems for car transportation can contrib-
ute to a reduction of up to 90 % of injuries in the case of traffic acci-
dents. Objective: To analyse whether sociodemographic characteristics
and the driver behaviour influences the protection of the child, as a
passenger.
Methods
Observational and cross-sectional study achieved in a sample of 119
drivers and 152 school children. We made up a STOP operation in
partnership with police officers, resorting to a record of socio demo-
graphic characterization and a check-list to observe the children's
carriage conditions to, and from school in a surrounding area of a
school centre in a Portuguese city.
Results
The transport was done in 92.8 % of the cases by mothers who
mostly assumed to have safety road knowledge (66.4 %). The obser-
vation of the children's transport conditions revealed that 70.4 %
used restraint system for children, 27.6 % seat belt and that 2.0 %
were traveling loosened in the car. With adequate protection were
traveling 51.3 % of children. The inferential analysis showed that the
mother, drivers aged < = 40 years, with intellectual and scientific oc-
cupations and higher education, influences significantly the proper
protection of children in road transport.
Conclusions
The use of restraint road systems for children is high, but the
intention of protection proved to be higher than the proper protec-
tion, highlighting the need to keep the nursing counselling in this
priority area of child safety promotion, especially among the most
disadvantaged Portuguese families.

Background
A Quality-by-Design (QbD) approach is mandatory in generics devel-
opment for the USA and encouraged elsewhere. How pharmaceutical
companies in Portugal are integrating it is unknown. Objective: The
aim of this study was to assess the Portuguese pharmaceutical indus-
tries’ perception and experience with QbD.
Methods
A structured survey was validated by three specialists and sent to 27
pharmaceutical companies producing active substances or medicines
(exception of medicinal gases) in Portugal between 16/12/2013 and
1/06/2014.
Results
Twelve companies answered the survey. Eleven have implemented
QbD, which is considered of greater importance among the indus-
tries having R&D activities (p-value = 0.024). Implementation has in-
creased in recent years, and 36 % used it already in a systematic
and continuous way. The most used QbD tool was “Quality Risk
Assessment and Quality Risk Management” (27 %), and the most
frequent scopes of implementation were “development and im-
provement of analytical methods” and “process improvements”
(28 %). 32 % of the companies indicated “greater robustness in the
final product quality and reduction of the risks of non-compliance
and costs” as benefit of QbD and the main obstacle towards QbD
implementation was “inability/difficulty of allocating time and quali-
fied staff” (43 %).
Conclusions
In Portugal there are companies with long experience in QbD and its
implementation is increasing. An important obstacle to QbD imple-
mentation is the requirement of skilled staff, therefore it is essential
that the Portuguese academy keeps pace with the professional de-
mands and provides students the skills needed for working with the
concept and tools of QbD.

Background
Oral hygiene habits such as tooth brushing, dental flossing and den-
tal appointments are important factors in determining good oral
health. Objectives: To determine the prevalence of dental caries and
assess oral health behaviours among a sample of Portuguese chil-
dren and adolescents.
Methods
A cross-sectional study was conducted with a sample of 1,575 chil-
dren and adolescents (50.3 % female) aged 2 to 18 years old from
Viseu, Portugal. Data collection was performed by applying a ques-
tionnaire about oral health behaviours (answered by parents and ad-
olescents) and through an intraoral observation for determination of
the decayed, missing and filled permanent teeth index (DMFT) and
deciduous teeth index (dmft).
Results
In this study, we obtained a DMFT index of 1.80 ± 2.47 with a decayed
component of 1.26 ± 1.94 and a dmft index of 2.46 ± 3.23, with a
decayed component of 2.01 ± 2.88. About 79.2 % of the sample re-
vealed tooth brushing at least twice a day. With regard to dental ap-
pointments, 60.9 % referred to visiting the dentist in the last 12 months
and 48.6 % to the consumption of sugary snacks between meals. A sta-
tistically significant association was found between the prevalence of
dental caries and the amount of daily tooth brushing (p = 0.033) and
consumption of sugary snacks between meals (p = 0.037).
Conclusions
The presence of oral diseases and inadequate oral health behaviours
among children and adolescents is still an important public health
issue in Portugal. Improvement has been verified in the last years;
however, it continues to be essential to carry out primary preventive
measures in oral healthcare among children and adolescents.

Background
Thnobotanical and ethnopharmacological studies are important
for documenting traditional knowledge and have contributed to
the discovery of many plant-derived drugs. Objectives: This study
aims to document the medicinal plant use in the community of
Igatu (Bahia, Brazil), as well as determining species with biopros-
pecting potential.
Methods
The ethnobotanical data were collected using semi-structured inter-
views. Recorded plants are listed along with their popular name,
traditional use, part used, method of preparation and use value (UV).
The informant consensus factor (ICF) and fidelity level (FL) of the
plants were also determined.

Results
A total of 80 species belonging to 73 genera and 36 families were
cited. Lamiaceae (27.8 %), Fabaceae (25.0 %), and Asteraceae
(19.4 %) families are of greater importance. Leaves were found to be
the most frequently used plant part, while infusion was the major
form of preparation. The largest number of medicinal species was in-
dicated for diseases of the digestive system. According to UV the
most important species were Lantana camara L. (2.88) and Polygala
multiceps Mart. ex A.W. Benn. (2.75). ICF values obtained reflect the
agreement on the use of plants for the treatment of diseases of eye
and adnexa, neoplasm-tumours, and endocrine, nutritional and meta-
bolic diseases.
Conclusions
Plants with high UV, ICF and FL values are good candidates for fur-
ther pharmacological and phytochemical investigations in the search
for new drugs. A comparison of the results in plants with high UV
with other studies showed that some of the traditional indications
are supported by available data from scientific literature.

Functional and cognitive difficulties have been associated with early
cognitive decline in older adults and increased risk for conversion to de-
mentia in cognitive impairment, but our understanding of this decline
has been limited by a dearth of objective methods. The primary purpose
of this study was to investigate functional and cognitive performance in
institutionalized older adults.

Ten subjects [(78.1 years (9.5), 158.4 cm (9.6), 68.2 kg (13.2), 27 BMI
(3.9)] performed a battery of functional ability tests. These tests in-
cluded functional measures such as the chair stand test (CTS), 6-
minute walking test (6MWT) and get-up and go test (GUG). Cognitive
impairment was evaluated by mini-mental state examination test
(MMSE), activities of daily living using Barthel’s index (BI) and balance
assessment with Tineti Test (TT). Results showed lower performance
in all tests (p ≤ 0.05): the chair stand test (9.8 ± 3.0 repetitions), 6MWT
(226.4 ± 114 meters), GUG (14.0 ± 10.9 seconds), MMSE (21.4 ± 5.9
total score) BI (95 ± 5.5 total score) and TT (21.9 ± 5.0 total score) at
baseline of the study. Results suggest that the effectiveness of dual-
task health intervention programmes seems to be the new strategic
way to improve functional capacity and cognitive performance and
can be useful
in decreasing functional decline in institutionalized
older adults. Activities targeting episodic memory may be most ef-
fective in addressing early functional impairment in older age.

Background
Literature has been pointing towards obesity as the moderating vari-
able of a depressive vicious cycle of self-esteem and self-image, with
social isolation, anxiety and depression. This in turn drives people to
channel sexual pleasure into the pleasure of food, thus aggravating
their condition of obesity even more and consequently causing a
major negative impact on the individual’s sexual life. Ojective: To as-
sess the importance given to sexuality in obese and overweight indi-
viduals as well as assessing the existence of a correlation between
these variables.
Methods
A quantitative exploratory study was conducted on 218 patients of
both genders (68.3 % female and 31.7 % male) aged between 18
and 65. Data collection was carried out in several hospitals in the
centre and north of the country. The data was collected by using the
Index of Sexual Satisfaction (ISS).
Results
Among participants, 82.2 % were obese or overweight. Among the
obese, 38.1 % registered a type I obesity; 16.4 % had type II obesity
(severe); and 8.7 % had type III obesity (morbid). The obese revealed
to be the ones who gave the most importance to sexuality, despite
also being the ones who present the highest sexual dissatisfaction.
Finally, the results show that there is a positive correlation, though
weak, between sexual dissatisfaction and BMI.
Conclusions
Obese individuals are the ones who revealed the highest sexual dis-
satisfaction. Therefore, the cause of such dissatisfaction must be
sought and valued as an issue related to obesity.

Pacifiers are important devices during the development and growth of
babies and young children, mainly owing to possible prevention of

sudden instant death syndrome and provision of a comfort feeling to-
wards stress and anxiety. However, permanent contact between pacifier
and oral microflora leads to the creation of a biofilm in the pacifier’s sur-
face. Besides, the contamination of pacifier’s outsides toddlers’ mouth
cannot be disregarded by being dropped and immediately used by in-
fants, enabling the entrance of pathogenic bacteria that might generate
relevant and eventual systemic infections.
The main objectives of this study were to develop a method to
quantitatively analyse the contamination of pacifiers used by infants
and to compare the contamination susceptibility of two different ma-
terials: natural rubber and silicon. Ten samples were collected in a
nursery in North of Portugal and properly kept in sterile bags during
its transportation to the laboratory. Subsequently, a microbiological
collection was performed from the pacifiers into Petri dishes previ-
ously filled with nutrient agar. Following incubation for 48 h, bacter-
ial colonies were counted.
It was possible to confirm the presence of several colonies in the
studied samples and, according to the obtained results, there was a
tendency to a greater contamination in silicon than in rubber
pacifiers.
The present study demonstrates that it’s important to define strat-
egies to ensure the convenient cleaning and sterilization of pacifiers,
owing to their massive contamination. Further studies, with larger
number of samples, would be important to conclude about the most
suitable composition of pacifiers,
regarding the contamination
prevention.

Background
Transition to retirement requires an effective adaptation to the new
roles and functions in individuals and their partners. The couple lives
special moments in this transition, maybe with a new marital dy-
namic. Objectives: To analyse the experiences of couple relationships
in the process of adaptation to retirement and the strategies
adopted to address it.
Methods
This is a qualitative and descriptive study. The sample consisted of
32 couples in which at least one spouse was retired for less than five
years. The subjects were registered in health units of a Regional
Health Administration of
region of Portugal. Semi-
the central
structured interviews and thematic analysis using the NVivo10® pro-
gram were used.
Results
The experiences of couple relationships in transition to retirement
showed the following topics: Resources; Vulnerabilities; Expectations
and future idealizations. Resources of conjugality and marital
idealization in the future proved to be strategies of adaptation to
retirement. Positive couple relationships are assumed as an im-
portant condition in the transition to retirement which is reflected
in health and well-being. Couples have different vulnerabilities
and marital resources. The spouse seems to be a key resource for
the retired individual. Couples idealize happy times but also ex-
pect future difficulties.
Conclusions
The transition to retirement is a moment which, due to its marital
and social importance, needs more investment in terms of psycho-
logical and physical health care.

Background
Drug-nutrient interactions are not always valued in clinical practice.
These interactions may result in drug-induced nutrient deficiency
and therefore preventive and corrective treatments may be neces-
sary. Pharmacy Technicians play an important role in identifying pa-
tients at risk. Objectives: To determine and characterise the values of
the bone mineral density of patients using quantitative ultrasonic
measurements of the calcaneus; to analyse the use of preventive or
corrective treatment of drug-induced nutritional deficiencies and
their consequences.
Methods
Observational analytic cross-sectional study performed in a Commu-
nity Pharmacy in Porto with 103 individuals (82.5 % female) over the
age of 40. Data collection was obtained through a structured ques-
tionnaire. Bone mineral density of the participants was quantitatively
assessed by ultrasound of the calcaneus. Data were analysed using
SPSS.
Results
Bone mineral density values were significantly lower in women
(0.405 ± 1.07 g/cm3 vs. 0.510 ± 0.142 g/cm3). There was also a more
pronounced decrease with age. Sixty-six per cent of the patients
were being medicated with at least one drug that could induce cal-
cium deficiency. Of the patients at risk, only 24.5 % take any sort of
oral supplementation. About 30%of patients at
risk were never
screened or treated for osteoporosis.
Conclusions
The quantitative assessment of bone mineral density by ultrasound
of the calcaneus in the pharmacy, allows the tracking of high-risk in-
dividuals. Pharmacy Technicians and other health professionals must
provide a greater awareness of drug-induced nutritional deficiencies
and adopt measures to prevent and avoid negative effects on pa-
tient health.

Age-related psychological changes frequently express an increase in de-
pressive symptoms and loss of vigour. A wide literature describes the
benefits of regular physical exercise in mental health. However, concern-
ing the elderly, the results are scarce. This study aimed to characterize
the Profile of Mood States (POMS) in regular physically active elderly
people. Moreover, we also intended to verify how the perception of

health status was associated with POMS and whether there are differ-
ences between the sexes.
The survey sample was composed by 279 elderly people (237 fe-
males and 42 males), aged between 65 and 92 years, practitioners of
physical exercise. The POMS questionnaire was used to measure
positive (vigour) and negative (tension, depression, hostility, fatigue
and confusion) variables. A case history questionnaire was used to
measure the perception of their state of health. The t-test and Mann-
Whitney test were used to compare variables by sex. A Spearman
test was used to test association of variables. The significance level
was set at 0.05.
According to POMS, the results revealed that the typical positive ice-
berg profile exists in this sample, with higher values obtained in
vigour and lower values in negative variables. This profile was even
better in men compared to women (p < 0.05). The perception of
health was higher in men and was positively associated with the
vigour scale of POMS and negatively associated with negative vari-
ables of POMS.
These results suggest that regular physical activity may contribute to
maintaining elderly psychological well-being which proved to be re-
lated with health perception.

(Un)Safety behaviour at work: the role of education towards a
health and safety culture

Work accidents are a constant and fatal reality in all countries. The
main causes are related to precarious working conditions and to
workers’ inadequate behaviour. There is an obvious connection be-
tween behaviour and risk prevention at work. However, behaviour is
not always the most important element in preventing labour acci-
dents. Therefore, to promote a culture of health and safety among
workers, it is fundamental to understand not only the role of educa-
tion in fostering a conscientious behaviour prone to following safety
procedures, but also the individual characteristics of each employee.
In Portugal, work related accidents occur frequently among workers
with low levels of education and training.
The objective of this paper is to explore the correlation between
education and training programmes and the prevention strategy re-
garding labour risks in Portugal. Since the early 1990s, several na-
tional plans have been designed and implemented in order to assure
the effective integration into school curricula of contents related to
labour risks and health and safety at work. The National Programme
for Education on Safety and Health at Work (PNESST) implemented
in 2000 is the main example of the national strategy for education
and training towards a culture of health and safety.
By examining the implementation of the PNESST and analysing the
statistics of occupational accidents in Portugal, it is possible to deter-
mine that safety behaviour at work is related to the workers’ level of
information and training in safety and health. Undoubtedly, this ap-
proach can contribute to reduce the number of labour accidents.

Background
The societal changes have created new necessities in terms of health
care and of professionals with diverse skills. The institutions of higher
education should promote the development of an entrepreneurial
profile in students which may boost the exploration of new opportun-
ities. Objectives: To identify the entrepreneurial profile in the students
in higher education and its relationship to some personal characteris-
tics and training.
Methods
Correlational quantitative study, accomplished with 1,604 students
from 18 institutions of polytechnic Institutes of Portugal. The collec-
tion of data occurred between July and November/2015. The Carland
Entrepreneurship Index (CEI) entrepreneurial skills questionnaire was
applied, along with the acquisition of socio-demographic variables of
the students. Data was analysed with the SPSS 23.0. The study
followed the ethical requirements.
Results
The (CEI) application, allowed us to note that 75.7 % of the students
presented an entrepreneurial profile, 20.8 % a Micro entrepreneurial
profile and 3.4 % a Macro entrepreneurial. Additionally, we verified
that older students (r = 0.193, p < = 0.000), of the male gender (Fe-
male = 0.55; Male, M = 0.580 p < 0.000), that had already worked or
would like to work for others, showed the greatest entrepreneurial
potential (Yes M = 0.60; No 0.54; p < 0.000), along with those who
participated in entrepreneurial contents during their training (Did
not participate M = 0.53; Participated 0.58; p < 0.000).
Conclusions
The entrepreneurial profile is related with some social demographic
characteristics of the students; however, the educational institutions
may have a preponderant role in the development of that profile,
which may contribute to a greater contribution in the wellbeing of
the populations.

The working situation of pregnant women has special connotations,
both in the physical and psychological situation and this may influence
their welfare. Aware of this, the present work has as objective to evalu-
ate the perceived quality of life for pregnant working women at differ-
ent times of pregnancy.
This work had a convenience sample of 165 pregnant women living
in Burgos (Spain) and workers from different weeks of gestation and
a wide range of ages.
The study has a cross-cutting nature and the data collection was car-
ried out with the WHOQOL-BREF questionnaire and an ad hoc ques-
tionnaire to collect identification data and the weeks of gestation.
The criteria variables were: perceived quality of life, satisfaction with
the health and quality of life in physical dimensions, health, psycho-
logical health, social relationships and environment. The predictor
variables were weeks of pregnancy and age.

The results show that in general women are quite satisfied with their
quality of life and health. The relationship between the variables that
measure the quality of life and stage of pregnancy does not become
significant although a trend to higher scores is observed in the over-
all assessment and the different dimensions in women who are in
the category between 31 and 35 years.

Background
Economic crises have a deleterious impact on mental health. Un-
employment and precarious work conditions pose an increased risk
to psychological wellbeing. Effective community-based interventions
need to be developed within the context of mental health equity-
oriented programmes. Objectives: To identify effective short-term
community-based interventions for psychological wellbeing protection
among unemployed and temporary agency workers. More specifically,
we aimed to identify which psychosocial competences, therapeutic
reference-models and intervention formats should be used in these
interventions.
Methods
We did a scoping review to map conceptually-driven interventions
(through PubMed and SciELO). Results of this review were submitted
to the opinion of a Delphi panel of experts, selected by intentional
sampling,
in the areas of: mental health promotion, public health,
psychological intervention and human-resources management. Con-
sensus criteria were set as 90 % of the scores per-item higher than 3
(5-point Likert scale) and average higher than 3.5 (variation coeffi-
cient lower than 0.35).
Results
The Delphi panel involved 46 experts (participation-rate at the end
of 2 rounds: 90 %). Consensus was achieved for 5 intervention
sessions with medium-size groups (15-20 people). Experts proposed
different
therapeutic-driven models (e.g., psychodynamic-inspired,
systemic, cognitive-behavioural) as adequate for the indicated pur-
poses. Cognitive-behavioural and psycho-educational strategies for
mental health literacy promotion, psychosocial competences and
emotional regulation were considered as maximizing the possibility
of positive effects.
Conclusions
Irrespective of
increased knowledge
about mental health and basic psychosocial (empathy, active listen-
ing, assertiveness) and emotional-regulation competences emerged
as necessary for wellbeing protection and to enhance resilience
among vulnerable populations.

Background
The SF-6D classification provides utility values for health status. Util-
ities generated have a number of potentially valuable applications in
economic evaluations and not only to ensure comparability between
studies. Reference values can be useful to estimate the effect of in-
terventions on patients’ HRQoL in the absence of control groups.
Thus, the purpose would be to provide the SF-6D normative values
in the Chilean population.
Methods
A cross-sectional study was conducted. A total of 5,293 people
agreed to participate in the study. SF-6D utilities were derived from
SF-12 questions.
Results
Mean SF-6D utility index for the whole sample was 0.74. It was better
for men (0.78) than for women (0.71). The ceiling effect was much
higher for men (11.16 %) than for women (5.31 %). Women were
more likely to show problems in any dimension than men.
Conclusions
Chilean population norms for the SF-6D are shown in this paper to
help in decision-making in health policies. Men reported a higher
state of health than women in all sub-categories analysed. Likewise,
men also reported higher scores than women in all dimensions of
SF-6D in overall.

Background
The concept of entrepreneurship is subdivided into entrepreneurship
of opportunity and entrepreneurship of necessity, evidencing that
labour-market instability has an important role in the decision to pur-
sue it (Global Entrepreneurship Monitor, 2013). The recent world fi-
nancial crisis led to social and employment instability in Portugal,
with potential
influence on the motivation to partake in business
ventures. Objectives: To analyse the relationship between the Percep-
tion of Social and Economic Instability (PSEI) and select contextual
and socio-demographic variables in polytechnic college students.
Methods
A correlational quantitative study made with 1,604 students from 18
different Portuguese Superior-Polytechnic institutions
(mainland
Portugal). A survey on business motivation from Parreira, Pereira and
Brito (2011) was applied. The sample consists of female students
(65.2 %), married students (11.1 %) and worker-students (19.7 %).
The data were analysed through SPSS.
Results
Students with entrepreneur aspirations felt able to start a business
and contrast with worker-students, who have less PSEI, respectively

(Midea = 2.97, SD = 1.20; Mwithout_idea s = 3.21, SD = 1.12, t(1601) =
4.10, p < .000); (Mable_create = 3.01, SD = 1.16; Mnot_able_create =

Mstudent_worker = 2.92, SD = 1.17, t(1599) = 2.74 p < .006), relation
between aspiration to the international market and PSEI (Minternacio-
nal = 2.95, SD = 1.24; Mnot_international = 3.11, SD = 1.15,
t(1601) =
2.31, p < .021); women demonstrate more PSEI (Mmale = 2.93, SD =
1,13; Mfemale = 3.16, SD = 1.18, t(1601) = 3.17 p < .000); married stu-
dents show less PSEI (Mmarried/joint = 2.91, SD = 1.17; Mother = 3.10,
SD = 1.17, t(1601) = 2.11 p < .035).
Conclusions
Some sociodemographic variables are revealed to have influence
on this process. Socioeconomic reality and the perception of in-
stability in different contexts conditions the student’s perception as
an entrepreneur.

Herbal therapy is characterized by the use of aromatic and medicinal
plants (AMP) in different pharmaceutical forms for therapeutic purposes.
The present study aims to characterize the use of AMP, drugs and herbal
products in Bragança city.
A cross-sectional study was conducted through application of a ques-
tionnaire to 404 subjects of both gender and aged between 18 and
89 years.
AMP were therapeutically used by 53.7 % mainly due “to be natural”
(43.9 %) while 33.8 % use drugs and/or herbal products mainly “be-
cause it is good for health” (53.5 %). The AMP most used were
Cidreira (n = 149) and Camomila (n = 117) and concerning drugs and/
or herbal products Valdispert® (n = 48) and Daflon® 500 (n = 41) were
the most reported.
Overall, the reported uses of AMP, drugs and herbal products were
correct, according to the reported in literature. The use of AMP is
motivated by self-knowledge (55.4 %) while drugs and/or herbal
products are used mostly by medical prescription (44.1 %). AMP were
obtained by own cultivation (44.1 %) and drug and/or herbal prod-
ucts in pharmacies (89.0 %). Of all users, about 90 % did not com-
bined these products with conventional drugs and it was identified
just one potential occurrence of drug interactions related with the
use of Hipericão. The occurrence of adverse effects was noted after
the use of AMP Sene (11.8 %), Hipericão (9.1 %) and Ginkgo Biloba
(8.3 %). The use of these products is a common practice among the
residents of Bragança city, which use a wide diversity of AMP and
plant-based products.

Edible flowers are commonly used in human nutrition and their con-
sumption has increased in the last years. In Europe, the most common
application of flower petals in human nutrition is in the preparation of
hot beverages (tisane or infusion), providing wellness due to the me-
dicinal properties already recognized. Thus,
it is paramount to know
their nutritional composition as well as other functional and beneficial
properties often related to their bioactive compounds and antioxidant
properties.
Rose (Rosa canina L.), marigold (Calendula officinalis L.) and camellia
(Camellia L.) were compared for their contents in total phenolics, fla-
vonoids and carotenoids. Moreover, their antioxidant capacity was
assessed.
In what concerns bioactive compounds and antioxidant activity
(DPPH(cid:129)), promising levels were obtained, showing significant differ-
ences among samples (p < 0.001). C. officinalis presented the highest
levels of total phenolics and carotenoids contents (35.4 mg GAE/g,
15.6 mg/g, respectively). Herein, the best results for flavonoids con-
tent were obtained in rose petals (~95 mg ECE/g) potentially indicat-
ing the presence of high percentage of glycosylated polyphenolics
which are readily soluble in water. Since the antioxidant activity is
often correlated with the contents in total bioactive compounds the
correlation coefficients among bioactive compounds and antioxidant
activity were also studied.
The antioxidant activity was found to be positively and significantly
highly correlated with total phenolics (rs = 0.917, p = 0.001) and ca-
rotenoids (rs = 0.900, p = 0.001). These findings might have practical
applications regarding the enhancement of edible flowers, either for
prompt consumption as well as to develop food supplements or
pharmaceutics related products.

Background
Leisure activities, often left in the background throughout life, play
an important role for older persons. They are activities that they like
to accomplish, according to individual preferences that make it easier
to maintain an active life, on a physical, mental and social level, im-
proving their health. Objectives: I) Identify the leisure habits of older
people living in nursing homes; II) Describe the nursing homes’ offer
of leisure activities; III) Identify relationships between leisure activities
and the seniors’ health condition.
Methods
A cross-sectional descriptive correlational study, in 12 nursing homes
in the north of Portugal with a sample of 1,131 seniors. We per-
formed a descriptive and inferential statistical data analysis using
SPSS/PC for Windows, version 22.
Results
Participants were mostly female, widows, with an average age of
84 years. The most common leisure activity is watching TV. Impaired
sight and illiteracy are the most frequent causes of elderly people’s

non-adherence to leisure activities. Leisure activities: card/board
games, crafts and reading are associated with better cognitive per-
formance; sightseeing and reading are associated with greater inde-
pendence in self-care; watching television is associated with greater
compromise of bodily processes and greater dependence on self-
care; performing manual work is associated with less depression;
walking is associated with a lower compromise of bodily processes
and lower risk of falling.
Conclusions
Leisure habits are important in maintaining the health of older
people living in nursing homes.

Background
Ageing among Portuguese population is leading to an increase in
the proportion of elderly people. Age-related changes are respon-
sible for high levels of disability, balance problems and high risk of
falls, Physiotherapy can identify elderly in risk of falling and provide
strategies to prevent falls in this population contributing to maintain
functionality. The purpose of this study was to characterise the risk

Cross-sectional study. Sixty-one (61) subjects participated in the
study, 40 (65.6 %) females and 21 (34.4 %) males, aged 74 ± 7.5 years.
Outcome measures were balance assessed with Berg Balance Scale
(BBS); fear of falling with Falls Efficacy Scale (FES); functionality with
Composite Physical Function (CPF).
Results
The results of our study showed that for BBS the median was 54, for
FES was 96 and for CPF was 20 points. The risk of falling for this sam-
ple was 11 %. Positive associations were found between BBS and FES
(R = 0.589; p = 0.00), CPF and BBS (R = 0.723; p = 0.00) and CPF and
FES (R = 0.613; p = 0.00).
Conclusions
Risk of falling is present among the participants in our study. The
positive associations between balance, confidence and functionality
indicate that balance and confidence in performing activities of daily
living are important for having high levels of function, suggesting
that physiotherapy focused on balance training can contribute to en-
hance independence.

The study of the relationship between the musculoskeletal pain and pos-
tural habits in children and teenagers of the 2nd and 3rd cycles of basic
education (107 male and 97 female) can establish criteria in health care in
individuals during growth. A body part discomfort scale was adopted to
check the references of pain level and localization. The results indicated
ranged from 0 (no pain) and 5 (maximum pain), with an average of 2.40 ±
0.96 (moderate to severe pain), and longer time of the presence of pain
(39.2 % of chronic pain) the greater the average intensity of pain (2.59 ±
0.87). 67.3 % (148) of the participants indicated musculoskeletal pain,
53.4 % reported pain in at least two different locations and 27 % referred
to pain in three or more places. The 5th grade participants indicated
chronic pain with 27.3 % as being 25 % (subacute) and 47.7 % (acute). In
contrast, the amount of 9th grade participants who referred to pain in the
body decreased (58.8 %), but the average pain (2.50 ± 0.89) and its dur-
ation increased (56.7 % of chronic pain). The average value of greater pain
among women (2.57 ± 0.93) in both years of schooling was greater com-
pared to males who had a mean value of pain 2.18 ± 0.97. This study
aimed to present the 1st phase of a study developed in the school envir-
onment, in order to contribute to the deepening of the discussion on pos-
tural education. These results showed a prevalence of moderate/severe
pain, the largest level of pain in females and in higher grade students.

Contemporary governance demands mutual interdependence of actors
through participatory devices in order to competently address public
problems and improve the quality of decisions. This debate is actively
present within the health system where several international organiza-
tions have been exhorting national governments to develop public
spaces within civil society as the proper locations for the improvement
of their health systems. To date, several initiatives have been put for-
ward and substantial resources have been invested in the design and
implementation of citizens’ participation exercises in the health domain.
The main focus of this paper is civil society's involvement with health
systems.
Italian, Portu-
guese, and Spanish health systems and the main steps in their re-
form processes. The most relevant initiatives of citizen participation
are identified, highlighting their key features and potential, as well as
the main critical issues raised.
The evolution of the national health services in the countries ana-
lysed shares a common history, as well as similar models for the
provision of health services in the case of Italy, Portugal, and Spain.
With the exception of Greece, where participation is in an early
stage, the participatory activities implemented in the other three
countries revealed common features: I) a gap between the discourse
on the importance of citizens' participation that permeated the re-
form processes and the practices implemented within health ser-
vices;
II) most of the experiments only take place at a local or
regional level; III) the changes of governments have been negatively
affecting the consolidation of participatory experiences.

Background
Occupational stress occurs when individuals perceive work demands
as exceeding their resources and abilities to cope with them, indu-
cing a set of physical and emotional responses and affecting job sat-
isfaction. Policing is often associated with high levels of occupational
stress, resulting from stressors found in the work environment and in
the individual’s family life. Objectives: To assess perceived occupa-
tional stress levels in police officers and to identify the most relevant
stressors.
Methods
Fifteen (15) police officers (from a police station with 45 profes-
sionals), 93.3 % males, 24 - 46 years (M = 33.27; SD = 6.24), with an
average of 9.07 years of experience (SD = 6.72), 66.7 % working more
than 40 hours/week and 86.7 % doing shift work, completed the
“Operational Police
Stress Questionnaire”
and the
“Organizational Police Stress Questionnaire” (PSQ-Org).
Results
Participants presented moderate stress levels for PSQ-Org (M = 3.45;
SD = 1.18) and PSQ-Op (M = 3.62; SD = 1.01), with no significant dif-
ferences between scores. No significant differences were found in
stress levels regarding demographic or job variables. Main sources of
stress are related to lack of resources, bureaucracy, working hours,
shift work, the risk of being injured or witnessing traumatic events.
Conclusions
Our findings suggest a perception of moderate level of occupational
stress in police officers, both at organizational and operational level.
The fact that even moderate-intensity stressors affect individuals in a
chronic way and may elicit physical and emotional responses, affect-
ing health and well-being, strengthens the importance of interven-
tions that enhance police officers’ ability to cope with stressors,
helping to preserve job satisfaction and quality of life.

Background
The processes of globalization have a clear impact on occupational
therapy. Consequently, there is a growing interest in aspects relating
to health and culture in many societies. The development of an occu-
pational therapy centre to promote mental health in Houndé, Bur-
kina Faso (West Africa), must to go beyond the usual terminological
questions, and to deepen and refine new guidelines in relation to
the construction and consolidation of knowledge and also to the
practical aspects in the country. Objectives: The main objective of
this qualitative study was to analyse the occupational therapy profes-
sional culture and its impact on practice having the development of
the occupational therapy centre to promote mental health in Burkina
Faso as reference.
Methods
A qualitative design was used and it was based on a doubly re-
flexive ethnography, a heuristic three-dimensional model consist-
ing of syntactic, pragmatic and semantic dimensions. Accordingly,
the methodology is based on ten semi-structured interviews with

Results
The results show that it’s necessary and urgent to develop conscious-
ness and responsibility for the power relations that are implicit but
also explicit in the theory and practice of occupational therapy.

The reform of primary care in Portugal
sionals to the possibility of pay-for-performance. Thus, two types of
payment co-exist: the fixed salary, and pay-for-performance. This
work sets out to test if the type of payment scheme determines pay-
ment satisfaction, to identify factors explaining the payment satisfac-
tion and also to test if the type of payment scheme influences the
self-perceived quality of health care provided in primary health care
units.
Methods
A quantitative approach is adopted. Data from a survey is analysed
by estimating tobit regressions.
Results
Payment satisfaction is explained by the type of incentives paid; be-
ing nurse decreases the payment satisfaction; the quality of health
care unit has a positive relation with the type of incentives paid.
Conclusions
This is the first work of this kind for the Portuguese primary health
care and it contributes to the ongoing discussion about pay-for-
performance in the health sector.

BMC Health Services Research 2016, 16(Suppl 3):P106

Background
The paper aims to define the association between health develop-
ment, measured by life expectancy, and economic development, fo-
cusing on Portugal, measured by Gross Domestic Product (GDP). We
wish to test if causality between growth and health measured by life
expectancy is possible, thus attesting to the adequacy of health pol-
icies, concerning the increase in quality and years of life of the
population.

Methods
To perform the test a Vector Autoregressive Model Analysis – VAR
model is used, and Granjer’s [1] causality test, applied to Portuguese
time-series data from 6 decades. Alongside this, a univariate and bi-
variate analysis is applied.
Results
The positive evolution of GDP, over the years until 2010, before the
beginning of economic crisis, at a positive rate of 14.0 %, has been
followed by an increase in life expectancy. Even though the linear re-
gression evidences a significant direct relation between variables (p-
value = 0.002), the causality is not sustained.
Conclusions
Even though the results in the period show no interdependence of
variables, health conditions are supported by growth [2], and health
contributes to economic development [3-7]. Therefore, policies con-
cerning productive aging should be considered.

Background
Cigarette smoking is one of the main risk factors for the occurrence
of clinical complications such as cardiovascular diseases, cancer or
hypertension. Currently the most common methods to quit smoking
are behavioural counselling and pharmacological therapy, however
their success rate remains quite low. Objectives: To analyse what is
the effectiveness of exercise on smoking cessation and to discover
what is the type of exercise and its characteristics that lead to better
outcomes.
Methods
Pubmed, Cochrane Library, PEDro and ScienceDirect were consulted
during the months of March and April 2015. The research was limited
to guidelines, meta-analyses, systematic reviews and randomized
controlled trials, written in English and published in scientific journals
over the past 5 years. To be valid, the article should have as popula-
tion smokers that performed an exercise program as intervention in
comparison to its non-application. The wanted outcome was the per-
centage of subjects who stopped smoking on a long-term basis.

Results
It was considered valid to analysis eight randomized controlled trials
that tested the effectiveness of aerobic exercise programs, muscular
resistance and yoga.
Conclusions
Exercise tends to improve the percentage of long-term smoking ces-
sation. The application of an aerobic exercise program of moderate
intensity, 100 to 150 minutes per week, over 12 weeks of smoking
abstinence is recommended.

Background
Positive psychology is changing the way we research mental health
to practices more than
in western society, bringing a focus
5,000 years old in eastern culture, specifically with roots in India, such
as yoga. Objectives: The aim of this paper is to explore documented
effects of yoga on mental health, through a systematic review of lit-
erature (independently of year of publication, country or language).
Methods
The Scopus database was used and 29 publications were retrieved,
10 were excluded (such as theoretical articles, books and research
that didn’t report mental health effects).
Results
Forty-eight (48) effects of yoga in mental health were found in the
19 publications analysed, which were systematized in three major
categories. Personality and life style impacts (11), the first category,
included decreases in neuroticism and psychoticism traits, changes
in life style and increased quality of life, among others.
Increased
spatial memory and attention span, as well as decreased rumination
negative affect are examples of the 15 effects included in the second
category, named cognitive-perceptual impacts. Finally, 22 emotional
effects (third category) were found, such as decreased anger levels,
depression and anxiety. Overall, positive effects were predominant
and only one effect can be interpreted as somehow negative (obses-
sive passion for yoga).
Conclusions
Since there are several types of yoga and diverse yoga techniques,
further studies should analyse its specific impacts on mental health.
Nevertheless, we hope this study allows a better comprehension of
the benefits of yoga and, possibly, integration of yoga strategies in
mental health interventions.

Environment and lifestyle have been recognized as important determi-
nants of health problems of populations of economically developed
countries. In particular, these two factors seem to play a role on chronic
degenerative diseases, sudden illness and accidents. The aim of our
study is to compare lifestyles among higher education students that
lived in rural and urban environments until adult age.
One hundred and thirty-two (132) students of both genders (85
males; 47 females) participated in the study. The mean age was of
21.81 years old (SD = 3.78). Subjects were divided in two groups
(group 1 - those that lived until adult age in a rural environment
and group 2 - the students that lived in an urban environment until
adult age). To characterize the sample an adaptation of the Telama
et al.’s [1] questionnaire was applied. The Fantastic Lifestyle Assess-
ment Questionnaire - Portuguese version was applied to evaluate
the lifestyle. For the study analysis, descriptive and inferential statis-
tics were used. A Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was applied for normal
distribution of data and a Mann-Whitney test for non-parametric
statistics.
Results show a significant difference in only one dimension (insight)
of the questionnaire (p ≤ 0.05). The remaining dimensions and the
total scores of the questionnaire show no statistically significant dif-
ferences. These results show that the type of environment (rural or
urban) lived in until adult age doesn’t seem to reveal significant dif-
ferences in a healthy lifestyle.
Overall the evaluated subjects presented results of “Good” and "Very
Good" in the total score of the questionnaire revealing healthy
lifestyles.

The Mobile Emergency Care Service (SAMU) in Brazil carries out pre-
hospital care in seeking harm reduction, deaths and increased survival.
It acts as an originator of network attention to the urgency and link be-
tween different services.
This is an evaluative research of mobile emergency care service with
analysis of 80 central regulations and 87 municipalities of a Brazilian
state that host units of basic and advanced support. It used a theor-
etical and logical model and evaluative matrix, validated through
included two dimensions. The
workshops with experts. The model
emergency management dimension analyses infrastructure,
finan-
cing, regulatory process and joins SAMU with the entire system. At-
tention is paid to urgent infrastructure analyses, diagnostic and
therapeutic support and appropriateness of care. We used different
collection strategies: document and literature review; interviews with
key informants and direct observation.

The analysis allowed the identification of strengths, and also weak-
nesses that can be prevented. No region performed well, all dimen-
sions were classified as regular and nearly half of the emergency
management units require urgent attention. The SAMU partially or-
ganises the network which must evolve towards greater internal inte-
gration of
its units and regulation of so-called fire and rescue
services. It is recognized as a fast and quality service, but there was
resistance to the acceptance once the patients had been referred.
Coordination mechanisms and internal and external communication
need to be implemented. The quality of the units is a matter of con-
cern. The model was considered feasible to contemplate municipal,
regional and state assignments can be replicated in other contexts.

any other method. In a sample of 382 women with an average age
of 30.95 years (±5.45 years), in 34.6 % of cases non-pharmacological
methods for pain relief were applied in labour, highlighting breath-
ing and relaxation (86.3 %). In some cases, although to a lesser ex-
tent, hydrotherapy was applied, isolated (6.9 %) or associated with
breathing and relaxation (5.3 %) and hypnosis (0.8 %) and the associ-
ation between breathing and massage (0.8 %).
Conclusions
According to the results obtained and on the basis of scientific evi-
dence available,
it should be noted that it is essential that non-
pharmacological care relief in childbirth pain is exploited because it
is safer and tends to carry fewer interventions and arguably a greater
humanization of childbirth and safer motherhood.

BMC Health Services Research 2016, 16(Suppl 3):P111

The consumption of fruits has become a way to improve our health.
Bioactive compounds have an important role in antioxidant activity,
since they are responsible for the protection of the cells by stabilizing
or deactivating free-radicals. The evaluation and quantification of the
bioactive compounds of dozens of tropical fruits allowed to stand out
three fruits with a significant antioxidant activity: camu camu, acerola
and açai. However, by-products also showed stunning amounts of
bioactive compounds, which may be useful for developing of new
products.
Further, the correlation identified phenolic compounds as major
contributors for the antioxidant activity, although it was inconclusive
about which specific phenolic compound had more influence.

Background
Labour pain is the result of complex interactions, similar to acute
pain, but with specific characteristics of neurophysiological, obstetric,
psychological and sociological nature involved in its threshold. In this
sense, non-pharmacological methods can help the mother in reliev-
ing pain, reduce stress and anxiety levels and thus foster greater sat-

and childbirth that interfere with the use of non-pharmacological
methods to relieve pain.
Methods

descriptive, cross-sectional study, according to a non-probability ana-
lysis of 382 clinic records of post-partum mothers.
Results

Potential dangers that arise from the use of pacifiers by children have
been reported for the past few decades. The repeated cases of injuries
and even fatalities possibly due to poorly designed pacifiers justified the
elaboration of guidelines that ensured the mechanical safety of those
devices in United States of America, Brazil and European Union.
This experimental study is the first one to describe the submission of
a group of pacifiers sold in a European country to a group of tests
and determinations that enable the evaluation of its mechanical
safety, after EN1400 came into force. Adopted methods included de-
terminations of nipple resistance, total size of the device, presence
and size of ventilation holes, performance of a swallowing risk test
and label analysis.
All 13 samples were bought in pharmacies and childcare stores in
the north of Portugal and belonged to five different brands. The
obtained results revealed that all analysed samples presented the
minimum required ventilation holes with adequate sizes and cor-
rect placement. Also all samples proved to have nipples with ad-
equate resistance to stretch and never exceeded the maximum
permitted size. None of the samples went by the polytetrafluoro-
ethylene (PTFE) device that mimicked the mouth of a child.
It is
quite clear that pacifiers sold in Portuguese pharmacies and child-
care stores present high standards of mechanical security, prob-
ably owing to the implementation of EN1400. However,
it would
be important to perform similar tests on pacifiers sold in internet
websites.

loading. There seems to be an asymmetrical activation of the axial mus-
cles, with preference towards the right side of the body, in a loading
condition. A 20 % body weight backpack causes the most significant
muscular changes; however, statistically significant differences were
also found at 15 % body weight conditions.
Conclusions
Analysis of the present findings suggests the choice of 10 % body
weight as the upper limit recommended for backpack load for
schoolchildren.

Background
The development of prenatal care requires multi-disciplinary actions
focused on women's health. Humanization and quality care are cru-
cial for the health of the mother-infant pair. The study aimed to ana-
lyse the knowledge of pregnant women about the importance of
prenatal consultation
Methods
It is a field study, descriptive with a qualitative approach. It was held
at the Family Health Unit of Jussara neighbourhood in the city of
Feira de Santana, Bahia, Brazil. The research subjects were 18 preg-
nant women undergoing prenatal
follow up in the unit. Semi-
structured interviews were used for this study. Interviews were sub-
jected to thematic content analysis.
Results
Most women reported that the importance of completing the pre-
natal follow up was mainly based on the detection of some diseases
and also to care for the health of the child. The first prenatal consult-
ation should take place in the first twelve weeks of pregnancy, as
recommended by the Ministry of Health, and this period was
respected by most of the pregnant women.
Conclusions
Prenatal influences directly the gestational process, and such assist-
ance should be carried out properly, by professionals who have the
knowledge that must be transmitted to pregnant women. The posi-
tive role of prenatal care during pregnancy was recognized by all re-
spondents. However, it is important to stress out the need to carry
out a quality prenatal care, because when conducted improperly, it
can bring numerous health losses to both mother and child.

Background
The purpose of the present study is to analyse the influence of four
backpack loading conditions (0, 10, 15 and 20 % of body weight) on
the electromyographic activity of the neck and lumbar muscles of
elementary school children.
Methods
Fourteen (14) school children participated in the present study, 5
males and 9 females, between the ages of 8 and 10. Bilateral sterno-
cleidomastoid, rectus abdominis and erector spinae muscles were re-
corded using surface electromyography (SEMG), while tested for the
effect of four randomized backpack loading conditions.
Results
The results showed an increase in the activity of the cervical erector
spinae muscle, while erector lumbar spinae decreased in the presence
of heavy loading. Rectus abdominis activity also increased and esterno-
cleidomastoid muscle did not change its activity in the presence of

Background
One of the most frequent symptoms in medical practice is cough.
Consequently, there is a wide range of products available for its treat-
ment, not only drugs but also some herbal products. This work focuses
on the dry extract of Hedera helix, which increasingly gains popularity.
Objective: Systematize the scientific evidence on the efficacy and safety
of Hedera helix extract in the treatment of productive cough.
Methods
Systematic review, using databases Pubmed, EBSCO and Science Dir-
ect. Articles were selected in English, Spanish and Portuguese and
with no more than twenty years since publication.
Results
Ten studies were selected, consisting of 69310 individuals with vary-
ing ages. One study was placebo controlled. Four studies compared
different formulations with extract. One study analysed differences
between the treatment with the dry extract of Hedera helix com-
pared with the conventional therapy. Three open non-comparative
multi-centre trials were also included as well as a retrospective study.
Results
All studies show evidence of the efficacy and tolerability of Hedera
helix extract in the treatment of productive cough. Due to the min-
imal incidence of adverse effects, the authors were able to admit a
good tolerability of ivy extract.
Conclusions
The studies included in this review indicate that Hedera helix dry ex-
tract preparations have positive effects in productive cough, showing
improvement in terms of respiratory function in patients with dis-
eases of the respiratory tract. However, more robust studies are re-
quired for a structured evaluation of the safety and tolerability of this
extract in productive cough.

Background
The development of educational actions in groups has been recom-
mended by public health policies due the construction of knowledge
and for the transformation of health care. However, the evaluation of
the educational process in order to obtain a critical analysis of the
group and its effects is a challenge for professionals. Objective: To
analyse the perception of professionals – workers in Primary Health
Care – about the evaluation processes of the groups linked with food
and nutrition.
Methods
A qualitative research with 48 professionals was conducted in Sao
Paulo, Brazil, (2012-2014) through semi-structured interviews. For the
evaluation processes the Discourse of the Collective Subject was
used and eight Central Ideas were identified.
Results
The presence of characteristics that promote the educational process
was found in the groups, such as participation, links, empowerment
and health autonomy. On the other hand, obstacles were found in
the realization and systematization of the evaluation of the educa-
tional process of the groups, due to naturalization of quantitative
variables (changes in weight and in biochemistry parameters), related
to acquisition of knowledge and of individual approaches.
Conclusions
There is the need for further reflection on analysis criteria of coher-
ent groups with health education assumptions in order to encourage
professional development and qualification of care.

Sensorineural hearing loss is a tendentiously growing problem and has
been associated with toxic effects of free radicals such as reactive oxy-
gen species (ROS) and nitric oxide (NO) in the auditory system. With this
in mind, studies have shown that the administration of vitamins has
positive effects and may decrease the sensorineural hearing loss.
In this sense, through a systematic review we intend to examine the
scientific literature available about the effectiveness of the use of vi-
tamins C and E in the improvement of the auditory system perform-
ance in individuals with sensorineural hearing loss.
Keywords were defined and a research was conducted of scientific
articles in electronic databases and four studies were selected ac-
cording to defined criteria and centred on the issue under study. The
comparison of the results from the articles chosen reveals concrete
evidence of a decrease in hearing thresholds provided by taking vita-
mins C and E, reaching a hearing gain of 30 dB.

Background
Anthropometry refers to the characterisation of the human individual
which involves the systematic measurement of the physical proper-
ties of the human body for the description of the individual’s body
composition and morphology. Today, anthropometry plays an im-
portant role in industrial design, clothing design, ergonomics and
architecture where statistical data about the distribution of body di-
mensions in the population are used to optimize products. Changes
in lifestyles, nutrition, and ethnic composition of populations lead to
changes in the distribution of body dimensions (e.g. the obesity epi-
demic), and require regular updating of anthropometric data collec-
tions. Objectives: This project aims to develop a web application with
the intent of aiding and organizing the anthropometric study and
follow up of patients regarding the evaluation of their body compos-
ition and morphology by professionals and researchers in several
areas such as health, sports and body aesthetics.
Methods
This evaluation is performed using the calculation of various indexes:
Body Mass Index, Conicity Index, Waist-to-Hip Ratio, Body Density,
Fat Mass Percentage, Muscle Mass, Bone Mass, and also the calcula-
tion of the Somatotype, which is the most complete method to
characterize individuals regarding their physical appearance, morph-
ology and body composition.
Results and conclusions
The developed application is a fully anthropometric integrated
system available on the web, allowing a global utilization world-
wide. As a result, the continuous usage of the application will re-
flect on the amount of data available on the platform, increasing a
valuable impact on future studies and research worldwide (http://

Background
Although pregnancy is one of the most common life events, surpris-
ingly little scientific information is available in the literature when
considering anthropometrics. Studies regarding the pregnant woman’s
body size variation, namely for the design of clothes during gestation
are quite common. But anthropometrics is a lot more than this: it is also
a science that aids in characterizing body morphology and compos-
ition. Objectives: Currently, there are standard data of anthropometric
parameters for specific groups such as children, seniors and athletes.
However, specific values or data for pregnant women don’t seem to
exist, nor any indication to whether or not it is possible to use the
values from other data given. Therefore, the main objective of this
study is to evaluate if the default data and the current anthropometric
tools are appropriate to be used on pregnant women.
Methods
In this study, we analysed and evaluated the morphologic char-
acterization and the body composition of seven pregnant women
using existing anthropometric restricted profile methods. The tools

BMC Health Services Research 2016, Volume 16 Suppl 3

Page 122 of 132

considered in this study were: Body Mass Index, Somatotype, Conic-
ity Index, Abdominal-Hip Ratio and Waist-Height Ratio.
Results and conclusions
Some tools do not demonstrate efficiency in the anthropometric evalu-
ation such as Body Mass Index by placing the pregnant women within
risk levels that do not correspond to reality. However, other methods
are plausible to be used, such as Conicity, Index Abdominal-Hip and
Waist-Height Ratios where the values obtained are within the expected
range.
In conclusion, the existing anthropometric tools need further
study when characterizing pregnant women.

Background
The transition period from high school to university is critical as the
students suffer big changes in their life patterns, frequently adopting
risk behaviour attitudes like unbalanced diets and physical inactivity
that may have repercussions in their long term health. This research
aims to study the perception of first year undergraduate students re-
garding their eating habits and physical activity indices in compari-
son with their habits at high school.
Methods
A cross sectional descriptive study of first year undergraduates (first
enrolment) of Lisbon universities was performed. The information
was gathered through on-line questionnaires. The data collected was
analysed considering a 5.0 % significant level.
Results
From the final sample of 223 students from the Lisbon faculties
65.0 % (n = 145) were female and 35.0 % (n = 78) were male with
ages between 18 and 21. The whole sample admits having de-
creased their indices of physical activity and 50.7 % has worsened
their eating habits. 61.0 % of the sample is apparently satisfied with
their current weight but wants to improve their eating habits and
physical activity.
Conclusions
Living away from family is strictly related to stricter and harder to
manage schedules, leading to worse food and exercise habits. Male
students have more risk behaviours although they are the ones who
most easily adopt behaviours considered healthy when it comes to
physical activity. Health students are more conscious about their
own health and are the most penalized by the lack of time. Preven-
tion strategies undergo increasing awareness of these issues and the
providing means to implement changes.

Background
Rally is a form of motorsport that takes place on public or private
roads with specially built cars. It is distinguished by racing not on a
circuit, but instead in a point-to-point format in which participants
and their co-drivers drive between a set of control points (special
stages), leaving at regular intervals from one or more start points.
This type of sporting events has a huge physical load on the drivers
where the levels of fatigue are very high. Objectives: The present
project main’s purpose is to measure the muscular activation of a
rally driver during a race. The study consists of evaluating the hand-
force before and after a driving exercise and evaluating the muscular
activity during driving.
Methods
Two methods were used to in order obtain the data. The first step
consisted of obtaining the hand-force data with the use of a dyna-
mometer, after which electromyography was used for evaluating the
muscular activity during driving. The study was composed of 5 tasks,
firstly the hand-force test, then a vertical vibration, lateral oscillation,
a driving test and finally another hand-force test.
Results and conclusions
From the results, it is possible to conclude that the key muscles dur-
ing driving activity are the anterior deltoid since this activity requires
many rotations and movements of the upper limbs. This activity is
most obvious during turns while driving. By undergoing this type of
evaluation, it is possible to have a better understanding of the de-
mands to which rally drivers are subjected.

Background
Health Literacy (HL), considered as a mediator of clinical results
which can be associated with health promotion campaigns focusing
on education, is a current focus for research on behavioural manage-
ment of individual health. Differences in the levels of health literacy
are associated with both a lesser capacity to interpret medication
labels and health messages and also with worse health indicators.
Objectives: To determine the correlation between HL and the Ab-
dominal Perimeter (AP), the Circumferential Perimeter of the Neck
(CPN), the blood glucose level and the Body Mass Index (BMI) in
healthy individuals.
Methods
A study with observational focus on a sample of 508 people, with an
average age of 44.48 years. Health literacy was assessed through the
European Health Literacy Survey [1] and the AP, the CPN, the blood
glucose level and the BMI were determined.
Results
Most participants (73.62 %) revealed a health literacy deficit. The risk
of cardiovascular disease proved to be correlated with health literacy.
Patients with inadequate literacy had a larger abdominal perimeter
(AP χ2 = 101.65; p = 0.000), a larger neck perimeter (CPN χ2 = 10.34;
p = 0.016), worse nutritional status/higher BMI (χ2 = 78.09; p = 0.000)

and higher blood glucose levels. Contrarily, excellent literacy was
linked to lower glucose levels (χ2 = 112.038; p = 0,000).
Conclusions
The priority is to consistently monitor the health variables previously
mentioned and the significance of the evidence examined, determin-
ing the cost-effectiveness and the effects of policies and educational
practices on clinical outcomes.

Background
Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (DM) is a serious public health problem that
affects mostly elderly people. This disease has a huge human, social
and economic cost, some of which could be prevented. Objective:
The aim of this study was to analyse the capacity of self-control, the
knowledge and the Quality of Life (QoL), of people with type 2 dia-
betes, aged 65 or older, enrolled in four Family Health Units, belong-
ing to the Group of Health Centers of Dão Lafões.
Methods
An exploratory and descriptive-correlational study was applied to
137 sample subjects, that responded a sociodemographic and clinical
characterization questionnaire and to the Portuguese version of the
Diabetes Empowerment Scale - Short Form (DES-SF), Diabetes Know-
ledge Test (DKT) and of the EQ-5D.
Results
Results point to: high perception of capacity for self-management
of DM; poor knowledge about the disease, with no statistical differ-
ences among diabetes non-insulin-treated individuals and insulin-
treated; with mean ± SD scores of 3.52 ± 0.69 of DES-SF, 54.34 ±
17.72 of DKT and 0.63 ± 0.30 of EQ-5D. We detected, a positive and
significant correlation between the ability to control DM, know-
ledge and the QoL. In addition, we also found some statistically sig-
nificant differences in DES-SF, DKT and EQ-5D before educational
attainment (t = -3.688, p < .001; t = -5.835, p < .001; t = -2.302, p < .05, re-
spectively) and DM complications (t = -2.355, p < .05; t = -2.578, p < .05;
t = -2.261, p < .05).
Conclusions
The evidence provided is crucial for a better adaption of the pro-
cesses that promote health literacy and empowerment of people
with diabetes.

Background
The Chronic Diseases Global Action Plan 2013-2020,
from WHO
(2013) [1], denotes the relevance of urgent implementation of strat-
egies promoting a healthy diet. The Mediterranean Diet (MD), recog-
nized in 2013 by UNESCO as Humanity Immaterial Cultural Heritage,
is increasingly considered in the literature as a fundamental eating
pattern in the prevention of non-transmittable diseases and with a
positive impact on life quality. Objectives: To understand the adhe-
sion levels to MD in 230 Portuguese children with ages averaging
10.09 ± 1.32, and also analyse their relation to the perception of
health state (very bad to very good) and life quality (including phys-
ical and psychological health dimensions, self-concept, and relation-
ships with peers and family).
Methods
General characterization questionnaires, KIDMED and KINDL were
used as instruments for data collection, with later SPSS analysis (IBM
23).
Results
Only 1.7 % revealed low adhesion levels to MD, in contrast to 34.8 %
at an average level, and 62.6 % at a high level. We found statistically
significant positive correlations (p < .05) between the adhesion to MD
and the perception of health state (r = .29), physical health (r = .48),
psychological health (r = .35), self-concept (r = .36), peer relationships
(r = .33) and general life quality (r = .54).
Conclusions
Results reinforce the relevance of this eating pattern in childhood life
quality, as well in health indicators. The implementation of promot-
ing eating education strategies based on this heritage, also charac-
teristic of Portuguese culture, is revealed as fundamental.

the use of health care services and consequently, in health costs. The
concept of health literacy has changed from a purely cognitive defin-
ition to a definition that includes the personal and social components of
the individual, assuming the ability to make informed decisions in their
everyday life.
This analytical cross-sectional study aims to validate and use the
European Health Literacy Survey (HLS-EU) for the Portuguese popula-
tion (HLS-EU-PT).
The HLS-EU-PT has been applied throughout the country, including
autonomous regions, by an academic network. Data collection was
conducted by personal interview. The final sample was composed of
1,004 individuals aged ≥ 16 years.
The HLS-EU-PT is an adequate instrument to measure the health liter-
acy levels of the Portuguese population and shows comparable psy-
chometric properties to versions used in the other countries.
In Portugal, 61.0 % of the surveyed population has problematic or in-
adequate general health literacy level, considering that the average
of the nine countries tested with HLS-EU is 49.2 %. Concerning the
Healthcare dimension, only 44.2 % have a sufficient or excellent level
of health literacy. In terms of disease prevention, about 45.0 % of re-
spondents reveal a sufficient or excellent level of health literacy, and
the average stands at 54.5 %.
In the Health Promotion dimension about 60.2 % of the auscultated
population has problematic or inappropriate health literacy level, and
the average stands at 52.1 %. Therefore, it is fundamental to imple-
ment a National Strategy for Health Literacy.

dures and the instructions provided by health professionals. It is also
important to provide the individuals with skills to participate in the
choice of treatments. In a community setting it is crucial to evaluate
oral health literacy levels before the implementation of a health pro-
motion programme, in order for it to become effective in the trans-
mission of educational themes. Objectives: The main goal of this
study is to evaluate the oral health literacy and oral health know-
ledge of students enlisted at a military police force school and mili-
tary officials.
Methods
To achieve this goal, the Portuguese version of the Oral Health Liter-
acy Instrument (OHLI-POR) was used with 274 enlisted students and
12 military officials.
Results
The percentage of students with adequate oral health literacy is
54 %; 38 % have marginal literacy and 7.3 % have inadequate liter-
acy. In relation to the military officials, 58.3 % have adequate literacy,
33.3 % marginal and 8.4 % inadequate literacy. When analysing oral
health knowledge on a scale from 0 to 100, students and military of-
ficials have a positive average of 63.81 and 75.98 respectively.
Conclusions
Oral health literacy belongs to a field of science in oral health that
needs urgent intervention. The results from this study show that

there is a need to develop educational strategies and work in order
to increase the oral health literacy of this population.

Background
Attachment representations were found to be relatively stable pre-
dictors for health behaviour and related attitudes, e.g. adherence to
psychotherapy, and the relationship to be mediated by perceived
stress [1-2]. Nonetheless, the role of attachment in e-therapies is not
well understood. Objective: The study aims to identify predictors for
preferences to guided Internet-based CBT (ICBT) and to assess associ-
ations between preferences on ICBT, attachment orientations and
stress.
Methods
A total of 436 healthy participants were provided with descriptions
of three most common types of e-therapies to indicate their prefer-
ence. The types varied in the involved guidance by a therapist (i.e.
unguided versus guided ICBT versus videoconference setting). Atti-
tudes towards ICBT were determined via a 17-item self-report meas-
ure. Furthermore, stress within the past four weeks was measured
with the Perceived Stress Questionnaire (PSQ-20) [3]. To assess at-
tachment orientations, a 9-item global version of the ECR–Relation-
ship Structures (ECR-RS) [4] was used.
Results
Most respondents (39 %) preferred guided ICBT to unguided ICBT
(20 %), videoconference psychotherapy (23 %) or none of them
(18 %). Half of the respondents had experience with conventional
psychotherapy, whereas 12 % were currently undergoing treatment
and 7 % were seeking for help. Preferences corresponded to overall
attitudes on ICBT. Regression analyses did not indicate that either at-
tachment or stress was significantly predicting attitudes towards
ICBT. Both, attachment anxiety and avoidance were positively corre-
lated with perceived stress (medium effect sizes).
Conclusions
Most respondents preferred guided ICBT. Defining specific predictors
for the utilization and acceptance of ICBT remains a challenge.

Background
Limited health literacy (HL) is associated with lower health outcomes,
higher healthcare costs and lead to impaired student success. Object-
ive. The study aimed at gaining knowledge about the English HL
level of non-native students from Health Science studies, to assess
their comprehension of medical related information.
Methods
An ERASMUS joint research project was conducted to compare the
HL level of students from two non-native English speaking countries
(N = 185): Austria, University of Applied Sciences, Salzburg (FHS) and
Portugal, ESTeSC-Coimbra Health School (CHS). A validated HL assess-
ment tool (Pfizer, The Newest Vital Sign) was used along with a ques-
tionnaire to find out if there are any correlations between lifestyle
factors and HL.
Results
A total of 140 students completed the questionnaire. Reliability was
acceptable with Cronbach’s alpha equal to 0.656. FHS and CHS stu-
dents showed an HL average score of 5.18 and 3.45 (out of 6), re-
spectively (T = 6.68; df = 111; p < 0.001). Better lifestyle habits were
related with higher HL scores. There is an intermediate positive cor-
relation between HL score and English education (ρ = 0.37, p <
0.001). Male students have a significant higher level of HL (5.09) (T =
2.1; df = 135; p = 0.04). Up to 86 % of students were capable of un-
derstanding/interpreting an information regarding health issues cor-
rectly, but only up to 50 % could resolve right all mathematic and
analytical-logical tasks.
Conclusions
The questionnaire can be used as a reliable and additional as-
assessment tool in application procedures for international student’s
exchange programs (e.g. Erasmus) or European Master Degree
programme in Biomedical Sciences.

Background
Health Literacy (HL) encodes the capacity to obtain, process and
understand basic health information and act appropriately. An ad-
equate level of HL can empower higher education students in the
process of decision-making regarding their own health. Furthermore,
social behaviours influence the increasing rate of Sexually Transmit-
ted Diseases (STD) in this population. Objective. The aim of this study
was to evaluate the relationship between HL, social behaviours and

STD in higher education students attending the first year of health
sciences (HSc) and non-health sciences (NHSc) courses.
Methods
Participants (N = 50 HSc; N = 33 NHSc) filled out a questionnaire to as-
sess sexual history, satisfaction, self-esteem/efficacy; attitude/intention
of condom use; control over sexual events; parental relationship; HIV
heuristics; alcohol consumption; plus, the level of HL (Newest Vital
Sign-PT). Additionally, a blood sample was collected for STD screening.
Results
HSc students tend to have a higher level of HL, use more condoms
and consume less alcohol before a sexual encounter in comparison
to NHSc students. The use of condom is reduced in the case of pill
contraception and when the sexual partnership is stable. A preva-
lence of 2.4 % for HSV 2 was found in this population, along with an
association between positive cases and lower HL level, less use of
condoms and higher alcohol intake before a sexual encounter.
Conclusions
A trend was observed in this population of higher education stu-
dents showing an association between higher level of HL, fewer so-
cial risk behaviours and a lower prevalence of STD.

Background
Parenting and Attachment styles have implications for interpersonal
relationships and adult psychopathology, being determinant for in-
ternal working models. Objectives: To explore the associations be-
tween parenting styles and attachment to parents.
Methods
Sample: 600 participants (M = 27.0; SD = 10.6 years-old, 68.7 % female).
Measures: I) ECR-RS – The Experiences in Close Relationships – Relation-
ships Structures Questionnaire to evaluate dysfunctional attachment
(F1-Avoidance in attachment to mother and father; F2-Anxiety in at-
II) EMBU – the Egna Minnen av
tachment to mother and father);
Barndoms Uppfostran self-report questionnaire for measuring one's
memory of parental rearing experiences (F1-Emotional mother and
father support, F2-mother and father Rejection, F3-mother and
father overprotection). Both measures showed good psychometric
properties.
Results
Regarding the mother, attachment avoidance (M = 2.69, SD = 1.14)
was negatively correlated with emotional support (M = 2.98, SD =
0.63; r = -.55), rejection (M = 1.40, SD = 0.44; r = .41) and overprotec-
tion (M = 1.95, SD = 0.54; r = .14) parenting styles. Considering the
father, attachment avoidance (M = 3.33, SD = 1.42) was negatively
correlated with emotional support (M = 2.65, SD = 0.73), rejection (M =
1.31; SD = 0.46), and overprotection (M = 1.78; SD = 0.51) parenting
styles. Anxiety in the attachment to the mother (M = 2.41, SD = 1.65)
was negatively correlated with emotional support (r = -.15) and posi-
tively correlated with rejection (r = .26) and overprotection (r = .16).
Anxiety in the attachment to the father (M = 2.46, SD = 1.67) was nega-
tively correlated with emotional support (r = -.16) and positively corre-
lated with rejection (r = .18) and overprotection (r = .20).
Conclusions
Negative parenting styles (overprotection and rejection) were posi-
tively associated with the attachment anxiety and avoidance types.
Emotional support of the mother and father was negatively associ-
ated with the attachment anxiety and avoidance types.

Background
Shift work is usually mentioned in the literature as a factor of weight
when it comes to the perception of conflict or facilitation in family
and work management, especially in health professionals. Objective:
To evaluate the extent to which working hours (fixed/shift) interfere
with work-life balance.
Methods
We used T-F scale to evaluate the conflict and facilitation in work-
family and family-work. The instrument was translated and adapted
by Carvalho and Peralta (2009). It was applied to 96 health profes-
sionals (time shift) and 594 University Teachers (fixed schedule). The
following were tested: the construct validity and reliability (subscales
conflict, facilitation and consequences); if the three subscales have
equivalent representations in the two samples; the effect of the
schedule (fixed/variable) in the three dimensions.
Results
The subscales showed adequate psychometric properties (explained
variance > 50 %; s > .40; .77 < α < .91), being invariant in the two sam-
ples (congruence coefficients from .936 to .976). Contrary to the hy-
pothesis that shift work interferes negatively in work-life balance,
schedule (fixed/shift) does not seem to influence the perception of
interference (positive and/or negative) between family and work
(Wilk's lambda = .99, p > .05; univariate F(6, 683) < 1:50, p > .05).
Conclusions
The results highlight the importance of continuing research, given the
complexity of intervening variables in work-life balance and consider-
ing the samples in analysis. Given that there is life beyond work and
because satisfied/happy people produce more, with higher quality,
well-being and health, it is important to promote work-life balance.

Methods
A quantitative, exploratory, descriptive and correlational study, using
a probabilistic stratified random sample of people enrolled in the Na-
tional Diabetes Control Programme in Health Centres of a Local
Health Unit. Data were collected with a form based on Davis and
Venkatesh’s theoretical models, applied through telephone contact.
Results
The sample consists of 388 users, 53.4 % female, with a mean age of
65.7 years; 6.2 % of participants have no schooling, more than half of
the participants (52.3 %) completed only the first cycle of basic edu-
cation, and only 9.8 % completed higher education. People of higher
age and less education are those with less technological literacy, lim-
ited access to information resources, as well as less use and a higher
difficulty of use. They also present a lower intention of using ICT and
make fewer demands of health information on the Internet. At the
same time these participants showed more information needs and
less health literacy. Already, younger participants and the more edu-
cated preferred the use of electronic resources as a source of health
information.
Conclusions
The evaluation the potential user proves to be a highly useful tool
for the development of informational resources available in line with
technological literacy and appropriate to the informational needs of
people.

Background
Type 1 diabetes is a chronic illness that requires therapeutic educa-
tion for empowering children/adolescents in managing their health-
disease process. The relationship established and the level of satisfac-
tion with the care provided sustains adherence to the treatment, im-
proving metabolic control. Objectives: To analyse the level of
satisfaction of children/youths with therapeutic education appoint-
ments and their relationship to the clinical variables.
Methods
Cross-sectional and descriptive-correlational
study with a non-
probabilistic sample of 135 children/adolescents between 8-18 years
old (Mean: 13:45; SD = 2.83), with Type 1 diabetes. A survey compris-
ing socio-demographic and clinical characterization was used, as well
an adaptation of the “Survey on Patient Satisfaction with therapeutic
education in Diabetes”.
Results
In the sample 54.1 % were boys, 36.3 % aged less than 12 years, the
average of diagnosis was 4.15 years (SD = 46.19 months), ranging
from 1 month to 15 years, and 83.0 % reported the mother as the
main caregiver. For each subscale, higher rates of satisfaction were
found in the "guidance" dimension (mean = 93.55 %; SD = 9.47), and
less
satisfaction in the "relationship/communication" dimension
(Mean = 79.55 %; SD = 19.17). Relative to clinical variables, children/
youths monitored in a central hospital, with fewer episodes of
hypoglycaemia and less diagnostic time have higher satisfaction with
therapeutic education (p < 0.05).

Background
Understanding the impact of food choices on our health is a basic
condition to have a healthy eating pattern – a cornerstone of type 2
diabetes treatment and control. Objectives: This study aimed to as-
sess nutrition-related knowledge in middle-age and older patients
with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and to analyse its determinants.
Methods
Nutrition-related knowledge was assessed using the Portuguese re-
duced version of the Nutritional Knowledge Questionnaire [1] in 46
individuals with T2D (29 women; 62.96 ± 7.15 years of age; literate
[47.8 % to 4th grade; 28.3 % between the 5th-9th grade; and 23.9 %
above the 9th grade]) candidates to Diabetes em Movimento®, a
community-based lifestyle intervention programme developed in Vila
Real, Portugal (NCT02631902). This version of the questionnaire con-
sists of three sections (dietary recommendations [DR, 0-6 points];
sources of nutrients [SN, 0-34 points]; diet-disease relationship [DDR,
0-16 points]), totalling a maximum score of 56 points.
Results
Total score was 25.89 ± 7.21 points (58.7 % with a score lower than 28
points); DR 4.59 ± 1.11 points; SN 15.30 ± 5.37 points; and DDR 6.04 ±
2.22 points. No significant differences between genders were observed
in the total score, nor any association with age. Significant differences
were found between the less and the more educated individuals.
Conclusions
These patients present deficits on nutrition-related knowledge, par-
ticularly in SN and DDR fields. Gender and age does not appear to
determine this knowledge, contrary to education level.

Background
Educators and the education settings can play a major role in pro-
moting Health literacy (HL) as a direct outcome. New perspectives
are being opened, such as the question of whether HL can be con-
sidered as a buffer variable at early ages (e.g. adolescence). The HLS-
EU questionnaire has emphasized the dimensions of health care,
health prevention and health promotion covering a wide range of
perspectives in an integrated approach. Objective: The purpose of
this research is to evaluate how health literacy can be measured in
the age group of adolescents.
Methods
A quantitative and qualitative explanatory cross-correlated study
based on a sample of 215 adolescents from the VFX region of
Portugal was collected in a school setting. Measurement of adoles-
cents’ HL (CrAdLiSa project) was implemented with the HLS-EU-PT
survey, the Portuguese version of the European Health Literacy Sur-
vey instrument (www.literacia-saude.info).
Results
Reliability analysis of HLS-EU-PT dimensions show an internal consist-
ence (Cronbach's alpha coefficient) of 0.946 (Health Care), 0.947 (Dis-
ease Prevention) and 0.958 (Health Promotion), while the global
instrument presents a value of 0.98. Inadequate HL (4.2 %) and prob-
lematic HL (25.6 %) show that about 30.0 % of respondents have lim-
ited HL.
Conclusions
The results enhance the reliability, validity, internal validity, statistical
validity longitudinal and linguistic validity, as land marks of the trans-
lation and validation process to Portuguese of the HLS-EU survey
and applied to evaluate adolescents HL. Further research must inves-
tigate HL potential at this age range and how it should be developed
in school curricula.

Background
This study takes place via a partnership between a Nursing School
and the cardiology department of a hospital on the outskirts of
Lisbon. Nursing interventions in the acute phase of Acute Coronary
Syndrome (ACS) should be started early through a process of recog-
nition of the need for behavioural change, health education and
planning the treatment regimen. For the early development of a
therapeutic intervention, the nurse acts by focusing the attention of
the person on the need for management of a therapeutic regimen
(self-care). The department has implemented an education programme.
Knowledge of the impact of this intervention is needed for its contin-
ued development. Objectives: To characterize and evaluate the educa-
tion strategy for health undertaken and to understand this intervention
through the eyes of those to whom it is addressed.
Methods
An exploratory, analytical cross-sectional study of qualitative dimen-
sion, developed with the persons’ subject to the education sessions.

characterization of individuals and identification of risk factors. Semi-
structured telephone interviews were made one year after discharge.
Results
Modification occurred in identified risk factors, an evaluation of ses-
sions in changing these factors was performed, and other educa-
tional support was identified.
Conclusions
Data was obtained on the impact of health education, given the
knowledge of the disease, control of health risk factors and adher-
ence to lifestyle and therapy. Contributions were collected for the
reorganization of the sessions, and also for the development of a
protocol to standardize the practice of education favouring improve-
ment and guaranteed health gains.

An adequate offer of information and training is undoubtedly a decisive
step to endow the informal caregiver with the competences to safe-
guard the wellbeing of both the caregiver and the person to whom he/
she provides care. There is a known insufficiency of information and
training making it necessary to fill these lacks on those who take care of
elderly people with stroke sequelae. The difficulty of finding an adjusted
training is owed to the little knowledge of their real needs as well as to
the fact that there isn’t a systematic plan addressed to these needs.
Focusing an area still to be explored in Portugal, this descriptive-
exploratory study attempted to identify the information and training
needs of informal caregivers of people with stroke sequelae, envisaging
the design of a training programme. We endeavoured to conceptualize
a training program starting from that which should be the starting
point of any educative action - the identification of needs. Using a
qualitative approach, we conducted an enquiry through a semi-
structured interview with the informal caregivers, as well with key infor-
mants such as the formal caregivers and individuals with stroke seque-
lae, with subsequent content analysis according to Bardin.
It was observed in different dimensions the perceived importance of
information and the need for a formal training structure. The results
suggest the training must be geared towards supporting the process
of rehabilitation and mediation, as well to the basic learning for the
act of caring for a person with stroke sequelae, requiring a practical
component.

Background
Teenagers are considered a vulnerable group for several risk behav-
iours, which include the use of psychoactive substances. The better
you know the risk factors and protection, as well as the risks associ-
ated with consumption of these substances, the better you can de-
fine and identify intervention strategies.
Objectives: The overall aim of this intervention study was to em-
power students from the 6th grade, from the Albergaria-a-Velha
School Group, in 2014, with personal and social skills for prevention
of psychoactive substance consumption.
Methods
This study consisted of two groups, one subjected to intervention
and one control group not submitted to intervention, each en-
compassing four classes. Five sessions were held, addressed to stu-
dents on personal and social skills, in particular, about taking part
in the decision and resolution of problems, of resistance to social
influence and peer pressure and information. The evaluation is
based on self-administered questionnaires before and after the
intervention.
Results
In the intervention group there was an increase in the proportion of
components of decision-making and problem solving and also in in-
formation, whereas in the resistance component of the social influ-
ence and peer pressure, there was a decrease. In the control group
there was a rate of decrease for the three components.
Conclusions
After the completion of this work it is considered appropriate to con-
tinue this kind of intervention, not only to make use of the available
material already applied/tested but also because more interventions
on this issue are invaluable.

Background
The study aimed to identify the knowledge and information of
young people and parents concerning sexuality and to identify the
needs and difficulties in sexual education of youths.
Methods
This quantitative study was conducted on a non-probabilistic con-
venience sample which was composed by 285 young people aged
between 14 and 20 years and their parents (257). A questionnaire
comprising questions of open, closed and mixed responses was
used.
Results
It was found that young people feel they have good information
(57.4 %) on sexuality, have doubts about topics such as pleasure and
orgasm (16.9 %) and sexually transmitted diseases (12.1 %) and that
the issue continues to be a taboo on a family, school and social level.
The information is acquired at school (24.9 %) and Internet (20.4 %).
They talk with friends (39.1 %) about the subject, but do not talk to
health professionals, or resort to family planning, and have risk be-
haviours. Most parents (73.3 %) had already talked to the child about
the issue of sexuality, giving it much importance and considering
that the issue should be addressed by 12 years of age. They feel less
difficulty in talking to their children about boyfriends (57.6 %) and
most difficulties in talking about their sexual behaviour (7.4 %). To
overcome the difficulties, most parents resort to books (36.2 %) and
Internet (29.6 %), considering the implementation a sexual education
programme relevant (67.3 %).

Background
Young people have risky sexual behaviour for disease transmission.
These increase with the early onset of sexual activity. According to
the 3rd EU Health Programme 2014-2020 [1], it is necessary to iden-
tify and combat this. Objective: This study aimed to describe the sex-
ual risk behaviour of young people by gender and age and its
relationship with the age of onset of sexual activity.
Methods
This correlational study resulted from the application of a range of risky
sexual behaviour, with four items in a sample of 128 adolescents and
young people (12-24 years of age). They were 72 boys (M = 18.23 ±
2.99 years) and 56 girls (M = 17.93 ± 2.45 years). The scale was Likert-
type with values from 1 to 5. The lowest values correspond to the worst
behaviours.
Results
The results were grouped into four age groups (12-13; 14-16; 17-19
and 20 and over). The boys had worse behaviours (M = 3.82 ± 0.77)
than girls (M = 4.38 ± 0.59) in the set of items and the total of age
groups. This difference was statistically significant (p ≤ 0.01). The co-
efficient of Spearman showed no relationship between these behav-
iours and the age of onset of sexual activity. The boys report first
sexual intercourse at 12 years old (M = 14.77 ± 1.49 years) and girls at
13 years old (M = 15.56 ± 1.36).
Conclusions
Young people are at risk from behaviours that differ by gender and
age, but are unrelated to the age of onset of sexual activity.

Background
Considering the increasing incidence of type 1 diabetes and the fact
most of these children attend school, school staff needs to be know-
ledgeable about providing a safe environment. Objectives: To evaluate
the knowledge of school staff on type 1 diabetes and to relate it to the

profession, years of professional practice in the institution and the per-
ception about the level of preparation about type 1 diabetes.
Methods
A correlational study was conducted on 81 school staff elements, to
whom a questionnaire was applied composed of socio-economic
data, scale of knowledge about type 1 diabetes and level of percep-
tion about their preparation about it.
Results
Participants had an average knowledge of 11.1 ± 2.69 (maximum 17
points). Most of participants (63 %) were wrong on the issue "Cori
has vomited. Your best initial response would be: call his parents",
but most of them (95.1 %) hit the question "Today, Cory is requesting
trips to the bathroom and fountain. You would: allow him to go to
the bathroom and fountain”. Teachers hold a higher level of know-
ledge in relation to other professional groups (p < 0.01) and perceive
a greater need for training and preparation (p < 0.01) about type 1
diabetes. The level of knowledge is not related to years of profes-
sional practice in the institution (p > 0.05).
Conclusions
The results show the importance of having prepared and know-
ledgeable school staff to follow these students. Thus, it is important
to assess the level of knowledge and associated variables, in order to
develop adjusted intervention programmes.

Background
Adolescents face numerous challenges searching for health informa-
tion, and this search is essential to develop an adequate health liter-
acy, that can enhance healthy choices. Objectives: The aim of this
study is to analyse the impact of health information sources use and
the search for sexual health information in sexual health literacy in a
group of Portuguese adolescents.
Methods
To reach the aim it was developed a quantitative descriptive and cor-
relational study, with a non-probabilistic sample of 1,215 adolescents
that attend two secondary schools of the central region of the coun-
try. Data were collected with a questionnaire with sociodemographic
questions, the Health Literacy Assessment Tool and the Portuguese
version of the Health Literacy Questionnaire for Children.
Results
The sample was composed by female (47.08 %) and male (52.92 %)
adolescents, aged between 14 and 20 years old (16.32; SD = 1.11), at-
tending the three years of the secondary school (from 10th to 12th
grade). Sexual health literacy was found to be good (0.65; SD = 0.18),
being lower in males (p = 0.000) and in adolescents attending the
10th grade (p = 0.005). Sexual health literacy was found to correlate
negatively with age (R = -0.105; p = 0.000). Results have shown that
sexual health literacy is influenced by the use of health information
sources, namely “doctor”, “television”, “pharmaceutics” and “leaflets”
(R2 = 0.032; p = 0.000; Z = 9.087) and through receiving sexual health
information (R2 = 0.045; p = 0.000; Z = 52.387).
Conclusions
There is an influence of the use of some health information sources
and the increase of sexual health literacy. To increase this type of lit-
eracy it is important to increase the amount of sexual health informa-
tion available, in order to improve its use.

Background
Basic life support (BLS) is the basis for saving lives following cardiac
arrest. Previous studies support the need to train bystanders in BLS
to reduce mortality and morbidity rates in situations of accident and
sudden illness in extra-hospital settings. Objective: This study aimed
to evaluate the impact of a training programme directed towards the
BLS skills of adolescents.
Methods
This quasi-experimental study surveyed 176 adolescents from a Pub-
lic Portuguese School aged between 11 and 17 years old, 55.1 %
female and 44.9 % male. The intervention comprised a training
programme directed towards the BLS skills of adolescents. The as-
sessment instrument was applied before and after the intervention,
including a 20-item questionnaire on BLS skills. The results were ob-
tained using descriptive statistics and nonparametric tests. All ethical
and formal procedures were respected.
Results
The BLS skills index before the intervention was 15.70 (SD = 2.02)
(95 % CI: 15.35 to 16.06), out of a maximum of 20 points. At the end
of the intervention the BLS skills index increased (p < 0.001) to 17.31
(SD = 4.58) (95 % CI: 16.93 to 17.68). Regarding the BLS skills determi-
nants, we found a significant influence of parents’ qualifications
(father: p = 0.037; χ2 = 8.456; mother: p = 0.001; χ2 = 16.131). Teens
whose parents had higher qualifications presented increased skills in
airway permeabilization.
Conclusions
The BLS training programme improved adolescents’ skills and know-
ledge. Special attention should be given to the determinants identi-
fied as influencing BLS skills in the design of future interventions and
policies.

Sexual education is a curricular component present in Brazilian schools,
set by the National Curriculum Parameters (PCNs) drawn up by the Min-
istry of Education and Culture (MEC). However, unprepared teachers
talking about this issue can lead to a simplified and just biological ap-
proach of sexuality.
The aim of this study was to conduct a survey about the 5 th grade
teachers’ difficulties of public schools in Foz do Iguaçu - Paraná -
Brazil, regarding sexual education. We chose to study this school
grade since sexuality and human reproduction appear for the first
time as a subject.

Participants were 82 teachers of 5th grade of fundamental education
from 48 municipal schools of Foz do Iguaçu, Paraná, Brazil, represent-
ing 94 % of the total number schools in town and 60 % of the total
of teachers of the grade. The data collection instrument was a form
with questions about teachers’ difficulties, challenges of sexual edu-
cation in schools and themes that should be addressed.
The difficulties reported by the teachers were mainly about talking
about homosexuality, masturbation and sexual violence. The very
permissive or neglecting families were pointed as the biggest chal-
lenges. The topics indicated as required in sexual education were:
"teaching about the typical changes of puberty", "advising the risks
and how to protect of abuse and paedophilia" and "informing about
contraceptive methods and prevention of STDs/AIDS”.
The conclusion is that the data found in this survey can contribute to
justify and better direct and train teachers in sexual education.

Background
The increase in survival for breast cancer (BC), problems in transition
to a post-treatment phase that BC women face and a decrease in
communication between patients and healthcare system justifies ex-
ploring the literature on information needs and sources for informa-
tion used by breast cancer survivors (BCS) in this phase of cancer
experience. The objective is to describe information needs and infor-
mation resources used by BCS after primary treatment that emerged
from qualitative evidence.
Methods
A qualitative systematic review. Eight databases were systematically
searched for studies using an expression resulting from a combination
of terms (breast cancer, survivor, information, literacy). Original articles
which focused on information needs and information resources used
by BCS, based on their cancer experience, were included.
Results
Thirty studies were select. Most of them were exploratory and used
focus group methodology to collect data. BCS need information that:
I) helps them to be effective in the self-management of the disease
II)
(references to information about side effects of BC treatment;
helps them to learn to live with cancer (more references about sup-
portive resources). Health professionals, support groups and written
materials are the information resources of first preference for BCS,
despite using others. There is some evidence about the approach of
BCS in using the web as an information resource (young women and
those who live in rural areas).
Conclusions
The information needs of BCS after primary treatment are multiple
and characterised by the experience of living with BC. BCS use differ-
ent information resources. This evidence seems to be the core of
needs in BC survival and justifies thorough research on these topics.

Background
Despite the continuum development in technology that facilitates
patient access to health information and services, the level of health
literacy (HL) and electronic health literacy (eHL) influences individ-
uals’
full participation in their own healthcare management. Al-
though many campaigns have been implemented to raise awareness
of young people to sexual risk behaviours, there is still an increasing
number of cases of sexually transmitted diseases (STD) worldwide.
Besides there is still a communication gap between health profes-
sionals and patients. Objective: The main goal of this joint research
project is to study the relationship between HL, sexual behaviours
and prevalence of STD in students of the Biomedical Laboratory Sci-
ences, comparing students from Belgium, University of Thomas More
(UTM) and Portugal, ESTeSC-Coimbra Health School (CHS).
Methods
The methodology includes the collection of a venous blood sample
for the screening of STD and application of a validated HL assess-
ment tool (Pfizer, The Newest Vital Sign) along with a questionnaire
to find out if there are any correlations between sexual behaviours
and HL.
Results
It is expected that higher education students frequenting health sci-
ence studies will show an adequate level of HL and of risk behav-
iours, and a low prevalence of STD.
Conclusions
Depending on the results, this study could be a valuable asset to en-
tities responsible for awareness campaigns on sexual risk behaviours,
translating into a new approach for the prevention of STD.

Background
An adequate level of health literacy (HL) and electronic health liter-
acy (eHL) is paramount to understand health risks and take action to
change behaviours. Having in mind the prevalence of sexually trans-
mitted diseases (STD) it is fundamental to evaluate the level of HL/
eHL and its association with risk behaviours, especially in restricted
groups of socio-cultural and clinical interest, such as the blood do-
nors. For the blood donation at the IPST, a blood sample is taken for
screening tests and at the same time an e-mail is sent to the blood

donor. This e-mail contains the online form for donor eligibility and
this provides a unique opportunity to associate a questionnaire for
the assessment of HL/eHL. Objective. The aim of this study is to
characterize the level of functional HL and eHL of blood donors.
Methods
A questionnaire addressing demographic data,
level of knowledge
on risk behaviours and STD, the Portuguese version of the scales
Newest Vital Sign (NVS-PT) and e-HEALS (e-Health Literacy Scale) will
be used in a representative sample of the nationwide population of
blood donors.
Results
It is expected that blood donors raise their level of confidence and
safety in the donation procedure in Portugal, calling more and new
donors, increasing the blood supplies.
Conclusions
This innovative research project will be the foundation for a model
for the IPST’ to develop effective evidence-based strategies to em-
power citizens for the blood donation.

Adequate literacy in pregnancy is critical to providing the pregnant
woman with the adoption of healthy lifestyles. In order to know the per-
spective of the midwife about health literacy in prenatal surveillance, we
developed a descriptive exploratory study of a qualitative approach in
which we conducted semi-structured interviews with 8 midwives who
played roles in health centres in rural and urban areas.
The data were subjected to content analysis according to Bardin. "To
satisfy the information requirements", "to promote the well-being of
the pregnant woman and child", "to educate towards motherhood"
and "to promote family well-being" are the purposes of Health
Education.
The results demonstrated that literacy allows one to qualify the
pregnant woman with knowledge, skills and attitudes in order to
promote responsibility and autonomy. The "level of education" asso-
ciated with the social environment were conditional factors for its
promotion. It should be noted that the knowledge of the pregnant
woman was transmitted by different agents, with a highlight on
healthcare providers (n = 38), the family (n = 30) and information
technologies (n = 26) (internet, television, books and magazines).
Women with a High School and Licentiate degree primarily seek
new information technologies. Those who have a lesser degree of
literacy have less knowledge about pregnancy and inadequate self-
management of the problems that may arise. It is confirmed that
the prenatal surveillance check-up is an adequate space to prepare
the woman positively and comprehensively for pregnancy, child-
birth and motherhood, as well as to transmit knowledge that will
lead her to the performance of an informed citizenship.

Background
Operating Assistants (OA) who work in schools should embrace
healthy lifestyles due to the active role they play within the educa-
tional community. Objective: To measure lifestyles of the Operating
Assistants in secondary schools in the north of the Portugal.
Methods
A descriptive study was used as well as a questionnaire on the phys-
ical, psychological and social components of lifestyles, consisting of
ten domains which are identified with the "FANTASTICO”. The Portu-
guese version, consisting of 30 items, each with three answer op-
tions, with values ranging from 0 to 2, and the total score of 0 to 120
points, categorized by: “need to improve” (0-46); “regular” (47-72);
“good” (73-84); “very good” (85-102) and “excellent lifestyle” (103-120).
Results
Of the 49 OA participating in the study, most were females 35
(71.4 %), with the average age of 50.6 years old (SD = 6.6) having
19.1 years of work experience (SD = 7.6). The lifestyles of the Oper-
ational Assistants were classified as following: excellent 7 (14.3 %);
very good 29 (59.1 %); good 11 (22.4 %) and a regular lifestyle 2
(4.1 %). The ten domains that presented the lowest scores were: to-
bacco use, physical activity and association commitments, family and
friends. Tobacco consumption had the lowest score (mean = 6.61; SD =
2.49), which indicates the poorest lifestyle.
Conclusions
The characterization of the OA’s lifestyles will allow the planning of
interventions in order to promote healthy lifestyles for the areas that
presented the lowest scores.

Background
The programme “Educação Pelo Trabalho para a Saúde (PET-Saúde”)
at the University of Sao Paulo (USP), has provided for students in
the health field that participated in the activities, different experi-
ences of teaching-service integration that has contributed the train-
ing process in health as it responds to the principles of the Sistema
Único de Saúde (SUS). Teamwork, multidisciplinarity and attention
to the health needs of populations are the principles that guide the
PET-Saúde, complementing curricular activities in basic attention/
primary health care. Objective: To investigate the experiences of
the integration of service learning in interventions of the PET-Saúde
at USP-Capital.

Methods
We developed a case study research with interventions of the PET-
Saúde, with conversation wheels and field diaries. For theoretical and
conceptual design, we adopted José Saramago’s Blindness and the
Philosophical Writing of Martinich, aiming to discuss and describe
the experience.
Results
Service-learning integration happened with the PET-Saúde and con-
tributed to broadening perspectives about the health-disease process
and supplementing training in health in order to qualify the perform-
ance of the professional in the field, considering above all social de-
terminants as inseparable components of health practices.
Conclusions
Diversity and plurality are ways of thinking and carrying out health
training is critical to experience teaching strategies that instigate and
produce more connection between students, users and services and
more commitment in defence of life.

Senior exercise is a valuable tool for people, because it leads to a long,
healthy life, and for governments, because it could significantly reduce
health expenditure. The goal of reducing health costs, promotes policies
of active and healthy aging, aiming at controlling the increase in health
care expenses predicted for the senior population. In this context, the
emergence of social risk prevention policies, including the promotion of
exercise, make sense. Exercising in water provides many benefits for se-
nior citizens, and can be used to increase recovery from surgeries and
other problems, to gain strength, stamina and balance for performance of
daily activities. Therefore, Life Long Swimming (LLS) is a project sponsored
and funded by Erasmus + European Union, and developed by the Italian,
Spanish and Turkish Swimming Federations, under the scientific supervi-
sion of the Faculty of Sport Science and Physical Education, University of
Coimbra (Portugal). The LLS Project aims to develop: I) an organization
model: adapting the sport centres to the needs of seniors; II) a teaching
model: a swimming educational programme for adults and seniors; III) a
swimmers certification standard: The Swimmer’s book; IV) a clubs and insti-
tutional certification standard: the quality certificate LLS partner club.
The project is the result of an innovative cultural process to produce
guidelines aiming to develop senior-friendly swimming centres, with
special interest for active people over 60. The desired impacts are to
spread awareness of the importance of health enhancing exercise
through swimming and enthuse a sustainable number of new senior
swimmers.
