Swollen lymph nodes most often happen because of infection from bacteria or viruses. Rarely, cancer causes swollen lymph nodes.

The lymph nodes, also called lymph glands, play a vital role in the body being able to fight off infections. They work as filters, trapping viruses, bacteria and other causes of illnesses before they can infect other parts of the body. Common areas for swollen lymph nodes include the neck, under the chin, in the armpits and in the groin.

Sometimes, time and warm compresses may be all that's needed to treat swollen lymph nodes. Sometimes,>If an infection causes swollen lymph nodes, treatment depends on the infection.

The lymph system is a network of organs, vessels and lymph nodes throughout the body. Many lymph nodes are in the head and neck. Lymph nodes there often swell. Swelling can be to the size of a pea or kidney bean or larger.

Swollen lymph nodes are a sign that something is wrong in the body. The nodes might also be tender and painful.

Depending on the cause of the swollen lymph nodes, other symptoms might include:

- Runny nose, sore throat or cough.

- Swelling of lymph nodes all through the body. When this occurs, it might be because of an infection, such as HIV or mononucleosis, or an immune system condition, such as lupus or rheumatoid arthritis.

- Hard, fast-growing nodes that don't move when pushed. These might be because of cancer of the lymph system, called lymphoma, or other cancer.


## When to see a doctor


Some swollen lymph nodes return to their usual size when the condition that's causing them gets better. See your healthcare professional if you're worried or if your swollen lymph nodes:

- Have no known reason.

- Continue to get bigger or have been swollen for 2 to 4 weeks.

- Feel hard or rubbery, or don't move when you push on them.

- Come with fever, night sweats or weight loss.

- Come with a cough that doesn't get better.

- Are in your armpit.

Seek immediate medical careif you have trouble swallowing or breathing.

Lymph nodes are small, round or bean-shaped bunches of cells. Inside lymph nodes are a mix of types of immune system cells. These cells filter the lymph fluid as it goes through the body and protect the body from invaders.

Lymph nodes are in groups. Each group drains an area of the body. It might be easier to tell if there's swelling in certain areas. These include the lymph nodes in the neck, under the chin, and in the armpits and groin. Where the swollen lymph nodes are might give a clue to the cause of the swelling.

The most common cause of swollen lymph nodes is an infection, usually viral, such as the common cold. Sometimes the cause isn't found.

Other causes of swollen lymph nodes include:


### Common infections


- Ear infections.

- Infected tooth.

- Skin or wound infections, such as cellulitis.

- Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the virus that causes AIDS.


### Less common infections


- Certain sexually transmitted infections, such as syphilis.

- An infection with a parasite called toxoplasmosis. It comes from contact with the feces of an infected cat or by eating meat that is not cooked well enough.

- A bacterial infection from a cat scratch or bite, called cat scratch fever.


### Immune system disorders


- Lupus. This ongoing, disease, or chronic disease, causes swelling and irritation. Swelling and irritation also is called inflammation. Lupus can affect the joints, skin, kidneys, blood cells, heart and lungs.

- Rheumatoid arthritis. This chronic disease causes inflammation in the tissue that lines the joints. The tissue is called synovium.

- Sarcoidosis. This chronic disease causes the growth of tiny groups of inflammatory cells called granulomas. They occur most often in the lungs and lymph nodes.

- Lymphoma. This cancer starts in the lymph system.

- Leukemia. This is cancer of the body's blood-forming tissue. This includes the bone marrow and lymph system.

- Other cancers that have spread, called metastasized, to lymph nodes.

Other possible but rare causes include certain medicines, such as the anti-seizure medicine phenytoin (Dilantin) and medicines that prevent malaria. Silicone breast implants also can cause swollen lymph nodes.

Many conditions increase the risk of swollen lymph nodes. Factors that increase the risk of having these conditions include:

- Older age.Aging increases the risk of getting infections, immune system disorders and cancer.

- High-risk behaviors.Having sex without protection and injecting illicit drugs increases the risk of infections such as HIV and other sexually transmitted infections.

- Weakened immune system.This can be from an illness or a medicine that suppresses the immune system. Having a weakened immune system increases the risk of infections.

When an infection that causes swollen lymph nodes isn't treated, a collection of pus may form. These are called abscesses. Pus contains fluid, white blood cells, dead tissue, and bacteria or other invaders. An abscess might need to be drained and treated with an antibiotic.
