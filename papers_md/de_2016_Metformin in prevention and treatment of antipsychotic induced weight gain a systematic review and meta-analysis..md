Abstract

Background: Most antipsychotics are associated with weight gain and other metabolic complications. Several
randomized trials have shown metformin to be effective, but this still hasn’t been included in clinical guidelines
on managing antipsychotic induced weight gain.
Methods: All double blind placebo controlled trials assessing the efficacy of metformin in the treatment of
antipsychotic induced weight gain were included. Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and
MEDLINE were searched for the period January 2000-December 2015. Meta-analysis was carried out using the
random effects model.

Results: Meta analysis of 12 published studies with a total of 743 patients found that in patients treated with
antipsychotics, metformin treatment resulted in significantly better anthropometric and metabolic parameters than
placebo. The mean change in weight was −3.27 kg (95 % CI −4.66 to −1.89) (Z = 4.64, p < 0.001). Metformin
compared to placebo resulted in significant reduction in BMI [−1.13 kg/m2 (95 % CI −1.61 to −0.66)] and insulin
resistance index [−1.49 (95 % CI −2.40 to −0.59)] but not fasting blood sugar [−2.48 mg/dl (95 % CI −5.54 to 0.57].
Conclusion: This meta-analysis confirms that metformin is effective in treating antipsychotic induced weight gain
in patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder.

Background
Most antipsychotics are associated with weight gain and
other metabolic complications [1]. Prevalence of metabolic
syndrome is higher in patients treated with antipsychotics
than in drug naive patients with schizophrenia. Metabolic
syndrome is more likely with second generation antipsy-
chotics than first generation antipsychotics [2]. Rate of
weight gain is highest in the first six months after com-
mencing treatment however patients continue to gain
weight during the course of treatment [3]. Clozapine
and olanzapine have the highest risk of weight gain
while aripiprazole, lurasidone and ziprasidone have the
lowest risk [4–6].

The standardized mortality ratio in schizophrenia is
1.5 times that of the general population [7]. This risk

has been increasing over the recent past [8]. Some of
this increased risk is attributed to the use of second gen-
eration antipsychotics [9]. Coronary heart disease is the
major cause of death in patients with schizophrenia. In-
creased rates of cigarette smoking, obesity and metabolic
syndrome caused by life style factors and side effects are
major contributors [10]. The beneficial effects of better
compliance with medication and reduced suicide rates
due to second generation antipsychotics are offset by the
deaths due to antipsychotic induced weight gain [9].

Behavioural interventions consisting of life style modi-
fications are effective in reducing antipsychotic induced
weight gain [11]. These can be used alone or as an ad-
junctive to pharmacological treatment. There is no sig-
nificant difference between the types of interventions of
individual or group therapy and nutritional counselling
and cognitive behaviour therapy [11].

[12]. Metformin also increases peripheral utilization and
suppresses appetite [13]. Metformin is recommended
as first line treatment in type 2 diabetes mellitus [14]. It
is also used to treat obesity is non diabetics. Metformin
may contribute to weight reduction in the obese by re-
ducing insulin resistance and by suppressing appetite.
However its efficacy in treating obesity in non-diabetics
has not been established [15].

Although several studies have shown metformin to be
effective, this still hasn’t been included in clinical guide-
lines on managing antipsychotic induced weight gain.
Several RCT which evaluated the efficacy of metformin
in treating antipsychotic induced weight gain have been
published recently [16, 17]. Therefore it is important
that the evidence regarding metformin is synthesized.

The objective of this review was to assess the efficacy
of metformin for treating or preventing antipsychotic
induced weight gain in patients with schizophrenia or
schizoaffective disorder.

Methods
A study protocol was developed and the meta analysis
was conducted according to it. The study protocol
is
available from the corresponding author on request. The
meta-analysis was conducted based on the Preferred
Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-
Analyses (PRISMA) [18].

Types of studies
All published, randomized controlled trials with double
blind assessment of outcome were included in the re-
view. Open label trials and observational studies were
excluded.

Participant characteristics and diagnosis
Participants of both sexes and all age groups with
schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder diagnosed ac-
cording to DSM IV, DSM-5 or ICD-10 criteria treated
with antipsychotics were included [19–21].

Types of interventions
All double blind placebo controlled trials assessing the
efficacy of metformin in the treatment of antipsychotic
induced weight gain were included. Trials which tested a
combination of metformin with lifestyle modification for
weight gain as an adjunct were also included.

Outcome measures
The primary outcome measure of efficacy was mean
change in weight in kg between pre-treatment and end
of study weight. Secondary outcome measures were change
in BMI (kg/m2), fasting blood sugar (mg/dl) and insulin re-
sistance index (IRI). The principal summary measure used
was mean difference.

Search methods for identification of studies
A study protocol detailing sources of data, search strategy,
outcome measures, study selection criteria and statistical
analysis was developed. Cochrane Central Register of Con-
trolled Trials (CENTRAL) MEDLINE and EMBASE were
searched for the period January 2000-December 2015. We
also looked at the references of selected full text articles.
We used the following search terms. Randomized con-
trolled trial OR randomized OR clinical trial OR random-
ized controlled trial AND metformin AND antipsychotic
agents OR dopamine antagonists OR atypical antipsy-
chotics OR antipsychotic induced weight gain OR second
generation antipsychotics OR olanzapine OR clozapine
OR risperidone OR aripiprazole OR ziprasidone OR
quetiapine.

Data collection process
Data was extracted from studies independently using a
data collection form by two investigators (VdeS and R.H.).
Disagreements were resolved by a third investigator (C.S.).

Risk of bias
Methodological quality of the included studies was eval-
uated using the Cochrane risk of bias tool and the Jadad
scale (Additional file 1: Table S1) [22]. Sequence gener-
ation, allocation concealment, blinding of participants,
personnel and outcome assessors, incomplete outcome
data, selective outcome reporting, and other potential
sources of bias were assessed according to these tools.

Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was carried out using Review Manager
version 5.2 [23]. Meta-analysis was carried out using the
random effects model of DerSimonian and Laird because
the subjects and interventions in the studies have differed
in ways that would have impacted on the results [24].
The presence of heterogeneity between studies was
tested using the Cochran’s Q. The magnitude of hetero-
geneity was determined using the I2 statistic. We ana-
lysed the mean change in body weight, BMI, fasting
glucose,
insulin resistance and percentage change of
body weight. Six studies reported the change in body
weight percentage [16, 17, 25–28]. In other studies per-
centage was derived by dividing the change in weight
by the mean baseline weight. When data on standard
deviations were missing,
it was calculated using the
standard error of subgroups or confidence intervals.
Funnel plot analysis was used to detect publication bias
using Begg–Mazumdar method and Egger’s test. This was
done using the software Comprehensive meta analysis
(trial version) [29].

Subgroup analysis
Subgroup analysis was carried out for weight and BMI
comparing adults and children and also first episode ver-
sus chronic patients.

Sensitivity analysis
Sensitivity analysis was carried out by excluding the
studies carried out in Chinese populations.

Ethical issues
Ethics clearance was not sought and consent was not
obtained as this is a secondary analysis of published data
and does not contain any individual clinical data.

Results
Study selection
A total of 137 studies were screened. Thirteen RCTs
were identified but one was excluded cause it did not
contain adequate data on the primary outcome [20, 30].
Twelve studies of adults and children were included in
the analysis (Fig. 1).

Description of studies
All were parallel group randomised controlled trials
comparing treatment with metformin or placebo of pa-
tients on atypical antipsychotics (Table 1). A total of 743
participants were included. In five studies patients were

Fig. 1 Study flow summary

treated with a specific antipsychotic (olanzapine, risperi-
[31–35]. Four studies were con-
done or clozapine)
ducted in China, one in Taiwan, three in Venezuela, two
in the United States and one each in Saudi Arabia and
Sri Lanka. Sample size ranged from 16–75 in each
group. Two studies included children and adolescents
[25, 36]. One included only female patients who had
amenorrhoea [26]. Five studies included patients who
had gained more than 7–10 % of their body weight after
commencing treatment with antipsychotics [16, 27, 28,
34, 36]. In 5 studies mean pre-treatment BMI was ≥25
[16, 17, 32, 35, 36]. Five studies were conducted in first
episode patients [25–28, 34]. In most studies the dose of
metformin was 1000 mg a day.

Risk of bias
Most information was from studies at low risk of bias.
The detailed risk of bias table is given as a additional file
(Additional file 1: Table S1). Quality of trials was also
assessed using the Jadad scale. One trial scored 2 and the
others scored between 3–5 (Additional file 1: Table S1).

Synthesis of results
Body weight
The forest plot from the meta analysis weight change is
given in Fig. 2. Ten studies of adults and two of children
were included in the meta analysis of weight. Of them
seven studies in adults and one in children showed that
there was significant difference in weight gain between
metformin and placebo. Meta-analysis of 12 studies
found that that treatment with metformin resulted in
significantly more weight loss than placebo in patients
treated with antipsychotics [−3.27 kg (95 % CI −4.66
to −1.89) (Z = 4.64, p < 0.001).

Meta-analysis of the studies found that that the percent-
age of body weight loss with metformin was significantly
more than with placebo [−5.07 (95 % CI −6.67 to −3.45)
(Z = 6.13, p < 0.001).

Body mass index
The forest plot from the meta analysis of change in BMI
is given in Fig. 3. Ten studies of adults and two of chil-
dren were included in the meta analysis of BMI. Of them
seven studies in adults and one in children showed that
there was significant difference in BMI between metfor-
min and placebo. Meta-analysis of 12 studies found that
that treatment with metformin resulted in significantly
more reduction in BMI than placebo in patients treated
with antipsychotics [−1.13 kg/m2 (95 % CI −1.61 to −0.66)]
(Z = 4.65, p < 0.001).

Fasting blood sugar
The forest plot from the meta analysis of change in FBS
is given in Fig. 4. Ten studies of adults were included

and two studies found a significant difference between
metformin and placebo. Meta-analysis of 10 studies
found that that treatment with metformin did not result
in significant reduction in FBS compared to placebo in
patients treated with antipsychotics [−2.48 mg/dl (95 %
CI −5.54 to 0.57)] (Z = 1.59, p = 0.11).

Insulin resistance index
The forest plot from the meta analysis of change in insu-
lin resistance index is given in Fig. 5. Nine studies in
adults reported change in IRI. One study of 16 weeks
duration gave data only for the week 8 value [36]. Five
studies reported a significant difference between metfor-
min and placebo. Meta-analysis of 9 studies found that
that treatment with metformin resulted in significant
reduction in IRI than placebo in patients treated with
antipsychotics [−1.49 (95 % CI −2.40 to −0.59) (Z = 3.23,
p < 0.001)].

Discontinuation and adverse events
Discontinuation was reported in 5 trials. De Silva et al.
reported one discontinuation due to dizziness in metformin
group and 3 due to development of diabetes in placebo
group [16]. Jarskorg et al. reported 11 in the metformin and
8 on placebo discontinued to intolerability [17]. Wu et al.
reported that 1 in metformin group and 2 in placebo with-
drew due to psychosis [26]. Wang et al. reported 3 discon-
tinuations due to nausea and psychosis [27]. Wu et al.
reported 5 discontinuations due to psychosis [28]. Only one
trial reported diarrhoea was significantly more in the
metformin group compared to placebo [17]. Three trials
reported no significant difference in moderate adverse
events [26–28].

Sub group analysis
Adults versus children
Subgroup analysis was carried out for weight and BMI
comparing adults and children. There was significant

mean difference in weight favouring metformin in both
adults [−3.24 (95 % CI −4.72 to −1.76) (Z = 4.28, p <
0.001)] and children [−3.92 (95 % CI −7.24 to −0.59)
(Z =2.30, p = 0.02)].

There was significant difference in change in BMI in
adults −1.11 (95 % CI −1.62 to −0.60) (Z = 4.24, p < 0.001)]

and children [−1.47 (95 % CI −2.57 to −0.36) (Z = 2.6,
p = 0.009)].

First episode versus chronic illness
Subgroup analysis shows that the five trials which in-
cluded first episode patients −5.94 kg (95 % CI 6.75

to −5.12) showed a much larger difference in mean body
weight change than trials of chronic patients −2.06 kg
(95 % CI −2.71 to −1.41) (Fig. 6).

Sensitivity analysis
Because the largest difference in body weight was in the
ethnic Chinese population we conducted a sensitivity
analysis by excluding these studies (Fig. 7). Metformin
was significantly more effective than placebo even after
excluding these studies (Z = 4.67, p < 0.001).

Publication bias
Funnel plot with standard error on the vertical axis and
treatment effect on the horizontal axis is given in Fig. 8.
Publication bias was assessed using Begg–Mazumdar
method and Egger’s test. There was no evidence of asym-
metry of treatment effect for weight (Begg Mazumdar:
Kendall’s t = −0.27, P =0.217; Egger’s test p = 0.662).

Heterogeneity
There was significant heterogeneity among the studies
(P < 0.001, I2 = 84 %). Subgroup analysis found that there
was significant heterogeneity in the adult studies (P < 0.001,
I2 = 87 %) but not studies of children (P = 0.66, I2 = 0 %).

Discussion
Meta analysis of 12 published studies with a total of 743
patients found that in patients treated with antipsy-
chotics, metformin treatment resulted in significantly
better anthropometric and metabolic parameters than
placebo. The mean difference in weight was −3.27 kg
(95 % CI −4.66 to −1.89) (Z = 4.64, p < 0.001). Metformin
compared to placebo resulted in significant reduction in
BMI [−1.13 kg/m2 (95 % CI −1.61 to −0.60)] and insulin
resistance index [−1.49 (95 % CI −2.40 to −0.59)] but not
fasting blood sugar [−2.48 mg/dl (95 % CI −5.54 to 0.57)].
Although pooled data shows that the mean weight loss
is −3.27 kg it is important to know if this is clinically
meaningful. Weight losses of 5 % or more can result in
clinically significant reduction of morbidity and mortal-
ity [37]. Wang et al. reported that 40.6 % in the metfor-
min treated group and 7 % in the placebo group reduced
their body weight by 7 % [27]. Wu et al. reported that
only 16.7 % in the metformin group gained > 7 % of their
body weight compared to placebo group (63.16 %). Thus
is appears that the metformin results in clinically signifi-
cant weight loss in about half the patients.

Publication bias occurs when studies with small differ-
ence between intervention and control groups or those

showing no significant difference between the two medi-
cations are less likely to be accepted for publication.
Funnel plot analysis showed there was no significant
publication bias.

Heterogeneity occurs when there is variation in true
effect size. This variation can occur due to methodo-
logical differences in the type of participants, interven-
tions and outcome measures between clinical trials. The
studies included in this meta-analysis had a wide vari-
ation in patient characteristics. We pooled together
studies which included first episode as well as chronic
patients, those who had gained more than 10 % of the

bodyweight,
those who were commencing treatment
with atypical antipsychotics, children and adults and pa-
tients of different ethnic origin. We found significant
heterogeneity among the studies. Therefore we used a
random effects model to analyse the data. Subgroup ana-
lysis showed that most of the heterogeneity was due to
first episode patients with
the pooling of studies of
chronic patients.

Metformin appears to be more effective in preventing
antipsychotic induced weight gain in first episode pa-
tients than in chronic patients who have already gained
weight. Subgroup analysis shows that the pooled mean

difference in weight of the five trials which included first
episode patients −5.94 kg (95 % CI 6.75 to −5.12) was
much larger than that of
trials of chronic patients
−2.06 kg (95 % CI −2.71 to −1.41). This could be due to
the metabolic changes which occur with continued use
of antipsychotics. Antipsychotic naïve patients show
rapid and continuous weight gain in the first few weeks.
During the first 12 weeks mean weight gain is about
3.8 kg with a 1 point increase in BMI [38]. This weight
gain continues throughout the duration of antipsychotic
treatment. With continuous weight gain insulin resist-
ance increases. A study which followed up antipsychotic
naïve patients treated with second generation antipsy-
chotics over 8 weeks reported that serum insulin de-
creased at week 2, returned to baseline at week 4, and
increased at week 8 [39]. In patients treated over a long
period insulin resistance increases with time. Metformin
may be more effective in preventing weight gain before
the onset of significant insulin resistance and thus shows
more efficacy in antipsychotic naïve patients. Once these
metabolic changes have occurred metformin may be less
effective in preventing or reversing weight gain.

Sub group analysis shows that metformin is effective
in children There were only two studies conducted in
children and adolescents [25, 36]. Both were small studies
with 15 or 16 participants in each arm. One study in-
cluded participants aged 10–17 years and the other study
included children with a mean age of 8.9 years and
11.25 years. Out of the two studies only one showed
significant difference in weight change. In this study
the placebo group gained a mean of 4.01 kg (SD 6.23)
of weight while the metformin group lost 0.13 kg.
There are a few open label studies too which found that
metformin was effective in treating weight gain in children

on antipsychotics [40, 41]. How ever all these studies
are small and the evidence for the use of metformin in
children is not as robust as in adults.

Because overall mean difference in weight was much
larger in Chinese patients compared to non-Chinese pa-
tients we conducted a sensitivity analysis excluding these
studies. Sensitivity analysis shows that excluding trials
conducted in Chinese populations did not significantly
change the outcome. The non Chinese RCTs were con-
ducted among Hispanic, Caucasian and South Asian
populations. We also found that that of the five studies
conducted in ethnic Chinese patients four included first
episode patients. Therefore the larger mean difference in
weight in ethnic Chinese could be due to genetic effects
or because the studies were of first episode patients who
respond better than chronic patients.

Only 2 RCTs were of 6 months duration [16, 26]. Two
trials were of 16 weeks duration [17, 36]. The other trials
were of 12–14 weeks duration. The trials that were lon-
ger than 12 weeks showed that patients on metformin
continued to lose weight with time. Therefore it is likely
that continuing metformin is beneficial. Since the data
from trials is limited to 6 months it is not known if the
weight loss continues, plateaus or if there is reversal
after that period.

Only one RCT included an arm of lifestyle modifica-
tion [28]. It found that metformin plus life style modifi-
cation was superior to metformin treatment alone. A
meta-analysis of nonpharmacological interventions also
found that significant nonpharmacological intervention
such as dietary counseling and cognitive behaviour ther-
apy were more effective than treatment as usual in redu-
cing antipsychotic induced weight gain [11]. This meta
analysis which included trials using cognitive behavior

de Silva et al. BMC Psychiatry  (2016) 16:341

therapy, nutritional counseling or combined nutritional
and exercise interventions reported a weighted mean dif-
ference of −2.56 kg (95 % CI −3.20 to −1.92) favouring
the intervention. This is similar to the mean difference
in weight achieved in metformin trials [11].

Several meta analysis have been conducted previously.
Meta-analysis by Mizuno et al. and Maayan et al. ana-
interventions including
lysed several pharmacological
metformin. Bergman et al. included 7 RCT and Praharaj
et al. four. All these meta-analysis included less RCTs
than our study. However all reported that metformin
significantly reduced weight and other anthropometric
measures [42]. The most comprehensive is the one by
Zhen et al. which included 21 RCTS including 10 trials
published in the Chinese language which were not in-
cluded in our study. The 13 trials conducted among
Chinese populations reported a pooled standardised
mean difference of −0.69 compared to −0.40 in trials
conducted in non-Chinese. However this meta analysis
used values at the end of follow up period instead of the
difference between end and baseline values the end of
follow up period instead of the difference between end
and baseline values for waist circumference and fasting
blood sugar.

There are several limitation to this meta-analysis. There
was significant heterogeneity across the studies. Sub group
analysis showed that this was probably due to pooling of
trails conducted in first episode and chronic patients. We
did not include unpublished data and results of several
trials published in the Chinese language.

Conclusion
This meta-analysis confirms that metformin is effective
in treating antipsychotic induced weight gain in patients
with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. This meta
analysis which included recently published data showed
a larger mean difference in weight than that reported in
previous meta analysis. There is sufficient evidence to
recommend commencing metformin in patients with
antipsychotic induced weight gain. Considering the mag-
nitude of effect in patients with first episode psychosis
we recommend that metformin is commenced in all pa-
tients who show evidence of weight gain.

Recommendations
Both adults and children receiving antipsychotics should
be monitored for weight gain and other metabolic com-
plications as this will allow early intervention. All pa-
tients should be provided advice on diet and other life
style modifications. Switching to an antipsychotic with
less risk of weight gain is known to be beneficial. We
recommend that clinicians consider prescribing metformin
for patients when the above strategies are not adequate to
control weight gain.
