Abstract 
Background  Neuropsychiatric disturbances are common manifestations of dementia disorders and are associated 
with caregiver burden and affiliate stigma. The present study investigated affiliate stigma and caregiver burden as 
mediators for the association between neuropsychiatric symptoms of people with dementia (PWD) and caregiver 
mental health such as depression and anxiety.

Methods  A cross‑sectional survey study was carried out with 261 dyads of PWD and informal caregivers from the 
outpatient department of a general hospital in Taiwan. The survey included the Caregiver Burden Inventory (CBI), 
the Affiliate Stigma Scale (ASS), the Taiwanese Depression Questionnaire (TPQ), and the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI). 
Mediation models were tested using the Hayes’ PROCESS macro (Model 4 for parallel mediation model; Model 6 for 
sequentially mediation model).

Results  Caregiver burden, affiliate stigma, caregiver depression, and caregiver anxiety were significantly associated 
with neuropsychiatric symptoms. After controlling for several potentially confounding variables, it was found that 
PWD’s neuropsychiatric symptoms, caregiver burden and affiliate stigma significantly explained 52.34% of the vari‑
ance in caregiver depression and 37.72% of the variance in caregiver anxiety. The parallel mediation model indicated 
a significantly indirect path from PWD’s neuropsychiatric symptoms to caregiver mental health through caregiver 
burden and affiliate stigma, while the direct effect was not significant. Moreover, there was a directional association 
between caregiver burden and affiliate stigma in the sequential mediation model.

Conclusions  These findings show that it is imperative to improve caregivers’ perception of those with dementia to 
reduce internalized stigma and to improve caregivers’ mental health. Implementation of affiliate stigma assessment in

Introduction
According  to  the  World  Alzheimer  Report  [1],  approxi-
mately  46.8  million  individuals  are  living  with  dementia 
globally.  The  number  has  not  plateaued  and  it  is  pre-
dicted that it will increase to 131.5 million individuals by 
the year 2050 [2]. Therefore, large demands on caring for 
older people, especially those with dementia, are needed 
and  such  burden  is  usually  relied  on  informal  caregiv-
ers.  Informal  caregivers  have  been  viewed  as  invisible 
second  patients  [3].  Indeed,  providing  care  to  a  fam-
ily  member  with  disease  can  cause  emotional,  physical, 
and  financial  burden  to  the  informal  caregivers  [4–6]. 
Among caregivers taking care of family member with dif-
ferent  types  of  disease,  those  taking  care  of  people  with 
dementia  (PWD)  appear  to  have  greater  levels  of  psy-
chological burden. Some research has reported that car-
egivers of patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) have a 
higher prevalence of depression and anxiety than caring 
for  patients  with  other  illnesses  [6–8].  A  meta-analysis 
comprising 17 studies (N = 10,825 participants) reported 
a  high  prevalence  of  depression  (34.0%)  and  anxiety 
(43.6%) for caregivers of patients with AD [9]. In Taiwan 
(where  the  present  study  was  carried  out),  similar  prev-
alence  rates  have  been  reported:  23.7–43.8%  at  risk  of 
depression  and  37.4%  at  risk  of  anxiety  among  informal 
caregivers of PWD [10, 11]. Therefore, the mental health 
of caregivers who take care of PWD should also be taken 
care of by healthcare providers.

The  model  proposed  by  Pearlin  et  al.  [12]  provides  a 
potential  psychological  framework  for  healthcare  pro-
viders  to  tackle  mental  health  of  caregivers  of  PWD. 
More  specifically,  the  Stress  Process  Model  (SPM) 
comprises  the  caregiving  context  (e.g.,  social  and  eco-
nomic characteristics). Also, during the process, stress-
ors (including objective indicators such as problematic 
behavior and subjective indicators such as burnout felt 
by caregivers) lead to psychological manifestations (e.g., 
depression, anxiety) via some mediators such as coping 
strategies [12]. Therefore, behavioral disturbances, par-
ticularly angry or aggressive behaviors among PWD, are 
objective stressors associated with caregiver depression 
[13–15]. Similarly, caring for PWD increases caregiving 
burden,  a  type  of  subjective  stressor,  and  such  subjec-
tive burden also increases the risk of having depression 
and anxiety symptoms [16]. In sum, behavioral and psy-
chological symptoms of dementia (e.g., irritability, agi-
tation, aggression, apathy) together with the caregivers’ 

caregiving burden are potential stressors that can result 
in  impaired  mental  health  among  caregivers  of  PWD 
[15, 17].

The  burden  experienced  by  caregivers  is  a  result  of 
many  factors.  As  individuals  gradually  lose  the  abil-
ity  to  care  for  themselves,  there  is  increasing  need  for 
supervision and assistance. Novak et al. [18] have iden-
tified  five  dimensions  of  subjective  burden  comprising 
(i)  time-dependence  burden  (i.e.,  time  cost  of  the  car-
egiver),  (ii)  developmental  burden  (i.e.,  the  caregiv-
ers’  feelings  of  being  ‘off-time’  in  their  development 
with  respect  to  their  peers  [e.g.,  missing  out  on  what 
others  do  because  of  their  caring  duties]),  (iii)  physi-
cal  burden  (i.e.,  caregivers’  feelings  of  chronic  fatigue 
and damage to their physical health, (iv) social burden 
(i.e.,  caregivers’  feelings  of  role  conflict),  and  (v)  emo-
tional  burden  (i.e.,  caregivers’  negative  feelings  toward 
their  care  receivers). The  five  dimensions  of  subjective 
burden  may  result  from  the  individual’s  unpredictable 
and often bizarre behavior [18, 19]. Studies of caregiver 
burden  have  also  shown  that  increases  in  the  care-
receiver’s  behavioral  and  psychological  symptoms  are 
strongly  correlated  with  caregiver  burden  [15,  20–22]. 
Moreover,  care-receiver’s  behavioral  and  psychological 
symptoms  (e.g.,  hallucinations,  irritability,  depression) 
are significant predictors of caregiver burden [17].

One study by Werner et al. assessed four dimensions 
of  affiliate  stigma—interpersonal  interaction,  conceal-
ment,  structural  discrimination,  and  access  to  social 
roles  conducted  [23].  Caregivers  of  people  with  Alz-
heimer’s  disease  have  especially  high  levels  of  affiliate 
stigma  in  the  four  aforementioned  dimensions.  Such 
affiliate stigma prevents informal caregivers from seek-
ing  the  services  that  might  reduce  caregiver  burden. 
Other  family  members  may  blame  informal  caregivers 
for providing a poor home environment or mismanag-
ing  PWD  [24].  Informal  caregivers  may  lose  their  jobs 
due to managing symptoms of PWD in emergency situ-
ations related to their wandering, falls, and basic needs. 
These  may  include  employment  discrimination  or 
other forms of structural discrimination as well as loss 
of  social  relationships  and  experiences  of  harsh  social 
judgments  [25].  Therefore,  caregivers  may  internalize 
negative  stereotypes  from  the  social  stigma,  resulting 
in  affiliate  stigma.  In  brief,  affiliate  stigma  is  a  type  of 
internalized  stigma  (i.e.,  the  caregivers  internalize  the 
stigma  themselves  because  of  their  relationship  with 

Chen et al. BMC Geriatrics           (2023) 23:27

PWD),  and  the  negative  effects  of  internalized  stigma 
on mental health of stigmatized populations have been 
widely reported [26–28].

From the information mentioned above, affiliate stigma 
is another important factor that could contribute to car-
egiving  burden  and  psychological  distress  of  caregivers 
of PWD. Many caregivers suffer from stigma experiences 
because  of  their  family  member’s  mental  illness  (i.e., 
courtesy  stigma  as  defined  by  Goffman  [29]),  and  such 
stigma experiences may be internalized by the caregivers 
and become affiliate stigma [26]. In other words, when a 
society  treats  the  caregivers  of  PWD  with  negative  per-
ceptions,  attitudes,  emotions,  and  avoidant  behaviors, 
caregivers  are  at  risk  of  having  negative  experiences  in 
emotional (e.g., anxiety), social (e.g., family burden) and 
interpersonal (e.g., isolation) aspects [30]. Indeed, empir-
ical  evidence  has  shown  strong  associations  between 
affiliate  stigma  among  informal  caregivers  and  negative 
outcomes, including caregiver burden [11, 31], quality of 
life [32], depression [27, 28], anxiety [27, 28, 31].

In  order  to  provide  high  quality  programs  to  improve 
the  mental  health  of  caregivers  who  take  care  of  PWD, 
it  is  crucial  for  healthcare  providers  to  better  under-
stand the psychological mechanisms that underpin their 
psychological  distress  such  as  depression  and  anxiety. 
More  specifically,  different  factors  (e.g.,  PWD’s  clinical 
characteristics  and  caregivers’  demographics)  should  be 
tested to yield the most important factors for healthcare 
providers  to  foster  an  efficient  program.  The  best  way 
to  investigate  the  psychological  mechanisms  is  to  use  a 
well-established theory or model. Therefore, the present 
study  was  guided  by  the  SPM  and  proposes  two  media-
tion models (a parallel mediation model and a sequential 
mediation  model).  More  specifically,  the  present  study 
proposed and tested the mediating role of affiliate stigma 
and  caregiver  burden  after  controlling  for  several  con-
founding variables associated with the PWD’s behavioral 
and psychological symptoms (e.g., PWD’s age, sex, mari-
tal  status,  employment  status,  education  and  relation-
ship  of  caregiver,  and  patient’s  age,  sex,  marital  status). 
The  present  study’s  simplified  SPM  retains  the  follow-
ing  factors  derived  from  the  original  SPM:  background 
information  (treated  as  the  confounding  variables);  pri-
mary  stressors,  including  behavioral  and  psychological 
symptoms (treated as the independent variables), affiliate 
stigma,  and  caregiver  burden  (treated  as  the  mediator); 
and  depression  and  anxiety  (treated  as  the  outcome). 
While  the  PWD’s  conditions  cannot  be  changed,  reduc-
ing affiliate stigma or caregiver burden could be effective 
in  improving  caregiver  mental  health  if  either  of  them 
was  found  to  be  a  significant  mediator.  Furthermore,  by 
separating  stressors  into  affiliate  stigma  and  caregiver 
burden,  the  present  study  also  addresses  the  question 

of  which  approach  caregiver  support  services  should  be 
more emphasized.

To  the  best  of  the  present  authors’  knowledge,  no 
empirical evidence has been reported regarding whether 
the SPM could be an effective model in explaining mental 
health  consequences  among  caregivers  of  PWD.  There-
fore,  the  present  study  sought  to  address  this  knowl-
edge gap in the literature on PWD through two types of 
mediation  model  examining  the  severity  of  neuropsy-
chiatric  symptoms  that  affect  caregiver  depression  and 
anxiety. It was hypothesized that caregivers experiencing 
increasing levels of affiliate stigma would be more likely 
to report higher levels of depression and anxiety, and that 
the relationship between neuropsychiatric symptoms and 
caregiver mental health would be mediated by caregiver 
burden and affiliate stigma.

Methods
Participants and data collection

A  cross-sectional  survey  study  utilizing  convenience 
sampling  was  designed  to  collect  data  from  a  dementia 
care center at a general hospital located in Southern Tai-
wan.  300  caregivers  who  took  care  of  the  patients  with 
dementia at home were invited to participate in the study. 
More  specifically,  several  psychiatrists  in  the  dementia 
care  center  screened  potential  participants  (please  see 
the  inclusion  and  exclusion  criteria  below  for  details) 
when  the  informal  caregivers  and  the  PWD  visited  the 
dementia care center for daycare service. Then, the psy-
chiatrists  transferred  the  eligible  participants  to  several 
research  assistants  to  further  confirm  the  eligibility  of 
the participants. When the eligibility was confirmed, the 
research  assistants  led  the  participants  to  a  quiet  room 
to  complete  the  self-reported  measures  using  pen  and 
paper.  After  excluding  those  who  had  incomplete  data 
(n = 39),  the  final  data  used  for  analyses  included  261 
patient-caregiver  dyads  (i.e.,  87%  of  response  rate).  All 
the  participants  (i.e.,  both  caregivers  and  patients)  pro-
vided their informed consent after being told of the study 
purpose.  For  those  who  had  severely  impaired  cognitive 
capacity, consent was obtained from their legally author-
ized  representatives  following  assessment  by  their  treat-
ing psychiatrist(s). The study’s inclusion criteria were: (i) 
ability to speak, understand and read Mandarin Chinese 
or Taiwanese, (ii) each caregiver participant had at least 
one  family  member  aged  older  than  65 years  (because 
young-onset  dementia 
is  conventionally  thought  to 
include patients with onset before the age of 65 years [33], 
and this cutoff point is indicative of a sociological parti-
tion  in  terms  of  employment  and  retirement  age)  with 
any type of diagnosed dementia (including AD and vas-
cular  dementia),  and  (iii)  each  caregiver  participant  was 
aged  at  least  20 years  because  the  Civil  Law  in  Taiwan

sets  20 years  as  the  age  of  adulthood.  Caregivers  who 
were diagnosed with a mental illness or had problems in 
understanding  the  survey  questions  were  excluded.  All 
procedures used for the present study were approved by 
the institutional review board of the Chang Gung Memo-
rial Hospital (IRB 102-3378B).

Measures
In the present study, all assessment items asked the cur-
rent  condition  of  each  participant,  except  for  those 
assessing  depression  and  anxiety  which  concerned  the 
condition  over  the  past  week.  In  addition,  demographic 
information concerning the caregivers was collected (i.e., 
age,  sex,  years  of  education,  marital  status,  employment 
status, relationship to the person with dementia) and the 
demographic variables for the person with dementia they 
cared for (i.e., age, sex, marital status, and neuropsychiat-
ric symptoms).

Caregiver Burden Inventory (CBI)

The  24-item  Chinese  version  of  the  Caregiver  Burden 
Inventory (CBI) was used to assess caregivers’ burden in 
taking  care  of  PWD.  The  CBI  also  provides  a  brief  and 
comprehensive  measure  of  caregiver  burden  that  makes 
it  a  practical  tool  for  assessing  and  responding  to  car-
egiver  burden  [19].  The  CBI  has  five  burden  subscales 
(time-dependent = 5 
items, 
physical = 4  items,  social = 4  items,  and  emotional = 6 
items).  Each  CBI  item  is  rated  on  a  5-point  Likert  scale 
ranging  from  0  (strongly  disagree)  to  4  (strongly  agree). 
The total CBI score ranges from 0 to 96, where a higher 
score indicates a higher the level of caregiver burden [18]. 
The overall scale has been shown to have excellent inter-
nal consistency (Cronbach’s α = 0.91) [19].

items,  developmental = 5 

Affiliate Stigma Scale (ASS)

The  22-item  Chinese  version  of  the  Affiliate  Stigma 
Scale  (ASS)  was  used  to  assess  caregivers’  internaliza-
tion  of  stigma  [26].  This  theory  driven  instrument  was 
designed  for  easy  and  practical  use  in  clinical  settings 
due to the fewer items, and its appropriateness for a wide 
range  of  family  caregivers  including  children,  spouses, 
grandchildren, and other relatives [27, 28]. The ASS has 
three  subscales  (cognitive = 7  items,  affect = 7  items, 
and  behavior = 8  items).  Each  ASS  item  is  rated  on  a 
4-point  Likert  scale  ranging  from  1  (strongly  disagree) 
to 4 (strongly agree). The total ASS score ranges from 22 
to 88, where a higher score indicates a higher the level of 
affiliate  stigma. The  psychometric  properties  of  the  ASS 
have  been  tested  for  caregivers  of  family  members  with 
dementia and has been shown to have very good internal 
consistency (Cronbach’s α = 0.82–0.85) [27].

Taiwanese Depression Questionnaire (TDQ)

The 18-item Taiwanese Depression Questionnaire (TDQ) 
was used to assess caregivers’ depressive symptoms [34]. 
The  TDQ  was  constructed  for  experiences  among  the 
Taiwanese population. Consequently, the TDQ has been 
widely used as a screening tool for studies conducted in 
Taiwan  [35].  Each  TDQ  item  is  rated  on  a  4-point  Lik-
ert scale ranging from 0 (no or extremely few, < 1 day per 
week) to 3 (often or always, 5–7 days per week). The total 
TDQ  score  ranges  from  0  to  54,  where  a  higher  score 
indicates  a  higher  the  level  of  depression.  The  overall 
scale  has  been  shown  to  have  excellent  internal  consist-
ency (Cronbach’s α = 0.90) [34].

Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI)

The 21-item Chinese version of the Beck Anxiety Inven-
tory (BAI) was used to assess caregivers’ anxiety [36]. The 
BAI is a brief somatic symptoms-focused screening tool 
that was specifically developed as a measure to discrimi-
nate between anxiety and depression [37]. Each BAI item 
is rated on a 4-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (not at 
all) to 3 (severe [“I could barely stand it”]) [38]. The total 
BAI score ranges from 0 to 63, where a higher score indi-
cates  a  higher  the  level  of  anxiety.  The  overall  scale  has 
been shown to have excellent internal consistency (Cron-
bach’s  α = 0.95,  Guttman  split-half  coefficient = 0.91) 
[36].

Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI)

The  severity  and  frequency  of  behavioral  and  psycho-
logical symptoms of PWD were assessed using the Neu-
ropsychiatric  Inventory  (NPI)  [39].  The  NPI  comprises 
12 domains that are symptoms associated with dementia 
(i.e., delusions, hallucinations, agitation, dysphoria, anxi-
ety,  apathy,  irritability,  euphoria,  disinhibition,  aberrant 
motor  behavior,  night-time  behavior  disturbances,  and 
appetite  and  eating  abnormalities). The  NPI  is  a  general 
outcome  measure  that  is  widely  used  to  assess  behavio-
ral changes for patients with dementia [40]. The partici-
pants  in  the  present  study  (i.e.,  caregivers  of  the  PWD) 
were asked to rate the frequency of the symptoms of that 
domain on a scale ranging from 1 (occasionally, less than 
once  per  week)  to  4  (very  frequently,  once,  or  more  per 
day or continuously) and the severity of the same symp-
toms on a scale ranging from 1 (mild) to 3 (severe). The 
total  NPI  score  ranges  from  0  to  120,  where  a  higher 
score  indicates  a  higher  the  level  of  behavioral  and  psy-
chological  symptoms.  The  overall  scale  has  been  shown 
to have good internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha 0.88 
and  a  test–retest  correlation  of  0.79  for  frequency  and 
0.86 for severity [41]).

Data analysis
The  data  were  analyzed  using  SPSS  version  22  (SPSS, 
Chicago, Illinois, USA). Descriptive statistics were car-
ried out to compute means and standard deviations as 
well  as  internal  consistency.  Bivariate  Pearson’s  cor-
relations  were  used  to  assess  the  associations  between 
study variables.

Ordinary  least  squares  (OLS)  regression  analyses 
were  performed,  with  neuropsychiatric  symptoms  as 
the  predictor,  affiliate  stigma  and  caregiver  burden  as 
proposed  mediators,  and  the  severity  of  depression 
and  anxiety  as  the  outcome  measures.  Covariates  in 
the regression models included age, sex, marital status, 
employment status, education, and relationship of car-
egiver, and PWD’s age, sex, marital status. The parallel 
mediation  (Model  4  in  Hayes’  PROCESS  macro)  and 
the  sequential  multiple  mediation  (Model  6  in  Hayes’ 
PROCESS  macro)  of  PROCESS  macro  developed  by 
Hayes  [42]  were  conducted.  In  the  parallel  mediation 
model, the mediating effect of PWDs’ NPI on caregiver 
depression  or  anxiety  were  examined  through  car-
egiver  burden  and  affiliate  stigma.  Sequential  multiple 
mediation analysis was used to determine the effects of 
mediators in the models. Bias-corrected bootstrap con-
fidence interval (CI) based on 5000 bootstrapping sam-
ples with a 95% level of confidence was used to examine 
the  mediation  effects  (i.e.,  indirect  effects).  When  the 
confidence intervals do not include zero, the mediation 
effect is interpreted as significant.

Results
Table 1 shows the socio-demographic and clinical char-
acteristics  of  the  261  patient-caregiver  dyads.  Overall, 
the  gender  distribution  was  approximately  equal  for 
the  caregivers  with  mean  age  of  52.9 years  (SD ± 12.3). 
On  average,  the  caregivers  had  received  11.2 years  of 
education (SD ±4.2). Most of the caregivers were chil-
dren of PWD (60.9%), had full-time employment (more 
than 30 hours per week) (52.5%), were married (78.2%), 
were living with PWD (70.9%), and were a primary car-
egiver (83.14%). Nearly half of caregivers (49.43%) self-
reported  caring  for  PWD  for  more  than  8  hours  a  day 
on  average,  and  26.43%  of  them  were  caring  for  PWD 
all-day.  Regarding  the  psychosocial  characteristics  of 
the caregivers, the mean score was 40.0 (out of 96) for 
caregiver burden (SD ± 19.1), 35.2 (out of 88) for affili-
ate  stigma  (SD ± 11.0),  12.7  (out  of  54)  for  depression 
(SD ± 11.2),  and  7.9  (out  of  63)  for  anxiety  (SD ± 8.8). 
Nearly  two-thirds  of  the  PWD  (63.6%)  were  females 
with a mean age of 79.3 years (SD ± 6.8). Slightly more 
than  half  of  the  PWD  were  married  (55.2%).  Moreo-
ver,  the  mean  score  for  neuropsychiatric  symptoms  of

the PWD was 18.7 (out of 120) (SD ± 20.4); more than 
three-quarters  of  PWD  (75.9%)  had  Clinical  Dementia 
Rating Stage 0.5–1, with Stage 1 being the majority.

Table 2 shows the bivariate correlations between the 
studied  variables.  The  results  showed  that  neuropsy-
chiatric symptoms were positively associated with car-
egiver  burden  (r = .44,  p < .01),  affiliate  stigma  (r = .34, 
p < .01),  caregiver  depression  (r = .36,  p < .01)  and  with 
caregiver  anxiety  (r = .35,  p < .01).  Table  2  additionally 
demonstrates  how  neuropsychiatric  symptoms,  car-
egiver  burden,  affiliate  stigma,  depression,  and  anxiety 
associated  with  other  demographic  characteristic  of 
caregivers and PWD.

Four  mediation  models  were  carried  out  (Fig.  1  and 
Table  3).  The  first  mediation  model  (Model  A;  Table  3 
and Fig. 1 A) showed that the direct effect of PWDs’ neu-
ropsychiatric symptoms on caregiver depression was not 
statistically  significant  (β = 0.03,  p = .32)  However,  this 
mediation model showed a significant indirect path from 
PWDs’  neuropsychiatric  symptoms  to  caregiver  depres-
sion  via  caregiver  burden  (β = 0.12,  95%  CI  [0.09,  0.17]) 
and affiliate stigma (β = 0.04, 95% CI [0.01, 0.07]).

The  second  mediation  model  (Model  B;  Table  3  and 
Fig.  1  B)  showed  that  the  direct  effect  of  PWDs’  neu-
ropsychiatric  symptoms  on  caregiver  anxiety  was  not 
statistically  significant  (β = 0.05,  p = .054).  However,  this 
mediation model showed a significant indirect path from 
PWDs’  neuropsychiatric  symptoms  to  caregiver  anxiety 
via  caregiver  burden  (β = 0.06,  95%  CI  [0.03,  0.09])  and 
affiliate stigma (β = 0.04, 95% CI [0.01, 0.07]).

The  third  mediation  model  (Model  C;  Table  3  and 
Fig.  1  C)  showed  that  the  direct  effect  of  PWD’s  neu-
ropsychiatric  symptoms  on  caregiver  depression  was 
not  statistically  significant  (β = 0.03,  p = .32).  However, 
this  sequential  mediation  model  showed  a  significant 
indirect  path  from  PWDs’  neuropsychiatric  symptoms 
to  caregiver  depression  via  caregiver  burden  and  affili-
ate  stigma  (β = 0.03,  95%  CI  [0.01,  0.05]).  This  model 
explained 52.34% of the variance in depression.

The final mediation model (Model D; Table 3 and Fig. 1 
D)  showed  that  the  direct  effect  of  PWD’s  neuropsychi-
atric symptoms on caregiver anxiety was not statistically 
significant  (β = 0.03,  p = .05).  However,  this  sequential 
mediation model showed a significant indirect path from 
PWDs’  neuropsychiatric  symptoms  to  caregiver  anxiety 

via caregiver burden and affiliate stigma (β = 0.06, 95% CI 
[0.03, 0.09]). This model explained 37.72% of the variance 
in anxiety.

Discussion
The results of the present study supported the simplified 
Stress Process Model (SPM) that affiliate stigma and car-
egiver burden mediated the association of PWDs’ behav-
ioral and psychological symptoms and caregivers’ mental 
health.  More  specifically,  the  present  study  examined 
two  mediation  models,  and  the  significant  association 
between  NPI  score  and  affiliate  stigma  (Fig.  1  A,  Fig.  1 
B) became nonsignificant when affiliate stigma was posi-
tioned after caregiver burden (Fig. 1 C, Fig. 1 D). To the 
best  of  the  present  authors’  knowledge,  this  is  the  first 
study  to  examine  whether  caregiver  burden  and  affiliate 
stigma  are  mediators  in  the  association  between  behav-
ioral  and  psychological  symptoms  and  caregiver  men-
tal  health.  These  findings  indicated  that  there  could  be 
a  directional  association  between  these  two  mediators, 
such  that  caregiver  burden  may  reduce  affiliate  stigma, 
which  subsequently  may  improve  the  psychological 
health of caregivers. However, the cross-sectional design 
in  the  present  study  cannot  provide  evidence  for  these 
proposed  directions.  Only  longitudinal  designs  can  cor-
roborate the directions proposed in the present study.

Previous  studies  have  shown  that  affiliate  stigma  has 
an  important  effect  on  caregiver  burden  and  that  the 
caregiver  dimension  of  affiliate  stigma  has  the  great-
est impact [43]. The results of the present study concur 
with the literature in the finding that caregiver burden 
is  a  significant  predictor  of  affiliate  stigma  [11,  44].  In

order  to  better  understand  the  mediating  role  of  affili-
ate  stigma  for  caregivers  of  PWD,  the  present  study 
analyzed both a parallel mediation model (Table 3 and 
Fig.  1  A,  Fig.  1  B)  and  a  sequential  mediation  model 
(Table  3  and  Fig.  1  C,  Fig.  1  D).  Results  from  both 
models were generally comparable. However, the asso-
ciation between NPI score and affiliate stigma was not 
found  in  sequential  mediation  model,  only  the  parallel 
mediation  model.  Parallel  mediation  analysis  showed 

that  the  two  mediators  (caregiver  burden,  affiliate 
stigma) fully mediated the relationship between PWDs’ 
behavioral  and  psychological  symptoms  and  caregiver 
mental  health.  However,  while  caregiver  burden  was 
found to significantly contribute to the overall indirect 
effect,  affiliate  stigma  did  not  mediate  the  relationship 
between  PWDs’  behavioral  and  psychological  symp-
toms  and  caregiver  mental  health  in  the  sequential 
mediation model.

The  aforementioned  findings  indicate  that  there 
might  be  a  directional  association  between  these 
two  mediators.  More  specifically,  caregiver  burden 
may  reduce  affiliate  stigma,  which  may  subsequently 
improve  the  psychological  health  of  caregivers.  Nev-
ertheless, the effect of affiliate stigma on mental health 
for caregivers of PWD was consistent between the two 
models. Therefore, a tentative conclusion is that affiliate 
stigma is an important factor in caregiver burden, with 
caregiver  burden  as  the  primary  mediator. The  finding 
of affiliate stigma as a mediator suggests that providing 

support  services  to  caregivers  to  improve  their  mental 
health could also reduce caregiver burden.

The  results  of  the  present  study  indicated  that  experi-
encing  subjective  caregiver  burden  was  associated  with 
increased  risk  of  psychological  distress.  These  findings 
are consistent with previous findings [45–47] and in line 
with  SPM  (i.e.,  primary  stressors  such  as  caregiver  bur-
den  leads  to  mental  health  problems  such  as  psycho-
logical  distress)  [12].  Moreover,  caregivers  of  PWD  are 
reported to have poorer mental health and a higher level 
of  psychological  distress  than  those  who  are  caring  for 

Chen et al. BMC Geriatrics           (2023) 23:27

individuals with a physical disability [48, 49]. The health 
problems,  especially  mental  health  problems,  among 
caregivers of PWD are likely to be explained by their car-
egiver  burden.  It  is  challenging  for  caregivers  of  PWD 
to  take  care  of  their  family  member’s  disruptive  behav-
iors  comprising  behavioral  and  psychological  symptoms 
resulting  from  their  dementia  [50,  51].  Such  caregiver 
burden  may  be  additional  to  the  feelings  of  embarrass-
ment and shame, which are further associated with affili-
ate stigma.

The results of the present study concur with the prior 
findings [27, 28] that affiliate stigma is positively associ-
ated with depression and anxiety. Therefore, the positive 
relationships  between  affiliate  stigma  and  psychological 
distress can be explained by the reason that caregivers of 
PWD  feel  themselves  as  inferior  (i.e.,  endorse  stigma  in 
themselves) and the negative opinions toward themselves 
increase their mood problems, such as psychological dis-
tress.  Accordingly,  healthcare  providers  and  social  ser-
vices may consider developing appropriate interventions 
to reduce affiliate stigma. Given that affiliate stigma was 
found  to  be  associated  with  depression  and  anxiety,  the 
reduction of affiliate stigma is needed to help caregivers 
improve their psychological distress. Subsequently, other 
benefits, such as improved outcomes for PWD, may also 
be gained.

Limitations

The  present  study  has  some  limitations.  First,  partici-
pants were from a convenience sample of PWD and their 
caregivers  with  referrals  from  the  same  area  in  Taiwan. 
Therefore,  the  findings  may  not  be  generalized  to  those 
who might not have been referred, because of the differ-
ences in types of dementia, need for caregiver assistance, 
and  use  of  healthcare  services.  Second,  the  study  was 
cross-sectional  study  and  therefore  causal  relationships 
were  unable  to  be  determined.  Future  research  should 
ideally  comprise  a  longitudinal  design,  which  can  assess 
studied  variables  across  time  and  provide  stronger  evi-
dence  for  causal  relationships.  Third,  the  sample  size  in 
the present study was relatively small. However, the main 
analyses (i.e., the mediation models) were based on 5000 
bootstrapped  samples,  which  are  robust  and  unlikely  to 
have  power  issues  [52].  However,  given  that  the  sam-
ple consisted of a small subset of kinship, future studies 
should separate these kinships of affiliate stigma in order 
to examine the distinct main effects.

Conclusion
Despite  these  limitations,  the  present  study  provides 
new  knowledge  that  caregiver  burden  and  affiliate 
stigma were found to mediate the relationship between 
behavioral and psychological symptoms and caregivers’ 

psychological  distress.  Therefore,  by  considering  men-
tal health concerns in intervention or prevention meas-
ures in helping caregivers of PWD, it may provide more 
effective  approaches  to  decrease  psychological  distress 
and  potential  negative  consequences  of  the  caregiver 
burden,  especially  in  relation  to  their  depression  and 
anxiety.  Future  similar  studies  with  bigger  and  more 
representative  samples  across  different  countries  and 
cultures  may  help  support  the  generalizability  of  the 
findings and better understand the mechanisms under-
lying  the  associations  between  dementia  and  affiliate 
stigma.
