Abstract
Background  Childhood maltreatment (CM) is closely linked to internet addiction (IA), especially in adolescents 
with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). Previous studies have shown that adolescents who experience CM are more 
likely to develop IA and other psychological problems. This study aims to explore the complex relationship between 
CM and IA through network analysis, particularly identifying the core symptoms and bridge symptoms to better 
understand the development of IA in these adolescents.

Methods  A cross-sectional study was conducted in seven hospitals in Anhui Province, China, involving 332 
adolescents diagnosed with MDD using DSM-5 criteria. The Childhood Trauma Questionnaire - Short Form (CTQ-SF) 
and the Internet Addiction Test (IAT) were used to assess CM and IA symptoms, respectively. Gender-based network 
analysis was also performed.

Results  Network analysis constructed a CM-IA network and identified core and bridge symptoms. “Depress/moody/
nervous being offline”, “Request an extension for longer time”, “Sleep loss due to late-night logins”, and “emotional 
abuse” emerged as central symptoms within the CM-IA network. Additionally, “emotional abuse”, “sexual abuse”, 
and “complaints about online time” were identified as key bridge symptoms linking CM and IA. These symptoms 
demonstrated significant connectivity, underscoring their critical role in linking CM and IA.

Conclusion  The findings highlight the complex relationship between CM and IA in adolescents with MDD. Specific 
symptoms, such as emotional abuse and online-related symptoms, play important roles in understanding and 
intervening in adolescent IA. Future interventions should target these core and bridge symptoms for more effective 
prevention and treatment.

Introduction
Adolescence  is  a  critical  period  for  rapid  physical  and 
brain  maturation,  accompanied  by  significant  hormonal 
changes  and  neural  restructuring  [1,  2].  During  this 
phase, adolescents are particularly susceptible to mental 
disorders,  with  depression  being  notably  prominent  [3] 
and becoming one of the most common mental disorders 
globally  [4]. The  “Global  Burden  of  Disease  Study  2020” 
[5]  indicated  that  during  adolescence,  major  depressive 
disorder  (MDD)  significantly  increases  the  Disability-
Adjusted Life Years (DALY), becoming a major influenc-
ing factor. In China, MDD has become one of the leading 
causes  of  disability  and  life  loss  [6].  Research  indicates 
that  adolescents  with  MDD  are  significantly  more  likely 
to  experience  incomplete  education,  with  an  odds  ratio 
(OR)  of  1.76  [7].  They  are  also  at  greater  risk  for  Inter-
net  addiction  (IA)  [8],  self-harm,  and  suicidal  behavior 
[9],  which  further  exacerbate  their  social  and  academic 
difficulties. Additionally, MDD in adolescents is strongly 
linked to depression, anxiety, and suicide later in life [10], 
highlighting  the  need  for  increased  attention  to  adoles-
cent  mental  health.  As  one  of  the  challenges  faced  by 
adolescents  with  MDD,  IA  further  worsens  their  social 
and academic outcomes.

In addition to MDD, adverse childhood experiences can 
also  significantly  impact  adolescent  behavior  through-
out  their  lifetime  [11],  particularly  concerning  internet 
addiction. Childhood maltreatment (CM) includes emo-
tional, physical, and sexual abuse, as well as neglect, and 
has lasting effects on mental health throughout an indi-
vidual’s life [12]. However, there is no standardized defi-
nition of CM, and different organizations, such as WHO 
and  UNICEF,  interpret  it  differently,  which  complicates 
research  and 
intervention  efforts  [13].  Adolescents 
exposed to CM are at increased risk of developing behav-
ioral issues like IA, as they often use internet engagement 
to cope with negative emotions [14]. CM has been linked 
to  altered  brain  structures  involved  in  threat  detection, 
emotional  regulation,  and  reward  processing,  as  well  as 
increased  use  of  maladaptive  emotion  regulation  strate-
gies,  which  collectively  heighten  vulnerability  to  IA  [15, 
16].  Recent  studies  have  found  a  significant  association 
between  childhood  maltreatment  and  internet  addic-
tion, with maladaptive emotion regulation and peer sup-
port playing key roles in mediating and moderating this 
relationship [16, 17]. A meta-analysis further emphasized 
that  different  types  of  child  abuse  and  study  timing  sig-
nificantly  impact  this  association,  highlighting  the  need 
for tailored interventions [18].

Although IA lacks a universally accepted definition and 
is  not  formally  recognized  in  modern  psychiatric  clas-
sification systems, it is generally characterized by exces-
sive  internet  use,  difficulty  controlling  online  behavior, 
and  significant  functional  impairment  [19].  Young  [20] 

categorized  IA  into  several  subtypes,  including  online 
gaming,  communication,  information  seeking,  and  oth-
ers. IA has been shown to impact adolescent brain devel-
opment,  impair  decision-making,  and  contribute  to 
issues  like  anxiety  and  depression  [21–27].  Additionally, 
gender differences may influence the CM-IA relationship, 
with female adolescents more likely to develop emotional 
issues  and  males  more  prone  to  behavioral  problems 
following  abuse  [28].  Investigating  these  gender  differ-
ences  can  help  develop  more  effective,  gender-specific 
interventions.

Recently, several studies have explored the link between 
CM and IA. For example, a meta-analysis involving over 
21,000 adolescents across 19 studies [29] found a signifi-
cant  positive  correlation  between  CM  and  IA.  Further 
analysis [30] showed that emotional neglect (OR = 3.062) 
and  physical  neglect  (OR = 2.328)  are  independently 
associated  with  IA.  Despite  these  findings,  most  exist-
ing  studies  rely  on  regression  analysis,  which  captures 
only  linear  relationships  and  fails  to  illustrate  the  com-
plex  interactions  between  multiple  factors.  To  address 
this  gap,  this  study  aims  to  provide  a  more  comprehen-
sive understanding of the complex relationships between 
different  subtypes  of  childhood  maltreatment  CM  and 
internet addiction IA in adolescents. Specifically, we use 
Network  Analysis  (NA)  to  explore  how  core  symptoms 
of  adolescent  IA  and  subtypes  of  CM  interrelate,  with  a 
particular focus on gender differences. By identifying key 
core and bridge symptoms, we seek to uncover potential 
intervention targets and provide insights into how these 
factors contribute to IA development in adolescents with 
MDD.

Methods
Study design and participants

A  cross-sectional  study  was  conducted  in  four  general 
hospitals  (Chaohu,  Bengbu,  Suzhou,  Bozhou)  and  three 
psychiatric  hospitals  (Hefei,  Ma’anshan,  Fuyang)  located 
in Anhui Province, China, between January and July 2021. 
Adolescent participants aged 12 to 18 were consecutively 
enlisted  from  psychiatric  outpatients  and  inpatients  in 
these  hospitals.  MDD  was  diagnosed  by  two  board-cer-
tified  psychiatrists  using  the  Diagnostic  and  Statistical 
Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition (DSM-5) crite-
ria [31], which included a comprehensive clinical evalua-
tion and a structured interview. To ensure a standardized 
assessment,  we  also  employed  the  Centre  for  Epidemio-
logic  Studies  Depression  Scale  (CES-D)  to  evaluate  the 
severity of depressive symptoms in all participants.

Exclusion criteria included individuals with other psy-
chiatric  or  neurological  disorders,  intellectual  disabili-
ties,  or  those  who  could  not  provide  informed  consent. 
Specifically,  14  participants  were  excluded  following  the 
second  interview  due  to  a  diagnosis  of  bipolar  disorder, 

Wang et al. BMC Psychiatry          (2024) 24:768 Page 3 of 11

7  participants  had  incomplete  questionnaire  data,  and  3 
participants were diagnosed with organic brain disorders 
upon discharge. Out of 356 invited adolescents, 332 com-
pleted the assessment, resulting in a robust participation 
rate of 93%.

The  study  protocol  (202009-kyxm-04)  was  approved 
by the Medical Ethics Committee of Chaohu Hospital of 
Anhui  Medical  University  prior  to  commencement.  All 
procedures were conducted in accordance with the ethi-
cal standards of the institutional and/or national research 
committee  and  with  the  1964  Helsinki  Declaration  and 
its  later  amendments  or  comparable  ethical  standards. 
Written  consent  was  obtained  from  all  eligible  partici-
pants  and  their  guardians  after  briefing  them  about  the 
study’s objectives and procedures.

Sociodemographic Information

Sociodemographic  data,  including  age,  gender,  grade 
level,  and  only-child  status,  were  gathered  using  struc-
tured questionnaires.

Measurement tools
The Childhood Trauma Questionnaire - Short Form (CTQ-SF)

The  CTQ-SF  is  a  widely  used  questionnaire  designed  to 
assess CM in individuals aged 12 and older [32]. It con-
sists of 28 items, with 25 dedicated to evaluating various 
forms  of  maltreatment  experienced  during  childhood, 
such as emotional abuse (EA), physical abuse (PA), sexual 
abuse (SA), emotional neglect (EN), and physical neglect 
(PN). The scoring for each item ranges from 1 (“never”) 
to 5 (“often”), and the total score for each subscale is the 
sum of scores for its five items, with higher scores indi-
cating more severe abuse [33]. It is important to note that 
the scores for 7 items (item 2, 5, 7, 13, 19, 26, and 28) are 
to be reverse coded. As a result, the total score for each 
subscale  ranges  from  5  to  25.  In  previous  research,  the 
Chinese  version  of  the  CTQ-SF  [34,  35]  demonstrated 
commendable  reliability,  with  Cronbach’s  alpha  values 
of 0.84 for emotional abuse, 0.79 for physical abuse, 0.86 
for sexual abuse, 0.78 for emotional neglect, and 0.83 for 
physical neglect, and an overall scale reliability of 0.80 in 
our cohort.

The Internet Addiction Test (IAT)

The  evaluation  of  IA  utilized  the  authenticated  Chinese 
version of the Internet Addiction Test (IAT), as reported 
by  Chin  and  Leung  [36]  and  Lai  et  al.  [37].  This  instru-
ment consists of 20 questions and employs a 5-point Lik-
ert scale for respondents to assess the frequency of their 
internet-related  symptoms,  ranging  from  1  (indicating 
very  rarely)  to  5  (indicating  very  often).  The  cumulative 
score from this test serves as an indicator of the severity 
of  an  individual’s  internet  addiction,  with  higher  scores 
reflecting more severe addiction levels. The reliability of 

the Chinese version of the IAT in our study was excellent, 
with a Cronbach’s alpha of 0.93, indicating high internal 
consistency.

The Centre for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-
D)

The  Centre  for  Epidemiologic  Studies  Depression  Scale 
(CES-D)  was  used  to  assess  the  severity  of  depres-
sive  symptoms  in  patients,  with  each  item  scored  from 
0  (“rarely  or  none  of  the  time”)  to  3  (“most  or  all  of  the 
time”)  [38].  The  CES-D  consists  of  20  items  covering 
mood,  somatic  complaints,  interactions,  and  positive 
affect, reflecting the frequency of symptoms over the past 
week.  The  total  score  ranges  from  0  to  60,  with  higher 
scores indicating more severe symptoms. The CES-D has 
been  widely  validated  in  both  clinical  and  community 
settings,  demonstrating  good  reliability  and  validity.  In 
our study, the Cronbach’s alpha for the CES-D was 0.85, 
indicating high internal consistency.

Network estimation

Data  analysis  in  this  study  was  performed  using  the  R 
language  within  the  RStudio  environment,  version  4.3.2 
[39].  Network  construction  was  accomplished  through 
the  EBICglasso  function  and  Spearman  correlation,  cre-
ating a sparse Gaussian graphical model. Specifically, we 
employed  an  integrative  network  model  that  combines 
different  types  of  CM—such  as  emotional  abuse,  physi-
cal  abuse,  and  neglect—with  core  symptoms  of  IA. This 
integrative approach allowed us to evaluate multiple fac-
tors simultaneously, identifying the complex interactions 
between  CM  and  IA  symptoms,  and  uncovering  core 
and  bridge  symptoms  that  are  crucial  for  understand-
ing  the  mechanisms  linking  CM  to  IA.  This  method, 
guided  by  the  Extended  Bayesian  Information  Criterion 
(EBIC), streamlined the network structure and enhanced 
interpretability  [40].  The  analysis  primarily  focused  on 
strength  and  the  expected  influence  (EI)  index,  due  to 
their  suitability  for  psychopathological  networks  [41]. 
Bridge Strength and the bridge expected influence (BEI) 
index  were  computed  to  identify  bridge  symptoms,  uti-
lizing  the  bridge  function  in  the  networktools  R  pack-
age  [42].  Other  centrality  metrics  such  as  closeness  and 
betweenness were not used due to their limited effective-
ness in revealing psychological variables [43].

Graphical representation of the network was generated 
using  the  qgraph  R  package  (version  1.9.8)  [44],  where 
nodes (circles) were connected by edges (lines), with the 
thickness  of  the  edges  indicating  interaction  strength 
[45].  Positive  correlations  were  depicted  in  blue,  while 
negative  correlations  were  shown  in  red.  The  Fruch-
terman-Reingold  force-directed  algorithm  was  used  to 
cluster  nodes  with  strong  associations  and  place  those 
with  weaker  associations  on  the  periphery  [46].  The  R2

predictability  index,  calculated  using  the  mgm  R  pack-
age (1.2–14) [47], was visually represented by the size of 
a  semi-circular  area  around  each  node,  quantifying  the 
variance each node explained in relation to others in the 
network.

Estimation of network accuracy and stability

The  bootnet  R  package  (version  1.5.6)  [48]  was  used  to 
conduct 1000 bootstrap iterations to assess the accuracy 
and stability of network edges, with edge precision evalu-
ated  by  examining  the  95%  confidence  interval  of  boot-
strap  edge  weights;  narrower  intervals  indicated  higher 
accuracy. The robustness of centrality measures was fur-
ther  assessed  by  comparing  centrality  indices  from  the 
complete sample with those from a 70% reduced sample. 
The  Centrality  Stability  coefficient  (CS  coefficient)  was 
calculated to evaluate network robustness, with a value of 
≥ 0.5 indicating high reliability, 0.25 to 0.5 denoting mod-
erate reliability, and < 0.25 indicating less robustness.

Comparisons of network characteristics by gender

We performed gender-based network comparisons using 
the  NetworkComparisonTest  package  (version  2.2.2) 
[49]. Effect sizes were determined using Bootstrap-based 
Spearman  correlation,  and  the  average  correlation  coef-
ficients  were  reported  from  1000  resampled  associa-
tions.  By  comparing  two  networks  and  visualizing  the 

differences in a corPlot diagram, we effectively identified 
key distinctions.

Results
Sociodemographic Characteristics of Participants

A total of 332 adolescents participated in the study, with 
an  average  age  of  15.32  years  (SD = 1.62).  Among  them, 
242 (73%) were male and 90 (27%) were female. Regard-
ing  grade  level,  148  participants  (45%)  were  in  middle 
school, while 184 (55%) were in high school. Additionally, 
139  participants  (42%)  were  only  children,  whereas  193 
(58%) had siblings.

Network structure and centrality measures analysis

Figure  1  illustrates  the  network  structure  of  CM-IA. 
Out of 300 edges in this network, 131 edges (44%) have 
non-zero  weights,  indicating  a  dense  interconnectiv-
ity  between  CM  and  IA.  In  terms  of  node  predictabil-
ity,  on  average,  43%  of  the  variance  can  be  explained 
by  neighboring  nodes.  The  node  “Preoccupation  with 
the  Internet”  (IAT-15)  has  the  highest  predictability  in 
the  network,  reaching  62%.  This  is  closely  followed  by 
“Depress/moody/nervous  being  offline”  (IAT-20)  and 
“Request  an  extension  for  longer  time”  (IAT-16),  with 
predictabilities  of  61%  and  58%,  respectively.  The  pre-
dictability of all other nodes in the network is detailed in 
Table 2.

In  the  CM  community,  the  connection  between  the 
nodes EN “Emotional neglect” and PN “Physical neglect” 
is the most direct and strong, with a weight of 0.40. The 
node  EA  “Emotional  abuse”  also  has  a  significant  direct 
connection  with  PA  “Physical  abuse”,  with  a  weight  of 
0.38. Additionally, there is a notable link between EA and 
EN, with a weight of 0.25. In terms of IA symptoms, the 
nodes  IAT-3  “Prefer  the  excitement  online”  and  IAT-19 
“Spend more time online over going out with others” are 
the most closely connected, with a weight of 0.46, repre-
senting the tightest bond in the entire network. Following 
closely,  IAT-1  “Stay  online  longer”  and  IAT-2  “Neglect 
chores to spend more time online” have a close relation-
ship with a weight of 0.37; and IAT-16 “Request an exten-
sion for longer time” and IAT-17 “Failure to cut down the 
time spend online” are also closely linked, with a weight 
of 0.28. Notably, the differences in these edge weights are 
statistically significant (refer to Figure S1). Detailed infor-
mation  about  the  weights  of  other  edges  in  the  CM-IA 
network can be found in Table S1.

As depicted in Fig. 2, within the CM-IA network, IAT-
20  “Depress/moody/nervous  being  offline”  emerges  as 
the node with the highest centrality, followed by IAT-16 

“Request  an  extension  for  longer  time”,  IAT-14  “Sleep 
loss due to late-night logines”, and EA “Emotional Abuse”. 
Additionally, SA “Sexual Abuse” holds the highest bridg-
ing  value,  succeeded  by  IAT-5  “Others  complain  about 
your  time”  and  EA  “Emotional  Abuse”.  Specifically,  the 
strongest link is observed between EA “Emotional Abuse” 
and  IAT-5  “Others  complain  about  your  time”. The  cen-
trality  and  bridge  symptoms  for  all  nodes  are  accessible 
in  Table  1.  Figure  3A  illustrates  satisfactory  accuracy, 
evidenced by the convergence of the black and red lines. 
Furthermore,  the  narrow  gray  band  indicates  minimal 
variability  during  the  resampling  process.  Regarding  the 
stability of the network analysis, the centrality and bridg-
ing metrics exhibit excellent stability levels with CS = 0.75 
and CS = 0.68, respectively, as shown in Fig. 3B.

Gender differences

Figure  S4  presents  the  network  structures  generated  for 
both  genders.  When  comparing  the  networks  generated 
for  females  and  males,  no  significant  differences  were 
found in terms of global network strength (females: 10.05 
vs. males: 9.47; S = 0.57, p = .71) or the distribution of edge 
weights in the network structure (M = 0.28, p = .12).

recruited from outpatient and inpatient units across mul-
tiple hospitals. Additionally, this study aimed to examine 
the  influence  of  gender  differences  on  the  relationship 
between  CM  and  IA,  providing  insights  into  gender-
specific  factors.  The  study  reveals  a  dense  network  of 
connections between CM and IA, with 44% of the edges 
showing non-zero weights, indicating a close interaction 
between the two. This dense interconnectivity highlights 
the complex and multifaceted interactions between vari-
ous aspects of CM and the symptoms of IA.

The  CM-IA  network  identifies  core  symptoms  includ-
ing  “Depress/moody/nervous  being  offline”  (IAT-20), 
“Request  an  extension  for  longer  time”  (IAT-16),  “Sleep 
loss due to late-night logines” (IAT-14), and “Preoccupa-
tion with the Internet” (IAT-15). These findings elaborate 
on  the  definition  of  IA  as  a  behavioral  disorder  where 
individuals  develop  an  excessive  reliance  on  and  lack  of 
control  over  internet  use,  leading  to  significant  impair-
ment in psychological, social, academic, or occupational 
functioning  [50].  Additionally,  our  findings  align  with 
previous network analysis studies on IA among Chinese 
adolescents,  particularly  in  highlighting  the  importance 
of symptoms like “Preoccupation with the Internet” and

Fig. 3  Network robustness and accuracy

“Request  an  extension  for  longer  time  spent  online”  as 
central  components  of  the  IA-depression  model  [51]. 
Previous  research  has  indicated  that  adolescents  with 
heightened IA tendencies often show signs of emotional 
abuse (EA) and a lack of emotional regulation, which can 
exacerbate  depressive  symptoms  and  internet  depen-
dency [51].

Previous  studies  have  reported  that  when  unable  to 
access the internet, adolescents may experience negative 
emotional reactions such as depression, anxiety, or irrita-
bility  [52,  53].  However,  these  emotional  reactions  were 
not  directly  assessed  in  the  current  study.  These  find-
ings suggest that the internet can serve as both an escape 
from  reality  and  a  tool  for  managing  emotions  in  cer-
tain  contexts  [54].  While  such  emotional  regulation  can 
be  beneficial  to  some  extent,  excessive  and  compulsive 
internet use can lead to delayed sleep and disrupted sleep 
cycles, worsening the individual’s real-life situation. Our 
study also highlights “Emotional Abuse” (EA) as another 
central symptom in the CM-IA model. Emotional abuse 
can have long-lasting effects on an individual’s ability to 
regulate  emotions  and  interpersonal  relationships  [55], 
undermine  their  basic  sense  of  safety  and  trust  [56,  57], 
and  increase  their  tendency  to  escape  reality  and  seek 
emotional fulfillment later in life [58]. This drives individ-
uals to use the internet as a coping mechanism to avoid 
the hardships and emotional pain of real life [59].

Previous  studies  on  preventing  problematic  internet 
use  have  indicated  that  emotional  abuse  (EA)  can  lead 
to  severe  psychological  issues,  including  depression  and 
anxiety     [60].  This  finding  supports  the  inclusion  of  EA 
as  a  central  symptom  in  the  CM-IA  model.  Given  these 
effects,  cognitive-behavioral  therapy  (CBT)  has  been 
shown to be effective in addressing emotional regulation 
challenges  caused  by  EA,  helping  individuals  develop 

healthier coping strategies and reducing their reliance on 
the internet.

In  our  integrative  network  model,  we  identified  three 
key  bridge  symptoms  that  link  IA  with  CM:  Sexual 
Abuse  (SA),  Emotional  Abuse  (EA),  and  “Others  com-
plain about your time” (IAT-5). Notably, there is a signifi-
cant  connection  between  “Emotional  Abuse”  (EA)  and 
“Others  complain  about  your  time”  (IAT-5).  Consistent 
with  the  findings  of  Taş  [61],  we  observed  a  correlation 
between  emotional  abuse  and  IA.  Furthermore,  a  study 
in South Korea by Kim et al. [62] indicated a positive cor-
relation between sexual abuse and IA (β = 0.20). As covert 
forms  of  CM,  sexual  and  emotional  abuse  can  often  be 
difficult  to  detect  and  may  persist  over  time,  leading  to 
a  relatively  high  incidence  rate  [63].  The  challenges  in 
identifying, defining, and legally substantiating emotional 
abuse increase the risk of children remaining in harmful 
environments  [64].  These  forms  of  abuse  have  a  lasting 
negative impact on children’s psychological development, 
manifesting  in  heightened  levels  of  depression,  anxiety, 
stress,  and  neuroticism  [65].  Particularly,  sexual  abuse 
profoundly affects children’s psychological state and can 
severely damage their self-esteem and identity [66]. Due 
to  these  psychological  impacts,  such  as  self-loathing, 
intense  dislike  for  one’s  body  and  emotions,  and  resul-
tant social isolation, victims may seek solace and escape 
in  the  virtual  world. The  relative  anonymity  and  control 
afforded  by  the  internet  provide  these  children  with  a 
means  to  distance  themselves  from  the  painful  experi-
ences of real life. In this space, children and adolescents 
may  find  the  support,  understanding,  and  acceptance 
they  lack,  temporarily  alleviating  their  inner  turmoil. 
However, prolonged internet use can evolve into a mech-
anism for escaping reality, ultimately leading to excessive 
dependence on the internet and the development of IA.

To  address  the  link  between  CM  and  IA,  comprehen-
sive  intervention  measures  should  include  cognitive-
behavioral  therapy  to  improve  emotional  regulation  and 
coping  strategies,  particularly  for  individuals  experienc-
ing  “Depress/moody/nervous  being  offline”  (IAT-20). 
Prior  research  has  demonstrated  cognitive-behavioral 
therapy (CBT) has been shown to be effective in address-
ing  addictive  behaviors  such  as  gaming  disorder  and 
unspecified internet use disorder, particularly by improv-
ing  emotional  regulation  and  coping  strategies     [67]. 
Given  that  adolescents  experiencing  withdrawal  from 
internet use often exhibit symptoms such as depression, 
anxiety,  or  irritability,  CBT  can  serve  as  an  appropriate 
intervention  to  mitigate  these  emotional  challenges  and 
prevent maladaptive coping behaviors.

Furthermore,  for  those  affected  by  “Emotional  Abuse” 
(EA)  and  “Sexual  Abuse”  (SA),  trauma-focused  therapy 
and  trauma-informed  care  (TIC)  should  be  provided  to 
help them process past traumatic experiences. This aligns 
with  our  findings,  which  show  a  significant  association 
between EA and IA symptoms. TIC aims to create a sup-
portive  environment  that  acknowledges  the  impact  of 
trauma,  reduces  re-traumatization,  and  promotes  emo-
tional  healing  [68,  69].  Since  EA  can  lead  to  emotional 
dysregulation and increase the risk of maladaptive coping 
mechanisms  like  excessive  internet  use,  TIC  can  foster 
resilience and promote healthier coping strategies. More-
over,  TIC  can  address  social  dysfunction  resulting  from 
emotional  abuse,  reducing  the  long-term  psychological 
impact of CM [70].

The  identification  of  “Emotional  Abuse”  and  “Sexual 
abuse”  as  key  bridge  symptoms  highlights  the  need  for 
targeted  interventions.  Emotional  dysregulation,  closely 
associated  with  IA,  suggests  that  cognitive-behavioral 
therapy  (CBT)  could  help  adolescents  develop  better 
emotional  regulation  skills,  while  trauma-focused  ther-
apy may reduce the influence of SA on IA development. 
Additionally,  establishing  supportive  social  networks, 
enhancing family communication, and educating individ-
uals on recognizing and expressing emotions are crucial 
strategies for reducing internet dependency.

This  multifaceted 

intervention  approach  aims  to 
address IA by targeting underlying factors, such as emo-
tional abuse, which has been linked to deficits in interper-
sonal  competence  and  an  increased  risk  of  maladaptive 
coping  mechanisms,  including  digital  game  addiction 
[61].  By  focusing  on  these  root  causes,  the  intervention 
seeks to improve emotional regulation, enhance interper-
sonal skills, and reduce problematic internet behaviors.

The lack of significant gender differences in the CM-IA 
network could be due to the similar  prevalence of emo-
tional  dysregulation  and  internet  use  patterns  among 
male  and  female  adolescents  in  this  sample.  Previous 
research  has  shown  that  both  genders  may  develop  IA 

as  a  coping  mechanism,  but  the  specific  symptoms  may 
vary  in  intensity  [71].  One  study  found  no  significant 
gender  differences  in  the  relationship  between  child-
hood  maltreatment  and  internet  addiction,  suggesting 
that this mechanism may have a similar impact on both 
genders [72]. Another study further showed that the total 
CTQ score and its subscale scores were positively corre-
lated  with  IAT  scores  for  both  males  and  females,  indi-
cating  consistency  in  this  relationship  [73].  Moreover, 
social  support  plays  a  crucial  role  in  influencing  coping 
mechanisms and reducing the risk of internet addiction. 
Research  has  shown  that  social  support  can  effectively 
alleviate  trauma-related  symptoms,  with  similar  effects 
for  both  genders  [74].  Therefore,  including  social  sup-
port as a key factor in prevention and intervention strate-
gies  may  benefit  all  adolescents.  Interventions  aimed  at 
enhancing  social  support  have  the  potential  to  be  effec-
tive  across  genders.  Additionally,  studying  how  social 
support influences the development of internet addiction 
could  provide  insights  for  creating  more  effective  inter-
vention strategies.

The limitations of this study warrant attention. Firstly, 
the  observed  network  structure  might  be  influenced  by 
the  specific  survey  tools  used,  and  different  assessment 
methods  could  yield  varying  results.  Secondly,  despite 
utilizing  self-report  tools  with  high  reliability  and  valid-
ity,  participant  responses  may  have  been  compromised 
by  recall  bias,  potentially  affecting  the  objectivity  of  the 
findings.  Furthermore,  while  we  used  the  Childhood 
Trauma  Questionnaire  (CTQ)  to  assess  childhood  mal-
treatment, it is important to note that the psychometric 
properties  of  the  CTQ  have  been  validated  among  Chi-
nese adolescents [75], which supports the reliability and 
validity of this tool in this population.

Furthermore, further research is needed to explore the 
specific  role  of  gender  in  the  relationship  between  CM 
and IA, particularly given the limitation of a small male 
sample  size.  Future  studies  should  increase  the  sample 
size and ensure gender balance for a more comprehensive 
understanding of these dynamics.

Moreover,  although  we  employed  bootstrapping  and 
predictability  metrics  to  assess  the  robustness  and  sta-
bility  of  our  network  model,  centrality  scores  may  vary 
across different samples or studies. Recent literature [76] 
has  highlighted  that  these  scores  may  not  always  accu-
rately  capture  the  true  influence  of  symptoms  within  a 
network, and the potential instability of centrality scores 
in complex networks may affect our conclusions regard-
ing  the  influence  of  certain  key  symptoms.  Therefore, 
while  centrality  analysis  provides  valuable  insights  into 
symptom  relationships,  these  results  should  be  inter-
preted  with  caution,  particularly  across  different  sample 
populations,  cultural  contexts,  or  clinical  conditions. 
To  address  this  issue,  future  research  should  explore 

Wang et al. BMC Psychiatry          (2024) 24:768 alternative  methods,  such  as  replicating  the  study  in 
diverse  populations  and  using  dynamic  models,  to  vali-
date and strengthen these findings. This will help estab-
lish  a  more  comprehensive  understanding  of  IA  and 
inform more effective prevention strategies.

Conclusion
These  findings  underscore  the  need  for  early  identifica-
tion  and  targeted  interventions  for  adolescents  exposed 
to childhood maltreatment. Schools and healthcare pro-
viders should implement screening programs to identify 
high-risk  individuals.  Additionally,  integrating  cogni-
tive-behavioral  interventions  and  trauma-informed  care 
within  mental  health  services  can  provide  adolescents 
with coping skills to reduce IA risk.
