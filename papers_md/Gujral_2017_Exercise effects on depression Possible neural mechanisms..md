Abstract

Depression is a syndrome of stress- and emotion-dysregulation, involving compromised structural 
integrity of frontal-limbic networks. Meta-analytic evidence indicates that volumetric reductions in 
the hippocampus, anterior cingulate cortex, prefrontal cortex, striatum, and amygdala, as well as 
compromised white matter integrity are frequently observed in depressed adults. Exercise has 
shown promise as an effective treatment for depression, but few studies have attempted to 
characterize or identify the neural mechanisms of these effects. In this review, we examined the 
overlap between structural brain abnormalities in depression and the effects of exercise on brain 
structure in adults, to highlight possible neural mechanisms that may mediate the positive effects 
of exercise on depressive symptoms. The prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, 
hippocampus, and corpus callosum emerged as structural neural markers that may serve as targets 
for exercise-based treatments for depression. These findings highlight the need for randomized 
exercise interventions to test these proposed neurobiological mechanisms of exercise on 
depression.

Introduction

Depression is a significant global public health concern; it is the leading cause of disability 
worldwide and is currently estimated to affect 350 million people (1). Depression is 
characterized by significant impairment in social and occupational functioning, and the 
majority of depressed individuals have recurrent episodes (~50%) (2) and/or chronic 
depression (~20%) (3). Exercise has recently shown promise as an effective non-

pharmaceutical treatment for depression (4). A recent Cochrane Review and meta-analysis 
of 35 randomized controlled trials (N= 1356) found that exercise was moderately effective at 
reducing depressive symptoms relative to a control condition in depressed adults 
(Standardized mean difference ((SMD) = −0.62 (95% CI: −0.81 to - 0.42)) (4). Subgroup 
analyses indicated that there was no evidence for a difference in the effectiveness of exercise 
relative to psychotherapy (7 trials) and pharmacotherapy (4 trials) in treating depression. A 
sensitivity analysis (8 studies, N = 377) suggested that exercise has a small long-term effect 
on depressive symptoms post-treatment (SMD −0.33, 95% CI −0.63 to −0.03). In sum, 
meta-analytic evidence suggests that exercise is a promising treatment for depression in 
adults, showing effects that are comparable to other first-line treatments for depression (4).

Despite the antidepressant effects of exercise, we have a limited understanding of the 
underlying neural mechanisms by which exercise alleviates depression. Converging evidence 
suggests that exercise and antidepressant medication may alleviate depression through 
common neuromolecular mechanisms (5, 6), including increased expression of neurotrophic 
factors (i.e., BDNF) (5, 6), increased availability of serotonin and norepinephrine (7), 
regulation of HPA-axis activity (8), and reduced systemic inflammatory signaling (9) (See 
(10) for Review). These processes influence the development of new neurons, increase 
synaptic connections between neurons, and increase cerebral vasculature (11, 12). 
Considering that exercise and antidepressant medication may exert effects on depression 
through overlapping molecular pathways, it is possible that they also influence overlapping 
neural systems. Antidepressant treatment may increase the volume of the hippocampus, 
anterior cingulate, and orbitofrontal cortex, increase white matter integrity, and induce 
changes in functional dynamics of frontal-limbic neural networks in depressed adults (13). 
While there have been few studies examining effects of exercise on neural systems in 
depressed individuals, we may predict that exercise leads to similar neural changes as 
antidepressant medication.

The goal of this review is to describe structural brain abnormalities in depression that may 
also be influenced by exercise. Much of the exercise literature we review is from studies of 
older adults, because the effects of exercise on brain structure have been most studied in the 
context of aging. We expect that this review may improve our understanding of the 
biological pathways involved in both the pathophysiology of depression and the anti-
depressant effects of exercise.

Study Selection

Literature search was conducted using PubMed, Google Scholar, and references from 
included studies and review articles from inception until September 2016. To search for 
meta-analyses examining structural abnormalities in depression, the following strategy was 
used: (“depress*”) AND (“MRI”) AND (“meta-analysis”) AND (“brain volume”) OR 
(“brain structure”) OR (“white matter”). To search for cross-sectional, longitudinal, and 
intervention studies examining exercise effects on brain structure, the following strategy was 
used: (“exercise” OR “PA” OR “CRF”) AND (“brain volume”) OR (“brain structure”) OR 
(“white matter”).

Eligibility of articles was determined by reviewing titles and abstracts. All included studies 
were published in English. The inclusion criteria for the depression literature were 1) meta-
analysis, 2) inclusion of clinically depressed patients (diagnosis of MDD), and 3) use of 
structural MRI data. The inclusion criteria for the exercise studies were 1) original studies 
(epidemiological, cross-sectional, and intervention studies), 2) use of structural MRI data, 3) 
evaluation of the effect of physical activity (PA), cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF), or exercise 
on regional volumetric assessments, and 4) gray matter volume in regions commonly linked 
with depression: hippocampus, anterior cingulate cortex, prefrontal cortex, striatum, and 
amygdala. Meta-analyses from the depression literature were not reviewed if they combined 
participants with depression and other psychiatric diagnoses (i.e., bipolar disorder) into one 
group. Articles from the exercise literature were excluded if they included patients with 
cognitive comorbidities (i.e., dementia).

Structural abnormalities in depression that may be influenced by exercise

Regional gray matter abnormalities have been have identified in acutely depressed adults 
relative to age-matched non-psychiatric control subjects in numerous meta-analytic studies 
(14–28); the most reliable regional abnormalities identified through structural MRI studies 
include the bilateral hippocampus, anterior cingulate cortex, regions within the prefrontal 
cortex, striatum, and amygdala. The literature of neuroimaging studies examining structural 
abnormalities in depression is vast and has been reviewed extensively; therefore, only meta-
analytic studies and reviews will be described here.

1.1  Hippocampus

The hippocampus is one of the most studied brain regions in the context of depression. The 
hippocampus plays an important role in stress regulation, as it exerts inhibitory control over 
HPA-axis activity, and is also more broadly involved in cognitive and affective processing 
via its widespread connections with other limbic and prefrontal regions (29). Reduced 
hippocampal volume has been consistently shown to be about 5% smaller in depression (15–
17, 19, 21–23, 25)}. Interestingly, these meta-analyses indicate that reductions in 
hippocampal volume are present throughout the lifespan (26), not explained by comorbid 
psychiatric comorbidities (19), and are not solely a consequence of medication-effects (25). 
A recent meta-analysis (N= 1728 depressed; N=7199 control subjects) (16) confirmed that 
depression was associated with smaller hippocampal volumes with larger reductions for 
those with an early age of onset (< 21 years). Given that early onset depression increases the 
risk for recurrent depressive episodes, it is possible that volumetric reductions in the 
hippocampus may persist even after remission and may increase vulnerability for further 
volumetric reductions during subsequent episodes.

There may be several factors that moderate the association between depression and 
hippocampal volume. For example, in the context of chronic stress dysregulation, lower 
hippocampal volume may represent a risk marker, rather than a consequence, of depression 
(15, 30, 31). However, some meta-analyses suggest that hippocampal differences exist only 
in the context of chronic or recurrent depression (16, 23), or among individuals experiencing 
their first depressive episode (15). This may indicate that the studies included in these meta-

analyses may represent different subgroups of depressed individuals that modify the effects 
of depression on hippocampal volume. For instance, variability in depression severity, age-
of-onset of the first depressive episode, Alzheimer’s disease pathology in older adults, or 
lifestyle factors (e.g., physical activity) may influence hippocampal volumetric reductions in 
depressed individuals. Nonetheless, reductions in hippocampal volume are a robust 
structural marker observed in depression.

1.2  Exercise effects on Hippocampal Volume

The association between fitness or exercise and hippocampal volume is a highly replicated 
finding (See Table 2). In cognitively and psychiatrically healthy older adults, Erickson et al. 
(32) found that higher CRF was associated with larger hippocampal volumes. CRF refers to 
an individual’s aerobic capacity, and is commonly used in this literature as a proxy for 
physical activity habits over a prolonged period of time (also see (33, 34). Another cross-
sectional study in older adults found that high levels of exercise engagement may mitigate 
the cumulative adverse effects of lifetime stress on hippocampal volume in late life (35). 
Unfortunately, studies examining these associations in mid-life and young adulthood are rare 
(36). Similar effects have been found longitudinally. For example, in one study, self-reported 
physical activity (PA), measured by how many blocks an individual walks on average per 
week were predictive of greater hippocampal volume nine years later (37).

Several randomized exercise interventions have detected increases in hippocampal volume 
(36, 37) or other markers of hippocampal morphology (38, 39) in healthy older adults. For 
instance, Erickson et al. (36) showed that 12-months of moderate intensity aerobic exercise 
(brisk walking) 3 times/week (N= 60) resulted in a ~2% increase in hippocampal volume 
(40). Regional specificity of these effects was also observed, such that volumetric increases 
were specific to the anterior hippocampus with little effect in the posterior region. The 
anterior region has been linked to emotional and motivational functioning (41) and 
neurogenesis (42). In addition, exercise-induced improvements in CRF (~7.8%) positively 
correlated with increases in hippocampal volume. These findings support the capacity for 
aerobic PA to induce volumetric increases in the hippocampus in older adults. Another 
intervention in younger adults (mean age= 33.7; SD= 11.9) using a cross-over design found 
that 6 weeks of aerobic training for 5 days a week, 30 minutes each day, was sufficient to 
increase hippocampal volume (43). They also found that hippocampal volume returned to 
baseline after 6 weeks of inactivity. These findings indicate that maintaining aerobic activity 
is important to retain exercise-induced volumetric changes.

Other randomized exercise trials have reported stability in hippocampal volume after 3- and 
6-month interventions, but increases in other markers of hippocampal morphology, such as 
cerebral blood volume and tissue density (38, 39). For instance, Maas et al. (38) examined 
the effects of a 3-month aerobic exercise intervention on cerebral blood volume and 
hippocampal volume in older adults (N= 40). They found that change in CRF (~10.4%) was 
related to change in cerebral blood volume (also see (44)). Similar to Erickson et al. (36), 
change in CRF was related to increased volume of the hippocampal head. These data point 
to vascular plasticity as a potential mechanism for exercise effects on hippocampal volume. 
Another randomized trial in older adults (N= 52) examined tissue density of the

hippocampus and reported that 6-months of aerobic exercise increased regional tissue 
density (39).

To date, one study has tested the effects of aerobic exercise on hippocampal morphology in 
depressed adults. In a 12-week randomized controlled trial (45), no changes were reported in 
hippocampal volume between the exercise group (N=41) and the active control group 
(N=38). However, these findings must be interpreted with caution due to poor exercise 
adherence (mean= 30%).

Collectively, evidence from randomized controlled trials examining exercise-effects on 
hippocampal volume is promising. Inconsistencies between types and duration of exercise 
preclude a clear understanding of the mechanisms underlying exercise-induced increases in 
hippocampal volume. Nonetheless, the current literature points to the promise of moderate-
intensity aerobic exercise as a non-pharmaceutical strategy to increase hippocampal volume.

2.1  Prefrontal Cortex/Anterior Cingulate Cortex

Meta-analytic reviews have documented volumetric reductions in several prefrontal cortical 
(PFC) regions in depressed individuals relative to healthy control subjects, namely in the 
anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) (17–20, 22, 24, 46), orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) (18, 19, 21, 
22), dorsolateral PFC (dlPFC) (17, 25), and dorsomedial PFC (dmPFC) (17, 24). The ACC 
is a medial prefrontal cortical structure. The dorsal ACC has been implicated in higher-level 
executive and motor functions, the subgenual ACC in emotional and interoceptive 
processing, and the pregenual ACC integrates cognitive and emotional information (47). The 
subgenual ACC is a key region implicated in depression (48). Several meta-analyses have 
found that volumetric reduction in the ACC is the largest effect size for any structural 
difference in depression (Cohen’s d = −0.77 p = 0.006) (18, 22).

Similar to results on the hippocampus, there have been inconsistencies regarding clinical 
moderators of volumetric reductions in the ACC. Medication may influence ACC volume 
(18), but see (25). Some evidence suggests that the effects may be most pronounced in the 
subgenual region of the ACC, which is important for affective processing (18, 49). Similar to 
findings of the hippocampus, abnormalities in the ACC may precede the onset of depression 
and may persist after remission from a depressive episode, suggesting that volume 
reductions in the ACC may represent a neurodevelopmental biomarker of risk for depression 
(49).

Volumetric reductions in other prefrontal regions have also been observed in depressed 
individuals relative to healthy controls. Reduced volume of the OFC, which is involved in 
emotion and reward processing, is consistently observed in depression. Several meta-
analyses reported volumetric reductions in the OFC (18, 19, 21, 22). Some evidence 
suggests volumetric reductions in the dlPFC and dmPFC may be linked to depression (17, 
24, 25). The dlPFC and dmPFC are both implicated in executive control, and are involved in 
monitoring performance and adjusting behavior, respectively (50). Volume reductions in 
dlPFC were reported in a meta-analysis of studies only including unmedicated depressed 
individuals, suggesting that these volume reductions are not an artifact of antidepressant 
treatment (25). Two meta-analyses of volumetric differences in individuals with late-life

depression relative to healthy controls also reported volumetric reductions in prefrontal 
regions, including the OFC, medial PFC, and subcallosal cingulate cortex (26) (27). In sum, 
converging evidence of reduced volume in several PFC regions suggests that structural 
abnormalities in the PFC may be a neural signature of depression.

2.2  Exercise Effects on PFC and ACC

Cross-sectional evidence supports a positive association between CRF, PA, and PFC volume 
(See Table 4). These regions include dorsal (51, 52), ventral (53), and lateral PFC (52, 54, 
55), as well as ACC (53–55). Several studies found evidence of a positive association 
between CRF and subgenual ACC volume (53, 55) as well as PFC volume even after 
accounting for age-related atrophy (51, 54, 55). At least one study found that higher CRF 
offsets age-related atrophy of the PFC (56). One longitudinal study (N= 75) found greater 
self-reported PA in midlife to be associated with greater PFC volume in late life (57). 
Greater self-reported PA also predicted greater PFC volume nine years later (37). These 
findings suggest potential long-term benefits of PA for PFC volume.

Two 6-month randomized controlled interventions found PA-related changes in PFC and 
ACC volume. Colcombe et al. (58) found that a 6-month brisk walking intervention resulted 
in increased volume of PFC and ACC. Another 6-month randomized trial (N= 62) also 
reported increases in PFC and ACC volume (59). Interestingly, they found that change in 
self-reported PA from pre- to post-intervention was positively associated with increased PFC 
and ACC volume. Findings from both studies suggest that increased PA for at least 6 months 
in older adults may lead to increases in PFC and ACC volume. Given that volumetric 
reductions in PFC and ACC constitute a central component of both depression and executive 
impairment, which typically co-occur in late-life depression (LLD), these results suggest 
that PA may modify neural abnormalities relevant for LLD.

3.1  Striatum

Volumetric reductions in the striatum in depression have been documented in several meta-
analytic studies (18, 21, 22, 46). The striatum is a subcortical structure consisting of the 
caudate and putamen subnuclei, as well as the nucleus accumbens, and is divided into 
functionally distinct regions involved in executive function, affective processing, motivation, 
and motor functions (60). Segments of the striatum are critically involved in affective and 
reward processing; however, neuroimaging studies examining volumetric reductions in the 
striatum in depression have not examined sub-regions within the striatum involved in mood 
and motivation.

Similar to other regions discussed in this review, there may be several moderators of 
volumetric abnormalities in the striatum. One meta-analysis suggested that volumetric 
reductions in the striatum may distinguish individuals with unipolar depression from those 
with bipolar disorder (22). Another found that age moderates striatal volume in depression, 
such that the reduction in volume is greater in late-life rather than mid-life (18). 
Interestingly, a meta-analysis examining structural abnormalities in un-medicated depressed 
individuals relative to healthy controls did not report striatal abnormalities (25). Evidence of 
volumetric reductions in the striatum in depression was not supported by recent whole-brain

meta-analyses. This may partially be explained by moderating effects of age and clinical 
factors described above.

3.2  Effects of PA and CRF on Striatum

PA and CRF associations with the striatum are limited, with only one cross-sectional report 
supporting a positive association. In healthy older adults, a link was observed between 
higher CRF levels and volume in the caudate (dorsal) and nucleus accumbens (ventral), but 
not the putamen (61). Given that the ventral striatum shows structural and functional 
alterations in depression and parts of the dorsal striatum are implicated in mood and 
motivation, these findings, suggest that CRF and PA may relate to volume of striatal nuclei 
that may have particular relevance to depression. One intervention study in older adults 
showing exercise-related increases in hippocampal volume found no effects of the 
intervention on caudate nucleus volume (36).

5.1  White Matter

Reduced microstructural integrity of white matter (FA) has been linked to depression in 
several meta-analyses, with inconsistencies regarding tract- or regional specificity of the 
effects (62–64). Two meta-analyses (62, 63) found reduced FA in the corpus callosum, one 
reported reduced FA in the left superior longitudinal fasiculus (62), and one reported 
widespread reductions in FA in the prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), as well as tracts connecting 
PFC regions to subcortical, temporal, parietal, and occipital regions in depression (63). One 
meta-analysis in LLD (N= 15) found lower FA in the uncinate fasiculus among depressed 
older adults, a tract that facilitates communication between inferior frontal (i.e., OFC) and 
limbic regions (i.e., amygdala, hippocampus) (65). These results suggest diffuse reductions 
in structural connectivity in depression.

5.2  Exercise Effects on White Matter Integrity

Twelve cross-sectional studies have examined the association between PA (N=3) or CRF 
(N=9) and FA in cognitively healthy adults. Eleven out of twelve studies found significant 
associations between PA or CRF and FA. The majority of these studies were in older adults 
(N= 11). Among studies in healthy older adults, CRF or PA was consistently associated with 
FA in the corpus callosum (N=4), the cingulum (N= 6), and superior longitudinal fasiculus 
(N=3) (SLF) (66–68). The corpus callosum is critical for interhemispheric communication, 
and the cingulum facilitates communication between sub-regions of the cingulate cortex, as 
well as between ACC and other limbic regions. Given the importance of the ACC in 
depression, associations between CRF and the cingulum may have profound implications for 
depressed individuals.

One cross-sectional study examined the association between CRF and FA in two samples of 
older adults (N= 113; N=154) (67). This study confirmed earlier findings of positive CRF 
associations with FA in the cingulum (68–72) and corpus callosum (72–74), and also 
showed CRF associations with FA in other WM tracts. Additionally, FA in regions within 
these WM tracts partially mediated the link between CRF and spatial working memory, an 
executive function that is often impaired in depressed individuals (75).

Three studies have examined CRF or PA associations with FA in younger samples (70, 74, 
76) (See Table 5). They found that CRF associations with FA in some tracts were similar 
across high fit older and younger adults, whereas CRF associations with FA in other tracts 
were only significant in older adults (74). Another study examined the association between 
PA and FA of projections from the hippocampus, and did not find a link between PA and FA. 
Key limitations within this literature include a large number of studies with small sample 
sizes, and some studies including samples having vascular conditions.

A longitudinal study examined the association between self-reported PA and global FA 3-
years later, in a sample of older adults (N=691)(77) and found that PA, but not leisure time 
activity, was associated with global FA after 3 years, after accounting for age, sex, IQ, and 
socioeconomic status. However, this effect did not remain after covarying for vascular 
disease burden (cardiovascular disease, stroke, and hypertension), pointing to the important 
role of vascular factors in WM integrity.

One randomized controlled trial in healthy older adults examined changes in FA after a 1-
year exercise intervention (78). There were no group differences observed in FA between the 
training groups. However, within the aerobic exercise group, change in CRF was positively 
associated with change in FA in the prefrontal and temporal lobes. Another 6-month trial 
compared the effects of an aerobic exercise intervention (cycling) on FA in healthy young 
adults and individuals with schizophrenia. They found that regardless of psychiatric 
diagnosis, the aerobic exercise intervention increased FA in the corpus callosum, SLF, and 
corticospinal tract (79).

This review was limited to exercise effects on white matter microstructure due to its overlap 
with the meta-analytic literature in depression-related white matter abnormalities. However, 
evidence also suggests exercise may lead to macro-structural changes in white matter, 
including reductions in white matter lesions and increases in white matter volume (See (80) 
for a detailed review). For instance, results from the Look – AHEAD trial suggests that a 10-
year lifestyle intervention involving physical activity prevents the development of white 
matter lesions in adults with Type II diabetes, which often clusters with depressive 
symptoms (81). Further, given the high prevalence of white matter lesions in LLD, this may 
be an important mechanism through which exercise may influence depression in late-life 
(82).

Discussion

Meta-analyses of depressed adults have identified volumetric reductions in the hippocampus, 
ACC, PFC, striatum, and reduced microstructural integrity of white matter in the rostral 
corpus callosum and inferior parietal segments of the SLF (See Table 4). In contrast, higher 
CRF and PA have been linked to greater gray matter volume in the hippocampus, PFC, and 
ACC in cross-sectional and longitudinal studies in healthy adults. Experimental evidence 
from randomized trials also supports exercise-induced increases in hippocampal, PFC, and 
ACC volume. Yet, not all regions implicated in depression appear to be positively affected 
by PA (i.e., striatum). White matter structure may also be affected by CRF and PA in the

corpus callosum and the cingulum, although the paucity of intervention studies and 
heterogeneity of study designs prevent firm conclusions.

Broader Implications

This review identified several regions that show consistent volumetric reductions in 
depression. Yet, many of these regions also show structural plasticity in response to exercise 
or in relation to higher levels of fitness. These regions include the hippocampus, ACC, and 
the PFC (See Figure 1). We speculate that it is partially through these neural volumetric 
pathways that exercise exerts its anti-depressant effects. Specific mechanisms by which 
exercise leads to these regional volumetric changes are still uncertain, but could include a 
number of downstream effects of exercise on cell proliferation, creation of new vasculature, 
expression of neurotransmitters, and changes in HPA-axis activity (83, 84). As we have seen, 
exercise and antidepressant medication not only trigger similar neuromolecular changes, but 
also have overlapping regional effects on brain structure (13). This overlap supports the 
possibility that volumetric increases in these regions mediate exercise-related reductions in 
depression (See Figure 1).

Exercise may also influence white matter connectivity. The most consistent exercise 
associations have been shown in the genu and body of the corpus callosum, suggesting that 
exercise may broadly improve deficits in interhemispheric communication (See Figure 1). 
Further, exercise has been associated with improved integrity of the cingulum, a key tract 
involved in ACC-hippocampal communication (See Figure 1).

Given that the majority of evidence of exercise on brain structure is based on older adults, 
these effects may be particularly relevant for the treatment of LLD. Exercise may be a 
particularly favorable treatment for depressed older adults because its neural benefits may be 
heightened in this population undergoing age-related atrophy that is exacerbated by LLD-
related neuropathology (i.e. white matter lesions). Specifically exercise may reduce atrophy, 
reduce white matter lesion burden, and improve cognitive function in those with LLD. 
Moreover, there is a greater need for non-pharmaceutical treatments for depression in late-
life, due to limited efficacy of pharmaceutical treatments in this population. Finally, older 
adults, among other populations, tend to be less physically fit, and thus may show greater 
changes in fitness after starting to exercise. These potentially robust changes in fitness may 
translate to greater neural benefits.

Depressed individuals are often less active, suggesting that incentives or motivational factors 
for initiating and maintaining exercise must be considered (i.e., structured programs in 
groups). Also, depressed individuals may perceive enrolling in a psychotherapy treatment 
trial that may be augmented with exercise as more feasible and rewarding than initiating an 
independent exercise program. A recent meta-analysis examining moderators of the 
antidepressant effects of exercise found that various constellations of biological, clinical, 
psychological, and social factors can influence exercise effects on depression, including the 
presence of somatic symptoms, comorbid anxiety, self-esteem, social support, as well as 
circulating levels of neurotrophic factors (BDNF) and inflammatory markers (TNFα) (85). 
Specifically, BDNF may be a key mediator of exercise effects on structural brain markers of 
depression, given its role in both the etiology of depression and exercise-induced increases

in hippocampal volume (11, 12).” Animal studies support the hypothesis that exercise 
relieves depressive symptoms by acting through BDNF pathways, although this has yet to be 
fully tested (5, 6).

Limitations

Several limitations should be considered here. Most importantly, the studies examining 
associations between exercise and regional gray matter volume and white matter integrity 
were not tested in depressed individuals. Therefore, they do not provide direct evidence of a 
mechanism, but suggest possible mechanisms through which exercise alleviates depression. 
Another notable limitation is the exclusion of studies examining brain function. We chose 
here to focus on volumetric and morphology studies because there is little overlap in the 
functional neuroimaging paradigms used in the depression and exercise literatures. 
Additionally, the number of studies and age groups examined differs greatly between the 
exercise and depression literatures. The exercise neuroimaging literature also includes a 
limited number of randomized interventions, precluding definitive conclusions about 
exercise-induced changes in brain structure. Finally, given that depression is a heterogeneous 
syndrome linked to several etiological factors that may influence these brain abnormalities, 
it remains unclear the extent to which these abnormalities would improve with various 
treatments, including exercise.

Future Directions and clinical implications

This review highlights a need to test whether changes to brain structure mediate the 
antidepressant properties of exercise, and the extent to which these effects may be age-
dependent. Further, moderators should also be explored, such as genetic factors, 
environmental stress, medical illness burden, antidepressant medication use, and severity and 
duration of depressive episodes. Also, given emerging evidence that structural brain 
abnormalities may serve as a biomarker of risk (86–88), PA may have important clinical and 
neuroprotective effects on the risk for depression (89). In fact, individuals at risk for 
depression may prefer lifestyle modification to taking medication or psychotherapy. 
Therefore, future preventive interventions could explore neural mechanisms underlying the 
effects of PA on risk for depression. Finally, this field would benefit from a multi-level 
characterization of exercise on depression, cutting across molecular pathways, neural 
systems, and clinical symptoms in depressed individuals.

Conclusion

Exercise is a viable non-pharmaceutical treatment for depression. The benefits of exercise 
may also persist beyond the end of treatment, unlike antidepressant medication (4, 90). It is 
critical for future studies to test whether the brain regions identified in this review may be 
neurobiological markers of depression that may serve as targets for exercise-based 
treatments for depression.
