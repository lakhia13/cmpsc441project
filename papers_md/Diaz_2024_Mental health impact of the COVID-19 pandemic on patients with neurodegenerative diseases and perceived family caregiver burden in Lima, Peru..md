Abstract

Background: Neurodegenerative diseases lead to difficulties with functional activities.

In Peru, most caregivers are family members. Little is known about the COVID-19

pandemic’s effect on caregivers in Peru.

Methods: This was a cross-sectional, prospective study of family caregivers of depen-

dent patients with dementia or Parkinson’s Disease in Lima, Peru. A caregiver burden

and mental health questionnaire was administered to the caregiver.
Results: We enrolled 48 caregivers (65% females, mean ± SD age 49.0 ± 12.3 years);

70% of patients had dementia. Nearly 40% of caregivers reported having full-time jobs,

and 82% felt overwhelmed with almost 75% dedicating more time to caregiving dur-

ing the pandemic. Caregivers perceived patients felt lonelier (52%), had an increase in

hallucinations (50%), or forgetfulness (71%) compared to pre-pandemic.

Conclusions: Our study highlights that perceived caregiver burden and patient behav-

ioral symptoms may have been exacerbated during the pandemic. In countries such as

Peru, more caregiving resources and interventions are needed.

Patients with neurodegenerative diseases, including PD or demen-

tia, have higher mortality and morbidity after COVID-19 infection (Hua

et al., 2022; Kim et al., 2022), which may increase the responsibility

felt by the patient’s caregiver to prevent COVID-19 transmission to the

patient. Moreover, cognitive impairment among patients with demen-

tia and physical limitations experienced by many patients with PD can

impede the ability to comply with COVID-19 safety measures, increas-

ing the burden felt by caregivers, seen in prior studies (Budnick et al.,

2021; Otobe et al., 2022). Our study found that many patients were

mandatory mask-wearing in Peru, likely exacerbating the perceived

caregiver burden. Other factors such as unfamiliar environments and

social isolation may exacerbate aggression or agitation, hallucinations

or delusions, cognitive impairment, or depressive symptoms experi-

enced by the patient (Azevedo et al., 2021; Mukherjee et al., 2022),

as was seen in our study with most patients having an exacerbation of

and one of the few in Latin America.

Future studies may determine participants who did not find the pan-

demic to be a difficult period the reasons for this through in-depth

interviewing in order to determine which factors may lead to caregiver

resiliency. Determinining the extent of economic loss due to caregiv-

ing is crucial for future studies. By examining the impact of COVID-19

on Peruvians with neurodegenerative disease and their caregivers,

this study has identified targets for the Ministry of Health and other

organizations to improve mental health and community resources for

caregivers of patients with neurodegenerative diseases, particularly

during challenging times such as in the COVID-19 pandemic. More-

over, our findings may serve to help develop targeted interventions and

support systems for caregivers in Peru and throughout many LMICs.
