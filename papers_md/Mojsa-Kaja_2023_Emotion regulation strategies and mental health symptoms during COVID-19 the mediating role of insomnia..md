Abstract
Objectives: COVID-19 has become a major source of stress for people around the world. Stressful life events play a role in the pathogenesis of 
sleep disorders such as insomnia which is considered a risk factor for anxiety and depression. Emotion regulation is an important factor linked 
with sleep and mental health problems. Therefore, the main goal of the present study was to examine whether insomnia could constitute a media-
tion mechanism that explains the relationship between emotion regulation strategies (rumination, reappraisal, suppression) and stress-induced 
mental health outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic. Material and Methods: The cross-sectional study was conducted among young (M±SD 
24.8±2.24) individuals (N = 281, 85.4% women) during the time of the third wave of infections in Poland. Data were collected by means of self-
report questionnaires, including the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire; Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire; Athens Insomnia Scale; Depres-
sion, Anxiety and Stress Scale. The direct and indirect effects of emotion regulation strategies on depression, anxiety, and stress were calculated using 
a bootstrap estimation technique. Results: All analyzed indirect effects were significant. The results show that insomnia mediates the relationships 
between all 3 emotion regulation strategies and stress, anxiety and depression. Conclusions: The presented results shed the light on the role of in-
somnia on the relationships between emotion regulation strategies and emotional states experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, 
the present study suggests that educational and therapeutic interventions aimed at improving emotion regulation might be useful for improving 
symptoms of insomnia and, through it, symptoms of affective disorders. Int J Occup Med Environ Health. 2023;36(1):151 – 59

INTRODUCTION
The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) disease began threaten-
ing the health of millions of people worldwide, starting in 
late 2019 and quickly spreading. To prevent the contagion 
and limit the outbreak, governments and public health sys-
tems adopted extraordinary measures that disrupted daily 
life.  These  preventive  regulations  included  travel  restric-

tions, closure of schools, public institutions and businesses, 
home quarantine, social distance, and even social isolation. 
Therefore,  not  only  the  coronavirus  itself  but  also  social 
and economic consequences of widely implemented pre-
vention measures altered the psychological well-being and 
caused stress for millions of people [1]. This unprecedent-
ed situation caused by the COVID-19 pandemic proved to

be related with increased risk of mental health problems 
related with stress such as depression and anxiety [2].
Life stressors play a role in the pathogenesis of sleep dis-
turbances.  During  times  of  stress,  existing  sleep  prob-
lems may increase and new ones may emerge. It is thus 
not  surprising  that  a  growing  number  of  studies  shows 
escalation  of  sleep  problems  and  places  them  among 
common  negative  consequences  of  the  COVID-19  pan-
demic  [3].  Of  particular  concern  is  insomnia  which  is 
both a common symptom of and risk factor for a range 
of psychiatric disorders including anxiety and mood dis-
orders [4]. Thus, although the relationship between sleep 
problems and mood disorders is complex and likely bi-di-
rectional, at least to some extent sleep problems precede 
depression [4]. It also has been suggested that treating in-
somnia might alleviate many of the mental health prob-
lems,  and  furthermore,  addressing  sleep  disturbances 
at their earliest stages might in fact prevent the onset of 
some of the clinical mental health disorders [5].

The role of emotion regulation in anxiety, 
depression, and stress
Emotion regulation is an ability to monitor and modify 
emotional  reactions  towards  goals  of  greater  well-being 
(making  ourselves  feel  better)  or  instrumental  goals 
(doing better on a task at hand). Emotion regulation en-
ables people to adjust the intensity, timing, and the way 
emotions  are  experienced  and  expressed  [6].  Success-
ful emotion regulation requires understanding potential 
consequences of emotions, as well as knowledge of strate-
gies to effectively influence the course of emotions. This 
ability to regulate emotions is vital to mental well-being 
and effective social functioning.
The  most  widely  studied  emotion  regulation  strate-
gies  are  cognitive  reappraisal,  suppression  and  rumi-
nation  [6].  Cognitive  reappraisal  involves  reevaluating 
an emotional event in order to modify its impact. Using 
cognitive reappraisal means changing the way one thinks 

about  potentially  emotion-eliciting  events,  such  as  fo-
cusing  on  potentially  positive  aspects  of  difficult  events 
or considering what one can learn in a challenging situ-
ation.  Reappraisal  is  generally  considered  an  effective 
strategy to reduce negative emotions related to stressful 
events [7]. Because the subjective experience of stress de-
pends on appraisal of the triggering situation, reappraisal 
has  the  ability  to  change  the  psychological  meaning  of 
the situation and consequently whether it is experienced 
as stressful and threatening or it is considered a challenge 
one can adequately address. While cognitive reappraisal 
ability does not predict depressive symptoms at low levels 
of  stress,  at  high  levels  of  exposure  to  stressors  cogni-
tive reappraisal ability becomes a significant predictor of 
depressive symptoms [8]. Similar effect has been found 
during  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  with  reappraisal  pre-
dicting lower anxiety at high, but not low levels of per-
ceived stress [9].
In  contrast,  suppression  refers  to  attempts  to  minimize 
visible signs of an emotion (e.g., facial expressions). Sup-
pression is largely maladaptive and tends to result in in-
creased or prolonged negative emotions [7]. Individuals 
diagnosed with depression or anxiety disorder endorsed 
more frequent use expressive suppression as compared to 
never-disordered controls [10].
Finally,  rumination  refers  to  a  cognitive  process  in 
which individuals perseverate on their mood and related 
thoughts,  causes,  and  potential  consequences.  Rumina-
tion has been linked to increases in symptoms of several 
mental  health  disorders,  including  anxiety  and  depres-
sion [11].
Difficulties  in  regulating  negative  emotions  have  been 
closely tied to psychopathology. Problems with employ-
ing  cognitive  reappraisal  and  eliminating  rumination 
or  expressive  suppression  are  considered  to  be  a  core 
mechanism  in  the  maintenance  of  psychopathology  in 
anxiety and mood disorders [10]. Supporting this, inter-
ventions that teach the use of cognitive reappraisal show

improvements  in  subjective  experience  of  stress  (meta-
analysis: [12]), as well as depressive symptoms [13]. Simi-
larly, cognitive behavioral therapy builds an ability to re-
appraise threat in people with primary anxiety disorders 
(including panic, generalized anxiety disorder, and social 
anxiety disorder [14]).

Emotion regulation and insomnia
From the clinical perspective, inability to regulate emo-
tions is a diagnostic feature of many mood disorders [7] 
which show strong comorbidity with disturbed sleep [4]. 
There has been a growing body of evidence suggesting that 
emotion regulation is an important factor that could help 
explain the link between sleep and mental health prob-
lems [15]. The relationship between difficulties in emo-
tion regulation and sleep problems is a vicious circle in 
which sleep deficit influences emotion regulation and def-
icits in emotion regulation impact sleep and create a risk 
of insomnia [16]. Those suffering from insomnia have dif-
ficulties in emotion regulation and such difficulties pre-
dict incidence of insomnia and its persistence [17].
International  research  projects  on 
impact  of 
COVID-19 outbreak on quality of life showed increased 
levels  of 
emotion  regulation  problems  and  higher 
stress [18]. In South Korea, >20% of participants reported 
depressive symptoms and sleep problems and nearly 30% 
of participants experienced anxiety disorders [19]. Sleep 
problems were associated with anxiety and stress among 
individuals who self-isolated during the pandemic [20]. 
In  Europe,  participants  also  reported  elevated  levels  of 
psychological  distress  during  the  pandemic  [21],  and 
those with higher levels of depression and anxiety symp-
toms reported lower sleep quality during the initial weeks 
of lockdown [22].
The authors of the present study hypothesize that insom-
nia  explains  associations  between  the  use  of  different 
emotion  regulation  strategies  and  symptoms  of  stress, 
depression and anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

the 

Given  the  fact  that  younger  age  predicted  both  greater 
frequency and severity of sleep problems [3], as well as 
the negative psychological impact of the COVID-19 pan-
demic  [2],  the  authors  focus  on  this  population  during 
the third wave of the pandemic.

MATERIAL AND METHODS
Participants and procedure
An anonymous online questionnaire was distributed via 
a  mailing  list  and  social  media  posts;  also,  participants 
were asked to share the link with other adult  individuals. 
Data  was  gathered  between  late  March  and  April  2021 
(third  wave  of  infections).  There  were  281  respon-
dents (85.4% women; age: M±SD 24.8±2.24) in Poland. 
The study was performed in accordance with the Declara-
tion of Helsinki. The participants were provided with in-
formation about the aim of the study, provided their writ-
ten  informed  consent  to  participate  and  were  informed 
about the possibility of withdrawing from the study at any 
stage.
The calculation of the sample size was based on the fol-
lowing  assumptions:  a  95%  (0.95)  confidence  level  and 
a fraction size of 0.5 with a maximum estimation error 
of 6%.

Measures
Emotion regulation strategies were measured with Emo-
tion  Regulation  Questionnaire  [6]  and  the  rumination 
subscale  from  the  Cognitive  Emotion  Regulation  Ques-
tionnaire [23].
Emotion Regulation Questionnaire includes 10 items rated 
on a 7-point scale (“strongly disagree” to “strongly agree”). 
Six items measured reappraisal (α = 0.83, e.g., “I control 
my emotions by changing the way I think about the sit-
uation  I’m  in”)  and  4  assessed  suppression  (α  =  0.78, 
e.g., “I control my emotions by not expressing them”).
The 4-item rumination subscale from the Cognitive Emo-
tion Regulation Questionnaire [23] was rated on a 5-point

scale (e.g. “I am preoccupied with what I think and feel 
about what I have experienced”; “almost never” to “almost 
always”; α =0.79).
Insomnia  was  measured  by  the  8-item  Athens  Insom-
nia Scale [24], which measures the severity of insomnia 
based  on  the  ICD-10  criteria  (e.g.,  “awakenings  during 
the night”; α = 0.82). Items are rated on a 4-point scale 
(“no problem at all”’ to “very serious problem”).
Mental health symptoms were assessed with the 21-item 
Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale [25]. Three 7-item sub-
scales measure symptoms of depression (α = 0.89), anxiety 
(α = 0.87), and perceived stress (α = 0.86). Participants re-
sponded using a 4-point scale (“did not apply to me at all” 
to “applied to me very much, or most of the time”).

RESULTS
Data were analyzed using SPSS v. 26 and AMOS v. 26.
Table 1 shows descriptive statistics and intercorrelations 
among study variables.
Most participants reported elevated symptoms of depres-
sion,  anxiety,  and  stress  (Table  2).  Staggering  77.2%  of 
participants reported above normal depression symptoms, 
71.2%  reported  above  normal  anxiety  symptoms,  and 
75.5%  reported  above  normal  stress.  Moreover,   between 
1  in  4  and  1  in  5  participants  experienced  severe  or  ex-

tremely severe levels of depression (25.6%), anxiety (34.9%) 
and stress (19.2%) during the third wave of the COVID-19 
pandemic. Similarly, 63.7% reported some insomnia, with 
4.3% experiencing severe insomnia.
Emotion  regulation  strategies  were  correlated  with  in-
somnia and negative emotional states. Specifically, cogni-
tive reappraisal correlated with fewer insomnia symptoms 
(r = –0.22, p < 0.001), while suppression and rumination 
correlated with more insomnia symptoms (r = 0.18 and 
0.37, p < 0.001, respectively). Additionally, insomnia cor-
related  with  depression,  anxiety,  and  stress  (0.55–0.59, 
p < 0.001).
Relevant tests were carried out to examine the probable 
existence  of  multicollinearity.  The  degree  of  multicol-
linearity of the study variables was found to be acceptable, 
with  all  tolerance  values  shown  to  be  higher  than  0.81, 
and the  VIF values lower than 1.25.
The significant correlations between emotion regulation 
strategies,  insomnia,  depression,  anxiety,  and  stress  en-
abled the following mediation models to be tested:
 – the  mediating  role  of  insomnia  on  associations  be-
tween  each  emotion  regulation  strategy  and  depres-
sion;

 – the  mediating  role  of  insomnia  on  associations  be-
tween each emotion regulation strategy and anxiety;

DISCUSSION
The  present  study  assessed  the  use  of  emotion  regula-
tion  strategies,  insomnia  symptoms,  and  symptoms  of 
depression,  anxiety  and  stress  during  the  third  wave  of 
the  COVID-19  pandemic.  Results  showed  that  the  fre-
quency with which 3 major emotion regulation strategies 
are used predicts COVID-related depression, anxiety, and 
stress in part through their effect on insomnia symptoms. 
While cognitive reappraisal is related to lower insomnia 
and mental health symptoms, suppression and rumina-
tion  are  related  to  higher  insomnia  and  mental  health 
symptoms.
Although  the  mean  levels  of  depression,  anxiety  and 
stress  are  similar  to  levels  shown  in  previous  research 
conducted in Poland during the first wave of COVID-19 
pandemic  [27],  there  was  a  higher  number  of  partici-
pants  reporting  severe  levels  of  depression  and  anxiety 
in this study. One possible explanation may be that the 
sample was composed mainly of young adults, who are 
more vulnerable to negative mental health consequences 
of the pandemic [2]. The other explanation may, to some 
extent, stem from the differences in value of the cut-off 
points which differs between studies using the DASS-21 
questionnaire.
The COVID-19 pandemic is a major stressor, with some 
scholars  arguing  that  it  can  constitute  a  source  of  trau-

matic stress [28]. It is thus not surprising that it resulted 
in increases in depression and anxiety [2] and insomnia 
disorder  [3].  However,  not  everyone  is  equally  affected. 
The current results are congruent with previous findings, 
which  indicated  that  maladaptive  emotion  regulation 
strategies  are  associated  with  individual  differences  in 
the frequency of use of emotion regulation strategies and 
may be triggered by life stressors.
Those  sensitive  to  stress-related  sleep  disruption  are 
more likely to develop chronic insomnia and as a conse-
quence depression and anxiety. The present study shows 
that emotion regulation in times of exposure to stressful 
circumstances plays a significant role in the occurrence 
of sleep problems. Although emotion regulation is an in-
herent  part  of  emotion,  there  are  individual  differences 
in the ability to judge potential effectiveness of different 
emotion regulation strategies, as well as in the frequency 
with which people use strategies that tend to be more or 
less  adaptive  [7].  Those  who  tend  to  use  more  effective 
emotion regulation strategies will be more successful in 
influencing the course of their emotional experiences and 
bring themselves into states that are conducive to sleep. 
By contrast, those who do not tend to use effective emo-
tion regulation strategies will be more likely to have diffi-
culty sleeping, which continues depletion associated with 
mental health problems.
This  study  has  theoretical  and  practical  implications. 
Theoretically,  the  authors  documented  one  mechanism 
that  contributes  to  insomnia  and  mental  health  symp-
toms  –  use  of  ineffective  emotion  regulation  strategies. 
Prior  research  has  shown  that  emotion  regulation  (and 
failures  thereof)  plays  a  role  in  psychopathology  [11]. 
Independently, research has shown that there are physi-
ological and emotional conditions that contribute to sleep 
quality  [29].  Here,  the  authors’  connected  3  variables  – 
ineffective  emotion  regulation  strategies  predict  insom-
nia,  which  in  turn  predicts  higher  depression,  anxiety, 
and stress symptoms.

Practically,  this  research  has  implications  for  treating 
insomnia.  Despite  the  fact  that  sleep  improvement  by 
the way of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for insom-
nia  is  associated  with  decreases  in  anxiety  and  depres-
sion,  emotion  regulation  was  not  studied  in  examining 
effectiveness of CBT on insomnia [30]. One mechanism 
through  which  CBT  affects  mental  health  outcomes  is 
through better emotion regulation. For instance, decrease 
in symptoms of anxiety disorders after treatment in natu-
ral settings is mediated by improvements in emotion reg-
ulation [31]. The present study suggests that educational 
and therapeutic interventions aimed at improving emo-
tion  regulation  hold  promise  for  improving  symptoms 
of insomnia and, through it, symptoms of affective dis-
orders.
The present study has several limitations. First, the sample 
is  one  of  convenience.  This  was  necessary  because  of 
the  goal  to  collect  data  during  a  peak  of  the  pandemic. 
Also,  the  data  is  correlational  in  nature.  Although  the 
authors  are  arguing  that  the  use  of  emotion  regulation 
strategies precedes insomnia, all variables were assessed 
at the same time and causal claims cannot be made with-
out additional research that would assess target variables 
at  multiple  times.  Future  research  should  assess  mental 
health symptoms at baseline, as well as at later times, and 
control for baseline symptoms when examining the role 
of emotion regulation strategies in times of high exposure 
to stressors. Similarly, experience sampling studies where 
emotions  and  regulation  strategies  are  assessed  close  to 
sleep  time  would  enable  drawing  more  specific  conclu-
sions about the mechanism of influence.
Finally,  there  is  a  substantial  body  of  pre-pandemic  re-
search  analyzing  the  links  between  emotion  regulation 
strategies,  insomnia  and  mental  health  problems  [30]. 
This research shows that participants who reported great-
er  sleep  problems  were  more  likely  to  meet  criteria  for 
a mood or anxiety disorder and generally reported poorer 
emotion regulation strategy use [32]. Thus, the examined 

associations  between  these  constructs  may  be  observed 
in general, regardless of the COVID-19 outbreak, and fur-
ther longitudinal research is needed to address the con-
textual role of the pandemic.
On the other hand, a growing body of research suggests 
that  COVID-19  pandemic  was  a  significant  source  of 
stress [33] and demonstrates that the prevalence rate and 
intensity  of  insomnia,  depression  and  anxiety  were  sig-
nificantly higher during the pandemic [34].

CONCLUSIONS
The results suggest that during the pandemic, individual 
differences in regulation strategy use may contribute to 
symptoms of insomnia, which in turn exacerbates mental 
health problems. Better understanding of the role of emo-
tion regulation strategies and insomnia in the emergence 
of  mental  health  symptoms  during  the  COVID-19  pan-
demic  could  inform  educational  and  therapeutic  inter-
ventions. The conclusions stemming from present study 
may  also  be  helpful  in  possible  additional  pandemic 
waves.
