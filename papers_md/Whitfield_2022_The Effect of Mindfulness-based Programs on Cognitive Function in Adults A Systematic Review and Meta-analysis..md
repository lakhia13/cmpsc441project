Abstract
Mindfulness-based programs (MBPs) are increasingly utilized to improve mental health. Interest in the putative effects of 
MBPs on cognitive function is also growing. This is the first meta-analysis of objective cognitive outcomes across multiple 
domains from randomized MBP studies of adults. Seven databases were systematically searched to January 2020. Fifty-six 
unique studies (n = 2,931) were included, of which 45 (n = 2,238) were synthesized using robust variance estimation meta-
analysis. Meta-regression and subgroup analyses evaluated moderators. Pooling data across cognitive domains, the sum-
mary effect size for all studies favored MBPs over comparators and was small in magnitude (g = 0.15; [0.05, 0.24]). Across 
subgroup analyses of individual cognitive domains/subdomains, MBPs outperformed comparators for executive function 
(g = 0.15; [0.02, 0.27]) and working memory outcomes (g = 0.23; [0.11, 0.36]) only. Subgroup analyses identified significant 
effects for studies of non-clinical samples, as well as for adults aged over 60. Across all studies, MBPs outperformed inactive, 
but not active comparators. Limitations include the primarily unclear within-study risk of bias (only a minority of studies 
were considered low risk), and that statistical constraints rendered some p-values unreliable. Together, results partially cor-
roborate the hypothesized link between mindfulness practices and cognitive performance. This review was registered with 
PROSPERO [CRD42018100904].

Introduction

Mindfulness-based  programs  (MBPs)  primarily  target 
improved mental health and wellbeing (de Vibe et al., 2017). 
Notably, MBPs not only support the development of emo-
tional, but also attentional self-regulation (Lutz et al., 2008). 
Indeed,  mindfulness  can  be  broadly  defined  as  ‘paying 
attention to the present moment’ (Kabat-Zinn, 2003). The

importance of attention in mindfulness practice and theory 
has been formally described by neurocognitive frameworks. 
In  order  to  delineate  relevant  mechanisms,  frameworks 
deconvolve mindfulness into component parts. In addition 
to attention regulation, these include intention and motiva-
tion, emotion regulation, extinction and reconsolidation of 
maladaptive behavior, changes in perspectives on self, and 
interoception (Shapiro et al., 2006). The theorized relation-
ship of these components to specific neurocognitive systems 
has been outlined in detail (Hölzel et al., 2011; Lutz et al., 
2015; Vago & Silbersweig, 2012). The implication of this 
is that development of greater mindfulness capacity may 
manifest in parallel with improved cognitive function.

The primary element included in MBPs to support the 
development of greater mindfulness capacity is the teach-
ing of formal practices, namely: the body scan, mindful

movement and sitting meditation (Crane et al., 2017). Whilst 
each of these practices may contribute to improved cognitive 
function, the vast majority of theory focuses exclusively on 
sitting meditation. The types of sitting meditation typically 
included in MBPs are predominantly focused attention and 
open monitoring practices. Focused attention meditation 
involves focusing on an ‘object’ (e.g. breathing-related sen-
sations), whilst open monitoring meditation is characterized 
by the receptive monitoring of experience. Both types of 
meditation require practitioners to disengage from distrac-
tors (e.g. mind wandering) which interfere with the intended 
foci, and can thus be considered practices of attentional self-
regulation (Lutz et al., 2008). Based on this understanding, 
a considerable number of studies have evaluated if and how 
participation in MBPs translates to improved performance 
on objective measures of cognitive function.

A seminal systematic review in this field (Chiesa et al., 
2011) concluded that the preliminary evidence suggested 
mindfulness  training  improves  attention.  In  contrast,  a 
review of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) and 
mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) – two of the 
most widely employed MBPs – found no effect on atten-
tion but did report improvements in working memory (Lao 
et al., 2016). Most recently, Cásedas et al. (2020) conducted 
a meta-analysis focusing exclusively on executive function 
outcomes from randomized mindfulness meditation stud-
ies, concluding that mindfulness meditation outperformed 
comparators (g = 0.34). Subdomains of executive function 
were also examined; MBPs outperformed comparators on 
working memory (g = 0.42) and inhibitory control outcomes 
(g = 0.42), but not for cognitive flexibility. While Cásedas 
et al. (2020) undertook the first quantitative synthesis in 
the field, important questions remain. Cognitive domains 
beyond executive function were not evaluated, and there 
was considerable variability in the age and clinical status of 
study samples. Meditation interventions were also highly 
variable – the briefest intervention included three 20-min 
classes, whilst the longest comprised a three-month medita-
tion retreat. The potential impact of this variability on the 
estimated effects is unknown, as the relatively small number 
of meta-analyzed studies (k = 13) precluded the evaluation 
of putative moderators via meta-regression or subgroup 
analyses.

The current review addressed the limitations of Cásedas 
et al. (2020) through the inclusion of multiple cognitive 
domains, focusing on a more homogeneous set of interven-
tions, and evaluating a range of potential moderators, includ-
ing age and clinical status. Age is a risk factor for both sub-
clinical and clinically relevant cognitive decline (Anderson 
& Craik, 2017; van der Flier & Scheltens, 2005); hence older 
adults’ cognitive function is typically somewhat worse rela-
tive to earlier adulthood. It is plausible that age could moder-
ate the effect of MBPs on cognition, given that there could 

be less of a ‘ceiling effect’ to limit potential improvements 
in older adults. Participants’ clinical status (i.e. whether they 
have a diagnosis or not) may also moderate MBP effects 
on cognition, perhaps via a similar association with initial 
cognitive performance, but perhaps also due to other aspects 
of living with illness, which might render full participation 
in an MBP more difficult.

Aims

The primary aim of the current review was to provide a 
comprehensive overview and meta-analysis of the effect 
of MBPs on cognitive performance in adults using results 
from randomized controlled studies. Additional aims were 
to estimate effects for separate cognitive domains and sub-
domains, for adults (< 60 years) and older adults (≥ 60 years) 
separately, and for clinical and non-clinical study samples 
separately.

Method

Protocol and Registration

In line with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic 
Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) recommendations 
(Moher et al., 2009), this review was registered with PROS-
PERO in July 2018 [CRD42018100904].

Eligibility Criteria

To be eligible, studies had to be randomized, written in Eng-
lish, and could be published or unpublished (the latter com-
prising dissertations and theses). Study comparators could 
be active or inactive. Study samples had to comprise adults 
with a minimum mean age of 18 years; both clinical and 
non-clinical samples were eligible. Studies had to include 
an MBP, defined as an intervention that was mindfulness-
based; comprised of four or more sessions; and delivered 
in-person, by a facilitator, to groups of participants. This 
definition drew heavily on a framework outlining MBP char-
acteristics (Crane et al., 2017), which implicitly pertains to 
MBPs with eight or more sessions. For this review, studies 
were required to have a minimum number of four sessions 
based on previous research that adjudged four sessions to be 
an adequate minimal dose (Williams et al., 2014) and evi-
dence that as few as four mindfulness sessions can improve 
cognitive performance (Zeidan et al., 2010). Permitting 
greater variability in MBP session number also facilitated 
the evaluation of this variable as a moderator. Considering 
other MBP characteristics, the in-person, group-based nature 
of MBPs is thought to support participants’ learning. MBPs 
exclusively delivered remotely or digitally were therefore 

1 3Neuropsychology Review (2022) 32:677–702

679

ineligible. Studies where the setting was exclusively resi-
dential (i.e. a mindfulness retreat) were excluded in order to 
reduce variability between interventions. Although retreats 
and MBPs both involve mindfulness practice and teaching, 
the residential nature of the former engenders a more inten-
sive experience. Lastly, the following interventions were not 
considered MBPs for the purpose of this review: integrative 
body-mind training, acceptance and commitment therapy, 
dialectical behavior therapy, compassion-based interven-
tions, loving-kindness meditation, mantra meditation, yoga, 
qi gong or tai chi. While we consider these interventions to 
be mindfulness-informed, they are not mindfulness-based in 
the sense of the above definition.

We exclusively examined the effect of MBP participa-
tion on objective measures of cognitive performance. Here, 
objective is defined as behaviorally-measured performance 
on neuropsychological or laboratory-based cognitive tests 
and includes both pen-and-paper and computerized para-
digms. Self-reported measures were thus excluded. To be 
included, studies must have administered one or more meas-
ures of an eligible cognitive domain pre- and post-intervention.  
Eligible  cognitive  domains  were  attention,  perception,  
declarative  memory,  language,  construction,  reasoning, 
and executive function. Tests of cognitive function used to 
screen for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia, 
for example the mini-mental state examination (MMSE; 
Folstein et al. (1975)) were also included; this category was 
denoted the ‘cognitive aging’ domain. Whilst these measures 
can be used to screen for early-onset cognitive decline (i.e. in 
midlife), in this review they were exclusively administered  
to older adults (mean age ≥ 60 years).

We excluded cognitive tests that included affective com-
ponents (e.g. emotional variants of the Stroop test). This was 
justified on the basis that these were less common than non-
affective cognitive tests, could suffer from the confound-
ing effect of emotional valence, and exhibited significant 
variability in content and administration. We also excluded 
studies which measured cognition immediately following 
mindfulness practice (the majority, in any case, reporting 
the effects of a single mindfulness session). The rationale for 
this was that measuring cognition immediately post-practice 
could be conceptualized as capturing transient ‘state’ mind-
fulness effects, whereas the current focus was on potentially 
more stable effects.

Search Strategy

The electronic databases AMED, CINAHL Plus, Embase, 
Medline,  PsycBOOKS,  PsycINFO,  Scopus  and  Web  of 
Science were systematically searched. Additionally, grey 
literature searches were conducted with ProQuest Disser-
tations and Theses Global, ClinicalTrials.gov and Google 
Scholar (Haddaway et al., 2015). Lastly, references from 

other reviews were hand-screened by two experts from the 
mindfulness research field (DV, SWL).

Briefly, search strings combined the stem ‘mindful*’ with 
interventional terms adapted from other reviews (Bhome 
et al., 2018; Smart et al., 2017; Verbeek et al., 2005), and 
cognitive domain terms derived from a handbook of neu-
ropsychological assessment (Lezak, 2012). The initial search 
was conducted on December 2nd, 2018 and updated on Jan-
uary 23rd, 2020. Please see the supplementary materials for 
database-specific search strings.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

The  web  platform  Covidence  (Veritas  Health  Innova- 
tion (Melbourne) was used for deduplication, and to coor-
dinate multiuser title-abstract and full-text screening. Each 
study record was screened in duplicate by two reviewers 
independently at both stages. Disagreements were resolved 
by  a  third  reviewer.  Pairs  of  reviewers  independently 
extracted study data into a piloted form in duplicate; these 
two versions of the data were then compared. Where dis-
crepancies arose, TW checked the relevant publication, and 
confirmed one of the previously extracted values. In rare 
cases where TW did not agree with either of the discrepant 
values, the final value was settled by at least one other mem-
ber of the review team (in the first instance, EM).

Coding Scheme

For descriptive and analytic purposes, studies were coded as 
‘adult’ (mean sample age < 60 years) or ‘older adult’ (mean 
sample age ≥ 60 years). The rationale for selecting this age 
cut-off was that age-related cognitive decline typically mani-
fests during the seventh decade of life (Cornelis et al., 2019; 
Schaie et al., 2004). Dichotomizing age therefore enabled us 
to explore whether MBPs might improve or restore cogni-
tive abilities. MBP types were coded into three categories. 
The first category, ‘unmodified MBSR/MBCT’, represented 
versions of those interventions delivered according to the 
original protocols. Unmodified MBSR/MBCT were grouped 
together as they share a similar structure, and are arguably 
the most influential and established MBPs (Crane et al., 
2017). The second category, ‘modified MBPs’, coded for 
interventions described by study authors as being variously 
adapted from MBSR/MBCT. The third category, ‘generic 
MBPs’, coded for MBPs described without any reference to 
MBSR/MBCT. Crane et al. (2017) note that MBPs typically 
incorporate three formal mindfulness practices: the body 
scan, mindful movement and sitting meditation, as well as 
a retreat day (the latter is sometimes omitted from research 
studies  due  to  resource  constraints).  We  thus  recorded 
the number of formal mindfulness practices and retreats 
included  in  each  MBP.  Studies  solely  utilizing  waitlist,

treatment as usual, or ‘no intervention’ control groups were 
coded as ‘inactively-controlled’; all other studies were coded 
as ‘actively-controlled’. We did not specify an a priori cod-
ing scheme for subclassifying active comparator interven-
tions, instead operationalizing this post-hoc.

Two reviewers independently coded outcomes into cogni-
tive domains during data extraction; this was informed by 
professional experience, test documentation and the wider 
academic literature. It was common for a given test to yield 
multiple outcomes – reviewers could code these outcomes 
into separate domains as appropriate. Three domains were 
further divided into subdomains. For executive function, 
these were cognitive flexibility, working memory (for meas-
ures requiring both informational maintenance and manipu-
lation), and inhibition, after Diamond (2013). For attention, 
these were alerting and orienting, after Petersen and Posner 
(2012); the third attentional subdomain specified by that 
framework – executive control – was here merged with the 
inhibition subdomain of executive function given the sig-
nificant overlap between these constructs. The declarative 
memory domain was divided into the episodic memory sub-
domain (combining immediate and delayed recall outcomes) 
and the short-term memory subdomain (for measures requir-
ing the maintenance, but not manipulation, of information).
A  number  of  the  included  tests  of  executive  function 
and attention are scored according to participants’ reaction 
time or accuracy. Typical examples include the Attention 
Network Test (Fan et al., 2002) and the Continuous Per-
formance Test (Cohen, 2011). We encountered significant 
variability between studies in the types of scores reported for 
these tests, even for the same or similar measures. Namely, 
authors reported scores across the following categories: (i) 
individual types of trial (e.g. incongruent trials) or types of 
response (e.g. correct hits); (ii) performance collapsed across 
conditions (e.g. global mean reaction time); or (iii) summary 
scores (contrasts between different types of trial/response, 
or other summary indices). Similarly, some studies reported 
reaction time but not accuracy scores (or the converse) or 
appeared to report scores incompletely (e.g. reporting data 
for correct hits but not false alarms). For these types of exec-
utive function and attention measures (i.e. those scored using 
reaction time/accuracy), only summary scores (i.e. (iii)) were 
meta-analyzed. This was justified on the basis that summary 
scores are a function of individual scores, rendering analyses 
including both invalid; the majority of studies included sum-
mary scores; and, particularly for executive function, con-
trasts are considered crucial to isolate the cognitive processes 
of interest. A good example of an executive function measure 
that utilizes contrast scoring is the Stroop test. The present 
approach thus maintained the independence of (while maxi-
mally exploiting) outcome data; reduced variability amongst 
score types; and facilitated the interpretation of results.

Risk of Bias in Individual Studies

Risk of bias at the level of individual studies was assessed 
during data extraction using the Cochrane risk of bias tool 
(Higgins et al., 2011), yielding pairs of independent rat-
ings. The Cochrane tool assesses risk of selection bias, 
performance bias, detection bias, attrition bias, reporting 
bias, and other potential biases. For each of these domains, 
reviewers judged the risk of bias as ‘Low’ (bias unlikely 
to alter the results seriously), ‘Unclear’ (indicating lack of 
information, or uncertainty over potential bias) or ‘High’ 
(bias with the potential to alter the results seriously). Disa-
greements were resolved using the same approach taken 
for data extraction.

Statistical Analyses

Calculation of Effect Sizes

The measure of effect size was the standardized mean dif-
ference, with a correction factor applied for small sam-
ple sizes (Morris, 2007). For cognitive tests where lower 
scores indicate better performance, we multiplied scores 
by minus one, so that all scores followed the format of 
higher values reflecting better performance. For each cog-
nitive outcome score, we calculated: (i) the pre- to post-
intervention (i.e. immediately following the conclusion of 
the intervention) mean difference for each study arm, and 
then (ii) the difference between these change scores. This 
score was then divided by the pooled pre-test standard 
deviation, and adjusted using approximate correction fac-
tor J, to give Hedges’ g (Morris, 2007). The calculation of 
g (see supplementary materials for the presently used for-
mula) requires knowledge of the pre- to post-intervention 
correlation for each outcome. These correlations were only 
available for four studies, with these having a mean of 
r = 0.49. Given this empirical observation, and that a value 
of r = 0.50 is typically substituted for unknown correla-
tions, we used the latter value for all effect size calcula-
tions. Some studies included both an inactive and an active 
comparator, in addition to the MBP. For studies with both 
types of comparator, we only included effect sizes ver-
sus active comparator interventions in the main analyses, 
given this constitutes a more rigorous evaluation of MBPs. 
However, for subgroup analyses reporting comparisons for 
MBPs versus active and inactive comparators separately, 
we included comparisons between the MBP and all avail-
able comparators. Consequently, the total number of stud-
ies and effect sizes across these subgroups exceeded the 
total numbers included in the main analyses.

1 3Neuropsychology Review (2022) 32:677–702

Accounting for Dependencies

Many studies reporting the effects of MBP participation on 
cognition administered more than one outcome measure 
meeting the eligibility criteria. Conventional meta-analysis  
cannot  optimally  accommodate  this  type  of  data,  as  an 
assumption of this approach is that each outcome is sam-
pled independently. Conventional solutions to this problem 
include selecting a single effect size, or the mean effect size, 
for each study. Both approaches lose information, and are 
therefore not recommended (Matt & Cook, 1994).

Random-effects meta-analysis with robust variance esti-
mation was therefore used for quantitative syntheses. This 
method can model multiple effect sizes from related meas-
ures that are clustered within studies without averaging data, 
and also controls for the dependence between these effects 
(Hedges et al., 2010). The robust variance estimation meta-
analysis was conducted with the ‘robumeta’ package in R 
version 3.6.0, with small-sample corrections enabled (Fisher 
& Tipton, 2017). As per the default option for the robumeta 
package, rho (presumed correlation amongst different out-
comes within studies) was set to 0.8, and sensitivity analyses 
varied rho from 0–1 to determine the effect these values 
could have on Tau2
. Significant results were defined as those 
having a p-value < 0.05. Notably, p-values for robust vari-
ance estimation meta-analytic estimates are unreliable where 
the model degrees of freedom < 4 (Fisher & Tipton, 2017). 
We highlight where this is the case and do not report these 
p-values. For the primary meta-analysis, data from all stud-
ies and all cognitive domains were pooled.

Heterogeneity

Heterogeneity for each model is reported using Tau2
, which 
represents between-study variance, and I2
, which represents 
the proportion of observed dispersion due to real variation 
in effect sizes, rather than random error.

Moderator and Subgroup Analyses

A series of meta-regressions evaluated whether the follow-
ing variables (possible values) moderated effect sizes:

(i)  Type of comparator (active; inactive)

  (ii)  Age group (adults, mean age < 60 years; older adults, 

mean age ≥ 60 years)

  (iii)  Clinical status (clinical; non-clinical)
  (iv)  Type of MBP (unmodified MBSR/MBCT; modified 

MBP; generic MBP)

  (v)  Number of formal mindfulness practices (i.e. how 
many of the following were included: body scan, 
mindful movement, and sitting meditation)

  (vi)  Retreat included (yes; no)

681

 (vii)  Number of MBP sessions (continuous variable)
 (viii)  Frequency of MBP sessions (number per week, con-

tinuous variable)

  (ix)  Duration of MBP sessions (minutes, continuous vari-

able)

For meta-regression, we only used the main compara-
tor (see ‘Calculation of effect sizes’). Each moderator was 
analyzed in a univariable meta-regression, and then the nine 
variables were simultaneously entered in a multivariable 
meta-regression. Subgroup analyses were also used to esti-
mate pooled effect sizes for different categories within each 
of the following variables (coded as per meta-regression): 
age group; clinical status; MBP type; and type of compara-
tor. We also conducted subgroup analyses of separate cogni-
tive domains and subdomains. The broad range of modera-
tors and domains evaluated resulted in multiple statistical 
comparisons, which can inflate the Type I error rate. One 
mitigatory approach is to use a Bonferroni-type correction 
to the statistical significance threshold. However, there is a 
lack of consensus regarding the suitability of this method 
for meta-analysis. Given this, we utilized an alternative 
approach, making a clear distinction between planned and 
exploratory subgroup analyses, as suggested by Pigott and 
Polanin (2020).

Testing for and Managing Publication Bias

We employed well-established methods to assess for the 
presence of small study effects. Whilst publication bias is 
one explanation for small study effects, other causes exist. 
For example, it has been suggested that larger, more expen-
sive trials are more likely to be methodologically rigorous, 
which may result in smaller effect sizes (Sterne et al., 2000). 
We assessed for the presence of small study effects using a 
regression-based method, meta-regressing effect size stand-
ard error on effect size. A significant association between 
effect sizes and their standard errors constitutes evidence 
of small study effects. The intercept from this model can 
be interpreted as the predicted value of an effect size with 
a standard error of zero (i.e. that which would be obtained 
for a hypothetical, infinitely large study). The intercept can 
thus be considered a measure of effect size adjusted for small 
study effects (Moreno et al., 2009).

Results

Study Selection

The literature search across seven databases yielded a total 
of 35,101 title-abstracts through January 2020. After dedu-
plication, 16,919 title-abstracts remained. Each title-abstract 

1 3 
682

was screened by TW and one other reviewer (EP, ML, AC 
or MS), with 184 title-abstracts subsequently included for 
full-text review. Each full-text was screened by TW and 
one other reviewer (ML, AC or MS). During the full-text 
retrieval and data extraction process, another 125 titles were 
excluded (see Fig. 1 for PRISMA flowchart), with a final 
total of 59 articles being included.

Study Characteristics

Characteristics of individual studies are presented in Table 1 
and summarized in supplementary Table S1. In three cases, 
different results from the same study were reported across 
two articles. In these cases, both sets of results were merged 
into a single study record. This resulted in the inclusion of 
56 unique study samples in the final review, representing a 
total of 2,931 participants (1,489 in the MBP arms and 1,442 

in the main comparator arms). Study sample sizes varied 
considerably from 14 to 200 participants (median 43).

Publication year ranged from 2007–2020. Half of the 
included studies (k = 28) were published in 2017 or later, 
highlighting the contemporary interest in the putative cogni-
tive effects of MBPs. Twenty-four studies (43%) took place 
in North America, with the remaining studies taking place 
in Europe (k = 18; 32%), Asia (k = 9; 16%), Australia (k = 2; 
4%), Israel (k = 2; 4%), and South Africa (k = 1; 2%). The 
majority of studies (k = 54; 96%) randomized participants 
at the individual level, while two studies (Rothschild et al., 
2017; Zanesco et al., 2019) utilized cluster-randomization.
Forty-four studies (78%) did not follow up participants 
beyond the end of the intervention, while seven studies (13%) 
used short-term (8–18 week) follow-ups, and five studies (9%) 
used long-term (24–44 week) follow-ups (see supplementary 
materials for a narrative overview of follow-up results).

Participant Characteristics

The mean age of included participants ranged from 19 to 
82 years (median 41 years). Forty studies (71%) were of 
adults (< 60 years), while sixteen studies (29%) recruited 
older adults (≥ 60 years). The overall proportion of female 
participants was 67%. Twenty-two studies (39%) reported 
sample ethnicity data. Across these studies, 71% of partici-
pants were white, 15% were Asian, and 9% were black (the 
ethnicity of the remaining 5% was not reported or coded 
as ‘Other’). Thirty-four studies (61%) provided some data 
on the educational attainment of participants. Considering 
only the 16 (29%) studies which reported education in years, 
participants’ mean education ranged from four to 17 years 
(median 15 years). We pooled available age, sex, education, 
and ethnicity data for the MBP and main comparator arms 
separately (see supplementary Table S2). Inspecting the rel-
evant means/proportions between arms broadly confirmed 
the effectiveness of randomization (i.e. groups were highly 
comparable across these characteristics).

Thirty-four studies (61%) recruited participants from non-
clinical populations. Twenty-six (46%) of these recruited 
individuals from university or general community popula-
tions, whilst the remaining study samples represented spe-
cific professional groups (k = 6; 11%), caregivers of peo-
ple with dementia (k = 1; 2%) or women during pregnancy 
(k = 1; 2%). Twenty-two studies (39%) recruited participants 
from clinical populations. These were broadly categorizable 
as comprising individuals with neurocognitive disorders (i.e. 
subjective or objective cognitive dysfunction, including 
dementia; k = 8; 14%), psychiatric disorders (k = 8; 14%), or 
neurological disorders (k = 4; 7%). A single study recruited 
persons  who  had  recovered  from  cancer,  while  another 
included HIV-positive individuals. The preponderance of 
neurocognitive, psychiatric and neurological studies in this 
review is unsurprising, given that cognitive dysfunction is, 
by definition, present in neurocognitive disorders, and fre-
quently implicated in psychiatric and neurological disorders.
Thirty-six (64%) studies reported information about par-
ticipants’ prior or current experience with mindfulness prac-
tices. Twenty-six studies (46%) addressed this under study 
eligibility criteria, stipulating that previous meditation expe-
rience (k = 17; 30%), or current meditation practice (k = 9; 
16%), were exclusionary. Nine studies (16%) took a descrip-
tive approach, with six studies (11%) stating that all partici-
pants were meditation naïve, and three studies (5%) stating 
that some participants had prior experience of meditation.

Intervention Characteristics

Ten  studies  (18%)  used  unmodified  MBSR,  while  three 
(5%) used unmodified MBCT. Thirty studies (54%) featured 
modified MBPs. Typical modifications included reducing

the number of sessions or omitting the retreat day; reduc-
ing the duration of sessions to facilitate the participation 
of attentionally-impaired individuals; adapting the psych-
oeducational content for non-stressed/non-depressed sam-
ples; and the omission of the mindful movement practice 
for persons with reduced mobility. The remaining interven-
tions (k = 13; 23%) were coded as generic MBPs. In general, 
generic MBPs lacked the psychoeducational components 
common to the other MBP types; these interventions thus 
predominantly featured sessions of a shorter duration, pri-
marily focusing on mindfulness practice.

The number of sessions included by MBPs ranged from 
four to 72, with most programs (k = 47; 84%) being delivered 
over six to 12 sessions. The majority of interventions (k = 42; 
75%) were between six and 12 weeks in length, highlighting 
the convention of delivering MBP sessions weekly. Fifty-
three studies (95%) reported the duration of in-person, group-
based MBP sessions, which ranged from 30 to 180 min, with 
the majority (k = 40; 71%) having durations between 90 and 
150 min. The MBP included a retreat day in 16 studies (29%) 
and did not include a retreat in 11 studies (20%). The remain-
ing studies (k = 29; 51%) were unclear regarding MBP retreat 
provision. Including both sessions and retreats, total MBP 
intervention duration ranged from 315 to 2,190 min (median 
960 min). In relation to the three formal mindfulness prac-
tices (body scan, mindful movement, and sitting meditation), 
six studies (11%) reported the inclusion of sitting meditation 
alone, 12 studies (21%) included two MBP practices, and the 
remaining 38 studies (68%) included all three practices. Two-
thirds (k = 37) of studies reported details of the frequency 
and duration of assigned home mindfulness practice. The 
suggested frequency ranged from five to seven days a week 
(median seven days), while the suggested daily duration 
ranged from five to 60 min (median 20 min).

Forty-two  studies  (75%)  reported  quantitative  (e.g. 
amount of time accrued in mindfulness teaching or prac-
tice) and qualitative (e.g. certification status) information 
about the MBP facilitators’ credentials. Broadly, thirty-three 
studies (59%) described the facilitator as being a mindful-
ness teacher/instructor (k = 22 (39%) explicitly stating that 
the facilitator had completed MBP teacher training). The 
remaining nine studies (16%) simply described the facilita-
tor as being a clinician, a mindfulness practitioner, or an 
individual with limited mindfulness teaching experience.

Twenty-five studies (45%) reported adherence data for the 
MBP. Across these studies, the mean proportion of sessions 
attended ranged between 39 and 100% (median 87%). Some 
studies, however, excluded dropouts from the reported adher-
ence data. If dropouts were accounted for, adherence would 
be expected to decrease. Home practice adherence data were 
available for 16 studies (29%). Eleven studies (20%) reported 
home practice data as the mean reported duration of practice; 
these figures ranged from 36 to 100% (median 82%) of the 

amount assigned in the MBP. Five studies (9%) reported home 
practice data as the mean percentage of assigned home ses-
sions completed; these ranged from 57 to 100% (median 84%).
Forty-eight studies (86%) included a single comparator 
group, while eight studies (14%) included more than one 
comparator. Of the latter, five studies (9%) included one 
active and one inactive comparator. In the main analyses, the 
MBP was compared against the active comparator interven-
tion for these studies, while both comparisons were included 
in subgroup analyses presenting data separately for active 
and inactive comparators. Two (4%) of the studies with more 
than one comparator included two MBP arms and a single 
inactive arm. For these studies, we selected the four-week 
modified MBP arm (Zanesco et al., 2019) and the modified 
MBP arm (Lymeus et al., 2016) for all analyses, and com-
pared these against the inactive comparator. The final study 
(Bowden et al., 2012) included two active comparator inter-
ventions: Body and Brain Training, and Iyengar Yoga. The 
MBP was compared against the yoga group in all analyses, 
as yoga is a better-researched intervention, and may posi-
tively impact cognition (Gothe & McAuley, 2015).

Considering  only  the  ‘main’  comparator  group  (i.e. 
that used in the main analyses), the review included 30 
inactively-controlled studies (54%), the majority of which 
(k = 20; 36%) used a waitlist. Of the ten (18%) which did 
not, five (9%) recruited clinical samples and offered the 
control  group  treatment  as  usual,  and  five  studies  (9%) 
recruited non-clinical samples and offered no intervention 
to the control group. Twenty-six studies (46%) used active 
comparator interventions, all of which were group-based. 
These comprised health enhancement/education programs 
(k = 7; 13%), psychoeducation interventions (k = 7; 13%), 
or relaxation interventions (k = 4; 7%). The remaining stud-
ies utilized cognitive training (k = 2; 4%); nutrition (k = 2; 
4%); reading (k = 2; 4%); yoga (k = 1; 1%); or social sup-
port (k = 1; 1%) interventions. All except one of the active 
comparator interventions (k = 25; 45%) matched the relevant 
MBP for number of sessions; all active comparators matched 
MBP session duration. Nineteen studies (34%) provided 
clear information about the provision of homework in both 
the MBP and active comparator arms. The MBP and active 
comparator were equivalent for homework provision in 17 
studies (30%), while two studies (4%) assigned homework 
to MBP participants only. Twelve actively-controlled stud-
ies (21%) provided clear information about the number of 
retreats in the MBP and comparator arms. Ten studies (18%) 
featured an active comparator which matched the MBP for 
number of retreats (including six studies without retreats). 
The remaining two studies (4%) featured an MBP retreat but 
no comparator retreat. Where ascertainable, session number 
and duration, homework, and retreat provision were thus 
approximately matched between MBPs and active compara-
tor interventions.

Risk of Bias

Neuropsychology Review (2022) 32:677–702

Publication Bias

The methodological quality of the studies reported varied 
significantly (see Fig. 2). ‘Random sequence generation’ 
bias ratings were split between ‘Low’ (k = 26; 46%) and 
‘Unclear’ (k = 30; 54%). The majority of studies (k = 48; 
86%)  did  not  report  enough  information  to  assess  the 
potential for ‘Allocation concealment’ bias and were thus 
rated ‘Unclear’. A large proportion of studies (k = 45; 80%) 
were rated as being at ‘High’ risk of bias for ‘Blinding 
of participants and personnel’, given the inherent diffi-
culties in achieving this in nonpharmacological RCTs. 
The ‘Blinding of outcome assessment’ domain saw four-
teen studies (25%) rated as being at ‘Low’ risk, and five 
(9%) studies rated as ‘High’ risk (e.g. for not blinding 
psychometrists), although the majority of studies (k = 37; 
66%) were ‘Unclear’. Ratings for ‘Incomplete outcome 
data’ bias were split between ‘Low’ (k = 18; 32%), ‘High’ 
(k = 19; 34%) and ‘Unclear’ (k = 19; 34%). In this category, 
‘High’ bias ratings reflected high overall attrition (≥ 30%) 
and/or  use  of  per-protocol  analyses.  Ratings  for  bias 
associated with ‘Selective reporting’ were mainly ‘Low’ 
(k = 28; 50%) or ‘Unclear’ (k = 21; 38%), although seven 
studies (13%) were considered to be at ‘High’ risk (e.g. for 
not reporting results for a cognitive test mentioned in the 
study Method and/or trial registration). Across each of the 
six risk of bias domains, the median proportion (range) of 
studies rated as ‘Low’ was 29% (0 to 50%); ‘High’, 11% 
(0 to 80%); and ‘Unclear’, 46% (20 to 86%).

Robust variance estimation meta-regression found no signifi-
cant association between the standard error of effect sizes 
and effect sizes themselves – either overall, or for actively- or 
inactively-controlled studies separately (see supplementary 
Table S4). We therefore did not identify evidence of bias 
stemming from underrepresentation of small sample size 
studies with null or negative findings. Examining the inter-
cept (interpretable as the estimate for a hypothetical, infi-
nitely large study) for each of these meta-regression models 
revealed the following values [95% confidence intervals]: all 
studies 0.33; [-0.01, 0.68]; actively-controlled 0.10; [-0.51, 
0.72]; and inactively-controlled 0.46; [0.10, 0.82]. In each 
of these models, the coefficient for the SE meta-regressor 
was negative, thus explaining how adjusting for small study 
effects resulted in larger effect size estimates compared to 
the unadjusted meta-analyses (see next section).

Quantitative Synthesis of Results

Forty-six studies (82%) reported cognitive outcome data 
amenable to meta-analysis (or the authors provided these 
on request). The remaining ten studies (18%) were excluded 
from meta-analyses for the following reasons: only reporting 
non-summary scores for laboratory tests (k = 7; 13%); not 
reporting sufficient data to calculate effect sizes (k = 2; 4%); 
or not reporting cognitive test data (k = 1; 2%). No included 
study reported data for the language or reasoning cognitive

domains. Available effect sizes (n; %) thus measured execu-
tive function (63; 35%), attention (53; 29%), declarative 
memory (49; 27%), cognitive aging (7; 4%), construction 
(5; 3%), or visual perception (3; 2%). No study adminis-
tered a non-visual measure of perception. See supplemen-
tary Table S3 for a complete list of analyzed cognitive test 
measures and metrics.

Primary Analysis

The initial meta-analysis pooled all 180 effect sizes from 
46 studies. The pooled effect size, collapsing across cogni-
tive domains, significantly favored MBPs over compara-
tors (g = 0.23; [0.01, 0.46]). This analysis included the trial 
reported by Rothschild et al. (2017), which compared a 
72-session MBP to an inactive comparator, and reported 
an unusually large effect size (g = 5.2) for the digit symbol 
substitution test (the only eligible measure). Given that 
both the number of MBP sessions (median number of ses-
sions was eight) and effect size were outliers, this study 
was removed and the analyses repeated. Following the 
removal of this study, the updated meta-analytic estimate 
continued to favor MBPs over comparators but was some-
what attenuated (g = 0.15; [0.05, 0.24]; see Table 2). The 
I2
 statistics for the initial and updated model were 80% and 
20%, respectively, suggesting that the study by Rothschild 
et al. (2017) was indeed a statistical/methodological out-
lier. We thus denoted the updated meta-analysis the ‘final’ 
model, with all analyses reported hereafter comprising 179 
effect sizes from 45 studies (n = 2,238).

Meta‑regression

Univariable meta-regressions evaluated the following can-
didate moderators in the final meta-analytic dataset: type 
of comparator; age group; clinical status; type of MBP; 
number of formal mindfulness practices included; whether 
a  retreat  was  included;  number  of  MBP  sessions;  fre-
quency of MBP sessions; and duration of MBP sessions. 
Each  moderator  was  first  individually  meta-regressed 
on effect size, and none were significant (all ps > 0.08). 
Whilst no moderators were significant, those effecting the 
greatest reduction in the I2
 statistic (relative to the final 
meta-analysis) were type of comparator (I2
 reduced by 4.0 
percentage points); MBP session duration (I2
 reduced by 
3.7 percentage points); and MBP session frequency (I2
reduced by 1.8 percentage points). All moderators were 
then simultaneously included in a meta-regression, and 
none emerged as significant (all ps > 0.25; see supplemen-
tary Table S5). These analyses were repeated substituting 
continuous age in years for age groups; this produced the 
same pattern of findings as described for the univariable 
age and multiple meta-regressions.

Subgroup Analyses

Cognitive Domains and Subdomains

Outcomes were subdivided according to the cognitive 
domain they primarily represented. MBPs significantly 
outperformed comparators for executive function (k = 29;

g = 0.15; [0.02, 0.27]; see Table 2). MBPs did not signifi-
cantly outperform comparators for attention, declarative 
memory,  nor  cognitive  aging.  There  were  insufficient 
data to yield reliable p-values for the visual perception 
or construction domains (see supplementary materials for 
a narrative review of those results).

Executive function, attention and declarative memory 
were further divided into subdomains; these were also 
evaluated separately (see Table 2). The only subdomain 
for which MBPs significantly outperformed comparators 
was  for  the  working  memory  subdomain  of  executive 
function (k = 13; g = 0.23; [0.11, 0.36]).

Six studies reported data from the Attention Network 
Test. In contrast to the variability of measures included 
in other analyses, these data provided the opportunity 
to examine effects on a single measure. MBPs did not 
outperform comparators for any of the network scores 
(i.e. alerting, orienting and executive; see supplementary 
Table S6).

Clinical Status and Age Group

In studies including non-clinical samples, MBPs signifi-
cantly outperformed comparators (k = 27; g = 0.18; [0.05, 
0.31]). In studies of clinical samples, MBPs did not sig-
nificantly outperform comparators (k = 18; g = 0.09; [-0.06, 
0.24]; see Table 3).

MBPs  did  not  outperform  comparators  in  studies  of 
adult (< 60 years) samples (k = 30; g = 0.11; [-0.01, 0.24]). 

MBPs significantly outperformed comparators for older 
adult (≥ 60 years) samples (k = 15; g = 0.21; [0.04, 0.38]; 
see Table 3). Following this finding, exploratory analyses 
evaluated separate cognitive domains for older adults; MBPs 
significantly outperformed comparators for the executive 
function domain only (k = 8; g = 0.27; [0.05, 0.50]; see sup-
plementary Table S7). We also conducted separate, explor-
atory subgroup analyses of clinical and non-clinical sam-
ples of older adults; neither subgroup exhibited significant 
effects, although the clinical analysis did not return a reliable 
p-value, and the lower confidence bound for the non-clinical 
estimate approached zero (g = 0.25; [-0.01, 0.51]; see sup-
plementary Table S8).

Comparator and MBP Type

MBPs did not significantly outperform active comparator 
interventions (k = 22; g = 0.07; [-0.04, 0.19]). In contrast, 
MBPs  significantly  outperformed  inactive  comparators 
(k = 28; g = 0.20; [0.06, 0.33]; see Table 3). Across these 
subgroups, the total number of ‘studies’ exceeded the total 
for other analyses (i.e. 50 versus 45), reflecting that some 
studies included both an active and an inactive comparator.
Unmodified MBSR/MBCT did not significantly outper-
form comparators (k = 12; g = 0.04; [-0.22, 0.30]). Modified 
MBPs outperformed comparators (k = 23; g = 0.15; [0.03, 
0.26]), as did generic MBPs (k = 10; g = 0.26; [0.05, 0.47]; 
see Table 3). We conducted additional, exploratory sub-
group analyses, seeking to better understand these results.

No MBP type outperformed comparators when actively- and 
inactively-controlled studies were analyzed separately (see 
supplementary Table S9). However, subgrouping each type 
of MBP for clinical and non-clinical samples separately indi-
cated that modified MBPs outperformed comparators in clini-
cal samples, and generic MBPs outperformed comparators 
in non-clinical samples (see supplementary Table S10). Of 
note, nine of the ten studies utilizing generic MBPs were con-
ducted in non-clinical samples, which may partially explain 
the comparatively large ‘main’ estimate for this MBP type.

Risk of Bias

We  conducted  unplanned  subgroup  analyses  of  studies 
which received a ‘Low’ risk of bias rating in at least three 
of six domains (defining this subgroup as ‘Lower’ risk), 
as well as for studies with fewer than three ‘Low’ ratings 
(defined as ‘Higher risk’), in order to establish whether risk 
of bias was associated with effect size. We acknowledge that 
requiring a minimum of only three ‘Low’ ratings to qualify a 
study as being at lower overall risk is perhaps overinclusive. 
However, only 12 studies satisfied this criterion, and the 
relevant threshold was thus motivated by statistical expedi-
ency. MBPs did not significantly outperform comparators in 
studies at lower risk of bias (k = 12; g = 0.18; [-0.01, 0.38]; 
see Table 3). In contrast, MBPs significantly outperformed 
comparators in studies at higher risk of bias (k = 33; g = 0.14; 
[0.01, 0.26]). Whilst this might appear to support the notion 
that higher risk of bias studies were associated with greater 
effects, the estimates were of a similar magnitude, and in 
both cases the lower confidence bound approached zero, 
implying that the significance (or lack thereof) of these 
analyses might exaggerate the difference between subgroups. 
Interestingly, the I2
 statistic was nominally smaller for stud-
ies at lower (7%) versus higher (25%) risk of bias.

Whilst trial registration status does not explicitly inform 
Cochrane risk of bias ratings, registered studies are considered to 
be at lower risk of reporting bias. It was recently recommended 
that meta-analysts thus conduct separate subgroup analyses of 
registered and unregistered trials, to ascertain whether trial reg-
istration status moderates effect sizes (Trinquart et al., 2018). We 
thus performed the recommended (unplanned) subgroup analy-
ses and found that MBPs significantly outperformed compara-
tors in registered studies (k = 15; g = 0.23; [0.07, 0.39]), but that 
there was no difference in unregistered studies (k = 30; g = 0.09; 
[-0.03, 0.22]; see Table 3).

Discussion

We identified 56 randomized MBP studies which measured 
objective cognition, of which approximately 30% comprised 
older adult samples (≥ 60 years), and 70% adult samples 

(< 60 years). Around forty percent of studies recruited par-
ticipants from clinical populations, primarily comprising 
individuals with neurocognitive, psychiatric, or neurologi-
cal disorders; the remaining 60% included non-clinical sam-
ples. About a quarter of studies used unmodified MBSR/
MBCT, half featured modified MBPs, and the remainder  
used generic MBPs. The split between actively- and inactively- 
controlled designs was approximately equal.

Forty-five studies were included in the final meta-analysis. 
The summary effect (pooling data across cognitive domains) 
significantly favored MBPs over comparators and was small 
in magnitude (g = 0.15; [0.05, 0.24]; see Table 2). Subgroup 
meta-analyses identified a significant effect for executive 
function (g = 0.15; [0.02, 0.27]), but not attention, declara-
tive memory or cognitive aging. There were insufficient 
data to meta-analyze the construction or visual perception 
domains, though no original studies reported MBP effects for 
these outcomes. Investigating the subdomains of executive 
function, MBPs conferred a significant benefit to working 
memory (g = 0.23; [0.11, 0.36]), but not cognitive flexibility 
or inhibition.

Cognitive Domains and Subdomains

The theorized cognitive benefits of MBP participation are 
domain-specific (Hölzel et al., 2011; Lutz et al., 2008; Shapiro 
et al., 2006; Vago & Silbersweig, 2012), and strongly implicate 
the domains of attention and executive function. We conducted 
subgroup analyses of separate cognitive domains and subdo-
mains, enabling observed effects to be compared to theorized 
gains. It remains important for the reader to hold in mind that, 
whilst MBPs outperformed inactive comparators, they did not 
outperform active comparator interventions. Significant effects 
could thus relate to aspects of interventions which are common 
to both MBPs and the presently included active comparators 
(e.g. therapeutic alliance, social stimulation, and/or treatment 
expectancy).

Executive Function

There was strong evidence for a small effect (g = 0.15; [0.02, 
0.27]) of MBP participation on executive function. This is in-
keeping with a recent meta-analysis of mindfulness meditation 
and executive function (Cásedas et al., 2020). However, earlier 
systematic reviews did not identify an effect in this domain 
(Chiesa et al., 2011; Lao et al., 2016), perhaps due to the com-
paratively small evidence base previously available. In con-
trast, both the current meta-analysis and all three prior reviews 
identified improvements to working memory (here opera-
tionalized as a subdomain of executive function). A recent 
opinion paper discussing the relationship between working 
memory and mindfulness practice noted the latter ‘may repeat-
edly require selective and reflective attentional engagement, 

1 3692

Neuropsychology Review (2022) 32:677–702

disengagement, maintenance, and monitoring […] these pro-
cesses are also necessary to successfully maintain and manipu-
late information in working memory’ (Jha et al. (2019), p.274). 
A proposed explanation for the present effect could, therefore, 
be the engagement of cognitive processes involved in working 
memory during mindfulness practice.

Mindfulness frameworks suggest that practicing focused 
attention meditation might confer benefit to the cognitive flex-
ibility subdomain of executive function, given the emphasis 
on noticing mind wandering and refocusing attention (Gallant, 
2016; Hölzel et al., 2011; Lutz et al., 2008; Shapiro et al., 
2006; Vago & Silbersweig, 2012). In-keeping with an earlier 
meta-analysis (Cásedas et al., 2020), we did not identify a 
significant effect on cognitive flexibility. A possible explana-
tion for this involves reframing sitting meditation as a unitary 
attention task in the presence of off-task distractors (e.g. mind 
wandering), whereas cognitive flexibility may be considered 
the ability to volitionally shift between tasks.

Neurocognitive frameworks of mindfulness hypothesize 
that  practice  should  lead  to  improved  attentional,  emo-
tional and behavioral self-regulation (Shapiro et al., 2006). 
Vago and Silbersweig (2012) theorize that the mechanism 
underlying this is the development of inhibitory control pro-
cesses, which are thought to be recruited during mindfulness 
practice in support of attentional regulation. In contrast to 
Cásedas et al. (2020), the present review did not observe a 
significant benefit to inhibition following MBP participation. 
It remains pertinent, however, to consider the limitations 
of tasks typically used by the presently-included studies to 
measure inhibition. For example, discussing the Stroop test, 
Vago et al. (2019) noted that studies have demonstrated a 
lack of convergent validity between different formats, as well 
as poor test–retest and internal reliability. Other measures of 
inhibition included here also have poor test–retest reliability, 
for example the Attention Network Test (see next section).

Attention

Perhaps surprisingly, we did not identify an effect of MBP 
participation on attention. It is first worth noting that rel-
evant mindfulness frameworks emphasize the role of atten-
tional regulation above attention itself (Lutz et al., 2008). 
The processes involved in attentional regulation are consid-
ered to be delineable from those involved in basic attention, 
and might share more in common with executive function 
(Petersen & Posner, 2012). Moreover, we encountered sig-
nificant variability amongst tests of attention. These could 
broadly be grouped into pen-and-paper tests (e.g. WAIS digit 
symbol coding, cancelation tests) and computerized tests 
(e.g. Attention Network Test, Continuous Performance Test). 
Notably, the test–retest reliabilities (reported as intraclass 
correlations; ICCs) of currently-included tests of both for-
mats vary considerably. One guideline (Koo & Li, 2016) 

suggests the following rubric for interpreting ICC values: 
poor (< 0.50), moderate (0.50 to 0.75), good (0.75 to 0.90), 
and excellent (> 0.90). The attentional outcomes admin-
istered by the present studies thus include measures with 
good (e.g. WAIS digit symbol coding; Lezak (2012)), mod-
erate (e.g. AX-Continuous Performance Test; Cooper et al. 
(2017)), and poor reliability (e.g. Attention Network Test; 
Enkavi et al. (2019)). Further research utilizing attentional 
measures with good or excellent reliability will enable more 
confident conclusions regarding effects in this domain.

Declarative Memory

The majority of declarative memory measures utilized ver-
bal stimuli (e.g. auditory verbal learning tests, WAIS logical 
memory test). While the contemporary discourse surround-
ing MBPs emphasizes attentional and emotional regulation, 
classical Buddhist texts also equate mindfulness with the 
ability to accurately recall prior events (see Brown et al. 
(2016)). Presently, the effects for the declarative memory 
domain and subdomains (i.e. episodic, and short-term mem-
ory) were not significant. Previous reviews (Chiesa et al., 
2011; Lao et al., 2016) did not discuss effects on declara-
tive memory as available data were sparse. However, both 
reviews reported an effect on memory specificity (the prefer-
ential recall of specific versus generalized autobiographical 
memories), the dysfunction of which has been implicated in 
affective disorders (Williams et al., 2007). Memory specific-
ity outcomes were not included in this review, precluding 
comparisons with previous syntheses.

Cognitive Aging

Six studies (four representing patients with neurocogni-
tive disorders, and two of non-clinical samples) included 
measures  of  cognitive  aging.  MBPs  did  not  outperform 
comparators for this domain. Four studies administered the 
MMSE (Folstein et al., 1975), a very brief screening instru-
ment for cognitive impairment. The MMSE does not include 
any executive function subitems, here the only domain to 
improve separately. Furthermore, the MMSE is not recom-
mended for use in interventional studies due to floor and 
ceiling effects and is not sensitive to changes in persons 
without dementia (Posner et al., 2017). Further studies uti-
lizing more in-depth measures of cognitive aging are thus 
required for a more rigorous evaluation of this domain.

Age Group

Older Adults

Whilst earlier reviews summarized MBP effects on cogni-
tion in older adults (Berk et al., 2017; Fountain-Zaragoza 

1 3Neuropsychology Review (2022) 32:677–702

693

& Prakash, 2017; Hazlett-Stevens et al., 2019), none were 
explicitly systematic (though see Gard et al. (2014) for a 
systematic review of mindfulness meditation). The reviews 
found mixed evidence for cognitive effects in elders, and 
concurred that additional high-quality studies were needed 
to support a more confident conclusion. The literature has 
since grown, with this synthesis being the first to systemati-
cally review and meta-analyze data from MBP studies of older 
adults (here a subgroup analysis). Across 15 studies of older 
adults (≥ 60 years; n = 860), the pooled effect across cogni-
tive domains favored MBPs over control conditions (g = 0.21; 
[0.04, 0.38]). Considering cognitive domains separately for 
these studies, MBPs did not outperform comparators on atten-
tion, declarative memory, or cognitive aging. However, the 
pooled effect for executive function (g = 0.27; [0.05, 0.50]) 
favored MBPs, with this effect being nominally larger than 
the equivalent effect for adults and older adults combined 
(g = 0.15; [0.02, 0.27]). A recent analysis of over 470,000 
individuals from the UK Biobank identified an average 7.8% 
decline in performance on the Trail-making test part B (a test 
of executive function) for each additional age group (defined 
as five-year intervals) beyond age 45 (Cornelis et al., 2019). 
Executive function thus declines with age, with the evidence 
presented here suggesting MBPs improve executive function 
in older adults; MBPs may thus be of particular value to older 
adults for supporting the partial restoration of function in this 
domain.

Adults

In contrast to older adults, the subgroup analysis of adults 
(< 60 years; k = 30; n = 1,378) including data from all cog-
nitive domains did not identify a difference between MBPs 
and comparators (g = 0.11; [-0.01, 0.24]). One interpretation 
of this apparent age-specific effect is that MBPs might be 
helpful for restoring cognitive abilities tending to decline 
over age 60 (see above). This interpretation is based on 
the intuition that restoring cognitive abilities to a previous 
state might be more easily achieved than improving abilities 
beyond the developmental peak.

Clinical Status

We divided studies into subgroups based on the clinical sta-
tus of participants. Eighteen studies recruited patients with 
clinical diagnoses (predominantly comprising samples with 
neurocognitive, psychiatric, or neurological disorders). In 
clinical samples, MBPs did not improve overall cognitive 
function relative to comparators. In contrast, across the 27 
studies of non-clinical samples, MBPs significantly outper-
formed comparators across the combined analysis of cogni-
tive domains (g = 0.18; [0.05, 0.31]). Potential explanations 
for the difference in effects between clinical and non-clinical 

samples include that relatively greater variability between 
and within clinical samples may have obscured effects; that 
some clinical conditions might interfere with the ability 
to intensively engage with mindfulness practices; and that 
some clinical studies used insensitive test measures (e.g. the 
MMSE).

Risk of Bias Between and Within Studies

We did not identify evidence of an association between 
effect sizes and their standard errors, suggesting that small 
study effects are unlikely to account for the present results. 
Considering studies at the individual level, the median pro-
portion of ‘Low’ ratings made across the six Cochrane risk 
of bias domains was 29%. A substantial portion of included 
studies did not satisfactorily report the elements required for 
comprehensive risk of bias assessment (the median propor-
tion of ‘Unclear’ judgments was 46%). The rate of trial reg-
istration was relatively low amongst current studies (33%), 
a factor putatively linked to inflated meta-analytic estimates 
in the psychological literature (Kvarven et al., 2020). How-
ever, in subgroup analyses we identified a significant effect 
for registered but not unregistered studies, implying that 
the relatively large proportion of unregistered trials has not 
upwardly biased current effect estimates. Nevertheless, the 
frequently unclear risk of bias highlights the uncertain meth-
odological quality of some of the evidence on which this 
review is based.

Complementary Lines of Evidence

During our systematic review of the extant literature, we 
identified a number of studies that did not meet the inclusion 
criterion of randomizing participants or did not feature an 
MBP fully satisfying the present criteria yet demonstrated 
a significant impact on cognition. Indeed, over fifty stud-
ies have employed other study designs to investigate the 
impact of mindfulness training on cognition; these should 
be taken into careful consideration when making any con-
clusions concerning the effects of mindfulness practice. 
Chiesa et al. (2011) undertook an early review of studies 
investigating the effect of different forms of meditation on 
cognition using cross-sectional designs, or other secular-
ized forms of training that involve some overlap with MBPs 
such as Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (Chiesa et al., 
2011). For example, Jha et al. (2007) compared participants 
following an 8-week MBP; experienced meditators follow-
ing an intensive retreat; and an inactive comparator group. 
Jha et al. (2007) demonstrated uniquely improved orient-
ing on the Attention Network Test in the MBP group, and 
improved alerting in the retreat group, relative to inactive 
controls (Jha et al., 2007). Numerous non-RCT studies in 
clinical  and  non-clinical  populations  have  found  MBPs 

1 3694

Neuropsychology Review (2022) 32:677–702

outperform inactive comparators on the Continuous Per-
formance Test (Bueno et al., 2015); attentional bias using 
affective priming (De Raedt et al., 2012) or dot-probe tasks 
(Garland, 2011; Garland et al., 2013; Vago & Nakamura, 
2011); a task-switching paradigm (Greenberg et al., 2017); 
and Stroop test (Basso et  al., 2019). Other studies have 
shown that mindfulness training with variable duration and 
intensity have significant effects on cognitive performance 
in non-clinical samples. For example, mindfulness training 
with as few as four 20-min sessions (Zeidan et al., 2010) 
improved performance on processing speed, verbal fluency 
and working memory versus an active comparator interven-
tion. Other studies have compared mindful state induction 
techniques seven to 20 min in length against active controls, 
with cognitive testing immediately following the practice 
session. These studies demonstrated improved inattentional 
blindness (Schofield et al., 2015); alerting (Polak, 2009); 
executive attention on a flanker task (Norris et al., 2018); 
attentional blink (Colzato, et al., 2015a, 2015b); cognitive 
control on a Simon task (Colzato et al., 2015a, 2015b); and 
cognitive  performance  on  a  Stroop  test  (Wenk-Sormaz, 
2005). Studies in meditation-naïve healthy populations that 
use intensive retreat formats up to three months in duration 
requiring 10–12 h of daily practice have also shown benefits 
on cognitive outcomes (Sahdra et al., 2011; Trautwein et al., 
2020). Some studies demonstrating improved cognition have 
modified MBPs to address the needs of a specific popula-
tion, like the Mindfulness-based mind fitness training course 
developed to address the specific needs of the military (Jha 
et al., 2010, 2015) or the Mindfulness-oriented recovery 
enhancement program which focuses on addiction, opioid-
dependent and chronic pain populations (Garland & Howard, 
2013; Garland et al., 2017). A number of non-RCT studies 
have now shown improvements in working memory using 
the operation span task (Jha et al., 2010), or a lack of degra-
dation of sustained attention, inhibitory control capacity and 
working memory in military cohorts following Mindfulness-
based mind fitness training (Jha et al., 2015, 2017, 2020). 
Participants randomized to Mindfulness-oriented recovery 
enhancement exhibited significantly reduced attentional bias 
in comparison to active controls (Garland & Howard, 2013; 
Garland et al., 2017). Furthermore, reductions in attentional 
bias predicted improvements in opioid use at three month 
follow-up (Garland et al., 2017). Cross-sectional studies of 
meditators versus non-meditators show enhanced attention 
and working memory in meditators on the Stroop test (Fabio 
& Towey, 2018; Moore & Malinowski, 2009); attentional 
blink (Fabio & Towey, 2018; Slagter et al., 2007); n-back 
(Fabio & Towey, 2018); and rapid visual information pro-
cessing task (Pagnoni & Cekic, 2007). Other studies have 
observed improved cognitive performance in individuals 
who score higher on trait mindfulness scales (Schmertz 
et al., 2009), suggesting dispositional differences. Thus, in 

addition to the current findings, one must consider the exist-
ing literature at the granular level to build a well-informed 
overview.

Strengths of the Review

This evidence synthesis has a number of clear strengths. 
Previous reviews did not search the literature systemati-
cally, or combined data from both longitudinal and cross-
sectional studies (Berk et al., 2017; Chiesa et al., 2011; 
Fountain-Zaragoza & Prakash, 2017). In contrast, we con-
ducted a systematic literature search; solely included rand-
omized studies; and performed screening, bias rating, and 
data extraction in duplicate. Moreover, we only included 
objective behavioral assessments of cognition, thereby cir-
cumventing problems associated with self-report measures 
(Van Dam et al., 2018). Perhaps most significantly, to our 
knowledge this is the first meta-analysis of general cognitive 
outcomes (i.e. spanning multiple domains) from randomized 
MBP studies. The rapidly-expanding MBP literature con-
stitutes a mosaic of significant and non-significant effects 
across various cognitive domains, the complexity of which 
prevents interested readers from gaining an intuitive sense of 
the aggregate effects. The present synthesis thus represents 
a genuine advance for the field, as it evaluates the effects 
of MBPs on separate cognitive domains, and also evalu-
ates key moderators such as age, clinical status, and MBP 
type. Moreover, the robust variance estimation meta-analytic 
approach was specifically selected to accommodate multiple 
effect sizes within studies, which avoided the averaging or 
simplifying of data.

Limitations of the Review

In spite of the clear strengths, limitations remain. Perhaps 
the most general limitation relates to the variability amongst 
study populations, MBPs, comparators and outcomes. In par-
ticular, the studies comprising the current ‘clinical’ dataset 
recruited from a range of populations, including individuals 
with neurocognitive, psychiatric or neurological disorders. 
Moreover, we were unable to evaluate the potentially mod-
erating effects of some MBP characteristics (e.g. the amount 
of teaching of mindfulness theory, the amount of ‘informal’ 
home mindfulness practice assigned or completed). These 
characteristics varied between studies and may contribute to 
unexplained variability in some statistical models. Half of 
the studies were actively-controlled, with these featuring a 
variety of comparator interventions, controlling for different 
aspects of MBPs. Lastly, the included cognitive outcomes 
spanned multiple domains; represented both pen-and-paper 
and computerized paradigms; and were scored and reported 
in a variety of ways.

1 3Neuropsychology Review (2022) 32:677–702

695

We sought to accommodate these sources of variability 
using subgroup analyses and meta-regression. Although 
meta-regression did not identify significant moderators, 
subgroup analyses returned a mixture of significant and non-
significant effects. It remains important to acknowledge the 
limitations of subgroup analyses and meta-regression, given 
that the former is prone to confounding (Spineli & Pandis, 
2020), and the latter low statistical power (Hempel et al., 
2013). Nevertheless, the continued publication of MBP stud-
ies will enable more powerful meta-regression analyses in 
future syntheses.

In the primary meta-analysis, we combined outcomes 
across cognitive domains. A previous meta-analysis cor-
roborated the view that tests generally measure more than 
one domain (Agelink van Rentergem et al., 2020), provid-
ing empirical support for the present all-domain analyses. 
Moreover, evidence syntheses of other nonpharmacological 
interventions also included pooled analyses (Mewborn et al., 
2017; Sherman et al., 2017). Nevertheless, this approach 
does not yield a true measure of overall cognitive function, 
and thus should be interpreted with a degree of caution. 
Lastly, the methodological rigor of individual studies was 
varied, with the most frequent finding being ‘Unclear’ risk 
of bias (only a minority of judgments yielded ‘Low’ risk 
ratings).

Implications of the Review

Firstly, it is worth acknowledging that the small magni-
tude of the primary meta-analytic estimate (g = 0.15; [0.05, 
0.24]). We encourage the interpretation of this with refer-
ence to the length of the included MBPs, which spanned six 
to 12 weeks. It remains possible that interventions deliv-
ered over a longer period, or in intensive retreat settings, 
might confer larger gains. The degree to which participants 
engage with mindfulness practices post-intervention may 
also contribute to longer-term cognitive effects. Evaluating 
this requires post-intervention follow-up assessments, which 
were generally lacking amongst present studies; where prac-
ticable, the inclusion of follow-up timepoints in future MBP 
trials will clarify the putative role of ongoing mindfulness 
practice.

Considering a general implication, we echo Van Dam 
et al. (2018) in encouraging methodological improvements 
in MBP research. Investigators are encouraged to compare 
MBPs to active comparators (either alone or in addition to 
inactive comparators, which may help to parse out practice 
effects). The increased use of active comparators will better 
enable specific and non-specific intervention effects to be 
disentangled. We recommend that studies be preregistered; 
that strict randomization procedures are implemented and 
reported;  and  that  data  are  analyzed  using  intention-to-
treat. We also encourage greater adoption of standardized 

cognitive measures – particularly those pertaining to execu-
tive function and working memory (e.g. the NIH Toolbox 
Cognition Battery, NIH EXAMINER). This promises to 
improve the validity, reliability and comparability of studies 
(Vago et al., 2019). Only a single study (Lebares et al., 2019) 
utilized such a test measure in the present review.

MBP  studies  combining  both  neurophysiological  and 
objective  cognitive measures are encouraged; electroen-
cephalography (EEG) is particularly well-suited to the study 
of time-sensitive executive function processes (Falkenstein 
et al., 1999; Van Veen & Carter, 2002). Indeed, error process-
ing and performance monitoring have already been measured 
via EEG in some MBP trials (Schoenberg & Speckens, 2014; 
Schoenberg et al., 2014). Future research will likely deline-
ate the specific MBP components driving cognitive benefits 
for specific populations and optimize delivery accordingly. 
Optimized MBPs will have the added benefit of reducing 
the variability that abounds in the way mindfulness is cur-
rently taught across different sectors of society. Whilst vari-
ability amongst MBPs constitutes a current limitation, in one 
respect, future reviews may consider encompassing greater 
variability. Namely, there is increasing interest in the digital 
delivery (e.g. via computer or smartphone) of both nonphar-
macological interventions in general, and MBPs specifically. 
Future syntheses may seek to focus on digitally-delivered 
MBPs, or even to compare different delivery modes. Variabil-
ity in participant motivation, and the degree to which it may 
moderate effects in MBP studies, is also a relatively under-
researched area. Whilst participant adherence may be used 
as a proxy for motivation, less than half of studies included 
here reported adherence data, precluding our evaluation of 
this putative moderator.

The present finding that MBPs improve cognition in older 
adults (≥ 60 years) but not adults (< 60 years) indicates that 
these interventions may help guard against cognitive decline, 
rather than improving cognitive skills more generally. Fur-
ther studies in older participants utilizing follow-up assess-
ments will enable this implication to be explored more fully.
A further consideration relates to the potential transfer 
of cognitive training effects. Interventions may improve 
performance on (i) the trained task; (ii) on closely related 
tasks; (iii) on distantly related tasks; and/or (iv) everyday 
cognitive functioning. Achieving improved performance 
on the trained task is considered easier than for untrained/
distal tasks (Simons et al., 2016). Returning to our present 
focus, mindfulness practices do not, ostensibly, share a 
great deal in common with cognitive test measures. In par-
ticular, the primary foci of mindfulness practices are sub-
jective and internal (e.g. thoughts, emotions). In contrast, 
cognitive measures exclusively utilize objective visual or 
auditory stimuli. In spite of these differences, the present 
review identified MBP effects on all-domain cognition, as 
well as for executive function and working memory. This 

1 3696

suggests that MBP training effects may partially transfer 
to cognitive activities beyond those directly involved in 
mindfulness practices.

Lastly, the rationale for this review was that the develop-
ment of greater mindfulness capacity might positively impact 
on  cognitive  function,  due  to  the  theorized  relationship 
between the components of mindfulness and specific neu-
rocognitive systems (Vago & Silbersweig, 2012). However, 
evaluating whether improvements to cognition do indeed 
manifest in parallel with increased mindfulness capacity (and 
whether this relationship holds for specific cognitive domains 
and mindfulness components) was beyond the scope of this 
review. Similarly, cognitive effects might be mediated by 
changes in emotional processing, or vice versa (Vago et al., 
2019); these putative mechanisms were not explored by this 
synthesis. Future investigations are encouraged to delineate 
these interesting and complex relationships.

Conclusion

This is the first systematic review and meta-analysis to eval-
uate objective, cross-domain cognitive outcomes reported by 
randomized MBP studies. In the primary analysis (pooling 
data across domains) we identified a small but significant 
effect on cognitive function. Specific effects were observed 
for executive function and for working memory (here con-
ceptualized as a subdomain of executive function), but not 
other individual domains. Small, significant effects were 
observed for studies of non-clinical, as well as older adult 
(≥ 60 years) samples, but not for studies of clinical, or adult 
(< 60  years)  samples.  In  addition,  we  found  that  MBPs 
outperformed inactive, but not active comparators. MBPs 
place strong emphasis on strengthening mental skills, and 
this review suggests that this translates to improved perfor-
mance on objective cognition. Future research is encouraged 
to adopt more rigorous methodology; to prioritize the stand-
ardized measurement and reporting of cognitive function; 
and to seek to identify the components of MBPs responsible 
for driving cognitive changes.
