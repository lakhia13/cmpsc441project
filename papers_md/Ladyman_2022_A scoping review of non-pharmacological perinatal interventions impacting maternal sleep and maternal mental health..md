Abstract 
Background:  A woman’s vulnerability to sleep disruption and mood disturbance is heightened during the perinatal 
period and there is a strong bidirectional relationship between them. Both sleep disruption and mood disturbance 
can result in significant adverse outcomes for women and their infant. Thus, supporting and improving sleep in the 
perinatal period is not only an important outcome in and of itself, but also a pathway through which future mental 
health outcomes may be altered.

Methods:  Using scoping review methodology, we investigated the nature, extent and characteristics of intervention 
studies conducted during the perinatal period (pregnancy to one-year post-birth) that reported on both maternal 
sleep and maternal mental health. Numerical and descriptive results are presented on the types of studies, settings, 
sample characteristics, intervention design (including timeframes, facilitation and delivery), sleep and mood measures 
and findings.

Results:  Thirty-seven perinatal interventions were identified and further described according to their primary focus 
(psychological (n 
in developed Western countries and published in the last 9 years. The majority of study samples were women with 
existing sleep or mental health problems, and participants were predominantly well-educated, not socio-econom-
ically disadvantaged, in stable relationships, primiparous and of White race/ethnicity. Interventions were generally 
delivered across a relatively short period of time, in either the second trimester of pregnancy or the early postnatal 
period and used the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) to measure sleep and the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression 
Scale (EPDS) to measure mood. Retention rates were high (mean 89%) and where reported, interventions were well 
accepted by women. Cognitive Behavioural Therapies (CBT) and educational interventions were largely delivered by 
trained personnel in person, whereas other interventions were often self-delivered after initial explanation.

Conclusions:  Future perinatal interventions should consider spanning the perinatal period and using a stepped-care 
model. Women may be better supported by providing access to a range of information, services and treatment spe-
cific to their needs and maternal stage. The development of these interventions must involve and consider the needs 
of women experiencing disadvantage who are predominantly affected by poor sleep health and poor mental health.

Background
During  the  perinatal  period,  physiological  changes 
(including  hormonal  changes),  psychological  adjust-
ments,  day  to  day  demands  of  infant  and  self-care,  and 
managing  shifts  in  employment,  finances  and  relation-
ships all play a part in increasing a woman’s vulnerability 
to  sleep  disruption  and  mood  disturbance  (e.g.,  symp-
toms of depression and anxiety). One in five women will 
experience  significant  depressive  symptoms  during  the 
perinatal  period  [1]  and  three  in  four  women  will  expe-
rience  insomnia  symptoms  [2],  poor  sleep  quality  [3]  or 
disrupted sleep [4]. The strong bidirectional relationship 
between sleep and mood is well recognised. Women with 
greater levels of depressive symptoms report more sleep 
disruption  [5],  and  women  with  poor  sleep  are  more 
likely  to  experience  depressive  symptoms  both  antena-
tally [6, 7], and postnatally [8, 9].

The sequelae of poor sleep and mood across the peri-
natal  period  are  significant.  Accumulating  evidence 
demonstrates  associations  between  poor  sleep  and 
gestational  diabetes  [10],  hypertension  [11],  pre-term 
birth  [12]  and  type  of  birth  (i.e.,  vaginal  vs.  caesarean) 
[13].  Studies  have  also  shown  that  poor  mood  is  asso-
ciated  with  adverse  obstetric  and  birth  outcomes  [14, 
15],  increased  infant  mortality  and  hospitalisation  [16], 
decreases  in  the  likelihood  of  breastfeeding  initiation 
[17],  early  breastfeeding  cessation  [18]  and  disruptions 
in  parent-baby  interactions  [19]. The  deleterious  effects 
of  poor  perinatal  mental  health  persist  beyond  infancy, 
with  children  of  depressed  mothers  having  impaired  or 
delayed  developmental  milestones  [20]  and  a  fivefold 
increase  of  experiencing  depression  themselves  dur-
ing  adolescence  [21].  Furthermore,  the  economic  costs 
of  perinatal  mental  health  are  significant.  For  example, 
a study assessing the costs and health-related quality of 
life losses over the lifetime of mothers and their children 
in the United Kingdom found that for all births in 2013, 
the costs of perinatal  anxiety  and  depression amounted 
to £6.6 billion, with 60% of the costs relating to the nega-
tive impact on children [22].

The  perinatal  period  represents  a  critical  life  stage 
where  “there  is  no  health  without  mental  health”  [23]. 
As  such,  the  World  Health  Organization  [24]  has  high-
lighted  the  urgent  need  for  “evidence  based,  cost  effec-
tive, and human rights oriented mental health and social 
care services in community-based settings for early iden-
tification and management of maternal mental disorders”. 
Addressing  maternal  mental  health  problems  requires 
many  approaches,  and  whilst  pharmacotherapy  is  the 
most  well  studied,  it  is  only  indicated  for  moderate  to 
severe illness. Less than 10% of women consider antide-
pressants  their  first  choice  of  treatment  [25]  and  report 
feeling  anxious  and  regretful  and  poor  adherence  when 

continuing  medications  during  the  perinatal  period  [26, 
27]. An international guideline review recommended the 
use  of  behavioural  interventions  before  antidepressants 
as an initial therapy for mild to moderate depression [28].
A  broad  range  of  non-pharmacological  interventions 
for  improving  maternal  mental  health  are  increasingly 
being  researched  and  show  promise  in  their  efficacy, 
acceptability,  and  accessibility,  and  improving  maternal 
wellbeing  by  addressing  sleep  difficulties  is  emerging  as 
a  viable  treatment  target.  Furthermore,  supporting  and 
improving  sleep  in  the  perinatal  period  is  not  only  an 
important  outcome  in  and  of  itself,  but  also  a  pathway 
through  which  future  mental  health  outcomes  may  be 
altered.  Recent  studies  have  shown  that  interventions 
aimed  at  improving  perinatal  sleep  help  reduce  depres-
sive symptoms [29, 30] and vice versa; interventions that 
reduce  depressive  symptoms  assist  in  improving  sleep 
[31, 32]. Previous reviews have described perinatal inter-
ventions  that  aim  to  improve  sleep  or  improve  mental 
health  [33],  or  examine  the  relationship  between  sleep 
and mental health during either pregnancy or the postna-
tal period. To our knowledge, there has been no recently 
published  review  of  perinatal  interventions  that  influ-
ence  both  maternal  sleep  and  maternal  mental  health 
outcomes.  Given  the  bidirectional  connections  between 
sleep and mood, the present review is focused on inter-
vention  studies  that  report  sleep  and  mood  outcomes 
concurrently and that are delivered at any point through-
out the perinatal period, pregnancy and one year postna-
tal inclusive.

Methods
To enable the synthesis of existing knowledge and iden-
tify the extent, range, and nature of evidence available on 
perinatal interventions that have measured the impact on 
both  sleep  and  mood,  a  scoping  review  was  conducted. 
Similar  to  systematic  reviews,  scoping  reviews  use  the 
same  systematic,  rigorous  approach  to  search  databases 
and extract data [34], but because they are aimed at iden-
tifying knowledge gaps, setting research agendas, and/or 
guiding  decision-making,  they  do  not  usually  include  a 
formal evaluation of the methodological quality of stud-
ies  [35,  36].  The  methodology  outlined  by  Arksey  and 
O’Malley [34], and expanded on by Levac et al. [37] and 
Tricco  et  al.  [38]  (including  the  PRISMA-ScR  reporting 
guidelines  [38]),  was  used  to  guide  the  study  processes 
and  reporting.  This  involved  the  following:  (1)  articula-
tion of the research question (2) identification of relevant 
studies, (3) selection of relevant studies using an iterative 
team-based approach, (4) charting data, and (5) collating, 
summarising and reporting results. PROSPERO registra-
tion was not possible because it does not accept scoping 
reviews.

Identifying the research question

The  intent  of  this  review  was  to  summarise  current 
knowledge and identify evidence gaps in this subject area 
to  inform  policy  and  practice  and  provide  recommen-
dations  for  future  research.  The  research  question  was 
defined  as:  ‘What  is  the  nature,  extent  and  characteris-
tics of interventions developed for perinatal women that 
influence  maternal  sleep  and  maternal  mental  health?’ 
This will include identifying when, where and what type 
of  studies  have  been  conducted,  describing  the  study 
methodologies  (settings,  sample  characteristics,  inter-
vention  length,  facilitation  and  delivery  measures  of 
sleep,  mood  and  acceptability),  and  summarising  sleep 
and mood findings.

mood  and  perinatal,  including  synonyms  and  medi-
cal  subject  headings  (MeSH  terms),  and  was  conducted 
in  the  Cochrane  Library,  PubMed,  Medline,  psycINFO, 
Web  of  Science,  CINAHL  Complete,  and  Scopus  data-
bases.  These  databases  were  systematically  searched 
using the Boolean string: “expect* mother*” OR maternal 
OR pregnan* OR postnatal OR perinatal OR postpartum 
OR  antepartum  OR  antenatal  AND  sleep*  OR  circadian 
AND  mental  OR  psycholog*  OR  psychiatric  OR  emo-
tional AND intervention* OR treat* OR therap* OR pilot 
OR feasibility. Non-peer reviewed literature and manual 
searches  of  academic  manuscript  reference  lists  were 
also  conducted  to  ensure  that  all  possible  interventions 
matching the inclusion criteria were identified.

Inclusion/exclusion criteria

Study selection

Full-text  articles  were  eligible  if  published  in  peer-
reviewed academic journals in the English language from 
1st  January  1975  to  1st  April  2021.  Randomised  con-
trolled  trials  (RCTs),  randomised  and  non-randomised 
cross-over  studies,  and  pre-post  studies  conducted  in 
community, clinical, and mixed settings from any country 
were included provided they: a) included adequate details 
of  an  intervention  (duration,  methods,  analysis  tech-
niques); b) the intervention covered any gestational week 
of pregnancy and/or postnatal week up to 12 months after 
birth; c) presented sufficient detail of pre- and post-inter-
vention data (either between-group or within- group); d) 
defined  the  gestational  or  postnatal  timeframe  for  inter-
vention  and  data  collection;  and  e)  reported  results  of 
at least one circadian OR sleep metric AND at least one 
measure  of  mental  health.  Relevant  sleep  metrics  were 
based  on  Buysse’s  [39]  model  of  sleep  health  and  could 
include sleep quantity, quality, latency, continuity, daytime 
sleepiness  and  sleep  timing.  Objective  or  self-reported 
measures of sleep were included but measures of fatigue 
were  excluded  due  to  this  construct  being  conceptu-
ally  and  psychometrically  distinct  from  sleepiness  [40]. 
Mental health measures included self-reported and clini-
cian  assessments  of  persistent  poor  mental  or  emotional 
health (such as symptoms of depression and anxiety) but 
excluded measures of stress (i.e., perceived level of stress, 
exposure  to  specific  stressors).  Pharmacological  inter-
ventions  were  excluded  as  were  reviews,  meta-analyses, 
observational  studies,  case  studies,  protocols,  editorials 
and  conference  abstracts.  All  studies  were  included  irre-
spective of the sociodemographic or health profile of par-
ticipants.  When  study  criteria  were  not  clear,  authors  of 
the original study were contacted.

Identifying the relevant studies

The  search  strategy  was  co-designed  in  collaboration 
with a medical librarian using key search terms for sleep, 

Endnote  reference  management  software  was  used  to 
import  and  manage  references.  The  initial  search  pro-
duced  4696  articles,  of  which  3035  were  duplicates, 
leaving  1661  for  initial  screening.  Titles,  abstracts  and 
keywords of the 1661 identified articles were reviewed 
and  1477  records  were  excluded  because  studies  had 
no intervention component; were not conducted in the 
perinatal  period;  the  article  was  a  review,  case  study, 
protocol  or  editorial;  the  study  did  not  include  moth-
ers  in  the  intervention;  or  had  no  sleep  and  psycho-
logical  data  (CL).  Full  text  records  of  the  remaining 
184 articles were read independently and a further 146 
articles  were  excluded  based  on  the  study  inclusion/
exclusion  criteria  (CL  and  TLS).  If  there  was  uncer-
tainty about the inclusion of a study, at least two mem-
bers of the extended research team discussed the study 
and reached consensus (BS, BB, KS). This resulted in 38 
studies considered central to the topic and included in 
the review. It should be noted that one study reported 
sleep  outcomes  for  only  approximately  one  third  of 
their  sample  [41].  Two  additional  articles  used  the 
same  sample,  but  each  manuscript  reported  different 
sleep  and  mood  measures.  Therefore,  38  articles  are 
listed  in  Table  1  but  only  37  study  samples/interven-
tions are described. Unless specifically referring to the 
38 articles, the remainder of the review refers to the 37 
studies/study samples/interventions. Fig. 1 outlines the 
study selection process.

Charting the data

A data extraction form was created jointly by CL and TLS 
in Excel and included the study characteristics and infor-
mation outlined in Tables 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and Figs. 2, 3, 
and 4. Figures 2, 3 and 4 illustrate the number of publi-
cations per year, intervention categories/timeframes and 
a  timeline  of  intervention  studies  respectively.  Table  1 
describes  the  author(s),  year  of  publication,  country  in

summarised  in  Tables  4,  5,  6  and  7  (depending  on  the 
type  of  intervention)  and  include  study  design,  method 
of intervention delivery, facilitator, length, data collection 
time  points,  number  of  participants  (including  break-
down  of  enrolled/completed,  case/control  and  reten-
tion  rates),  recruitment  sites/methods,  and  the  sleep 
and mood variable(s) assessed. A summary of sleep and 
mood  results  are  also  included  in  these  tables  as  a  sec-
ondary outcome of the review.

Results
Studies  were  conducted  in  the  United  States  (n = 12), 
Australia  (n = 7),  China  (n = 5),  Taiwan  (n = 5),  Canada 
(n = 3), New Zealand (n = 2), Iran (n = 1), Sweden (n = 1), 
and Turkey (n = 1). Fig. 2 illustrates the recent growth in 
this field, with 86% of studies published in the past dec-
ade (n = 32).

Demographic characteristics

Twenty-eight  of  the  eligible  study  samples  reported  a 
mean  maternal  age  between  30  and  35 years,  and  seven 
studies  reporting  a  mean  maternal  age  between  25  and 
30 years of age. Two studies did not report maternal age 
[53,  75].  Table  2  summarises  the  parity,  education  level, 
relationship  status,  socioeconomic  position  and  race/
ethnicity of the study samples. Based on information pro-
vided,  participants  in  these  studies  were  predominantly 
well-educated,  not  socio-economically  disadvantaged, 
in  stable  relationships,  primiparous  and  of  White  race/
ethnicity.

Eligibility criteria

Over half of the studies screened potential participants to 
include women experiencing moderate or severe current 
or  previous  mental  health  concerns  and/or  moderate  to 
severe sleep disruption (n = 19, 51%). Approximately one 

third of study samples had no restrictions on participants 
physical,  mental  and  sleep  health  status  (n = 11,  30%). 
Only one study assessed potential participants to ensure 
those who enrolled had no problems with their physical, 
mental  and  sleep  health,  whereas  six  samples  screened 
participants to ensure good health in one or two of these 
domains.

Study design

Of the 37 interventions included in this review, 26 uti-
lised a randomised controlled trial (RCT) study design, 
one  study  was  a  quasi-experimental  controlled  trial, 
and  10  studies  were  single  arm  pre-post  comparisons. 
Across  all  37  interventions,  4986  participants  were 
enrolled, and 4422 women completed the interventions 
(sample  size  range = 10  to  802,  median = 85).  Sam-
ple  sizes  were  smaller  in  single  arm  studies,  (total  278 
participants;  range  10–85)  whereas  RCT  study  designs 
were  generally  larger  (total  of  4513  participants;  range 
26–802).

Retention

Retention  rates  were  calculated  using  data  from  each 
manuscript.  The  mean  retention  rate  across  all  stud-
ies  was  89%  (range = 55  to  100%),  with  similar  rates 
for  the  different  study  designs  (84%  single  arm,  89% 
case-control).

Sleep, mood and acceptability measures

Over  half  the  studies  (51%)  used  the  Pittsburgh  Sleep 
Quality  Index  (PSQI)  as  a  sleep  measure  and  over 
three-quarters of the studies (81%) used the Edinburgh 
Postnatal  Depression  Scale  (EPDS)  as  a  mental  health 
measure. Table 3 presents the range of sleep and men-
tal  health  measures  used  in  the  studies.  Nine  stud-
ies  used  objective  sleep  measures  and  only  one  study

used  clinical  interview  for  their  mental  health  assess-
ment.  Just  over  a  quarter  of  the  studies  included  one 
or  more  follow-up  timepoints  past  intervention  end 
and less than a third reported on intervention accept-
ability. Just over a third of interventions were online or 
self-delivered,  with  the  remaining  being  delivered  in 
person.

Intervention categories

After  careful  review,  interventions  were  grouped  into 
4  general  categories  to  enable  further  description:  1) 

psychological, 2) educational, 3) lifestyle and 4) chrono-
therapeutic.  Psychological  interventions  (n = 9)  were 
those based on a treatment or therapy aimed at changing 
cognitions,  attitudes  or  emotions  and  founded  on  psy-
chological  theories.  Educational  interventions  (n = 15) 
focused  on  providing  participants  with  practical  infor-
mation  and  strategies  to  improve  or  support  mood 
or  sleep  (maternal  or  infant).  Lifestyle  interventions 
(n = 10)  used  a  range  of  methods  to  intervene,  includ-
ing exercise, massage, listening to music, and consuming 
various  herbal  teas.  The  final  category  of  interventions,

chronotherapeutic (n = 3), included studies based around 
changes to the timing of the circadian system or the tim-
ing of sleep. Interventions could incorporate components 
from more than one category, for example, a chronother-
apeutic intervention could also include some educational 
material but was categorised as chronotherapeutic based 
on the key focus of the intervention.

Figure  3  illustrates  the  four  identified  categories 
(inner),  the  focus  of  the  intervention  (middle),  and  the 
intervention  timeframe  (outer).  Twenty-one  studies 
were  conducted  in  the  postnatal  period  (57%),  14  were 
conducted  during  pregnancy  (38%)  and  only  two  stud-
ies  spanned  both  pregnancy  and  the  postnatal  period 
(5%).  The  tendency  for  interventions  to  be  delivered  in 
the  postnatal  period  was  similar  across  all  categories  of 
intervention,  except  psychological  interventions,  where 
five studies (56%) were conducted in pregnancy and four 
studies (44%) in the postnatal period.

Figure  4  shows  the  timing  of  recruitment  and  inter-
vention  phases  of  each  study.  Amongst  the  14  interven-
tions commencing in pregnancy, only one study recruited 
solely in the first trimester, four recruited in the first and 
second trimesters, seven in the second and third trimes-
ters  and  three  in  the  third  trimester.  The  intervention 
phase  of  these  studies  was  conducted  predominantly  in 
the second trimester; with eight conducted exclusively in 
the second trimester, three spanned the second and third 
trimesters, two studies were conducted solely in the third 
trimester and one commenced in the third trimester and 
continued into the postnatal period. Seventeen of the 22 
studies conducted in the postnatal period began recruit-
ment  within  3  months  of  birth.  Three  studies  began 
recruitment  at  3  months  postnatal  and  the  remaining 
two studies recruited between 6 and 7 months postnatal. 
Across  all  studies,  the  intervention  length  ranged  from 
5  days  to  6  months  (mean  6.5 weeks);  26  studies  (70%) 
lasted 6 weeks or less, eight studies (22%) lasted between 
8 and 12 weeks and three studies (8%) lasted 6 months or 
more.

Psychological interventions

The  nine  psychological  interventions  identified  in  this 
review  centred  around  mindfulness  (n = 4)  [32,  50,  55, 
64]  and  cognitive  behavioural  theory  (CBT)  (n = 5) 
[30,  31,  46,  65,  68].  Table  4  provides  a  summary  of  the 
interventions.

CBT interventions

(CBTi)  and  included  information  about  maternal  and 
infant  sleep  [30,  65,  68],  while  two  further  studies  used 
generic CBT and focussed on maternal mental health [31, 
46].  One  study  did  not  report  who  facilitated  the  inter-
vention  or  how  it  was  delivered  [31],  while  four  studies 
were facilitated by a trained CBT therapist or clinical psy-
chologist,  with  three  conducting  face-to-face  individual 
or group sessions [30, 65, 68] and one using online deliv-
ery [46]. Improving both sleep and mood were the focus 
of three studies [30, 31, 68], while one study concentrated 
on  mood  as  a  primary  outcome  and  sleep  as  a  second-
ary outcome [65] and another study did the reverse [46]. 
All  CBT  interventions  recruited  women  experiencing 
either  moderate  to  severe  depressive  symptoms  (n = 2) 
[31, 46], moderate or severe insomnia (n = 2) [30, 68] or 
both (n = 1) [65]. Three studies reported on acceptability 
measures: one study reported 95% of participants found 
the intervention important and helpful [46]; another that 
77% of participants felt “satisfied” or “very satisfied” with 
the care provided [31]; and a further study reported 54% 
of  participants  enjoyed  the  group  environment  and  62% 
enjoyed the education component [68].

Measures  and  findings 
In  general,  the  CBTi  interven-
tions  reported  improvements  in  both  sleep  and  mood, 
with  group  improvements  or  group  differences  in  both 
sleep  quality  and  insomnia  symptoms  [30,  65,  68].  One 
of these studies reported on sleep diary and actigraphy (a 
validated  and  objective  motion-based  measure  of  sleep) 
results,  finding  sleep  efficiency  was  improved,  however 
they  noted  mixed  results  for  other  dimensions  of  sleep 
[68].  Mental  health  measures  were  improved  in  all  CBTi 
studies (depression symptoms in two studies [30, 65] and 
depression and anxiety symptoms in the other study [68]). 
The  two  CBT  studies  that  utilised  RCT  methodology 
largely reported improvements in mental health measures 
when comparing the intervention and control groups [31, 
46], however one study found improvements in two meas-
ures  of  mental  health  (MADRS  and  GAD)  but  not  the 
third (EPDS) [46]. One CBT study found improvements in 
self-reported sleep quality [31], but the other did not find 
differences between groups for insomnia symptoms [46]. 
There was no follow-up past the intervention end for any 
of the CBT intervention studies.

Mindfulness interventions

Characteristics  Of  the  five  CBT  interventions,  three 
occurred  during  pregnancy  [30,  46,  68]  and  two  during 
the postnatal period [31, 65] and ranged from five to 10 
weeks in duration. Three studies used CBT for insomnia 

Characteristics  All  four  mindfulness  interventions  [32, 
50, 55, 64] were self-delivered or administered using apps 
or recordings after participants were provided with instruc-
tions. Two interventions were delivered during pregnancy 
[50, 64]  and  two  during  the  postnatal  period  [32, 55]  and 

 Ladyman et al. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth          (2022) 22:659

they ranged in length from two to 8 weeks duration. Three 
of  the  four  studies  involved  women  with  moderate  to 
severe depressive symptoms [32, 50, 64]; the fourth had no 
eligibility criteria [55]. Improving sleep and mood concur-
rently were the focus of three studies [32, 50, 55], while the 
fourth study focussed on mood as a primary outcome and 
sleep as a secondary outcome [64]. Three studies reported 
on  acceptability,  with  two  studies  noting  that  67  and  69% 
of the sample were “very” or “extremely” satisfied [32, 50], 
while the other study reported that 96% of participant’s had 
a “somewhat” or “very positive” experience [55].

Measures and findings  Overall, participants in mindful-
ness interventions reported improvements in both sleep 
and mood. Two single-arm mindfulness studies reported 
within-group  improvements  immediately  post  interven-
tion  for  both  sleep  quality  and  mental  health  measures 
(depression  symptoms)  [32,  50].  Another  single-arm 
study  reported  a  decrease  in  depressive  symptoms  and 
improvements  in  both  sleep  quality  and  duration  (but 
not  sleep  efficiency  or  latency)  [55].  Only  one  mindful-
ness  intervention  had  follow-up  time  points  after  the 
intervention end and was also the only study that used an 
RCT [64]. This study reported between group differences 
on  depressive  and  anxiety  symptoms  but  not  on  sleep 
quality  measures.  It  also  found  within  group  differences 
in  depressive  symptoms  immediately  post  intervention 
and  in  late  pregnancy,  but  not  at  6 weeks  postnatal,  and 
within  group  differences  in  anxiety  symptoms  immedi-
ately post intervention and at both follow-up time points.

Educational interventions

The 14 educational interventions identified in this review 
focussed on either maternal health (n = 5) [29, 57, 60, 73, 
74], infant health (n = 5) [41, 47, 48, 59, 61] or a combi-
nation  of  both  (n = 4)  [49,  62,  63,  69,  70]  (70  &  71  used 
the  same  sample).  Table  5  provides  a  summary  of  the 
interventions.

Maternal health interventions

Characteristics  Five  maternal  health 
interventions 
[29,  57,  60,  73,  74]  ranged  from  4  to  24 weeks  in  dura-
tion.  Four  occurred  during  pregnancy  and  one  during 
the  postnatal  period  [57].  Four  of  the  five  studies  used 
an  RCT  design,  and  all  had  similar  session  schedules: 
1–2-hours in duration, weekly or fortnightly, over a time 
period of 4–12 weeks, the shortest consisting of four ses-
sions  over  4  weeks  and  the  longest  consisting  of  eight 
sessions  over  12 weeks. The  fifth  study  was  a  single  arm 
pilot which ran 1–2-hour education sessions in the first, 

second and third trimesters of pregnancy (three sessions 
over 24 weeks) [29]. All five of these interventions utilised 
face-to-face  delivery;  three  studies  provided  individual 
education  sessions  [29,  57,  74],  one  study  used  group 
education  sessions  [73]  and  one  utilised  both  modes 
[60]. Four interventions were considered ‘individualised’, 
‘tailored’ or ‘interactive’, catering to the sleep and health 
needs  of  the  participant  [29,  60,  73,  74]. The  facilitators 
of the education sessions varied and included; a sleep sci-
entist  (n = 1)  [29],  registered  nurse/midwife  (n = 3)  [57, 
73, 74] and an allied health professional (n = 1) [60]. Two 
studies  recruited  women  with  either  current  or  previ-
ous mental health symptoms [29, 74], one study included 
women with current mental health symptoms as well as 
an  obstetric  complication  [73],  and  two  studies  had  no 
eligibility  criteria  [57,  60].  The  content  of  the  interven-
tions  ranged  widely.  One  study  focussed  on  improving 
sleep  [29],  two  centred  on  obstetric  issues  and  mental 
health  concerns  [73,  74]  and  two  had  a  broader  lifestyle 
and  health  focus  (e.g.,  nutrition,  exercise,  sleep,  stress) 
[57, 60].

Measures  and  findings 
Improving  both  sleep  and 
mood  were  primary  outcomes  for  four  studies,  and 
one  study  concentrated  on  reducing  weight  gain  as 
a  primary  outcome  and  sleep  and  mood  as  second-
ary  outcomes  [60].  Significant  results  were  found  for 
all  primary  outcomes,  but  no  change  was  seen  for  any 
secondary  measures  in  these  studies. The  three  studies 
measuring  sleep  quality  and  the  two  studies  reporting 
on  insomnia  symptoms  found  improvements  within  or 
between groups [29, 57, 60], particularly for sleep qual-
ity,  but  not  across  all  follow-up  time  points  [29]  or  all 
dimensions  of  sleep  [29,  57].  Two  of  the  three  studies 
investigating  sleep  duration  found  that  intervention 
groups  slept  longer  [73,  74]  however  the  one  study 
examining  daytime  sleepiness  found  no  difference 
between  intervention  and  control  groups  [29].  Depres-
sive symptoms improved in three out of the six studies 
[29, 73, 74], but not at follow-up for one [29]. One study 
that  examined  overall  psychological  health  found  that 
the  intervention  group  remained  stable  while  the  con-
trol group deteriorated [57]. The two studies examining 
anxiety  symptoms  found  no  difference  between  groups 
[29, 60].

Only  one  study  reported  on  acceptability  measures, 
with  86%  of  participants  reporting  the  intervention  was 
‘definitely’  a  positive  experience  and  93%  reporting  they 
would  ‘definitely’  recommend  the  study  to  others  [29]. 
This was also the only study to have follow-up measures 
past the conclusion of the intervention.

Infant sleep interventions

Characteristics  Five  studies  were  classified  as  infant 
sleep interventions [41, 47, 48, 59, 61], ranging from 2 to 
26 weeks in duration. Four of the interventions were sim-
ilar, in that they were conducted solely during the postna-
tal period. Only one intervention spanned late pregnancy 
through  until  4  months  postnatal  [47].  All  studies  had 
relatively  large  cohorts  with  between  72  and  802  enrol-
ments  and  high  retention  rates  (> 82%).  Only  one  study 
had  health  requirements  for  eligibility  (good  mental, 
physical and sleep health) [59], while the remaining stud-
ies had no mental, physical and sleep health criteria.

Four  of  the  five  studies  were  similar  in  their  aims  and 
delivery  style:  all  aimed  to  provide  information  about 
infant  sleep  and/or  establish  infant  sleep  management 
plans  via  an  initial  face-to-face  individual  session,  with 
subsequent  weekly  or  fortnightly  follow-up  sessions 
(either face-to-face or telephone) over a 2–8-week period 
[41,  48,  59,  61]. These  four  interventions  were  delivered 
by health professionals (midwife, paediatrician or mater-
nal  health  nurse).  All  but  one  of  these  interventions 
(which  did  not  provide  information)  [59],  reported  that 
the  sessions  were  either  ‘individualised’  or  ‘tailored’  to 
the  mother’s  (and  in  one  case,  mother  and  father’s  [61]) 
concerns about their infant’s sleep.

The fifth study varied from those above, and was a longer 
6-month  RCT  intervention  with  four  arms  covering  a 
more  holistic  range  of  material,  primarily  infant  sleep, 
with  additional  support  on  breastfeeding,  nutrition  and 
exercise  (supplementary  to  normal  infant  care  from  an 
infant  health  nurse)  [47].  This  intervention  combined 
group and individual sessions, included partners and was 
facilitated by a researcher with infant sleep training and a 
lactation consultant.

Measures  and  findings  Two  of  the  five  infant  sleep 
education  interventions  identified  maternal  sleep  and 
mood  as  primary  outcomes  [47,  59],  while  another 
study  also  had  maternal  mood  as  a  primary  outcome, 
with  maternal  sleep  as  a  secondary  outcome  [41].  The 
two  remaining  studies  assessed  infant  sleep  (n  = 2)  as 
primary  outcomes  with  maternal  mood  and  sleep  as 
secondary  outcomes  [48,  61].  Three  of  the  five  stud-
ies  had  follow-up  periods  past  the  intervention  end 
date  [41,  47,  48].  Three  of  the  five  studies  reported 
improvements  in  maternal  sleep  quality  (either  pre-
post  or  between  groups)  immediately  post  interven-
tion [41, 59, 61] and one study saw improvements at the 
2-month follow-up but not immediately [48]. Maternal 
sleep  duration  results  were  mixed,  with  two  studies 

reporting  improvements  (one  immediately  [41]  and 
one at follow-up [48]), while two studies saw no differ-
ence  or  improvement  [47,  61].  Four  of  the  five  studies 
saw improvements in maternal mood immediately post 
intervention  [41,  48,  59,  61],  however,  the  two  studies 
that  included  follow-up  at  2-months  post  interven-
tion  had  conflicting  findings  on  the  longevity  of  these 
improvements [41, 48].

Four  of  the  five  studies  measured  acceptability.  Helpful-
ness was rated in two studies; one intervention was rated 
by 75% of women as helpful [61] and another had ratings 
of  73–100%  for  the  helpfulness  of  individual  strategies 
[59] (e.g., ‘putting infant in bed, awake but drowsy’). The 
remaining  two  studies  rated  satisfaction  and  usefulness 
on visual analogue scales (8.2 and 8.4 (out of 9) [41], the 
other 7.7 and 7.3 (out of 10) respectively [48]).

Combined maternal and infant sleep interventions

Characteristics  Although  there  were  four  interven-
tions that encompassed both maternal and infant sleep, 
two were very similar, being a pilot [62] and RCT [63] of 
the  same  TIPS  (Tips  for  Infant  and  Parents  Sleep)  pro-
gram.  This  intervention  was  similar  to  the  infant  inter-
ventions describe above, in that a nurse guided an initial 
face-to-face  individual  session,  with  subsequent  weekly 
follow-up telephone calls over a 4- to 5-week period that 
were  ‘individualised’  to  the  mother’s  concerns.  Another 
maternal/infant  intervention  was  a  5-day  intensive 
residential  program,  with  a  range  of  medical  clinicians 
providing  multidisciplinary  assistance  and  support  to 
mother  and  baby  (two  manuscripts  providing  different 
data on the same intervention) [69, 70]. The last mater-
nal/infant sleep intervention was an RCT study, provid-
ing sleep information and strategies to women and their 
partners  over  two  1.5 hr.  face-to-face  group  sessions  in 
late  pregnancy  [49].  It  had  three  follow-up  data  time 
points  in  the  postnatal  period  and  was  facilitated  by  a 
sleep psychologist.

Measures  and  findings  While  the  TIPS  pilot  study 
found  sleep  duration  and  self-reported  sleep  problems 
were  significantly  different  between  groups  (but  not 
sleep  quality,  24 hr.  TST,  and  sleep  disruptions),  the  full 
TIPS RCT did not. Mood related measures did not differ 
in  either  the  pilot  or  full  RCT.  Acceptability  and  usabil-
ity  measures  were  well  described  with  only  one  woman 
in the pilot [62] and eight women in the RCT indicating 
that  would  not  re-participate  [63].  The  residential  pro-
gram  intervention  found  improvements  to  mood  out-
comes and most sleep related measures (except duration) 

 Ladyman et al. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth          (2022) 22:659 

Page 46 of 52

but did not report on follow-up data or program accept-
ability [69, 70]. The joint mother and partner RCT study 
focussed  on  sleep  as  a  primary  outcome  and  found  dif-
ferences in sleep quality and insomnia symptoms at some 
but  not  all  time  points  [49].  No  differences  were  seen 
for  daytime  sleepiness.  Depression  and  anxiety  symp-
toms were secondary outcomes, and no differences were 
seen on either measure. No acceptability measures were 
reported.

Lifestyle interventions

Eleven  studies  were  classified  as  lifestyle  interven-
tions,  including;  drinking  herbal  tea  (n = 3)  [42,  43, 
71],  listening  to  music  (n = 1)  [53],  massage  (n = 2) 
[44,  56]  and  incorporating  exercise/movement  (n = 5) 
[45, 52, 54, 67, 72]. Table 6 provides a summary of the 
interventions.

Herbal tea interventions

Characteristics  The three herbal tea interventions were 
largely similar in design; all were RCTs requiring women 
to drink one cup of tea a day for 2–3 weeks and all were 
aimed  at  women  experiencing  poor  sleep  health  in  the 
early postnatal period [42, 43, 71].

Measures  and  findings  All  three  studies  used  the 
PSQS  to  assess  sleep  and  the  EPDS  to  evaluate  mood 
(both  primary  measures)  with  measures  completed 
immediately  post  intervention  and  an  additional  fol-
low-up  timepoint  2–3 weeks  past  the  intervention  end. 
Both  the  chamomile  and  magnolia  tea  interventions 
found the intervention group to have improved physical 
sleep  related  symptoms  immediately  post  intervention, 
though  not  at  follow-up,  and  fewer  depressive  symp-
toms at both post intervention time points compared to 
controls [42,  71]. The lavender tea intervention did not 
find  a  between  group  difference  in  sleep  and  although 
depressive  symptoms  were  better  immediately  post 
intervention,  this  difference  was  also  apparent  at  base-
line and did not extend through to the follow-up time-
point  [43].  Study  samples  for  the  three  studies  ranged 
between  80  and  112  participants  and  retention  rates 
were  above  90%,  however  none  of  the  studies  reported 
on intervention acceptability.

Music interventions

Characteristics  One  RCT  intervention  explored  lis-
tening  to  music  as  a  strategy  for  improving  sleep  and 
mood  [53].  This  intervention  was  aimed  at  women  in 

their second trimester experiencing poor sleep. Like the 
tea  drinking  interventions,  music  was  self-guided  over 
2 weeks, with women required to listen to one of five pre-
recorded CDs for a minimum of 30-minutes at bedtime.

Measures  and  findings  Both  the  intervention  and  con-
trol  groups  reported  better  sleep  quality,  with  the  inter-
vention  group  having  greater  improvement  compared 
to  controls. Within  and  between  group  differences  were 
found for anxiety symptoms at intervention end. Partici-
pant retention was 95% and there were no follow-up time 
points past intervention end or acceptability information.

Massage interventions

Characteristics  Two 
interventions  utilised  massage, 
with very different study designs. One intervention inves-
tigated the effect of ten 20-minute massages over 5 weeks 
for women in their second trimester, delivered by trained 
massage  therapists  [44].  The  second  intervention  was 
conducted  in  the  second  half  of  the  first  postnatal  year, 
with 123 mothers massaging their infants nightly over 2 
weeks [56]. The only physical, mental or sleep health eli-
gibility  criteria  was  for  the  infant  massage  intervention 
which required mothers to be physically healthy.

Measures and findings  Even though the recipients of 
the  massage  were  different,  maternal  sleep  and  mood 
were  primary  measures  in  both  studies.  Within  and/
or between group sleep and mood results were varied. 
The  maternal  massage  study  found  sleep  disturbance 
improved  for  the  intervention  group  from  baseline  to 
intervention end but there was no difference for other 
sleep  metrics  [44].  This  study  found  improvements  in 
immediate  (beginning  to  end  of  massage)  depressive 
and anxiety symptoms and longer-term improvements 
(baseline to intervention end) on the PAAS Pregnancy 
subscale,  but  not  on  the  other  PAAS  subscales  or  on 
the  CES-D.  The  infant  massage  study  found  mothers 
in  the  intervention  group  had  greater  improvement 
in sleep quality, fewer night wakings and fewer moth-
ers  were  designated  as  poor  sleepers  post  interven-
tion  [56].  However,  there  was  no  difference  between 
groups  for  daytime  sleepiness  symptoms,  bedtime, 
sleep latency, sleep duration or the time spent awake at 
night.  Similarly,  there  were  mixed  findings  for  mood, 
with  no  difference  between  groups  for  depressive  or 
anxiety  symptoms,  but  a  significant  improvement  in 
mood from baseline to weeks one and two. This study 
also  reported  that  between  83%  (week  one)  and  91% 
(weeks  two)  of  mothers  were  ‘somewhat  satisfied’  or 
‘very  satisfied’  with  the  routine  and  69%  of  mothers 

Ladyman et al. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth          (2022) 22:659 

Page 47 of 52

were  ‘very  likely’  to  continue  the  recommended  rou-
tine in the future.

Exercise/movement interventions

Characteristics  Five  studies  were  movement  or  exer-
cise-based interventions [45, 52, 54, 67, 72]. Four studies 
used  RCT  and  one  study  employed  a  quasi-experimen-
tal  [54]  study  design,  with  relatively  large  cohorts  (62–
140  enrolments)  and  high  retention  rates  (> 82%).  The 
sole  intervention  occurring  in  pregnancy  was  a  weekly 
20-minute tai chi/yoga group session, delivered face-to-
face  by  a  qualified  yoga  instructor  over  3  months  [45]. 
The  four  postnatal  interventions  were  similar  in  design 
to  each  other,  in  that  they  involved  self-delivered  (after 
instruction)  moderate  to  high  intensity  aerobic  exer-
cises  involving  either  walking  [54],  gymnastic  exercises 
[72]  or  home  exercise  equipment  (stationary  bicycle 
or  treadmill)  [52,  67].  Three  of  the  four  aerobic  inter-
ventions  lasted  3  months  [54,  67,  72]  with  only  one  of 
these  studies  providing  contact  and  support  to  partici-
pants  throughout,  via  access  to  an  online  forum  [67]. 
The fourth aerobic intervention lasted 6 months and was 
the  only  study  in  this  category  that  provided  11  indi-
vidualised  support  phone  calls  and  also  covered  addi-
tional  health  information  (stress  reduction,  nutrition 
and  sleep)  [52].  Three  studies  recruited  women  with 
either  current  or  previous  poor  mental  health  [45,  52, 
67] and one study recruited women with poor sleep [54]. 
The  remaining  study  had  no  mental,  physical  and  sleep 
health criteria [72].

Measures  and  findings  Three  exercise  interventions 
identified maternal sleep and mood as primary outcomes 
[45, 54, 72], while another study also had maternal mood 
as a primary outcome, with maternal sleep as a secondary 
outcome [52]. The remaining study assessed feasibility as 
its  primary  outcomes  with  maternal  mood  and  sleep  as 
secondary outcomes [67]. While three of the five studies 
had mid-intervention data collection time points, none of 
the five studies had follow-up periods past the interven-
tion end date [54, 67, 72].

Only  one  study  (the  face-to-face  yoga/tai  chi  inter-
vention)  observed  between  group  differences  on  both 
sleep  and  mood  [45].  The  6-month  study,  with  support 
phone  calls,  found  mixed  findings  for  mood  measures, 
with  participants  reporting  fewer  depressive  symp-
toms  post  intervention  on  the  EPDS  and  PHQ,  but  not 
when  assessed  using  clinical  interview  (DSM-IV)  [52]. 
There  were  also  no  changes  in  sleep  in  this  study.  The 
three  remaining  self-delivered  studies  had  either  no 

improvements in mood or sleep measures [67], reported 
significant differences in both the intervention and con-
trol  groups  [72]  or  reported  a  group  difference  on  one 
sleep measure (fewer physical symptoms related to sleep 
inefficiency) mid intervention but not at intervention end 
[54].

Two of the five studies measured acceptability, with one 
study  reporting  specific  health  and  wellbeing  benefits 
(i.e., reducing muscular pain) for between 36 and 50% of 
participants [72]. The other study had a key focus on fea-
sibility  and  acceptability  and  reported  comprehensively 
on  these  topics  [67]  and  whilst  exact  percentages  were 
not reported, it was stated that ‘almost all women’ liked 
the  convenience,  accessibility  and  flexibility  of  the  pro-
gram  and  that  ‘a  majority’  of  women  suggested  it  had  a 
positive effect on exercise engagement.

Chronotherapeutic interventions

Two studies used bright light therapy (BLT) [51, 66] and 
one  study  trialled  sleep  restriction  in  either  the  first  or 
second half of the night [58]. Table 7 provides a summary 
of the interventions.

Bright light therapy interventions

Characteristics,  measures  and  finding  The  two  BLT 
studies  required  women,  who  were  early  in  the  postna-
tal period, to wear light therapy glasses (visors) daily for 
30–60 minutes  within  the  first  hour  of  waking.  One  of 
the BLT interventions also included a brief discussion of 
sleep  hygiene  principles  prior  to  using  the  glasses  [51]. 
This  2-week  intervention,  that  utilised  an  RCT  design, 
found no difference for either sleep or mood post inter-
vention.  This  small  study  (n = 10)  found  improvements 
in  depressive  symptoms  and  sleep  efficiency,  but  no 
improvement  in  other  aspects  of  sleep.  It  also  found  a 
significant correlation between the phase angle difference 
(PAD) of melatonin and sleep onset and percent change 
in  SIGH-SAD  score  (lengthening  of  the  PAD  was  asso-
ciated  with  greater  improvement  on  SIGH-SAD).  One 
study  discussed  acceptability,  reporting  high  adherence 
rates  to  the  treatment  protocol  and  that  the  device  was 
well tolerated by participants [66].

Early‑night and late‑night wake therapy intervention

Characteristics,  measures  and  finding  Recruitment  for 
this study spanned the entire perinatal period except for 
the  6 weeks  prior  to  birth  [58].  It  involved  a  single-arm 
cross-over trial of one night of early-night wake therapy 

 Ladyman et al. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth          (2022) 22:659 

Page 48 of 52

(EWT,  sleep  between  3:00–7:00 am)  versus  late-night 
wake  therapy  (LWT,  sleep  between  9:00 pm–01:00 am) 
in  physically  healthy  women.  EWT  showed  greater 
improvement  in  mood  in  depressed  pregnant  women 
compared  to  postnatal  women;  LWT  showed  greater 
improvement in mood for depressed postpartum women 
compared to pregnant women. Results also showed that 
improved  mood  in  pregnant  women  after  EWT  was 
associated with smaller PAD i.e., less time between mela-
tonin onset and sleep onset. Improved mood in postpar-
tum  women  after  LWT  was  associated  with  increased 
total sleep time. This study did not report on intervention 
acceptability.

Discussion
This scoping review identified and summarised the range 
and  nature  of  37  perinatal  interventions  that  aimed  to 
influence  sleep  and  mood  outcomes.  The  studies  were 
grouped  into  either  psychological,  educational,  lifestyle 
or chronotherapeutic categories depending on the inter-
vention’s  key  focus  and  ranged  from  those  grounded  in 
sleep  and  circadian  science  to  those  based  on  comple-
mentary  and  alternative  therapies.  Our  literature  search 
showed that this field is rapidly growing, indicated by the 
number of studies published in the last 5 years, most fre-
quently in developed Western countries (USA, Australia, 
New Zealand and Canada).

Most  interventions  started  within  3  months  of  birth 
and  were  delivered  across  a  relatively  short  period  of 
time. The short delivery timeframe is likely to be advan-
tageous from a participant burden perspective and assist 
with engagement and retention. However, retention rates 
did  not  appear  to  be  lower  for  longer  interventions.  On 
the  contrary,  most  studies  that  provided  data  showed 
high retention rates, despite occurring during a challeng-
ing and busy life stage. These high retention rates suggest 
that  women  are  interested  in,  and  are  open  to,  support 
during  the  perinatal  period,  particularly  in  relation  to 
sleep and mental health.

For  some  women,  mental  health  concerns  that  com-
mence  in  pregnancy  are  chronic  and  remain  years  later 
[29]. However, there is reliable evidence that intervening 
in  sleep  and  mental  health  early  in  pregnancy  [76],  may 
prevent  the  onset  of  difficulties  later  in  pregnancy  and 
postnatally.  However,  only  four  of  the  37  interventions 
in  the  review  recruited  women  in  their  first  trimester 
of  pregnancy  highlighting  a  gap  in  early  and  preventive 
perinatal  interventions.  Additionally,  only  two  interven-
tions  spanned  both  pregnancy  and  the  postnatal  period 
and, as far as we are aware, there are no perinatal health 
interventions  with  a  sleep  or  mental  health  focus  that 
cover pre-conception to pregnancy even though women 

have  voiced  a  strong  desire  for  information  at  this  time 
[77]. Future interventions may better support women by 
spanning  a  longer  period  and  broadening  their  focus  as 
factors that influence both sleep health and mental health 
change across this timeframe. For example, shifting from 
solely  focusing  on  maternal  sleep  during  pregnancy  to 
also  including  information  and  strategies  to  support 
infant sleep.

Over  half  of  the  studies  were  conducted  with  women 
with  existing  sleep  or  mental  health  problems,  and  the 
sleep  health  and  mental  health  of  study  samples  were 
described  for  many  of  the  studies,  which  is  expected 
given  the  focus  of  the  interventions.  In  contrast,  there 
was  often  limited  information  provided  on  other  demo-
graphic characteristics of the study samples, particularly 
the socioeconomic position and race/ethnicity of women. 
Only  two  interventions  were  specifically  designed  for, 
or trialled with, women from minority or disadvantaged 
groups  [45,  51]  (i.e.,  women  from  indigenous  or  minor-
ity  ethnic  groups,  women  experiencing  socio-economic 
disadvantage,  women  with  low  education/literacy  levels 
or  teenage  mothers).  Interventions  that  meet  the  needs 
and priorities of these women are vital given women who 
experience  disadvantage  are  disproportionately  affected 
by poor mental and sleep health [78–80].

None  of  the  studies  reviewed  explicitly  stated  that 
the  interventions  were  designed  in  collaboration  with 
women, although it is possible that this did occur but was 
not acknowledged. To ensure the content and focus of the 
information  and  intervention  is  appropriate,  culturally 
based  information  is  incorporated  [81,  82],  and  suitable 
methods  and  modes  of  delivery  are  considered,  inter-
ventions  need  to  be  co-designed  with  perinatal  women, 
their  family  members,  and  relevant  clinical,  health  and 
community  stakeholders.  In  Aotearoa  New  Zealand,  for 
example, perinatal sleep and mood interventions must be 
developed by or in collaboration with Māori and Pacific 
women, family and whānau, and Māori and Pacific health 
providers. This approach has been shown to be effective 
in  the  design  and  development  of  other  public  health 
interventions in minority populations [83, 84].

It is also important to note that all studies in this review 
were person-centric and focused on changing a woman’s 
thoughts  or  behaviour  (or  infant’s  behaviour).  Interven-
tion  at  an  individual  level  has  an  important  role,  but 
the  structural  and  social  determinants  of  mental  health 
and  sleep  health,  such  as  racism,  socioeconomic  dep-
rivation,  poor  housing,  limited  education,  violence,  and 
chronic life stress are also critically important in the peri-
natal  period  [85]  and  must  be  addressed  through  policy 
and  action  by  government  and  associated  agencies,  and 
community engagement [86]. Thus, alongside the devel-
opment  and  application  of  perinatal  interventions  there 

Ladyman et al. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth          (2022) 22:659

must  be  a  broader  range  of  work  to  reduce  the  social 
drivers  of  sleep  health  and  mental  health  inequities  for 
women.

availability of technology and therapy preference are also 
important options to consider when women are choosing 
perinatal care that is right for them.

Women with existing sleep or mental health problems 
may  also  experience  multiple  comorbid  issues  includ-
ing,  for  example,  other  health  conditions,  alcohol  and 
substance  abuse,  and  dietary  concerns.  Furthermore,  in 
many countries, Aotearoa New Zealand included, health 
services  that  can  provide  support  for  sleep  or  mental 
health  concerns  and  deliver  interventions  are  very  lim-
ited  [87]  and  are  often  only  able  to  engage  with  women 
who  are  experiencing  the  most  severe  difficulties.  Find-
ings  from  the  review  indicate  that  interventions  can  be 
delivered using a range of methods from online delivery 
with  no  or  minimal  personal  contact  through  to  live-in 
residential  programmes.  Given  the  restrictions  created 
through  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  the  continued  use  of 
online  information  and  virtual  visits  in  delivering  such 
interventions  is  important  to  explore,  but  access  and 
effectiveness  for  all  women  must  also  be  considered. 
While  the  reviewed  interventions  hold  promise,  barri-
ers  to  accessibility  and  help-seeking  must  be  taken  into 
account and interventions may need to incorporate self-
recognition  of  issues,  encouragement  to  seek  help  and 
pathways to care.

Although  there  was  some  overlap  between  the  meth-
ods used and focus of interventions, such as education in 
conjunction with psychological therapy, there is potential 
for  greater  integration.  Together  these  findings  suggest 
the  following:  there  is  space  for  prevention  therapies  to 
work  alongside  intervention  models  of  care;  that  sleep 
and mood interventions could be integrated into routine 
perinatal care and support for other issues that perinatal 
women  may  be  facing;  and  that  interventions  should  be 
provided within a stepped care model and span a broader 
range of methods depending on the woman’s health con-
cerns  (mild  vs  severe  symptoms,  comorbid  vs  singular 
issues) or ability to participate in different formats (online 
vs in person delivery). For example, empirical, high qual-
ity, easily accessible information about sleep and mental 
health could be provided to all women via websites, apps 
or  written  material  that  also  address  a  range  of  perina-
tal  topics.  Women  that  begin  or  continue  to  experience 
difficulties  with  sleep  and/or  their  mental  health  need 
to  be  able  to  access  further  support  in  a  timely  manner. 
This might involve women being able to enrol or engage 
with  an  intervention  directly  and/or  assessment  by  an 
informed  health  care  provider  and  referral  to  appropri-
ate  services.  Depending  on  the  issues  women  face  and 
the degree of severity, intervention options may need to 
be both specific (i.e., a course of bright light therapy) or 
broad  (i.e.,  further  education  in  conjunction  with  CBTi 
and  admission  to  residential  care).  Proximity  to  care, 

A  clear  finding  from  the  review  was  the  lack  of  fol-
low-up timepoints to determine if any improvements in 
either sleep or mental health persisted over longer peri-
ods  of  time. Those  that  did  collect  follow  up  data  show 
mixed  findings  (long  term  improvement  in  five  studies, 
short  term  but  no  long-term  improvement  in  six  stud-
ies,  no  short  term  or  long-term  improvement  in  eight 
studies,  and  no  short-term  improvement  but  long-term 
change in two studies). A recently published study found 
that CBTi delivered in a community sample over multi-
ple  time  points  during  pregnancy  and  postpartum  was 
associated  with  improved  insomnia  severity  and  sleep 
disturbance  in  late  pregnancy  and  at  24 months  post-
partum, but not at 12 months postpartum [88], suggest-
ing  that  within  the  immediate  postpartum  timeframe 
making measurable changes to sleep may be difficult to 
achieve but that there are long term benefits to support-
ing sleep at this time.

Across all interventions, a majority reported improved 
sleep and mood and the primary study outcomes tended 
to be significantly changed by the intervention. Although 
this sounds encouraging, it also highlights a possible bias 
in the publishing of studies with positive effects for sleep 
and mood and in the participating women who enrol in 
studies focused on these health outcomes.

As is the norm for scoping reviews, it was not the pur-
pose  of  the  present  review  to  assess  the  quality  or  effi-
cacy of studies or to comment on whether one category 
or  type  of  intervention  may  be  more  or  less  effective. 
However,  there  is  certainly  a  need  for  future  research 
that  evaluates  the  efficacy,  acceptability  and  cost  effec-
tiveness  of  different  types  of  interventions.  In  doing  so, 
the  clinical  implications  of  results  must  also  be  consid-
ered. This may prove challenging, as the present review 
found  limited  and  varied  use  of  clinically  significant 
outcome  measures,  such  as  clinically  validated  thresh-
olds  for  sleep  and  mental  health  scales.  Consideration 
must  also  be  given  to  the  rigour  of  measures  employed 
in  assessing  intervention  efficacy.  Only  one  study  in 
the  present  review  utilised  structured  diagnostic  inter-
views to determine the presence of mental health disor-
ders and only nine studies employed objective measures 
of  sleep,  with  the  large  majority  relying  on  self-report 
measures.  Furthermore,  only  12  studies  in  this  review 
reported on acceptability. It is recommended that stud-
ies seek acceptability feedback from participants to allow 
future perinatal interventions to be tailored and further 
refined to women’s needs.

Limitations of the review include limiting the review 
to  studies  published  only  in  the  English  language, 

 Ladyman et al. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth          (2022) 22:659

after  1975.  The  review  used  online  databases  only, 
but these are considered to contain most of the peer-
reviewed  health-related  research.  Accordingly,  it  is 
possible  that  some  studies  were  not  identified  using 
the search strategies outlined in this paper. Exclusion 
of  studies  that  did  not  fit  the  methodological  criteria 
or  were  outside  the  designated  perinatal  timeframe 
was undertaken by one author, but the remaining 184 
full  text  articles  were  considered  independently  for 
inclusion  by  two  authors.  Although  important,  inter-
ventions exploring infant sleep and infant health out-
comes were outside the scope of this research and not 
included as part of this review.

Conclusions
In  summary,  there  is  a  rapidly  growing  body  of  litera-
ture  on  sleep  and  mood  focused  interventions  during 
the  perinatal  period  which  indicates  the  importance  of 
this  field.  The  high  prevalence  of  sleep  and  mood  dis-
turbances  in  the  perinatal  period  can  have  severe  and 
extended  repercussions  for  mothers,  children,  families 
and  communities  and  perinatal  sleep  complaints  and 
mental  health  problems  remain  widely  under-recog-
nised,  under-researched  and  under-treated.  Due  to  the 
strong  bi-directional  relationship  between  sleep  and 
mood,  treating  or  preventing  issues  in  one  area  has 
great potential to treat or prevent concerns in the other. 
Sleep  is  also  a  less  stigmatised  pathway  through  which 
mental  health  concerns  can  be  addressed.  We  recom-
mend  that  future  interventions  consider  supporting 
perinatal women over an extended period of time using 
a  stepped-care  model,  such  that  basic  sleep  and  mood 
information is readily available to all women as part of 
routine  perinatal  care  which  could  prevent  problems 
occurring  or  issues  escalating,  and  that  as  required, 
women  can  access  an  integrated  range  of  therapies 
that  are  specific  to  their  needs.  The  development  of 
these perinatal interventions must involve and consider 
the  needs  of  women  from  minority  groups  or  women 
experiencing  disadvantage  who  are  disproportionately 
affected by poor sleep health and poor mental health in 
the perinatal period.
