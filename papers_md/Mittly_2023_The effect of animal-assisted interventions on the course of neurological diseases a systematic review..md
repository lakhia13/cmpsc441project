Abstract 
Background  In our experience, working with a therapy animal strengthens endurance, maintains motivation, 
provides a sense of achievement, and boosts overall mental resilience. The aims of this work were to summarize 
the results of quantitative research on the possibilities of animal‑assisted intervention (AAI) among people with neu‑
rodegenerative and cerebrovascular diseases and to attempt to assess the effects of animal‑assisted interventions 
in an objective manner and to find supporting evidence based on published literature.

Methods  Our target groups are people diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis, or stroke. A systematic 
search of relevant articles was conducted by two independent researchers in April 2021 and August 2023. The search 
for studies was conducted using PubMed, Google Scholar, Web of Science, Scopus, and Ovid databases, specifying 
keywords and search criteria. The qualitative evaluation of the research reports was conducted by four independent 
researchers, using the Newcastle–Ottawa Quality Assessment Form.

Results  According to the scientific criteria and based on the Newcastle–Ottawa Quality Assessment Form, thirteen 
publications met the search criteria, out of which 9 publications were rated good and 4 publications were rated poor. 
Evaluating the publications we found evidence that AAI had a measurable impact on participants, as their physical 
and mental health status significantly improved; however, mental health improvement was more prominent.

Conclusions  By developing evidence‑based research methodology and standardized research settings, AAI could 
be measured effectively as part of health care practice. This would bring significant benefits to the rehabilitation 
of patients in need.

Background
The therapeutic use of animals goes back several decades. 
Animal-assisted  interventions  in  healthcare  institutions 
and  among  patients  are  widespread  worldwide  [1,  2]. 
Clinicians  and  rehabilitation  professionals  consider  the 
involvement  of  therapy  animals  as  an  effective  comple-
mentary therapy option, which can greatly assist doctors 
and  therapists  in  encouraging  patients  to  achieve  thera-
peutic goals.

Approximately  40%  of  those  in  need  of  rehabilitation 
have  a  neurological  problem  underlying  their  functional 
impairment.  According  to  a  study,  more  than  half  of 
those affected by a cerebrovascular event develop speech 
and/or  motor  function  impairment,  and  only  about  one 
third of them are able to resume their previous job. Due 
to the nervous system’s plasticity, the regular practice of 
specific tasks and daily skill development can help restore 
impaired function [3].

Besides  stroke,  the  effects  of  animal-assisted  inter-
ventions  have  also  been  examined  in  many  studies  in 
other  areas  of  neurorehabilitation.  Dog-assisted  therapy 
carried  out  with  Parkinson’s  disease  patients  has  been 
shown  to  have  a  positive  effect  on  motor  performance, 
mood, and quality of sleep [4]. The introduction of dog-
assisted therapy for these patients was recommended by 
several experts to improve gait and balance and to treat 
depression,  mood  disorders,  apathy,  and  anxiety  often 
associated  with  the  disease  [5].  Equine-assisted/dog-
assisted therapy has been successfully used with patients 
with multiple sclerosis. As a result of the rhythmic move-
ment,  the  torsional  and  extension  motions  of  the  trunk 
musculature led to a significant reduction in lower limb 
spasticity  and  an  improved  sense  of  balance.  In  addi-
tion,  psychosocial  effects  of  the  therapy  have  also  been 
reported  among  these  patients,  who  reported  that  their 
quality  of  life  improved  as  a  result  of  animal-assisted 
therapy [6, 7]. Hammer et al. found that animal-assisted 
therapy  had  a  positive  effect  on  the  subjects’  gait,  bal-
ance, coordination, and muscle strength [8]. The above is 
supported  by  another  research  study  conducted  among 
people  with  multiple  sclerosis.  According  to  this  study, 
quality  of  life  indicators  significantly  improved  among 
people  in  the  intervention  group.  Based  on  their  scores 
on  the  Berg  Balance  Scale,  their  balance  and  coordina-
tion improved, and they became more confident in their 
movements [9].

Animal  therapy  can  be  implemented  in  several  ways. 
Animal-assisted  intervention  is  a  goal-oriented  activity 
for  healing  (AAT,  animal-assisted  therapy)  and/or  rec-
reation (AAA, animal-assisted activity), which is carried 
out with animal involvement. In animal-assisted therapy, 
a  trained  therapy  animal,  a  trained  therapy  animal  han-
dler,  and  a  professional  with  expertise  in  the  respective 

field  who  knows  the  individual  or  group  work  together 
to  carry  out  a  goal-oriented  and  personalized  therapeu-
tic intervention. In animal-assisted activity, however, only 
the  beneficial  effect  of  the  presence  of  the  therapeutic 
animal is utilized, primarily for recreational purposes and 
to improve quality of life [2].

Two issues definitely need to be clarified in connection 
with  AAA  and  AAT.  First,  the  question  of  efficacy,  i.e., 
whether the positive clinical experiences that make AATs 
so popular can actually be measured in terms of clinical 
effectiveness (i.e., both symptom reduction and improve-
ment in quality of life) and, if so, what the active impact 
factors of AATs might be. Based on several years of expe-
rience in animal-assisted intervention, our research team 
found animal-assisted intervention to be highly beneficial 
for  the  mental  and  physical  well-being  of  both  children 
and  adults.  The  aim  of  the  present  systematic  review  is 
to summarize the results of quantitative research on the 
possibilities of animal-assisted activity or therapy among 
people  with  neurodegenerative  and  cerebrovascular  dis-
ease. The rationale for this topic is demonstrated by the 
significant  rates  of  functional  impairment  that  develop 
and  persist  as  a  result  of  the  abovementioned  diseases. 
Our  further  aim  is  to  provide  a  scientific  approach  to 
the  effects  of  animal-assisted  interventions,  to  objectify 
them,  and—based  on  a  summary  of  the  reviewed  stud-
ies—to identify evidence.

The  target  populations  of  the  reviewed  literature 
include people with Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclero-
sis,  and  stroke.  The  rehabilitation  methods  of  these  dis-
eases  share  the  common  property  that  AAI  is  used  as  a 
complementary  therapy,  e.g.,  in  addition  to  rhythm  and 
music  therapy  or  ergotherapy,  and  the  aim  is  rehabilita-
tion and improving the patients’ quality of life.

Methods
We conducted our search on these three diseases. In the 
selected  literature,  only  one  publication  mentions  Par-
kinson’s disease patients and one mentions patients diag-
nosed  with  multiple  sclerosis  without  quantifying  them. 
The  subjects  of  the  other  eleven  studies  were  stroke 
patients. The literature predominantly presents AAI and 
related  research  on  people  with  mental  disorders;  how-
ever, we decided not to include this in the search criteria, 
so that our focus would be more consistent and clear.

Search strategy

Our  review  was  previously  registered  at  PROSPERO 
(registration  number:  CRD42021255776).  A  systematic 
search  for  relevant  articles  was  performed  by  two  inde-
pendent researchers on 21 April 2021, on 29 April 2021, 
and  was  repeated  on  29  August  2023.  To  obtain  greater 
coverage  of  possible  articles  for  our  study  we  executed

the  search  in  multiple  databases.  Besides  Pubmed,  we 
searched  an  additional  four  databases:  Google  Scholar, 
Web  of  Science,  Ovid,  and  Scopus.  Based  on  relevant 
studies in this field, this combination should cover more 
than  90%  of  all  relevant  references  [10,  11].  These  stud-
ies were identified using the following terms and boolean 
operators: ("animal assisted therapy" OR "animal assisted 
intervention" OR "animal assisted activity" OR "pet ther-
apy"  OR  "dog  assisted"  OR  "canine  assisted"  OR  "equine 
assisted"  OR  hippotherapy)  AND  (stroke  OR  "multiple 
sclerosis" OR Parkinson OR neurodegenerative OR neu-
romusculoskeletal). The range of year of publication was 
between 2001 and 2023.

Selecting studies, inclusion, and exclusion criteria

To ensure that selected articles met all the inclusion crite-
ria, title, abstract, and full text of records identified from 
the search were independently screened for eligibility by 
two  researchers.  The  following  criteria  were  applied  for 
inclusion in our systematic review:

•  Studies conducted on animal-assisted intervention
•  Involving  adult  patients  suffering  from  stroke,  Par-

kinson’s disease, or multiple sclerosis

In  addition  to  randomized,  controlled  trials,  we  also 
included  non-randomized,  non-controlled  studies,  as 
only  a  few  randomized  controlled  trials  had  been  con-
ducted  in  this  field  and  we  sought  to  present  as  many 
study  designs  as  possible.  Reports  on  children,  publica-
tions on assistance or service dogs, case reports, system-
atic  reviews  and  meta-analyses,  and  studies  conducted 
on  robotic  animals  were  excluded.  Discrepancies  were 
resolved  through  discussion  between  the  two  review 
authors or by seeking advice from a third author. Publica-
tions  in  English  were  included.  Duplicate  records  in  the 
search  results  were  removed  using  EndNote  Web.  Fig-
ure 1 shows the PRISMA flow chart of our study’s iden-
tification and selection process. An additional file shows 
the  PRISMA  checklist  of  our  systematic  review  (see 
Additional file 1).

Data extraction

Assessment  Form.  This  scale  is  one  of  the  most  used 
methods  for  assessing  the  quality  of  non-randomized 
studies  in  systematic  reviews  and  meta-analyses.  Its 
widespread  use  has  led  to  a  shared  understanding  and 
acceptance  of  its  criteria  and  scoring  system  among 
researchers and reviewers. The Newcastle–Ottawa Qual-
ity Assessment Form provides clear criteria for assessing 
study quality, making the assessment process more trans-
parent.  Being  well-structured,  the  Newcastle–Ottawa 
Quality  Assessment  Form  provides  a  well-based  frame-
work for evaluating multiple domains of study quality.

We assessed eight items, grouped into three categories:

1. Selection of the study groups
2. Comparability of the groups
3. Outcome of the study

Studies were graded as good quality if they met 6 to 8 
criteria, fair quality if they met 5 to 7 criteria, and poor 
quality if they met 0 or 1 point in the selection category 
or 0 points in the comparability category or 0 or 1 point 
in the outcome category.

We decided not to execute a meta-analysis for the fol-
lowing  reasons:  Although  statistical  methods  are  avail-
able  for  quantifying  the  heterogeneity,  there  are  many 
qualitative differences in the enrolled studies which limit 
the interpretation of any comparison among them, inde-
pendently from any kind of formal quantification. Firstly, 
these  are  different  neurodegenerative  conditions  with 
different  pathomechanisms.  Secondly,  all  investigated 
conditions  have  significant  inherent  clinical  heterogene-
ity,  characterized  by  different  subtypes  and  many  forms 
of clinical manifestations which also hinder any compari-
son.  Thirdly,  the  enrolled  studies  were  not  homogenous 
according to severity, age of onset, symptom lengths, and 
level of disability. Fourthly, considering treatment, differ-
ent  clinical  protocols  were  administered  that  cannot  be 
standardized statistically.

All of the abovementioned factors hinder the interpret-
ability  of  any  kind  of  quantitative  statistical  approach; 
therefore,  we  decided  to  conduct  a  stand-alone  system-
atic review without meta-analysis.

Data extraction from all included studies was completed 
by four independent authors. The following information 
was extracted from each eligible article: the first author’s 
name, year of publication, sample size, targeted diseases, 
measurement  tools  and  methods  (e.g.  questionnaires), 
and follow-up results.

Details  of  the  abovementioned  13  articles  are  presented

assessment are summarized in Table 3.

Quality assessment

The  quality  of  each  study  was  evaluated  by  four  inde-
pendent  authors  with  the  Newcastle–Ottawa  Quality 

tions used in the research.

In  their  study,  Bunketrop  et  al.  (2017  and  2020) 
assessed  whether  multimodal  equine-assisted  inter-
ventions  targeting  functional  deficits  and  behavioral

limitations  are  effective  and  whether 
functional 
improvement  is  sustained  in  the  late  phase  after 
stroke.  According  to  the  evaluation,  the  proportion 
of  people  who  observed  improvement  was  higher  in 
the  experimental  groups,  with  higher  scores  in  gait 
ability,  balance,  and  working  memory,  respectively. 
The  improvements  were  sustained  at  3  months  and 
6 months, as well [17, 15].

A  study  by  Beinotti  et  al.  (2013)  investigated  the 
impact of equine-assisted therapy on the quality of life 
of stroke patients. The functional capacity, physical fit-
ness,  and  mental  health  of  the  subjects  significantly 
improved in each area of the SF-36 questionnaire, com-
pared to the control group [13].

Beinotti et al. (2010) examined the impact of equine-
assisted  therapy  on  the  re-learning  of  gait  in  hemipa-
retic  stroke  patients.  Compared  to  the  control  group, 
equine-assisted  therapy  significantly  improved  lower 

limb  motor  function  and  balance  in  the  experimental 
group [12].

In  their  study,  Berardi  et  al.  (2022)  investigated  the 
impact  of  equine-assisted  therapy  on  activities  of  daily 
living, quality of life, mood, balance, and gait in patients 
with  Parkinson’s  disease.  Equine-assisted 
therapy 
resulted  in  statistically  significant  improvements  in  the 
occupational performance, mood, quality of life, gait, and 
balance of the participants [14].

Bunketrop  et  al.  (2019)  examined  whether  therapeu-
tic  riding  and  rhythm  and  music  therapy  have  an  effect 
on functional mobility in the late phase of stroke. In the 
equine-assisted therapy group, immediate and sustained 
improvement  was  shown  in  short-term  gait  ability.  The 
music  therapy  group  showed  measurable  improvement 
only  at  the  6-month  measurement.  The  study  confirms 
the  beneficial  effects  of  equine-assisted  therapy  on  gait 
and  functional  task  performance  in  the  late  phase  of 
post-stroke rehabilitation [16].

Prospective controlled study

Sunwoo et al. (2012) analyzed the effects of therapeutic 
riding on motor skills in adults with brain disorders. The 
balance  and  gait  of  patients  significantly  improved  as  a 
result of equine-assisted therapy. The study indicates that 
equine-assisted  therapy  improves  the  balance  and  gait 
speed of people with chronic brain disorders [23].

Lee  et  al.  (2014)  investigated  the  effects  of  equine-
assisted  therapy  on  balance  and  gait  among  adult 
stroke  patients.  In  the  experimental  group,  significant 
improvement  was  found  in  balance,  gait  speed,  and  gait 

asymmetry,  while  in  the  control  group,  only  gait  asym-
metry was significantly improved. The research indicates 
that by improving balance and increasing step length and 
gait speed, therapeutic riding may reduce the risk of falls 
overall [18].

Machová  et  al.  (2019)  examined  the  benefits  of  dog-
assisted therapy as a complementary therapy in the reha-
bilitation  of  stroke  survivors  concerning  physiological 
and  psychological  status.  Compared  with  the  baseline 
measurements, there was no significant decrease in heart

rate  and  systolic  blood  pressure  in  either  group  at  the

in the subjective well-being of patients who had received 
AAT [20].

In  their  research  study,  Peppe  et  al.  (2017)  analyzed 
whether the motor and non-motor symptoms in patients 
with Parkinson’s disease could be improved in the short 
term  by  using  equine-assisted  therapy.  According  to  the

results, all participants in the study showed improvement 
in motor skills; however, this was not significant. The step 
length  increased,  the  stance  and  double  stance  percent-
ages  decreased,  and  their  attention,  balance,  mood,  and 
quality of life improved in their short-term analysis [21].

Macauley  examined 

the  effectiveness  of  dog-
assisted  speech  therapy  for  patients  with  aphasia  and 
its  impact  on  patient  motivation.  According  to  the 
results,  the  patients  felt  that  they  had  made  more 

progress during the AAT sessions and had been more 
motivated  to  undergo  therapy  combined  with  AAT. 
The  effectiveness  of  AAT  was  reflected  in  subjective 
measures;  the  patients  perceived  the  therapy  as  more 
enjoyable, they were more motivated, showed a wider 
range  of  emotions,  and  became  more  open  in  their 
communication [19].

In  their  study,  Rondeau  et  al.  (2010)  examined  the 
impact of the therapy dog as a therapeutic method and 
as a walking aid in the rehabilitation of stroke patients. 
In  the  presence  of  a  therapy  dog,  gait  speed  and  gait 
pattern  improved  significantly  in  all  cases.  According 
to their results, practicing with a therapy dog improves 
these  scores  of  patients  significantly  more  than  using 
other aids [22].

The  study  of  Palsdottir  et  al.  (2020)  aimed  to  ana-
lyze  the  impact  of  equine-assisted  therapy  on  the  par-
ticipants’ daily engagement and perceived health and to 
understand  what  the  interventions  might  mean  for  the 
participants’  daily  lives.  The  scores  of  perceived  health 
were  higher  among  those  receiving  equine-assisted 
therapy [24].

Discussion
In our study, we attempted to review the available meth-
ods  for  quantification  of  the  effectiveness  of  AAI,  based 
on published literature. Since AAI is a diverse field, both 
qualitative and quantitative research methodologies were 
used in the reviewed publications. Therefore, we consid-
ered  it  necessary  to  review  both  evidence-based  studies 
and published methods aiming to measure the effective-
ness of AAT.

Main findings

To  summarize  the  original  findings  of  our  review, 
although  there  are  multiple  research  about  AAT  and 
many  best  practices  were  published,  the  quantitative 
comparison  of  best  practices  is  not  possible  because  of 
the lack of standardized methodology and lack of stand-
ardized  research  protocols.  As  the  quality  assessment 
scores of the reviewed studies show there are only a few 
appropriate  research  methods  in  this  field.  Our  origi-
nal  findings  suggest  that  AAT  is  an  emerging  adjunc-
tive  treatment  in  the  rehabilitation  of  various  disorders, 
which  has  gained  significant  popularity.  Future  studies 
with  homogenized  patients’  groups  and  standardized 
methodology are needed to increase the comparability of 
the  studies  and  therefore  provide  more  robust  evidence 
of the efficacy of AAT. Thus, based on the results, we may 
conclude that AAI significantly improved both the physi-
cal  and  mental  well-being  of  participants,  but  the  men-
tal  improvement  was  more  outstanding.  According  to 
the  results,  the  physical  rehabilitation  achieved  by  AAI

is slower, while psychological coping can be facilitated in 
the short term by the therapy animal.

In‑depth comparison of the reviewed research

Of  all  the  research  studies  we  reviewed,  three  stud-
ies  examined  the  effects  of  animal-assisted  intervention 
on  participants  based  on  how  the  intervention  comple-
menting  the  usual  treatment  impacted  them  (Beinotti 
2010, 2013, Machová). In addition, two articles examined 
the  effect  of  animal-assisted  interventions  carried  out 
in  addition  to  standard  therapy,  and  the  effects  of  other 
additional interventions besides standard therapy (Buke-
ntrop 2017, 2019).

This is supported by Palsdottir’s research. In their study, 
participants  spent  30  min  with  effective  equine-assisted 
therapy  once  a  week,  complementing  this  by  patients 
spending 60 min connecting with each other, attuning to 
the  therapy  animal,  and  preparing  for  the  joint  activity 
(social  connection,  building  bridges).  This  is  an  impor-
tant  intervention  from  both  the  musculoskeletal  and 
the mental perspectives. From Palsdottir’s  research, it is 
clear that AAI induced significant positive changes in the 
patients’ mental state. Machová et al. indicated that those 
patients who received AAT felt better despite showing no 
significant  changes  in  heart  rate  or  blood  pressure.  The 
beneficial  effect  of  AAT  on  patients’  well-being  is  also 
demonstrated by the subjective mood ratings on a Likert 
scale that patients completed before and after the session. 
By improving the mood of the patients, AAT has an indi-
rect  impact  on  the  successful  rehabilitation  of  patients. 
It  encourages  proactivity  in  the  treatments  they  receive, 
improves their interaction with other therapists, and thus 
improves their relationship with the whole team provid-
ing the treatment (Machová, 2019).

In  the  studies  we  reviewed,  the  use  of  horse-assisted 
interventions  was  over-represented  compared  to  dog-
assisted ones; however, the results of the research studies 
suggest  that  horses  are  more  likely  to  assist  with  physi-
cal development, while dogs are more likely to assist with 
mental  and  social  development.  Beinotti,  Bunketorp, 
Lee,  and  Sunwoo  et  al.  supported  the  beneficial  effects 
of  equine-assisted  therapy  on  balance,  gait  function, 
and  hand  and  arm  use.  However,  Peppe’s  small  sample 
size study found that a 5-week course of equine-assisted 
therapy in Parkinson’s patients improved motor skills and 
also reduced anxiety and apathy among participants. The 
developmental  impact  of  a  dog-assisted  intervention  is 
supported by the results of Machova and Macaulay. They 
found that dog therapy increased motivation, mood, and 
self-reliance in stroke survivors.

Limitations

Clarity is made difficult by the fact that concepts of AAT 
are still not applied uniformly, as experts do not refer to 
exactly the same things by them. Despite this incongru-
ity,  we  tried  to  use  the  terminology  related  to  animal-
assisted intervention consistently. Thus, we used the term 
“dog-assisted  therapy”  for  interventions  with  dogs  and 
“equine-assisted  therapy”  for  interventions  with  horses, 
but the activities carried out in the studies with dogs and 
horses differ from one study to another.

Another important limitation is the diversity of meas-
urement  tools.  Physical  (gross  motor  function,  fine 
motor function, and balance) and mental changes (mood, 
motivation,  and  well-being)  are  measured  very  differ-
ently,  making  it  difficult  to  compare  results.  From  the 
publications  we  analyzed,  we  have  identified  approxi-
mately  thirty  different  scales,  such  as  FAC,  Fugl-Meyer 
Scale, BBS, NIHSS SIS, TUG, Timed 10 m-WT, M-MAS 
(UAS)  for  the  measurement  of  physical  changes,  and 
STAI,  OVal-pd,  EQ-VAS/EuroQol-VAS  SMBQ  for  the 
measurement  of  mental  changes.  There  are  also  tools 
that  measure  both  physical  and  mental  states,  such  as 
the  MOSF36  SF.  There  are  also  measurement  tools  that 
we  identified  in  several  publications,  e.g.,  TUG,  Barthel 
index, and Timed 10 m-WT.

Also,  an  important  limitation  is  the  disproportion-
ality  of  studies  with  different  species.  In  the  literature 
reviewed,  equine-assisted  therapy  is  over-represented 
(3 therapies with dogs, 10 therapies with horses), but we 
have no information on the number of AAI in the world 
and the proportion of dog-assisted therapies and equine-
assisted  therapies,  and  on  how  many  of  these  attempts 
to  measure  the  impact  of  animal  therapy.  Our  research 
team  could  analyze  only  published  papers.  It  is  a  well-
known fact that in past centuries, in the case of dogs and 
horses  (as  opposed  to  other  animals),  cooperation  with 
humans was a main selection criterion during the course 
of  breeding,  and  both  species  have  a  long  tradition  of 
being involved in tasks and being specifically trained.

The quality of the published research varies widely. In 
the present review article, we examined thirteen publica-
tions with the following results: 9 publications were rated 
good,  and  4  publications  were  rated  poor.  One  possible 
reason for this may be the scarcity of available literature 
on the topic that meets the criteria and the novelty of the 
research  field.  Due  to  the  small  number  of  papers  pub-
lished on this topic and meeting our quality criteria, we 
did not limit the scope of the present review to one group 
of  animals,  one  disease,  or  one  type  of  animal-assisted 
intervention.  The  low  number  of  quality  articles  pub-
lished  posed  a  challenge  to  our  research.  On  one  hand, 
this  paints  an  incomplete/distorted  picture  of  this  form 
of  complementary  rehabilitation;  on  the  other  hand, 

Mittly et al. Systematic Reviews          (2023) 12:224 

Page 13 of 15

it  also  draws  attention  to  the  fact  that  there  have  been 
very  few  studies  of  appropriate  excellence  on  this  topic. 
Since  this  field  has  been  undergoing  explosive  develop-
ment, our study calls attention to the fact that many more 
qualitative  research  studies  are  necessary  to  provide  an 
overview of the subject. Besides the low number of qual-
ity  publications,  the  other  major  limitation  was  meth-
odological  heterogeneity.  Although  the  definitions  are 
provided and there is literature that specifies criteria, e.g., 
for  animal-assisted  therapy,  on  reviewing  the  research 
reports  we  found  that  these  definitions  are  not  used 
consistently  in  practice.  Furthermore,  we  could  find  no 
information  on  whether  there  are  comparable  forms  of 
quality  control  measurement  in  place  in  different  coun-
tries,  and  due  to  their  absence,  the  use  of  measurement 
tools  and  interventions  may  differ  from  one  country  to 
another, or even from one research study to another. The 
length of musculoskeletal and social interventions varies. 
The interventions range from a few weeks or months to 
complex  programs  lasting  a  year.  This  makes  it  difficult 
to compare the effectiveness of AAIs of varying lengths.

In most studies, AAT was used as an adjuvant to con-
ventional  medical  therapy,  but  the  studies  do  not  pro-
vide  clear-cut  information  on  whether  patients  with 
similar illness severity were selected in the experimen-
tal and control groups. Therefore, as mentioned earlier, 
quantitative  comparison  of  efficacy  has  major  limita-
tions.  Although  Parkison’s  disease  seems  to  be  associ-
ated with a higher efficacy of AAT than MS, we cannot 
draw  definite  conclusions  due  to  significant  confound-
ers  such  as  the  great  variability  of  the  severity,  symp-
toms, and course of the conditions. Affected brain areas 
can be very different even in the case of one particular 
disease, which may have direct effects on psychomotor 
functions.  There  are  many  psychological  confounding 
factors (mood, apathy, level of motivation, locus of con-
tol, etc.) which also affect the response to any interven-
tion. Another important factor is the great variability of 
the  studies  and  the  lack  of  standardized  methodology 
for  measuring  efficacy.  Future  studies  with  standard-
ized  assessment  and  methodology  and  more  homog-
enous  participants  groups  considering  psychomotor 
functions, disease severity, and mental health state can 
be eligible for quantifying efficacy differences.

Strengths

As interest in  AAT has grown rapidly and the number 
of  scientific  publications  on  the  subject  has  increased 
significantly  over  the  last  15  years,  there  has  been  an 
increasing need for both providers and users to review 
the state of the art in AAT. An important strength of the 

paper is that it attempts to investigate the effectiveness 
of  AAT  by  summarizing  highly  heterogeneous  studies 
that  differ  in  methodology,  quality,  and  target  group. 
The  publication  following  the  2006  peer-reviewed 
paper,  which  met  the  selection  criteria  in  terms  of 
quality,  is  from  2010,  followed  by  papers  published 
in  2013  and  2014.  The  fact  that  7  of  the  publications 
we  analyzed  were  written  in  the  past  7  years  suggests 
that interest in the topic has increased in recent years, 
with more and more people using AAI. The number of 
research  studies  on  AAI  is  growing,  and  its  literature 
is expanding at a faster pace. A further strength of our 
paper is that the approach presented in the review pro-
vides a quality framework for the development of meth-
odological features for future research. If the presented 
framework is followed in future studies, comparability, 
and evidence-gathering would be much easier.

Implication for practice and research

There are few evidence-based studies available, and their 
summary is insufficient to draw any far-reaching conclu-
sions; however, we may venture to conclude that AAT is 
an  effective  adjuvant  treatment  for  the  studied  diseases, 
adding  significant  value  to  conventional  therapies,  par-
ticularly  for  psychiatric  symptoms  and  quality  of  life, 
and,  in  the  case  of  equine-assisted  therapy,  for  move-
ment rehabilitation. Therefore, we need to emphasize the 
importance  of  developing  a  uniform  measuring  meth-
odology,  a  larger  sample  size,  and  detecting  significant 
changes. In the case of control group studies, it would be 
important to use simultaneous complementary therapies, 
such  as  dog-assisted  therapy  and  art  therapy  in  the  two 
analyzed groups. By developing evidence-based research 
methodology and standardizing the research setting, the 
effects  of  animal-assisted  therapy  could  be  effectively 
measured  as  part  of  healthcare  practice,  which  would 
bring  about  significant  benefits  in  the  rehabilitation  of 
patients in need. Interventions of different lengths could 
be  subject  to  further  research  in  order  to  identify  the 
length of intervention that is the most effective, and the 
systemic  change  a  12-month  intervention  can  trigger  in 
patients’ lives.

It would be a step forward in quantifiable interventions 
with measurable impact if professionals used the defini-
tions uniformly. It would also be important for research 
and interventions to have a regulated professional frame-
work  for  animal-assisted  therapy,  within  which  the  pro-
fessionals have the flexibility to tailor the therapy to the 
clients’ needs.

In  connection  with  the  measurements,  the  idea  may 
arise that control group studies conducted in health care 
institutions  would  be  more  fit  for  the  purpose.  How-
ever,  given  the  heterogeneity  of  the  patient  group  and 

 Mittly et al. Systematic Reviews          (2023) 12:224 

Page 14 of 15

the  pharmacotherapy  used,  the  implementation  of  this 
cannot  be  standardized  as  of  yet.  In  contrast,  biometric 
measurements could be helpful in measuring the impact 
of AAI.

We  would  like  to  confirm  that  although  this  is  a  diffi-
cult  area  to  assess,  at  the  same  time,  an  evidence-based 
approach  is  indispensable.  Psychometric  tools  (depres-
sion,  anxiety)  are  key  in  measuring  changes  in  mental 
health.

Conclusion
Based  on  the  results,  we  concluded  that  placing 
emphasis  on  strengthening  coping  skills  and  improv-
ing  subjectively  experienced  quality  of  life  and  emo-
tional  states  is  important  when  using  animal-assisted 
interventions.  Therefore,  AAI  has  an  indirect  positive 
effect  on  well-being,  which  is  important  not  only  for 
the  individual,  but  for  society  as  a  whole.  In  our  own 
experience,  the  effects  of  animal-assisted  therapy  are 
manifested sooner in psychological and mental factors 
than in physical fitness, and a few appropriate sessions 
can  already  have  a  positive  effect  on  patients’  motiva-
tion,  general  well-being,  and  quality  of  life.  However, 
our  experience  so  far  suggests  that  AAI  has  an  effect 
on physical fitness as well, mainly in terms of reducing 
pain and increasing mobility.

Our studies have certainly shown that AAT is an area 
worth  investigating,  but  one  that  really  needs  practice 
guidelines  and  standardized  research  methodology.  As 
the popularity of AAT continues to grow among users, 
it is very important that providers not only respond to 
these  needs,  but  do  so  in  a  way  that  is  evidence-based 
and according to appropriate standards. The true place 
of  AAT  in  patient  care  can  only  be  accurately  deter-
mined  on  the  basis  of  methodological  excellence  both 
in research and clinical practice.
