Abstract
Purpose  Individuals with eating disorders (ED) and comorbid borderline personality disorder (BPD) may benefit from 
therapies focusing on emotion regulation, such as dialectical behavioral therapy (DBT). The aim of the study was to evalu-
ate the effectiveness of one-year standard DΒΤ enhanced with cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) strategies for patients 
suffering from ED and BPD.
Methods  Seventy-two BPD and ED (anorexia and bulimia nervosa) participants were recruited from the eating disorders unit 
of the 1st Psychiatric Department of National and Kapodistrian University of Athens. All participants completed one year of 
standard DBT. ED-related behaviors were added to the treatment plan according to the DBT targeting hierarchy. Individual 
therapy and skills training group sessions were adapted to incorporate CBT strategies for nutritional and weight restoration. 
BPD and ED symptomatology were measured at the beginning and at the end of one year of treatment.
Results  The major finding of the study was the significant improvement of patients in all the outcome measurements after 
one year of treatment. The study's second finding was that the severity of BPD symptomatology was significantly related to 
the severity of ED symptomatology. It was also shown that improvement of the patients coping skills was correlated with 
the reduction of ED and BPD symptomatology.
Conclusions  These results support previous studies on the effectiveness of DBT for comorbid BPD and EDs. Despite the 
promising results, randomized controlled trials are needed to establish the efficacy of DBT for BPD and ED patients.
Level of evidence  Level IV: Evidence obtained from multiple time series with or without the intervention, such as case 
studies. Dramatic results in uncontrolled trials might also be regarded as this type of evidence.

Introduction

Eating disorders (ED) are a group of psychiatric disorders 
characterized by disordered eating or weight control behav-
iors that lead to altered food consumption or absorption [1]. 
Comorbidity is quite common among patients with anorexia 
nervosa (AN), bulimia nervosa (BN) and binge eating disor-
der (BED), with 80% of sufferers meeting diagnostic criteria 
for other disorders besides EDs at some point in their life

[2]. Α meta-analysis examining the prevalence of personality 
disorders among individuals with EDs demonstrated that the 
most common comorbid personality disorder in patients with 
EDs is borderline personality disorder (BPD), with preva-
lence rates of 28.4% in individuals with BN, 25.5% in indi-
viduals with AN-binge-eating/purging subtype (AN-BP), 
10.8% in individuals with AN-restrictive subtype (AN-R), 
and 11.7% in those with BED [3]. The relationship between 
BPD symptoms and EDs is complex, as BPD symptoms can 
act as a predisposing or severity factor of EDs [4, 5]. While 
the mechanisms underlying this comorbidity and the impli-
cations for treatment are still under investigation, patients 
with EDs and coexisting BPD symptoms are considered a 
“difficult to treat” clinical group [6].

The comorbidity of EDs and BPD has been associated 
with  higher  levels  of  anxiety,  depression,  more  severe

general psychopathology and life-threatening behaviors, 
lower expectations regarding sufferers’ ability to regulate 
affect and finally, greater difficulty in reducing ED symp-
toms than individuals with EDs alone [7–9]. It has been 
reported that BPD with co-occurring BN is associated with a 
higher risk of repeated suicide attempts, BPD with co-occur-
ring AN is associated with an increased risk of repeated 
non-suicidal self-harm, and BPD with co-occurring BED 
is associated with a higher rate of other Axis I disorders in 
addition to EDs [8].

Considering the course of the comorbid disorders, there 
are studies reporting no adverse effects of BPD on the sever-
ity of ED symptoms or treatment outcomes [10–12], while 
a follow-up study of the course of EDs in individuals who 
were also diagnosed with BPD found that although the initial 
ED regressed at the 10-year follow-up, there were fluctua-
tions in symptomatology with migration to other EDs [13].
It is critical to understand the differences between patients 
with EDs and BPD and patients without such comorbidity 
in order to ensure that appropriately targeted interventions 
are provided to this high-risk group [6]. Affective instability, 
a key characteristic of BPD which is also observed in EDs, 
should be prioritized when treating patients with ED and 
BPD [14]. Individuals with high affective instability, such 
as BPD patients, may use eating related maladaptive behav-
iors, such as binging and purging in order to regulate nega-
tive emotions and rapid mood fluctuations [14, 15]. Conse-
quently, these patients may benefit from therapies focusing 
on emotion regulation and distress tolerance strategies, such 
as dialectical behavioral therapy (DBT) [7, 16].

Regarding EDs, cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is 
considered a first-line treatment for BN and BED [17] while 
the “enhanced” form of the treatment (CBT-E) was found to 
be an effective “transdiagnostic” treatment for BN, EDNOS 
and possibly AN [18, 19]. CBT-E puts an emphasis on the 
overevaluation of body and weight for the individuals self-
esteem and targets the perpetuating mechanisms of ED such 
as the effects of starvation or the rewarding nature of binge 
eating. The treatment targets are prioritized starting with 
weight and nutritional restoration and moving on to the dys-
functional beliefs and sustain chronic feelings of low esteem 
[18, 19].

Regarding BPD, DBT was initially developed to treat 
chronically suicidal individuals diagnosed with BPD using 
principles derived from behaviorism, Zen meditation and 
dialectical philosophy [20–22]. DPT has been proven to be 
effective as a treatment for BPD in several studies [23]. DBT 
has been adopted and applied in individuals suffering from 
ED disorders with quite promising results [24]. The effec-
tiveness of DBT for the treatment of BPD and ED have been 
shown in a number of studies.

The  first  study  evaluated  a  pilot  program  of  DBT  in 
women with BPD and BN or EDNOS and all individuals 

appeared to benefit from DBT regarding general function-
ing, dysfunctional eating behaviors, and self-harm at the 
18-month follow-up. [25]. Some years later, a second study 
evaluated a 6-month DBT program in women who met the 
criteria for BPD and BN or BED and it was found signifi-
cant improvements in the measures related to EDs and sui-
cidal and non-suicidal self-injury behaviors up to 6 months 
after the completion of the treatment [26]. Furthermore, a 
3-month adaptation of the DBT combined with an additional 
cognitive-behavioral module specific for EDs was evaluated 
in an open trial in a sample of 24 inpatients with BPD and 
EDs. The results showed that self-reported ratings of diet-
related complaints, general psychopathology, and overall 
psychosocial functioning significantly improved after the 
treatment and at the 15-month follow-up [27]. Recently, in 
a naturalistic setting, a non-randomized controlled trial of 
DBT was compared to treatment as usual cognitive behavior 
therapy (TAU-CBT) for the comorbidity of BPD and EDs. 
Patients who received DBT showed significant reductions in 
dysfunctional behaviors associated with BPD which are used 
to regulate emotions, non-suicidal self-harm, and depres-
sive symptoms, as well as a significant increase in cogni-
tive performance and overall functioning [28]. Finally, the 
long-term outcomes (4- and 6-year post-treatment) of the 
above study were published some years later showing that 
individuals who received DBT had improved significantly in 
measurements of depression, emotional eating, anger, impul-
sivity, adaptability, and emotional expression at the 4- and 
6-year post-treatment assessment compared to the pre-treat-
ment assessment. However, comparing the two interventions 
did not result in significant differences over the follow-up 
years, suggesting that a new program such as DBT may be 
as effective as a well-established program such as TAU-CBT 
[29]. A recent meta-analysis, reported that DBT was found 
to produce the largest effects in reducing disordered eating 
behaviors among other third-wave interventions [30].

The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of 
1-year  standard  DΒΤ  enhanced  with  CBT  strategies  for 
weight and nutritional restoration for patients suffering from 
ED and BPD.

Method

Participants

Participants were recruited during the years 2017 to 2022 
from the Eating Disorders Unit of the 1st Psychiatric Depart-
ment of National and Kapodistrian University of Athens in 
Eginition Hospital. During their first appointment, all par-
ticipants who met the diagnosis of both BPD and ED during 
the above-mentioned period of time were approached.

The diagnosis of BPD and ED was confirmed by a senior 
psychiatrist. Also, SCID-II was conducted during the second 
appointment by a psychologist [31]. Considering the ED 
diagnostic categories, due to the small sample size anorectic 
type ED that did not meet the full criteria for AN (BMI over 
17, lack of weight phobia or body image distortion) were 
categorized as AN and the same applied to BN. Also the fact 
that the ED unit provides only group DBT skills training for 
BED prohibited the inclusion of patients suffering from BED 
in the study. The inclusion criteria were: BMI over 12 and/
or absence of serious medical complication due to malnutri-
tion, age between 17 and 35 years, adequate knowledge of 
the Greek language (read and write), lack of psychotic dis-
order, developmental disability and substance use disorder 
that required specialized treatment. It should be noted that 
considering substance use BPD patients that did not met the 
full criteria for substance use disorder were included in the 
study. In fact a large portion of the participants especially 
those suffering from BN reported that they were using some 
kind of psychoactive substance mainly cannabis, alcohol, 
nicotine and less often cocaine. All patients that were found 
to be suffering from BPD and ED were offered the same 
treatment option (DBT), and they were required to commit 
to one year of treatment.

Measurements

All measurements with the exception of the demographics, 
were administered twice during the initial assessment and 
after the completion of one year of treatment. The question-
naires were administered by the primary researcher, who was 
not in any way involved in the patient’s treatment.

The following questionnaires were used:

a)  Borderline Symptom List 23 (BSL 23) [32]. The ques-
tionnaire has 23 items measuring BPD symptomatol-
ogy during the last week prior to the investigation. The 
questionnaire has been translated, back-translated and 
adjusted in Greek. The Cronbach alpha was calculated 
at 0.95. BSL 23 includes also a supplementary list of 11 
items for the assessment of behaviors often observed in 
individuals suffering from BPD, Item 4 and 5 refer to 
ED symptomatology (binge eating and purging behav-
iors).

b)  Ways of Coping Checklist (WCCL) [33]. The question-
naire assesses possible ways of managing crises during 
the last month prior to the investigation. Specifically, it 
investigates whether patients use DBT skills or dysfunc-
tional coping mechanisms when faced with a psycho-
logical crisis or blame others for their predicament. The 
questionnaire has been translated, back-translated and 
adjusted in Greek. The Chronbach alpha was calculated 
at 0.94 for the DBT skills subscale, 0.76 for the general 

dysfunctional coping subscale, and 0.70 for the blaming 
subscale.

c)  Suicidal behaviors questionnaire (SBQ) [34]. The ques-
tionnaire is used for the measurement of suicidal idea-
tion. It is a self-complementary questionnaire assessing 
suicide ideation, expectations for suicide, communica-
tions, threats regarding suicide, and suicidal behaviors. 
The questionnaire has been translated, back-translated 
and adjusted in Greek. The Chronbach alpha was calcu-
lated at 0.84.

d)  Eating  Disorders  Examination  (EDE-Q)  [35].  The 
questionnaire  is  used  to  assess  ED  symptomatology 
and related behaviors. It has four subscales measuring 
restraint eating, eating concern, weight concern, and 
body shape concern. The Greek version of the ques-
tionnaire has been validated by Pliatskidou et al. [36]. 
The Cronbach alpha was calculated at 0.92 for restraint 
eating, 0.88 for eating concern, 0.91 for shape concern, 
0.88 for weight concern, and 0.92 for the total EDE-Q 
score.

The treatment

All participants completed one year of standard DBT. Stand-
ard DBT involves weekly individual psychotherapy, skills 
training group, the therapists’ group consultation meeting, 
and access to 24-h telephone coaching. Eight therapists in 
total, four in each consultation group, provided the treat-
ment (individual and skills training) to the participants. All 
therapists engaged in the treatment of the patients that were 
included in the study had been trained in DBT and CBT-E 
and had more than 5 years of clinical experience in DBT 
treatment for BPD and ED patients. The therapists were 
organized into two consultation groups that met on a weekly 
basis. All therapists were supervised every 2 weeks by one 
senior psychiatrist with more than 10 years of clinical and 
training experience in DBT for BPD and CBT for ED.

According to DBT binge eating was regarded as a short-
term  emotion  regulation  behavior,  while  caloric  intake 
restraint was regarded as a long-term behavior resulting in 
the attenuation of intense emotions. ED-related behaviors 
were added to the treatment plan according to the DBT tar-
geting hierarchy. Thus, top priority was given to behaviors 
that could threaten the individual's life (such as starvation, 
intense purging), followed by therapy-interfering behaviors 
(such as coming to therapy late, not filling in the food diary 
card). In contrast, behaviors that negatively impacted the 
individual's quality of life (such as binge eating) were com-
ing third in priority. Individual therapy and skills training 
group sessions were adapted to incorporate CBT strate-
gies for nutritional and weight restoration. Specifically, the 
patients were urged to keep a food diary that was reviewed 
during the weekly sessions. Weight measurement was also 

1 3   81

Eating and Weight Disorders - Studies on Anorexia, Bulimia and Obesity           (2023) 28:81 

conducted at the first half of the session. CBT-E strate-
gies for gradual nutritional and weight restoration such as 
establishing a five meals per day routine, increasing caloric 
intake, reducing specific food avoidance, and reduction of 
purging behaviors and compulsive exercising were used as 
described into the treatment manual [37]. Also, mindful eat-
ing and body awareness practice were used as part of the 
mindfulness skills training (non-judgmental body aware-
ness, mindful eating). Finally, DBT distress tolerance skills 
for substance abstinence were taught and practiced with the 
clients targeting the food addiction behaviors observed in 
ED patients.

All participants were asked to have a complete medical 
check-up before engaging in the whole treatment process. 
During therapy, the individual therapist collaborated with 
the medical team that monitored the patient's medical status.

Statistical analysis

Continuous  variables  were  expressed  as  mean  values 
(standard deviation, SD), while categorical variables were 
expressed as absolute and relative frequencies. Paired Stu-
dent’s t-tests and Wilcoxon signed tests were used for time 
comparisons. Spearman correlation coefficients (rho) were 
used to explore the association of two continuous variables. 
All reported p values are two-tailed. Statistical significance 
was set at p < 0.05, and analyses were conducted using the 
Statistical Package for the Social Science (SPSS) software 
(version 26.0).

Results

In total, 92 patients were assessed and found eligible to be 
included in the study. One patient refused to participate 
in the study. Of the 91 patients who started treatment and 
agreed to participate in the study, 15 dropped out before 
completing the first year of treatment. No statistical signifi-
cance difference were found in the baseline measurements 
between the group that concluded the first year of treatment 
and the group that dropped out of treatment. Seventy-two 
(72) participants completed one year of treatment. 90,3% 
of them were women. Their mean age was 26.7 years old 
(SD = 6.7  years),  and  their  mean  BMI  was  23.5  kg/m  2 
(SD = 5.4 kg/m). Considering the ED diagnosis, 12 (16.7%) 
participants were suffering from AN binge/purge type or 
anorectic type ED and 60 (83.3%) were suffering from BN 
or bulimic type ED. The majority of the participants were 
unmarried (83.3%), and high school graduates (43.1%) while 
most of them had seen a mental health professional twice 
during their lifetime (40.4%) (Table 1).

and post-treatment (2nd measurement) are summarized in 
Table 2. Scores in BSL-23 and EDE-Q scales and the SBQ 
score diminished significantly at the second measurement. 
Furthermore, the DBT Skills subscale increased significantly 
at the second measurement, while the WCCL General dys-
functional coping factor decreased significantly. No signifi-
cant change was observed with the WCCL blaming others 
factor.

Considering the diagnosis of ED, all scales were similar 
in both groups (AN and BN) at both measurements (before 
and after one year of treatment (p > 0.05). Due to the above, 
all patients were grouped for the statistical analysis of the 
results (Supplementary Table 1).

The BSL-23 supplementary behavioral assessment of 
the patients during the first and second measurements is 
summarized in Table 3. The quality of their overall status 
increased significantly at the second measurement, one year 
after DBT. Moreover, the frequency of reports from patients

who hurt themselves, told others they wanted to commit sui-
cide, binged, deliberately threw up, consciously acted dan-
gerously, used substances, used unprescribed medication, 
and had rage outbreaks to others reduced significantly at the 
second measurement.

BSL-23 score was positively correlated with all four 
subscales  of  the  EDE-Q  score  and  the  total  EDE-Q 
score, indicating that more severe BPD symptomatology 

correlates  to  more  severe  ED  symptomatology  both  at 
the  beginning  and  at  the  end  of  one  year  of  treatment 
(Table 4).

Table 5 shows Spearman's correlation coefficients (rho) 
between  the  patient's  scores  on  the  subscales  of  DBT-
WCCL and the scores of the EDE-Q and BSL-23 at both 
measurements. In the first measurement, the "DBT Skills 
subscale" score of the DBT-WCCL was negatively cor-
related with all subscales and the global score of EDE-Q 
score and BSL-23 score. The better the patients' coping 
skills were in dealing with stressful situations, the fewer 
EDs they had, and the better they were in terms of BPD. 
Moreover, it was found that the "General Dysfunctional 
Coping Factor" subscale of the DBT-WCCL was positively 
correlated with the score of BSL-23 and with all the sub-
scales and the total score of EDE-Q with the exception 
of the "Restraint dimension". This result indicates that 
dysfunctional coping in stressful situations was linked to 
more severe ED and BPD symptomatology. Finally, the 
"Blaming others factor" subscale score was not signifi-
cantly correlated with any other measurement. The same 
results were observed in the 2nd measurement. Addition-
ally, it was found that EDE-Q "Restraint dimension" was 
significantly correlated with DBT-WCCL general dysfunc-
tional coping factor.

Finally, the SBQ score was found to be positively corre-
lated with the “Shape concern” and “Weight concern” sub-
scales of the EDE-Q and the BSL-23 score. In the second 
measurement, all results of the first measurement remained 
significant. Additionally, it was found that greater SBQ 
was  significantly  associated  with  greater  restraint  and 
global EDE-Q score (Table 6).

Skillful emotion regulation appears to be an important chal-
lenge for individuals diagnosed with BPD and EDs, and as 
a result, there has been a growing interest in researching 
novel therapies such as DBT that are putting an emphasis 
on observing, labeling and regulating emotion. The present 
study applied a 1-year DBT program to individuals with 
BPD and EDs. The dropout rate was 17% and no significant 
differences concerning demographics and questionnaires’ 
scores were found between the patients who abandoned ther-
apy and those who completed the treatment. Among indi-
vidual suffering from BPD a diagnosis of ED increases the 
probability of early treatment dropout [38], although socio-
demographical factors and severity of BPD psychopathology 
do not seem to predict dropout from therapy [38, 39].

The first main finding of the study was the significant 
improvement in all outcome measures at post-treatment 
compared to those at pre-treatment. Specifically, after one 
year of DBT, the individuals showed a significant decrease 
in  suicidal  ideation,  BPD,  and  ED  symptomatology.  It 
should be noted that although the sample size was relatively 
small all comparisons were highly significant. These results 
are supported also by previous studies that evaluated the

effectiveness of DBT in individuals suffering from BPD and 
ED [25–29].

The second major finding was that BPD symptomatol-
ogy was significantly related to ED symptomatology. The 
relationship between BPD symptoms and EDs is complex, 
and the mechanism underlying this comorbidity is still under 
investigation. According to some theoretical suggestions, the 
symptoms of BPD can act as a predisposing factor or a com-
plication of EDs [4–6]. In order to receive a diagnosis of 
BPD, at least five of nine criteria must be met including: fear 
of abandonment, unstable interpersonal relationships, unsta-
ble self-image, impulsivity, self-harm, mood instability, 
feelings of emptiness, inappropriate anger, emptiness and 
dissociation/transient paranoid ideation [40]. The numerous 
possible combinations of BPD symptoms complicate our 

understanding of the mechanisms underlying comorbidity 
between BPD and ED, as the two disorders may be linked for 
different reasons depending on the BPD symptomatology. 
Certain BPD symptoms may play a greater role in comorbid-
ity between ED and BPD than others contributing uniquely 
to the onset and manifestation of the disorder and to the 
course of treatment [14].

Recently, three studies have examined the nine individual 
symptoms of BPD in relation to the symptoms of EDs. Both, 
BN and AN symptoms, were more severe in an adolescent 
psychiatric inpatient sample who endorsed unstable inter-
personal relationships, mood instability, feelings of emp-
tiness, unstable self-image, inappropriate anger, dissocia-
tion/paranoia, and suicidal behavior while impulsivity was 
only related to BN symptoms [41]. Furthermore, emotional 
instability and anger were found to be significantly more 
strongly associated with symptoms of BN compared with 
AN, whereas the opposite was found for identity disturbance 
[41]. A network analysis for the visualization of the direct 
and indirect associations between transdiagnostic variables 
involved in BPD and ED symptoms revealed that emotion 
dysregulation and fear of abandonment are the most cen-
tral symptoms in the relationship between BPD and EDs 
[16]. Finally, nine separate meta-analyses (one for each BPD 
symptom) which were conducted in order to compare levels 
of BPD symptoms in individuals with EDs versus healthy 
controls revealed that emotional instability was the most 
elevated BPD symptom, indicating that BPD patients may 
use maladaptive food-related behaviors to regulate intense 
negative emotions and rapid mood fluctuations [14].

These research results could lead to the assumption that 
DBT can be regarded as a promising treatment for individu-
als with BPD and EDs because it specifically targets deficits 
in emotion regulation by improving behavioral skills for dis-
tress tolerance, emotion regulation, and mindfulness [7, 20, 
21]. The above suggestion is in accordance with the third 
finding of the study, that is, the improvement of the patients 
coping skills is correlated with the reduction of the ED and 
BPD symptomatology. These findings support the hypoth-
esis that when individuals become more skillful in regulat-
ing their emotions they reduce the use of food as a way to 
"solve their problems" [15].

Future research is needed to explore which specific DBT 
skills may be more helpful for this clinical population. Ran-
domized control studies are also needed to establish the effi-
cacy of DBT for BPD and ED. Long-term follow-up studies 
could also examine or even confirm the long-term efficacy 
of this treatment and the factors that contribute to the remis-
sion of both disorders. Finally, a larger sample size would 
possibly indicate significant differences between different 
types of ED on outcome measures.

The study’s findings could probably have several clinical 
implications. Firstly, given the fact that most of the study’s 

1 3   81  

Page 8 of 10

Eating and Weight Disorders - Studies on Anorexia, Bulimia and Obesity           (2023) 28:81 

participants applied only for ED treatment and the diagno-
sis of BPD was considered during their first assessment at 
the ED unit, it is essential to raise awareness among men-
tal health practitioners of the comorbidity between ED and 
BPD and its clinical implications. Secondly, the correlation 
between BPD and ED symptomatology and the simultaneous 
improvement of both conditions after one year of DBT could 
indicate the value of addressing both disorders at the same 
time in order to achieve a more favorable treatment outcome. 
Finally, the low dropout rate (17%) could be regarded as a 
possible indication that participants found DBT an effective 
treatment option that could provide understanding, accept-
ance and a skillful way to restore their mental health.

In conclusion, it should be noted that the comorbidity of 
ED and BPD poses an ethical question to the clinician. Since 
the standard treatment for ED, such as CBT or family-based 
therapy, is not very helpful for severe cases of BPD and 
both conditions can prove dangerous for the sufferer's life, 
should a clinician focus on one of them first and then deal 
with the other using two different treatment plans? DBT for 
ED seems to provide an effective solution for this dilemma, 
providing a unified approach to the maladaptive behaviors 
related to both mental disorders. Of course, further research, 
primarily randomized controlled studies, is needed with a 
larger sample size in order to explore the effectiveness of 
DBT for this excessively burdened group of young sufferers.

Strengths and limitations

The study has several strengths and limitations. It is the first 
study that evaluated a 1-year DBT intervention in individu-
als suffering from both BPD and EDs compared with previ-
ous studies that evaluated DBT interventions with shorter 
duration. The second strength is that both ED and BPD were 
addressed simultaneously as the treatment protocol dictated. 
Finally, the low dropout rate (17%), despite the fact that BPD 
comorbidity with ED typically increases the likelihood of 
dropout, enabled a degree of safety in the interpretation of 
the results.

However, the study also presents several limitations. The 
sample size was small and derived from a single treatment 
facility in the Greek capital’s central area. A control group 
was not included, as implementing any other form of effec-
tive treatment for this specific group of patients for an entire 
year posed significant challenges. Moreover, all AN and BN 
patients were grouped together, and BED patients were not 
included in the study. This hinders the ability to draw con-
clusions about the effectiveness of DBT in different diag-
nostic categories of EDs. Finally, another limitation is that 
confounding factors, such as depression and other anxiety 
disorders, were not assessed, although these factors are often 
present in individuals with personality disorders.

What is already known on this subject?

DBT is an effective treatment for individuals suffering from 
BPD while promising results have also been found when 
ED’s patients were treated with DBT or DBT derived treat-
ment protocols. Recently, there has been an attempt to apply 
DBT as a treatment for BPD and ED patients. The results 
from the published small number of open trials have been 
so far favorable for DBT.

What this study adds?

The current study is the first to evaluate the effectiveness 
of a 1-year standard DBT treatment enhanced with CBT 
strategies for weight and nutritional restoration for patients 
suffering from ED and BPD. The findings of the study lead 
to the assumption that DBT could prove to be a promising 
treatment for individuals with BPD and EDs because it spe-
cifically targets deficits in emotion regulation by improving 
patients’ coping skills. Additionally, the analysis of the find-
ings showed that improvement was simultaneously observed 
for both ED and BPD symptomatology and highly correlated 
with the enhancement of the patients’ behavioral skills.
