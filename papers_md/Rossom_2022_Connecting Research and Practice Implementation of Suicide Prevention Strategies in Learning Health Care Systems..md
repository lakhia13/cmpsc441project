Abstract

The healthcare systems affiliated with the Mental Health Research Network strive to be learning 
healthcare systems that identify and address evidence gaps of importance to clinicians, patients 
and funders. This paper describes how research guides clinical care and how clinical care guides 
research in the area of suicide prevention, and some of the challenges of conducting embedded 
research.

The transformation of healthcare systems into learning healthcare systems - where science, 
informatics, incentives and culture align for continuous improvement - could improve clinical 
care and decrease delays in implementing best practices. However, it can be challenging to 
ensure the necessary elements are present: a well-developed infrastructure to organize and analyze 
health records data, a culture of shared responsibility, and an organizational philosophy promoting 
bidirectional learning between healthcare practice and research. Nonetheless, strengthening 
research-practice partnerships to accelerate the adoption, implementation and improvement of 
evidence-based mental healthcare is a priority for federal funding agencies and healthcare 
organizations. This paper discusses the benefits and challenges of establishing and maintaining 
engaged clinical partnerships in the area of suicide prevention.

Building Partnerships

We previously described an evolving model of a learning healthcare system in the Mental 
Health Research Network (MHRN; mhresearchnetwork.org)(1), a network of 14 research 
institutes embedded in healthcare organizations across the U.S. NIMH funding supports 
infrastructure work, including establishment and maintenance of a virtual data warehouse at 
each site, as well as pilot and signature projects.

MHRN-affiliated healthcare systems care for and insure 25 million patients across 16 
states, with embedded mental health researchers who conduct federally-funded research 
and maintain relationships with healthcare system leaders and clinicians at each site. 
This engagement varies and includes researchers attending leader and departmental 
meetings to learn of system priorities and disseminate research findings, engaging with 
or working as frontline clinicians, and serving on or acting as advisors to healthcare system 
committees. Challenges to building and maintaining these partnerships include competing 
organizational priorities, limited leadership and clinician bandwidth, and the perception 
of research as being too slow to meet the demands of pressing clinical decisions (with 
leaders often required to make decisions in weeks, not years). Researchers have addressed 
these challenges by scheduling quarterly meetings with leaders, supporting organizational 
priorities, identifying and leveraging overlap between funding agency and organizational 
priorities, serving as interpreters of external evidence and generators of internal evidence, 
and designing pragmatic trials that can quickly adapt as needed.

The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ9) and Suicide Risk

MHRN healthcare systems were early adopters of the PHQ9 to screen for and monitor 
depression and suicide risk. These PHQ9 data revealed that approximately 6% of 
respondents reported thoughts of suicide more than half the days in the previous 2 weeks 
on item 9, with 0.5% attempting suicide in the next 30 days and 3% within 2 years.(2) 
These PHQ9 findings led to four streams of clinical or research activities in our healthcare 
systems: (1) Use of the Columbia Suicide Severity Risk Scale (CSSRS), (2) The Suicide 
Prevention Trial (SPOT), (3) Evaluation of Zero Suicide implementation, and (4) Use of 
machine learning to improve suicide risk prediction.

Use of the CSSRS to Assess Suicide Risk

Despite evidence that elevated scores on item 9 of the PHQ9 were reasonably good at 
identifying people at increased risk of suicide, there is no evidence that suicide screening by 
itself prevents suicide attempts or deaths. Despite this evidence gap, health system leaders 
felt compelled to act and implemented workflows for patients reporting suicidal ideation. 
In many systems, this led to systematic use of the CSSRS for patients with elevated PHQ9 
item 9 scores. Implementation varies across healthcare systems, but most prompt completion 
of the CSSRS in the electronic health record (EHR), followed by such actions as further 
clinical assessment of risk/protective factors, lethal means counseling, and/or completion 
of EHR-based suicide safety plans. The clinical use of the CSSRS in MHRN healthcare

systems provides an opportunity to study whether clinicians use the CSSRS, whether its use 
prompts subsequent clinical actions, and whether these actions impact suicide attempts.

Researchers and health system leaders also sought to understand the limitations and 
how to improve self-reported measures such as the PHQ9 and CSSRS. In one health 
system, researchers conducted semi-structured qualitative interviews with suicide attempt 
survivors (3) and primary care patients (4), who described the value of being asked about 
suicidality, but also how disclosing suicidal thoughts often involved weighing hope for 
help against fears of negative consequences associated with stigma and loss of autonomy. 
This research confirmed and extended research among Veterans who reported similar fears 
and underscored the importance of direct and caring communication about suicidality and 
relationships with trusted providers (5). Recognizing these limitations, MHRN investigators 
are collaborating with health system leaders to improve screening/assessment practices, and 
are developing and evaluating alternative methods to identify risk using medical records 
data, discussed below.

The Suicide Prevention Outreach Trial (SPOT)

To generate evidence to guide large-scale secondary interventions for populations at risk 
of suicide, we conducted a pragmatic trial enrolling 18,882 patients (67% women, 12% non-
white, 8% Hispanic) from March 2015 through to September 2018 across four healthcare 
systems.(6) Patients who reported suicidal ideation on the PHQ9 were randomized to receive 
ongoing usual care or an invitation to one of two interventions: an online dialectical 
behavioral therapy skills training program supported by a health coach or a phone-based 
care management intervention designed to keep patients connected with their behavioral 
health clinicians. Of note, SPOT care managers used the CSSRS to assess suicide risk 
and to inform risk-based care pathways, which will ultimately contribute information as 
to whether the CSSRS may be useful for suicide prediction and prevention. The primary 
outcome is suicide attempt assessed via EHR and state mortality data. Importantly, patient 
and clinician stakeholders were engaged in the design and implementation of this study, 
and healthcare leaders helped design the intervention to minimize disruption of clinical 
workflows, maximizing sustainability should either intervention be found effective. Study 
results are expected in 2021.

Evaluation of Zero Suicide Implementation.

In response to MHRN findings, healthcare systems began implementing a series of suicide 
prevention and intervention approaches as part of large-scale Zero Suicide (ZS) initiatives 
(http://zerosuicide.edc.org/). Henry Ford Health System began this work in 2001, while 
Kaiser Permanente (KP) began evaluating varying models of Zero Suicide implementation 
across five regional healthcare systems in 2016.(7) Systems chose from a range of evidence-
based interventions, including screening and assessment, safety planning, engagement in 
care, care management, caring contacts, follow-up after hospital or emergency discharge, 
means reduction, and intensive suicide risk treatment. An NIMH-funded grant has supported 
evaluation of the model at each system using the Normalization Process Theory framework. 
Researchers partner with leaders and clinicians to document the implemented interventions,

develop metrics aligned with each approach, facilitate a learning collaborative across sites, 
and support ongoing improvement efforts.

Use of Machine Learning to Improve Suicide Risk Prediction.

While PHQ9 item 9 data was reasonably good at identifying patients at increased suicide 
risk, we adopted machine-learning methods to develop potentially more accurate suicide risk 
prediction models. Models use data from nearly 20 million visits from almost 3 million 
patients (61% women, 32% non-white, 23% Hispanic) to better consolidate multiple factors 
for suicide risk than use of the PHQ9 alone.(8) This could allow healthcare systems to 
provide more intensive interventions for those at highest risk while opting for less intensive 
interventions for patients at lower risk. Importantly, and in contrast to PHQ9 item 9 
results, healthcare systems have the ability to set these risk thresholds to match available 
interventions and resources. Our models and others have global classification accuracy of 
80% or more, but given relatively low baseline rates of suicide attempts, positive predictive 
values (PPVs) are low, often below 0.01.(9) We do note, however, that models with similar 
PPVs are widely used in other clinical areas. For example, many guidelines recommend 
statins for people with at least 10% risk of a cardiovascular event in the next 10 years. 
Similarly, using suicide risk models, we can accurately identify those with a 5% risk of a 
suicide attempt in the next 90 days. Essentially, the threshold for acceptability of a PPV 
depends on the balance of risks and harms with the indicated subsequent clinical actions. 
Most would agree the risk of starting a statin is low and a reasonable secondary prevention 
strategy; the equivalent strategy for elevated suicide risk is not yet known but represents an 
opportunity for future research within this learning health system.

Next Steps: Using Suicide Risk Models to Address Suicide Risk.

Researchers have been working with care delivery leaders to adopt suicide risk models for 
clinical use. At KP Northern California, suicide risk models have been embedded in the 
EHR and run in the background (without display to clinicians), demonstrating similar model 
performance in this diverse external validation cohort. Researchers are now working with 
clinical leaders to determine an appropriate risk alert threshold and suitable workflows.(10) 
At HealthPartners in Minnesota, suicide risk models are integrated with the EHR to produce 
weekly reports of members with serious mental illness or increased risk of hospitalization 
who are also at elevated risk for suicide. This prompts behavioral health case managers 
to complete CSSRS assessments and evaluate the need for more intensive interventions. 
Behavioral health clinicians at one outpatient clinic at KP Washington are piloting use of a 
column in clinicians’ EHR calendars flagging patients with elevated suicide risk; clinicians 
are encouraged to have flagged patients complete the CSSRS.

Discussions between researchers and clinicians about these implementation strategies have 
led to shared recognition of the importance of research to understand how patients and 
clinicians interpret these risk models, how they experience conversations about suicide 
risk and prevention, and what clinical capacity is needed to respond to at-risk patients to 
inform future implementation strategies. A qualitative study at three healthcare systems 
uses the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research to interview administrators,

clinicians, case managers, patients and insurance members to assess these needs. Interviews 
are conducted at different stages of pre-implementation and implementation as an important 
step in improving patient-centered care and soliciting stakeholder perspectives about the 
appropriate uses and limitations of predictive modeling. Understanding the implementation 
context at various levels across organizations will serve to inform future implementation 
strategies in other clinical settings.

Conclusions: The Value of Ongoing Partnerships between Clinical Care and 

Research

A learning healthcare system where care informs research and research informs care hinges 
on ongoing relationships and shared priorities between healthcare system leaders, frontline 
clinicians and researchers. These partnerships are built on trust that has evolved over many 
years of collaboration, shared common interests and goals, and frank conversations. To forge 
successful partnerships, in some cases researchers hear clinical concerns that are translatable 
to fundable research ideas. In other cases, researchers learn of research priorities that are 
translatable to care system priorities. Over time, researchers have become more embedded 
in clinical operations and clinical leaders have become embedded members of the research 
teams. Bidirectional communication and collaboration between research and clinical staff 
requires fostering on both sides to keep these partnerships viable and valuable to both 
groups.

As described in this paper, successful learning healthcare systems do not undertake just one 
kind of research. A variety of research methods have been utilized, including observational 
studies, pragmatic clinical trials, implementation, machine learning, and qualitative research. 
This broad array of approaches allows researchers flexibility to tailor approaches to specific 
research or clinical questions, making use of existing data sources when possible and 
fitting into clinical workflows as necessary. Researchers need all of these tools to function 
effectively in learning healthcare systems and better understand implementation issues 
across cultures, diverse patient populations, and varied clinical contexts.

In the end, the goals of healthcare systems and researchers are the same: to improve 
the care, outcomes, and experiences of patients. Conducting embedded research in a 
learning healthcare system provides opportunities to improve patient care more quickly 
than traditional research models, but also requires researchers to be flexible and adept 
at designing pragmatic research that minimizes clinical disruptions. Aligning healthcare 
system, funder and research priorities is key to success.
