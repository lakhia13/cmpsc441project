Abstract

There is conflicting evidence as to whether military populations (i.e., veteran and active-duty 
military service members) demonstrate a poorer response to psychotherapy for posttraumatic 
stress disorder (PTSD) compared to civilians. Existing research may be complicated by the fact 
that treatment outcomes differences could be due to the type of trauma exposure (e.g., combat) or 
population differences (e.g., military culture). This meta-analysis evaluated PTSD treatment 
outcomes as a function of trauma type (combat v. assault v. mixed) and population (military v. 
civilian). Unlike previous meta-analyses, we focused exclusively on manualized, first-line 
psychotherapies for PTSD as defined by expert treatment guidelines. Treatment outcomes were 
large across trauma types and population; yet differences were observed between trauma and 
population subgroups. Military populations demonstrated poorer treatment outcomes compared to 
civilians. The combat and assault trauma subgroups had worse treatment outcomes compared to 
the mixed trauma subgroup, but differences were not observed between assault and combat 
subgroups. Higher attrition rates predicted poorer treatment outcomes, but did not vary between 
military populations and civilians. Overall, manualized, first-line psychotherapies for PTSD 
should continue to be used for civilians and military populations with various trauma types. 
However, greater emphasis should be placed on enhancing PTSD psychotherapies for military 
populations and on treatment retention across populations based on findings from this meta-
analysis.

Introduction

Page 2

Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a debilitating condition that leads to relationship 
dysfunction, physical health issues, greater health care utilization, increased work sick days, 
substance abuse, and elevated suicidality risk (Hoge, Terhakopian, Castro, Messer, & Engel, 
2007; Taft, Watkins, Stafford, Street, & Monson, 2011; Thomas et al., 2010). Research has 
shown particularly high rates of PTSD in military populations (13–30%; Thomas et al., 
2010; Kok, Herrell, Thomas & Hoge, 2012) compared to the general population (6–8%; 
Kessler, Berglund, Demler, Jin, & Walters, 2005). Given that almost 3 million U.S. military 
personnel have deployed to the Middle East and surrounding territories since 2001, the 
demand for effective treatments for veterans and active-duty service members, hereinafter 
referred to as military populations, is critical.

Evidence based psychotherapies for PTSD exist and the positive effects of evidence-based 
psychotherapies in civilian and military populations are well-established (Bisson et al., 
2007; Bradley, Greene, Russ, Dutra & Western, 2005; Cusack et al., 2016; Goodson, 
Helstrom, Halpern, Ferenschack, & Gillihan, 2011; Kline, Cooper, Rytwinksi, & Feeny, 
2018; Powers, Halpern, Ferenshak, Gilliahn, & Foa, 2010; Steenkamp, Litz, Hoge, & 
Marmar, 2015). However, several meta-analyses have reported smaller effect sizes among 
treatment studies with a greater proportion of veterans and combat samples (Bisson et al., 
2007; Bradley et al., 2005; Sloan, Feinstein, Gallagher, Beck, & Keane, 2013; Watts, et al., 
2013). These findings suggest military populations experience less benefit from 
psychotherapies for PTSD compared to civilians (Litz et al., 2009; Sifferlin, 2015; 
Steenkamp et al., 2015). Yet, existing meta-analyses have been limited in evaluating 
treatment response differences among military and civilian populations in several ways. For 
example, Bisson et al. (2007) only evaluated two studies of Vietnam veterans. Sloan et al. 
(2013) found that group interventions for PTSD were not significantly superior to active 
control conditions (d = 0.09); however, they did not include individual interventions. Watts 
et al. (2013) found that studies with more women, or fewer veterans, had larger effect sizes, 
but the authors were unable to disentangle whether this finding was due to gender or veteran 
status. Additionally, Watts et al. (2013) included psychotherapies that were considered to be 
first-line and non-first-line treatments according to PTSD treatment recommendation 
guidelines, which may have confounded results (American Psychological Association 
[APA], 2017; Department of Veterans Affairs and Department of Defense [VA/DoD], 2017; 
Foa, Keane, Friedman, & Cohen, 2009; Institute of Medicine [IOM], 2008; International 
Society for Traumatic Stress Studies [ISTSS], 2018). Similarly, Bradley et al. (2005) 
included all psychotherapies in their meta-analysis. They also reported that trauma type was 
a predictor of treatment effect size, but only reported an omnibus test of differences across 
three groups (combat v. mixed v. assault). This study did not test whether the combat group, 
which demonstrated the smallest effect size, was significantly different from the other 
groups.

There is also meta-analytic evidence to suggest that military populations benefit equally well 
from PTSD treatments compared to civilians. In a recent meta-analysis, Kline et al. (2018) 
demonstrated that population type (i.e., military v. civilian) was unrelated to effect sizes at 
long-term follow-up. However, this meta-analysis also included non-first-line psychotherapy

treatments and only examined effect sizes at long-term follow-up, excluding studies that did 
not provide follow-up data. Thus, whether or not military populations demonstrate a poorer 
treatment response from first-line PTSD psychotherapies in comparison to their civilian 
counterparts remains an open and important question.

Conflicting findings in the existing research literature among military and civilian 
populations may be complicated by differences in the nature of the trauma exposure (e.g., 
combat v. assault) or differences in the patient population (i.e., characteristics of military v. 
civilian populations). Research has shown that military populations experience traumatic 
events at a greater frequency, these events are often combat-related, and are often more 
severe and diverse compared to civilian populations (Green et al., 2015; Stein et al., 2012). 
All of these factors have also been identified as variables that may contribute to PTSD 
symptom severity and treatment outcomes (Steenkamp et al., 2015). Additionally, active-
duty service members remain in relatively dangerous situations during deployment, which 
places them at greater risk for repeated trauma exposure.

Discrepant findings on whether military populations benefit less from first-line PTSD 
psychotherapies may also be because, to our knowledge, previous meta-analyses have not 
separated military sexual trauma (MST) and combat-related trauma type in military 
populations. Research has found symptom presentation differences between MST victims 
and military populations with non-MST related PTSD (Carroll et al., 2018; Sexton et al., 
2018). It is possible that MST is more akin to civilian sexual assault than to combat trauma, 
which in turn may impact treatment outcomes. Alternatively, it is possible that the impact of 
MST differs from that of civilian sexual assault, especially when perpetrated by a fellow 
service member with whom the victim may have continued contact and on whom the 
victim’s continued safety may depend (e.g., in combat). Early research is mixed regarding 
treatment outcome differences between MST and non-sexual assault military traumas (Tiet, 
Leyva, Blau, & Turchik, 2015; Voelkel, Pukay-Martin, Walter, & Chard, 2015; Zalta et al., 
2018). Therefore, separating military population studies by trauma type could provide an 
explanation for previous conflicting results regarding population and trauma type 
differences.

It is also important to consider that treatment outcome differences may not be impacted by 
the type of trauma, but rather characteristics that differ between military and civilian 
populations. For example, prior research has noted approximately 87% of treatment seeking 
military veterans with PTSD also meet criteria for at least one additional psychiatric 
comorbidity (Magruder et al., 2005). Military culture has also been identified as a factor that 
may interfere with optimal treatment response. Research has indicated that mental health 
stigma in the military may impact treatment seeking behavior and treatment dropout (Sharp 
et al., 2015). Mental health stigma beliefs may also result in treatment dropout and poor 
treatment attendance, which has been linked to worse PTSD treatment outcomes (Bush, 
Sheppard, Fantelli, Bell, & Reger, 2013; Tarrier, Sommerfield, Pilgrim, & Faragher, 2000). 
Military training is another factor that may interfere with treatment response by promoting 
hyperarousal PTSD symptoms, such as hypervigiliance and anger, as key strategies for 
survival (Yehuda, Vermetten, McFarlane, & Lehrner, 2014). It is also possible that other 
systemic factors, such as service connection disability claims and secondary gain, may

impede treatment gains (Guina, Welton, Broderick, Correll, & Peirson, 2016; McNally & 
Frueh, 2013). Although mental health stigma, cultural norms about the benefits of 
hypervigilance and avoidance, and disability claims are not entirely absent in civilian 
populations, they appear to be more prevalent in military populations.

The goal of this meta-analysis is to evaluate PTSD treatment outcomes as a function of 
trauma type and population. Specifically, we aim to evaluate whether military populations 
demonstrate a poorer treatment response from first-line PTSD psychotherapy interventions 
in comparison to civilians. Based on the existing evidence, we hypothesized that: (a) first-
line treatments would result in treatment benefits across trauma types and population types; 
(b) combat traumas would yield smaller treatment benefits compared to other trauma types; 
and (c) military populations would report poorer treatment outcomes compared to civilian 
populations.

2.  Methods

A systematic review of the literature was conducted to identify psychotherapy treatment 
outcome trials for PTSD from PsycINFO, PILOTS, and MEDLINE databases from January 
1, 1980 to December 31, 2017. The rationale for selecting this start date was based on the 
formal introduction of PTSD as codified clinical diagnosis in the American Psychiatric 
Association Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, 3rd ed, which was published in 1980 
(American Psychiatric Association, 1980). We used subject headings and keywords, when 
appropriate, for the following search terms, “(ptsd or post traumatic stress disorder or 
posttraumatic stress disorder or post-traumatic stress disorder) and (cognitive behavior* 
therapy or cbt or cognitive-behavio* therapy) or (cognitive processing therapy or CPT) or 
(prolonged exposure or prolonged exposure therapy or PE) or (eye movement 
desensitization and reprocessing or emdr) and (Adult*).” Additional inclusion criteria were 
that manuscripts were peer reviewed and published in English. Potential papers for inclusion 
were also identified through hand-searching published PTSD reviews, PTSD meta-analyses, 
and the references of retrieved articles.

2.1 

Inclusion criteria

We included PTSD psychotherapy treatment outcome trials (controlled and uncontrolled 
studies) for adults with a diagnosis of PTSD. Studies that included participants with sub-
threshold PTSD were excluded from the meta-analysis. Selection of included intervention 
types was based on the International Society for Traumatic Stress Studies (ISTSS) PTSD 
treatment recommendation guidelines (ISTSS, 2018). Based on the ISTSS guidelines, we 
included studies that utilized at least one of four manualized, first-line psychotherapy 
treatments for PTSD: Prolonged Exposure (PE), Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT), Eye 
Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR), and Ehlers and Clark’s (2005) 
Cognitive Therapy (CT) for PTSD.

The rationale to include only these four interventions was to mitigate treatment type 
confounds (e.g., first-line vs. non-first-line treatment options). Studies that utilized 
components of these interventions, implemented the interventions in a manner that was 
inconsistent with the standard protocol, or included an additive treatment component were

excluded from the meta-analysis. For example, if a study only used imaginal exposure, 
combined PE with another intervention, or implemented components of PE in a manner that 
was inconsistent with the protocol, that study was excluded. When a trial involved multiple 
condition arms and one of the arms was consistent with our inclusion criteria, we extracted 
the data for that condition alone and excluded the other treatment arms. For example, if a 
trial compared EMDR alone v. EMDR combined with medication, we extracted the data 
from the first condition and excluded the second condition.

Studies that utilized individual, face-to-face weekly or biweekly interventions in an 
outpatient setting were included in the meta-analysis. Although PTSD treatments using a 
group treatment modality, teletherapy/virtual options, daily (massed) delivery, and 
administration in a residential/inpatient setting have demonstrated positive treatment 
outcomes, these formats can include additional components that deviate from the initial 
protocol design or remain categorized as a non-first-line treatment option (ISTSS, 2018). For 
instance, residential PTSD treatments often include additional supplementary components 
(e.g., skills-based therapy, art therapy, etc.) that are not often utilized in conjunction with a 
first-line PTSD treatment delivered in an individual outpatient therapy format. We also 
excluded trials that focused on dual diagnosis treatment for PTSD and a comorbid issue 
because the primary focus of this meta-analysis was PTSD treatment outcomes alone. We 
did not exclude studies where participants endorsed a comorbid secondary condition as long 
as the aim of the study was PTSD treatment alone. Based on expert guidelines, studies with 
a protocol that was at least 4 sessions in length were eligible for inclusion (Foa et al., 2009).

Additional criteria for inclusion were that studies utilized an established PTSD outcome 
measure and an established PTSD diagnostic measure. The rationale for all of the listed 
exclusion decisions was to mitigate potential variables that may impact treatment outcomes 
and confound our primary analyses. When insufficient information was available to calculate 
an effect size, the primary study author was contacted to obtain the required information 
(i.e., Duffy, Gillespie, & Clark, 2007; Lee, Gavriel, Drummond, Richards, & Greenwald, 
2002; Monson et al., 2006; Nacash et al., 2011; Popiel, Zawadzki, Pragiowska, & Teichman, 
2015; Rauch et al., 2009; Schnurr et al., 2007; Thorp et al., 2012). Studies were excluded 
from analyses if the author could not be contacted or was unable to provide data. Based on 
the criteria outlined above, 28 studies were included. See Figure 1 for a flow chart of 
included studies.

2.2  Coding procedures and definitions

Outcome variables of interest were PTSD symptom severity mean scores at pre and 
posttreatment and the proportion of participants who no longer met criteria for PTSD at 
posttreatment. Additionally, study sample characteristics and study methodology was coded 
for each study to evaluated potential covariates that may predict treatment outcomes (see 
Table 1). Sample descriptive variables included percentage of participants that were female, 
mean participant age in years, and percentage of the sample who dropped out of treatment 
(attrition). Study methodology variables included intervention type (EMDR, CPT, PE, CT), 
PTSD treatment outcome/diagnostic measure used, method of PTSD measure administration 
(self-report v. clinical interview), statistical analysis method (intent to treat v. completer),

study year, and trial type (randomized clinical trial [RCT], clinical comparative trial [CCT], 
and uncontrolled clinical trial [UCT]). Intervention type coding included four categories of 
EMDR, CPT, PE, or CT. Coding for PTSD measures was based on the reported diagnostic 
and outcome-based measures used in the study. Effect sizes based on intent to treat were 
selected over effect sizes based on completers when both methods were reported in the 
study. For type of trial, there was one instance of a quasi-randomization that was coded as 
“Quasi” (i.e., Thorpe, Stein, Jeste, Patterson, & Loebach-Wethell, 2012). This study was 
excluded from the trial type covariate analysis

The first moderator variable of interest was trauma type. A minimum of three studies were 
required to establish a trauma type to maximize the number of identified trauma categories 
in the least restrictive manner. Based on this method, we defined and coded trauma type into 
three categories: a) combat, b) assault, or c) mixed. The combat trauma category was defined 
as a traumatic experience that occurred in the context of a combat-related event. The assault 
trauma category was defined as physical or sexual assault, and included one military sexual 
trauma study (i.e., Surís et al., 2013). The mixed trauma category included studies with 
various trauma types reported or a specific trauma type that did not have at least three 
studies to establish a specific trauma type subgroup. For example, Ehlers et al. (2014) 
included individuals with PTSD related to assault, accidents, disaster, and witnessing death. 
Alternatively, the sample in Capezzani et al. (2013) was composed of individuals with 
oncology-related PTSD, but this was the only study entirely composed of individuals with 
this trauma type. Based on the coding methods, both studies were assigned to the mixed 
category.

Four military population studies included participants with various trauma types (i.e., 
Nacash et al., 2011; Rauch et al., 2009; Schnurr et al., 2007; Thorp et al., 2012). For these 
studies, we contacted the primary author to request sub-sample effect size information for 
specific trauma types. Schnurr et al. was a military population sample that included 
participants with exposure to combat, assault (MST and non-military related assault), and 
other types of trauma types (e.g., accidents). Therefore, the Schnurr et al. study participants 
were separated into three groups for sub-group analyses by trauma type: combat (n = 7), 
assault (n = 74), and mixed (n = 30). Nacash et al. included a military population sample that 
included participants with exposure to combat (n = 10) and terror-related trauma types (n = 
5). Participants with exposure to terror-related trauma were assigned to the mixed trauma 
category because this was the only study that included terror-related trauma. Studies by 
Rauch et al. (2009) and Thorp et al. (2012) also reported combat, assault, and mixed trauma 
type categories. However, only the combat trauma participants were included for these two 
studies because of small sample size (n < 3) in the other trauma categories (see Figure 3). 
Comprehensive Meta-Analysis will not calculate an effect size for samples this small. One 
military population study was not included in trauma type analyses, but was included in 
population analyses because the author could not be reached to provide information on 
trauma type (i.e., Monson et al., 2006).

The second moderator variable of interest was population type. Study population was coded 
as either military or civilian. A majority of the included military population studies were 
comprised of veterans and only one military study was made up of active-duty military

service members (i.e., Thorp et al., 2012). When a study sample was composed of military 
and civilian participants, we contacted the author to request sub-sample effect size 
information by population type (e.g., Lee et al., 2002).

2.3  Data analytic plan

In order to evaluate treatment outcome differences as a function of trauma type and 
population, we used random mixed-effects models with repeated measures, with time (pre-
post treatment) as the within group variable and trauma type or population type as the 
between group variable. Hedges’ g was used as a measure of the weighted effect size for 
within group PTSD symptom severity outcomes (Hedges & Olkin, 1985). PTSD remission 
rate was also evaluated as a secondary outcome and as a measure of clinically meaningful 
improvement. PTSD remission was defined as the sample proportion that no longer met 
diagnostic criteria for PTSD at posttreatment as indicated by an evidence-based diagnostic 
instrument. Event rates analyses were used to evaluate PTSD remission rates at 
posttreatment in the total sample. Cochran’s Q was utilized to test group differences in 
symptom severity and PTSD remission. When appropriate, post-hoc testing was performed 
using a partitioned chi-square analysis to evaluate groups of three or greater. The partitioned 
method allows for analysis of k-1 group comparisons that should sum to the total degrees of 
freedom in the omnibus chi-square. Informal interpretation of general difference across 
subgroup effect-size estimates were utilized to inform the specified contrast tests.

In this study, a positive effect size sign denotes symptom reduction scores from pretreatment 
to posttreatment. In instances where a study included multiple outcomes (e.g., PCL and 
CAPS) or multiple interventions (e.g., PE and CPT), a combined study effect size was 
calculated (e.g., Resick, Nishith, Weaver, Astin, & Feuer, 2002). Of note, a majority of 
studies did not report a pre-post score correlation coefficient which is a component of the 
repeated measures Hedges’ g effect size formula. It is recommended to conduct a sensitivity 
analysis utilizing a range of plausible correlations when this occurs (Borenstein et al., 2009). 
However, Borenstein et al. (2009) do not provide specific sensitivity analysis estimates. 
Therefore, we used Cohen’s (1988) recommended conventional interpretation of a small (.
10), medium (.30), and large (.50) correlation coefficients. This provided a range of 
plausible correlations with a varying degree of impact on pre-post change scores. Overall, 
findings based on these three correlation coefficients were not meaningfully different. 
Therefore, a medium pre-post score correlation (.30) was used across studies.

2.4  Preliminary analyses

Prior to evaluating the main hypotheses, we conducted outlier and publication bias analyses. 
We also evaluated treatment outcome differences across study methodology and descriptive 
factors to identify any variables that may impact treatment outcomes. We identified potential 
outlier studies utilizing the sample adjusted-meta-analytic deviance (SAMD) statistic 
(Huffcutt & Arthur, 1995). The SAMD statistic is based on the difference-in-fit standardized 
(DFFITS) statistic, which calculates a value approximate to a t distribution with and without 
that observation included. Values greater than 2.00 are considered large (Huffcutt & Arthur, 
1995). However, we selected a cutoff of 2.25, which maximizes the ability to explore group 
differences (Beal, Corey, & Dunlap, 2000). If a study was identified as an outlier, this study

was removed from the primary model analyses. As the methods for the identification and 
management of outliers is not universally accepted, findings with potential outlier studies are 
also reported (Aguinis, Gottfredson, & Joo, 2013).

2.4.1  Publication bias analyses.—Fail-safe N analysis and trim and fill plot 
procedures were utilized to evaluate publication bias (Rosenthal, 1979; Duval & Tweedie, 
2000). The fail-safe N calculates the robustness of significant meta-analytic findings by 
estimating the number of hypothesized missing studies required to nullify the summary 
effect. As the number of hypothesized missing studies required to result in null findings 
increases, there is less reason for concern regarding missing studies. The trim and fill 
approach estimates an adjusted effect size based on imputed estimates that result in a more 
symmetrical, unbiased funnel plot. Duval and Tweedie (2000) recommend this method as a 
sensitivity analysis with an emphasis on identifying how the effect size may change if 
missing studies exist.

2.4.2  Study and descriptive preliminary analyses.—A series of mixed-effects 
models and meta-regression analyses were also conducted prior to the main analyses to 
identify potential influential variables that may impact treatment outcomes and confound our 
primary aims. We evaluated differences between intervention type, PTSD measure used for 
diagnosis and outcome, method of PTSD measure administration, statistical analysis 
method, study year, trial type, gender, attrition, and publication year (see Table 1). When a 
study did not report specific descriptive information, that study was excluded from that 
analysis and the missing information was denoted with “NR = not reported” in Table 1. 
Multiple studies used self-report and clinician interview measures to assess PTSD. We 
evaluated outcome differences between these two methods prior to creating a combined 
composite score to rule out measure administration type confounds. We excluded one study 
(Resick et al., 2002) from the treatment type analysis because this study included both PE 
and CPT intervention arms.

2.4.3  Heterogeneity statistics.—Heterogeneity of the summary effect size was 
examined using the Cochran’s Q statistic and I2 index. The Q statistic is based on a chi 
square distrubution that tests if the observed distribution is significantly larger than expected 
as indicated by the within group error. As noted previously, the Q statistic can also be used 
to test group differences in subgroup analyses (Borenstein et al., 2009). Higgins and 
Thompson (2002) proposed the use of the I2 statistic as a method of determing heterogeneity 
based on the ratio of true variance to total variance. I2 can be understood as the percentage 
of between-studies variablitity in the effect esimates. Higgins and Thompson (2002) 
developed a classification system of I2 values to interpret magnitude. I2 = 25%, I2 = 50%, 
and I2 = 75% are classified as small, medium, and high cut-off benchmarks, respectively.

Analyses were conducted using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis. The SAMD estimates were 
calculated based on the recommended formulas (Huffcutt & Arthur, 1995). All studies were 
included in analyses unless otherwise specified in the text or indicated in tables and figures 
as missing or excluded.

3.  Results

3.1  Total effect size analyses

Page 9

Study characteristics are displayed in Table 1. The n across studies ranged from 8 to 141 and 
there was a total of 1,228 participants. Results yielded a large repeated measure total effect 
size across all studies, g = 1.44, SE = .09, p < .001. The total summary repeated measure 
effect size information is presented in Figure 2. Heterogeneity analyses of the summary 
effect with all included studies suggested there was not a common effect size across studies, 
and mixed effect subgroup analysis was warranted, Q (27) = 75.49, p < .001, I2 = 64.23.

3.2  Preliminary analyses

Prior to examining trauma type and population, a series of outlier and publication bias 
analyses were conducted. We also ran a series of mixed-effects models to identify any 
methodological or descriptive study variables that may impact PTSD treatment outcomes.

3.2.1  SAMD statistic results.—SAMD outlier analyses are presented in Figure 2, and 
indicate one outlier study (Schnurr et al., 2007; SAMD = −2.97), which was therefore 
excluded from primary analyses. As exclusion of outliers is not a universally recommended 
method (Aguinis et al., 2013) and Schnurr et al. was a methodologically rigorous study, we 
also report outcomes with Schnurr et al. included in the model. Of note, heterogeneity 
statistics of the total summary effect with Schnurr et al. excluded from the model remained 
statistically significant (p < .001).

3.2.2  Fail-safe N and trim and fill analyses.—The fail-safe N analysis demonstrated 
that 5,251 missing studies with no effect of PTSD treatment were necessary to result in a 
non-significant p value. The funnel plot was slightly asymmetrical in favor of treatment 
effects. The trim-and fill analysis imputed seven studies opposed to the treatment effect 
(right) and zero studies in support of the treatment effect. Consideration of the imputed 
studies resulted in a small decrease (gdiff = −0.13) between the observed effect size (g = 
1.44) and imputed effect size (g = 1.31).

3.2.3  Mixed-effects and meta-regression.—A series of preliminary analyses were 
conducted to evaluate treatment outcomes across descriptive and study methodology 
variables. Meta-regression analyses indicated that attrition rate was the only variable 
associated with treatment outcomes, B = −1.121, SE = .57, Z = −1.96, p = .05. Specifically, 
higher rates of attrition were related to worse treatment effects. All other study methodology 
and descriptive variables were found to be statistically null, p > .05.

3.3  Treatment outcomes as a function of trauma type and population

Two mixed-effects analyses were performed to evaluate PTSD treatment outcomes as a 
function of trauma type and population type (see Figures 3 & 4). A significant difference 
was found between trauma subgroups, Q (2) = 10.07, p = .006. The mixed subgroup 
demonstrated the largest effect size, g = 1.74, SE = 0.12, p < .001, followed by the assault 
trauma subgroup, g = 1.33, SE = 0.09, p < .001, and the combat trauma subgroup, g = 1.23, 
SE = 0.13 p < .001. Post-hoc analyses utilizing a partioned chi-square contrast method were

implemented to evaluate differences between groups. Because the mixed trauma group 
appeared to be different compared to the other two trauma type subgroups, we first evaluated 
differences between the mixed trauma subgroup and the combined assault and combat 
subgroups. The second contrast evaluated differences between the assault v. combat 
subgroups. Findings indicated that the treatment outcome effect in the mixed trauma 
subgroup was significantly larger than the combined assault/combat comparison, Q (1) = 
9.71, p = .002. There was not a statistically significant difference in pre-post change scores 
between the assault and combat subgroups, Q (1) = 0.36, p = .56.

Population type analyses revealed significant differences in treatment outcomes between 
civilian and military populations, Q (1) = 6.19, p = .01. Specifically, the military population 
subgroup, g = 1.22, SE = .10, p < .001 demonstrated a smaller treatment response in 
comparison to the civilian subgroup, g = 1.55, SE = 0.08, p < .001.

Given that attrition rate was a significant predictor of treatment outcomes, we also evaluated 
whether there were population differences in attrition rates. Lee et al. (2002) was excluded 
from analyses as this study was comprised of military and civilians participants. The total 
sample across studies demonstrated an omnibus attrition rate of approximately 26%. 
Subgroup analysis indicated there was not a significant difference in attrition between 
populations, Q (1) = 0.28, p = .60. Both groups had a similar attrition rate, with the military 
subgroup, 28%, CI (0.21, 0.36), demonstrating a slightly higher rate of attrition compared to 
civilians, 25%, CI (0.20, 0.31). Trauma type differences in attrition rates were not conducted 
because attrition information was not available by trauma type for studies that were 
separated as described (see Section 2.2. Coding Procedures and Definitions).

3.4  PTSD remission rate as a measure of clinically meaningful change

Approximately 59% of participants across studies no longer met criteria for PTSD at 
posttreatment. Population subgroup analysis were also conducted to evaluate PTSD 
diagnostic remission differences between military and civilian subgroups. Lee et al. (2002) 
was excluded from this analyses because this study included military and civilian subgroups. 
Subgroup analysis indicated that military populations demonstrated poorer rates of PTSD 
remission at posttreatment compared to civilians, Q (1) = 4.39, p = .04. Specifically, 50%, CI 
(0.39, 0.62), of the military population subgroup no longer met criteria for PTSD at 
posttreatment, while 65%, CI (0.57, 0.72), of the civilian population subgroup no longer met 
criteria for PTSD at posttreatment.

3.5  Results with the outlier study included in models

All analyses were re-evaluated with the Schnurr et al. (2007) outlier study included in the 
model.1 Preliminary analyses evaluating study and descriptive variables maintained similar 
patterns and significance levels with Schnurr et al. (2007) included in models. That is, 
attrition was the only variable that was predictive of treatment outcomes (p < .05). Treatment 

1All analyses were also evaluated with only the RCT studies included in the model (with and without the outlier study). Effect size 
statistics and the pattern of results were essentially unchanged (gdiff = ± 0.01) in comparison to the results reported in text.

outcomes did not vary by, nor were treatment outcome predicted by, any other study 
methodological or descriptive variable (p > .05).

When including the outlier study, trauma type no longer impacted treatment outcome, Q (2) 
= 3.24, p = .20. Specifically, the mixed trauma subgroup retained the largest effect size, but 
slightly decreased in magnitude compared to the first model, g = 1.64, SE = 0.18, p < .001; 
gdiff = −0.10. The combat trauma subgroup went from having the weakest effect in the first 
model to having the second largest effect in the second model, g = 1.30, SE = 0.20, p < .001; 
gdiff = 0.07. The assault trauma subgroup demonstrated the poorest treatment effect with the 
outlier study included in the model, g = 1.22, SE = 0.18, p < .001; gdiff = - 0.11. In contrast, 
treatment outcome differences as a function of population remained significant when 
Schnurr et al. (2007) was included in the model, Q (1) = 9.14, p = .003. The civilian 
subgroup maintained a larger treatment effect size, g = 1.56, SE = 0.09, p < .001; gdiff = 
0.00, compared to the military subgroup, g = 1.14, SE = 0.10, p < .001; gdiff = −0.13.

The pattern of PTSD remission rates was essentially unchanged when including the outlier 
study. That is, 57% of participants no longer met criteria for PTSD at posttreatment. 
Population differences in PTSD remission rates at posttreatment remained significant, Q (1) 
= 7.44, p = .006. With Schnurr et al. (2007) included in the model, 48%, CI (0.38, 0.58), of 
the military population subgroup no longer met criteria for PTSD, whereas 65%, CI (0.58, 
0.72), of the civilian population subgroup no longer met criteria for PTSD at posttreatment.

4.  Discussion

The primary aim of this meta-analysis was to evaluate PTSD treatment outcomes as a 
function of trauma type and population. Overall, there were large treatment effect sizes 
across studies and subgroups, indicating that first-line psychotherapy treatments for PTSD 
result in significant treatment benefits. Additionally, we evaluated PTSD remission rate as a 
measure of clinically meaningful change and, on average, 59% of the sample demonstrated 
PTSD remission at posttreatment. These findings provide additional support for the 
effectiveness of manualized, first-line psychotherapy treatments for PTSD that are strongly 
recommended among experts in the field (ISTSS, 2018).

Consistent with our second hypothesis, the combat subgroup benefitted less from treatment 
than did the mixed trauma subgroup. However, treatment response in the combat trauma 
subgroup was not different from the assault subgroup. These findings may be because the 
nature of assault and combat trauma events can be thought of as more severe compared to 
other trauma events, such as accidents, illness, and disasters. Additionally, assault and 
combat trauma events can be more chronic or repeated, although this is not always the case. 
Thus, these findings indicate that manualized, first-line PTSD psychotherapy treatments, 
although quite effective across trauma types, may be less effective in assault and combat 
trauma type categories relative to other trauma types.

This outcome is consistent with prior meta-analyses that have also found treatment outcomes 
variations as a function of trauma type (Bradley et al., 2005; Bisson et al., 2007; Sloan et al., 
2013). Although Bradley et al. and Bisson et al. did not conduct specific subgroup test

comparisons, both meta-analyses reported smaller treatment effect sizes among combat-
related studies. Sloan et al (2013) carried out specific subgroup tests in a sample of group-
based PTSD interventions and found that the mixed trauma subgroup demonstrated the 
largest treatment effect size in comparison to other trauma subgroups, such as combat-
related trauma types. This meta-analysis extends this pattern of treatment outcome 
differences to individual treatments and incorporates assault trauma events.

Trauma type findings in this meta-analysis should be interpreted with consideration of how 
the outlier impacted results. Variations in trauma type results with the outlier study included 
v. excluded in the model can potentially be explained by two possibilities. First, the 
variability in trauma type findings may bring into question the relative importance of trauma 
type with regard to treatment outcomes. Prior meta-analyses have emphasized difficulties in 
disentangling trauma type as a factor that impacts treatment outcomes in military 
populations (Bisson et al., 2007; Bradley et al., 2005; Sloan et al., 2013; Watts et al., 2013). 
Differences in the statistical stability of trauma type v. population type when the outlier 
study was included in the model provides a possible indication that population may be a 
more influential variable.

A second possibility for variations in trauma type analysis with the outlier study included in 
the model is potentially related to the uniqueness of the Schnurr et al. (2007) study sample. 
The women in this sample reported varying trauma types including combat, assault, and 
mixed traumas. Across these three trauma types, women with assault appeared to have 
particularly poor outcomes (g = 0.26) compared to women with mixed (g = 0.82) and 
combat (g = 1.16) traumas. Military women in this study endorsed high levels of PTSD 
symptom severity and a high number of lifetime traumatic exposures (Mtraumas = 10). It is 
likely that the comparatively smaller effect size (0.80), in this study reflects the high severity 
of trauma symptoms, the deleterious effects of a high rate of traumatic life events, the unique 
components of female military populations, and possibly the nature of MST.

Although there is some evidence to suggest that veterans who report MST as their index 
trauma have poorer PTSD treatment outcomes compared to veterans with combat-related 
index traumas (Zalta et al., 2018), unlike the Schnurr et al. (2007) subsample, those with 
MST-related index traumas still demonstrated large treatment effects in our meta-analysis 
(i.e., Surís et al., 2013). Moreover, there is also evidence indicating negligible difference in 
treatment outcomes for those with v. without MST (Tiet et al., 2015; Voelkel et al., 2015), 
which is similar to findings from this meta-analysis related to combat and assault-related 
traumas. Notably, all of these studies comparing those with MST v. combat trauma evaluated 
residential and intensive treatment programs. To our knowledge, there are no studies directly 
comparing treatment outcomes of weekly, first-line psychotherapy treatment for those with 
and without MST as their index trauma. Unfortunately, we were not able to examine MST as 
a separate trauma type category from assault in this meta-analysis. It is possible that the 
rudimentary trauma type categorization coding entirely masked the true effects of trauma 
type on treatment outcomes. Thus, the impact of trauma type on treatment outcomes 
warrants further evaluation and remains an empirical question. Future studies should explore 
how symptom presentation differences between combat-related PTSD and MST impact 
treatment outcomes.

The military population subgroup demonstrated a poorer treatment response compared to 
civilians as indicated by effect size differences and PTSD remission rates at posttreatment. 
This is consistent with our hypothesis and in line with prior meta-analytic results that have 
highlighted that military populations do not benefit from PTSD psychotherapy treatment to 
the same degree as civilians (Bisson et al., 2007; Bradley et al., 2005; Sloan et al., 2013; 
Steenkamp et al., 2015; Watts et al., 2013). Individual factors (e.g., psychiatric 
comorbidities) and systemic factors (e.g., mental health stigma and secondary gain) have 
been identified as important variables for consideration with regard to treatment engagement 
and outcomes in military populations (Bush et al., 2013; Guina et al., 2016; Magruder et al., 
2005; McNally & Frueh, 2013 Tarrier et al., 2000). Although prior research has highlighted 
the importance of considering these factors in psychotherapy treatment, minimal research 
has evaluated these issues. Therefore, the direct influence of these variables on treatment 
outcomes remains an empirical question.

Although pre-post treatment effects were large for all trauma and population types, across all 
groups, more than 40% of individuals continued to meet criteria for PTSD at posttreatment. 
This was even greater among military populations, half of whom still had PTSD after 
treatment. These findings are generally consistent with prior literature (Steenkamp et al., 
2015), and highlight the dire need to develop ways to improve treatment outcomes even 
though existing treatments yield large improvements on average. Further, this meta-analysis 
extends previous PTSD remission rate findings by directly comparing differences between 
military and civilian populations PTSD remission rates.

Higher rate of attrition was predictive of poorer treatment gains based on exploratory 
analyses, which is consistent with previous meta-analytic findings (Bradley et al., 2005; 
Sloan et al., 2013). Factors related to attrition may be different in civilian and military 
samples. For example, military culture factors, such as mental health stigma and career 
impact, could affect treatment seeking and attrition in military populations (Bush et al., 
2013; Sharp et al., 2015). However, there was not a significant difference in attrition rates 
between civilians and military subgroups. An absence of attrition rate differences supported 
previous research showing that attrition rates with first-line psychotherapy treatments for 
PTSD are a concern across populations (Garcia, Kelley, Rentz, & Lee, 2011; Imel, Laska, 
Jakcupcak, & Simpson, 2013; Steenkamp et al., 2015). Nonetheless, it is imperative that 
future research identify and be mindful of specific cultural factors that may lead to attrition 
across military and civilian populations.

We found no differences in treatment outcomes as a function of gender or age. The absence 
of gender effects in this study differs from previous PTSD treatment outcome reviews that 
suggest women experience greater symptom reductions than men (Wade et al., 2016; Watts 
et al., 2013). This discrepancy with previous research may potentially be explained by our 
decision to include only manualized, first-line psychotherapy treatments whereas previous 
meta-analyses included a more liberal criteria. The null findings for age effects were 
consistent with previous research demonstrating the effectiveness of PTSD treatment across 
age groups (Clapp & Beck, 2012; Cook, McCarthy, & Thorp, 2017). Taken together, 
findings from this meta-analysis provide additional support that first-line psychotherapy 
treatments for PTSD are effective regardless of age or gender.

A final point for discussion is consideration of publication bias. Fail-safe N analyses 
revealed minimal concerns for publication bias based on the number of studies required to 
produce a null effect, whereas trim and fill analysis found a slightly asymmetrical funnel 
plot suggestive of minor publication bias. Although trim and fill analysis produced a slightly 
asymmetrical funnel plot, the difference between the imputed effect size and the observed 
effect size was relatively trivial. Additionally, an asymmetrical funnel plot can indicate 
publication bias, but asymmetry may also be due to different causes other than publication 
bias, such as heterogeneity (Egger, Davey-Smith, Schneider, & Minder, 1997; Sterne, Egger, 
& Davey-Smith, 2001). Therefore, the presence of heterogeneity in this meta-analysis is a 
plausible explanation for the asymmetrical funnel plot. While publication bias was present to 
a degree in this study, and is an important consideration across meta-analyses, the presence 
of symmetry and small effect size difference between observed and imputed estimates 
provides an increased degree of confidence in findings from this meta-analysis.

4.1  Limitations

Several limitations should be noted from this review. First, there were a limited number of 
trials that utilized a first-line, manualized psychotherapy treatment for PTSD and provided 
information on specific trauma types that yielded effect size data. Review of the literature 
suggested that specific trauma type information was not consistently provided across trials 
and typically only a brief description of trauma type was provided, with insufficient 
information to parse apart trauma type by outcome effects. This trend was present across 
trauma types included in this study and resulted in utilizing broad categories (e.g., Mixed) to 
develop an adequate number of trauma type subgroups. The use of broad, generalized 
trauma categories may have masked treatment outcomes effects by trauma type and may 
also explain variations in trauma type findings discussed above. Additionally, there were 
challenges in defining trauma type in military-related studies. A number of studies utilized 
the term military-related trauma which was representative of a variety of trauma types, such 
as MST, combat trauma, training accidents, and in some cases traumas that may have 
occurred outside of the military. We directly contacted authors to parse apart trauma 
differences in military studies. However, there were limitations in data availability, which in 
turn resulted in a slightly rudimentary categorization of study samples. Additionally, 
individuals were categorized into specific trauma groups based on their presenting trauma 
event (i.e., index event); however, it is likely many individuals across studies had 
experienced multiple traumas in their lifetime that were representative of different trauma 
categories. All these factors may have impacted trauma type results and findings should be 
interpreted within the context of these limitations. This meta-analysis highlights the 
challenges of evaluating trauma type based on how this information is reported in the 
literature. The question as to whether treatment outcomes vary as a function of trauma type 
requires further investigation.

Another limitation is that we were unable to evaluate potential differences between active-
duty military and veteran populations because the military sample in this meta-analysis was 
almost entirely composed of veterans. We were also unable to evaluate various systemic and 
individual factors that may impact psychological treatment among active-duty military 
service members v. veterans. Indeed, previous research has identified individual and

systemic differences between active-duty and veteran populations, such as stigma, career 
threat, avoidance of deployment, and secondary gain (Guina et al., 2016; McNally & Frueh, 
2013). These factors may result in symptom minimization or exaggeration, influence 
motivation to seek or to benefit from treatment, and may vary across active-duty and veteran 
populations. Future research should evaluate such potential differences between active-duty 
military and veteran populations.

A final limitation to note is the generalizability of findings to alternative treatment types, 
treatment modalities, and treatment settings that were excluded from this meta-analysis, 
such as teletherapy, group therapy, and residential treatment settings. Our rationale to 
include only select interventions was to mitigate confounding variables and focus 
exclusively on highly recommended PTSD treatments. Although such interventions were 
excluded from this study, these methods have displayed positive evidence for military 
populations (e.g., Zalta et al., 2018). Findings should be interpreted within the context of the 
included treatment types, treatment modalities, and treatment settings. Moreover, future 
research should explore whether alternative methods of treatment delivery can help to 
improve treatment response for military populations.

4.2  Conclusions

Overall, first-line, manualized psychotherapies for PTSD appear to be very effective in 
ameliorating symptoms of PTSD across populations and trauma types. Despite the 
effectiveness of these treatments, military populations demonstrated worse treatment 
outcomes compared to civilians, and these differences appear to be robust. In contrast, 
specific trauma types that may be more severe in nature (e.g., assault and combat) were 
associated with poorer treatment response compared to other trauma types. Trauma type 
appeared to be a less robust finding and the inclusion of one outlier study resulted in trauma 
type differences becoming non-significant. Hence, the impact of trauma type warrants 
further investigation. Finally, a large minority of individuals across all groups did not 
achieve remission, and this number was particularly large in the military group. Together, 
these data highlight the necessity of continued efforts to improve treatment outcomes.

studies included some participants with non-combat traumas, but only the participants with 
combat trauma were included in the trauma type analysis due to small n in other trauma type 
categories (i.e., Rauch et al., 2009: n = 8; Thorp et al., 2012: n = 5). One study was separated 
by trauma type in trauma type analysis as follows: Nacash et al. (2011; n = 10) = Combat, 
Nacash et al. (2011; n = 5) = Mixed.

Figure 4. 
Repeated Measures Population Type Subgroup Analysis. g = Hedges’ g; SE = Standard 
Error; ES = effect size. One study included military and civilian participants and therefore 
was separated by population for population type analyses. Lee et al. (2002) was separated by 
population type as follows: Lee et al. (2002-1; n = 4) = Military, Lee et al. (2002-2; n = 8) = 
Civilian.
