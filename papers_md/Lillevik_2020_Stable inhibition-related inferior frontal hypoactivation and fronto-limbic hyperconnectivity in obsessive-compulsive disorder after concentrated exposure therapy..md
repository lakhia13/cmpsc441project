Response  inhibition  has  previously  been  suggested  as  an  endophenotype  for  obsessive–compulsive  disorder 
(OCD), evidenced by studies showing worse task performance, and altered task-related activation and connec-
tivity. However, it’s unclear if these measures change following treatment. In this study, 31 OCD patients and 28 
healthy controls performed a stop signal task during 3 T functional magnetic resonance imaging before treat-
ment,  while  24  OCD  patients  and  17  healthy  controls  were  rescanned  one  week  and  three  months  after 
concentrated exposure and response prevention over four consecutive days using Bergen 4-Day Format. To study 
changes over time we performed a longitudinal analysis on stop signal reaction time and task-related activation 
and  amygdala  connectivity  during  successful  and  failed  inhibition.  Results  showed  that  there  was  no  group 
difference  in  task  performance.  Before  treatment,  OCD  patients  compared  to  controls  showed  less  inhibition- 
related  activation  in  the  right  inferior  frontal  gyrus,  and  increased  functional  connectivity  between  the  right 
amygdala and the right inferior frontal gyrus and pre-supplementary motor area. During error-processing, OCD 
patients versus controls showed less activation in the pre-SMA before treatment. These group differences did not 
change after treatment. Pre-treatment task performance, brain activation, and connectivity were unrelated to the 
degree  of  symptom  improvement  after  treatment.  In  conclusion,  inferior  frontal  gyrus  hypoactivation  and 
increased fronto-limbic connectivity are likely trait markers of OCD that remain after effective exposure therapy.   

1. Introduction 

Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is characterized by intrusive 
obsessions  and  repetitive  compulsions  (American  Psychiatric  Associa-
tion, 2013). The disorder affects 1–3% of the population, is related to 
substantial impairment in personal, family and work life, and often re-
mains chronic if untreated (Stein et al., 2019). 

OCD patients have difficulty stopping rituals or ruminating once they 
have started, and tasks measuring the ability to cancel behaviors may be 
relevant to study the neurobiological processes underlying these symp-
toms (van Velzen et al., 2014). Response inhibition involves suppressing 

and cancelling actions in order to efficiently complete a task. Different 
paradigms exist that assess the subprocesses of inhibition, ranging from 
interference control tasks (e.g. Flanker task), action withholding tasks 
(e.g. Go/No-go task), and action cancellation tasks (e.g. Stop signal task; 
SST)  (van  Velzen  et  al.,  2014).  Meta-analyses  have  shown  that  OCD 
patients  show  small  to  moderate  difficulties  in  response  inhibition 
relative  to  healthy  controls,  with  the  largest  difference  in  action 
cancellation (Snyder et al., 2015). 

Functional neuroimaging studies have related OCD to subtle alter-
ations  in  cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical,  fronto-parietal,  and  fronto- 
limbic  circuits  (Stein  et  al.,  2019).  A  recent  meta-analysis  (Norman

Lillevik Thorsen et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      

et al., 2019) of response inhibition found that OCD patients compared to 
controls showed less inhibition-related activation in areas of the fronto- 
parietal  and  ventral  attention  networks,  including  the  dorsal  anterior 
cingulate cortex (dACC) and anterior insula. Hyperactivation was found 
in the premotor, orbitofrontal, parietal, and temporal cortices, as well as 
the  thalamus  and  caudate  nucleus.  OCD  patients  also  showed  more 
error-related activation in cingulo-opercular regions, also including the 
dACC  and  pre-supplementary  motor  area  (pre-SMA)  (Norman  et  al., 
2019). 

In an endophenotype functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) 
study of the SST in 41 OCD unmedicated patients, 17 unaffected siblings 
and  37  healthy  controls,  patients  (compared  to  controls)  showed  less 
activation in the right IFG and inferior parietal during inhibition, while 
both patients and siblings (compared to controls) showed more pre-SMA 
activation. Pre-SMA activation was suggested to be compensatory since 
it was related to better inhibitory task performance (shorter stop-signal 
reaction time; SSRT) (de Wit et al., 2012). Patients and unaffected sib-
lings also showed less connectivity between the left IFG and bilateral 
amygdala during successful inhibition, which was negatively related to 
pre-SMA  activation (van Velzen et  al., 2015). This  suggests that both 
OCD patients and siblings show altered recruitment of inferior frontal 
and  premotor  cortices  during  action  cancellation,  as  well  as  altered 
limbic connectivity. 

Recommended  first-line  treatments  for  OCD  include  exposure  and 
response  prevention  (ERP)  and  serotonin  reuptake  inhibitors  (SRI) 
(Stein et al., 2019). ERP can be effectively delivered intensively, weekly, 
¨
Ost et al., 2015). Rapid and sustained 
individually or in group-settings (
recovery  after  concentrated  treatment  may  be  provide  a  basis  for 
investigating both short- and long-term changes in task performance and 
inhibition-related brain network function. 

There  are  few  studies  on  how  response  inhibition  and  its  neural 
correlates  change  after  successful  treatment  (Thorsen  et  al.,  2015). 
Previous  findings  have  been  inconsistent,  with  both  increased  or  un-
changed task-related activation (or event related potentials when using 
EEG)  after  treatment,  and  inconsistencies  in  where  the  changes  were 
observed (Nabeyama et al., 2008; Nakao et al., 2005; Riesel et al., 2015). 
It’s  therefore  unclear  if  hyperactivation  or  hypoactivation  are  trait 
markers  or  endophenotypes  of  OCD,  or  if  they  are  dependent  on  the 
severity  of  the  disorder  (de  Wit  et  al.,  2012).  If  these  are  traits,  one 
would expect that these abnormalities remain after successful treatment. 
If they are state-related, hyperactivations might increase so that patients 
resemble  unaffected  siblings  (de  Wit  et  al.,  2012),  or  decrease  if 
compensation is no longer needed. There is also evidence that increased 
fronto-limbic connectivity may interfere with cognitive control in OCD 
and unaffected siblings (de Vries et al., 2014; van Velzen et al., 2015). 
We  recently  found  reduced  (normalized)  connectivity  between  the 
fronto-parietal and limbic networks after treatment using resting-state 
fMRI (Thorsen et al., 2020), which may suggest that limbic and task- 
related areas become more independent after treatment. 

We here investigated if concentrated ERP leads to changes in per-
formance,  task-related  brain  activation  and  connectivity  during  the 
response  inhibition  and  error  processing  using  the  SST.  Following  a 
preregistered analysis plan (https://osf.io/ye7q3), we first assessed 31 
patients and 28 controls the day before treatment, and assessed changes 
in 24 patients and 17 healthy controls after one week and after three 
months.  During  successful  inhibition,  we  expected  to  find  hypo-
activation in the IFG, dACC and parietal cortex, hyperactivation of the 
pre-SMA,  and  increased  fronto-limbic  connectivity  in  OCD  patients 
before treatment. We also expected more dACC and pre-SMA activation 
during  error  processing.  After  treatment,  we  expected  increased 
inhibition-related activation in the pre-SMA, IFG, inferior parietal cor-
tex, and dACC, and the fronto-limbic connectivity to normalize. We did 
not expect error-related activation to decrease after treatment. 

2. Methods 

2.1. Participants 

The study recruited 35 OCD patients and 31 healthy controls before 
treatment (See Table 1 for demographics, comorbidity, and medication). 
Patients  were  recruited  from  a  specialized  outpatient  OCD  clinic  at 
Haukeland  University  Hospital,  Bergen,  Norway,  while  controls  were 
recruited using bulletin boards, social media, and emails to local busi-
nesses. Patients were 18 years or older, had a primary diagnosis of OCD, 
had  a  minimum  Yale  Brown  Obsessive  Compulsive  Scale  (Y-BOCS) 
(Goodman  et  al.,  1989)  score  of  16,  and  were  fluent  in  Norwegian. 
Exclusion criteria for patients were symptoms primarily associated with 
hoarding, ongoing substance abuse, bipolar disorder or psychosis, sui-
cidal ideation, intellectual disability, or being unwilling to refrain from 
benzodiazepines  or  alcohol  during  treatment.  Participants  were 
required to be MRI compatible and not have a neurological illness. After 
exclusions,  the  baseline  sample  consisted  of  31  OCD  patients  and  28 
healthy  controls,  while  24  patients  and  17  controls  were  included  in 
longitudinal analyses including the day before treatment, after one week 
(directly  after  treatment),  and  after  three  months  (See  Supplemental 
Fig.  1  for  a  flowchart  with  reasons  for  exclusions).  The  study  was 
approved by the Regional Ethics Committee for South-Eastern Norway 
(2015/936) and all participants provided informed written consent. 

2.2. Measures 

All participants were diagnosed using the Structured Clinical Inter-
view (SCID) for DSM-IV (First et al., 2002), and healthy controls were 
free of any current or lifetime disorders. The Y-BOCS (Goodman et al., 
1989), Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) (Kroenke et al., 2001), and 
Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) (Spitzer et al., 2006) were used to 
measure  severity  of  obsessive–compulsive,  depressive,  and  anxiety 
symptoms. Clinical remission was defined as a total Y-BOCS score under 
13 and response as a minimum of 35% reduction on the Y-BOCS (Mataix- 
Cols et al., 2016). The Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function 
(BRIEF) (Roth et al., 2013) was used to measure subjective problems in

2.3. Bergen 4-Day treatment 

The Bergen 4-Day Treatment (B4DT) format is delivered during four 
consecutive  days  in  groups  for  3–6  patients  with  a  1:1  ratio  between 
patients and therapists (Havnen et al., 2014; 2017;; Launes et al., 2019; 
Riise et al., 2016, 2018). Routine clinical data and a randomized control 
trial have found a remission rate of 75%, while an additional 10% were 
improved,  and  15%  showed  no  significant  change  one  week  after 
treatment (Havnen et al., 2014, 2017; Launes et al., 2019), which are 
largely maintained after four years (Hansen et al., 2019). The first day of 
the B4DT consists of a group session with psychoeducation and planning 
of  individual  exposure  tasks.  The  next  two  days  consist  of  therapist- 
assisted  exposure  with  response  prevention  in  relevant  settings.  Pa-
tients are also instructed to perform exposure between the second and 
fourth day. The last day consists of relapse prevention and planning of 
self-exposure for the next three weeks (Kvale et al., 2018). 

2.4. Stop signal task 

The SST (de Wit et al., 2012) required responding to the direction of 
an arrow (left or right) by pressing a button with the index finger of the 
concordant  hand  during  go-trials  (Supplemental  Fig.  2).  Participants 
were instructed to respond as quickly and accurately as possible. Go- 
trials were pseudo-randomly mixed with stop-trials where participants 
are instructed to withhold their response when a cross was overlaid on 
the  arrow  with  a  variable  delay.  The  delay  of  the  stop  signal  was 
continuously  adapted  by  a  staircase  tracking  mechanism,  so  that  the 
participant reaches around 50% accuracy on stop-trials. Stop signal re-
action  time  (SSRT)  was  calculated  using  the  integration  method  over 
four blocks (Verbruggen et al., 2013). Exclusion criteria were go-trial 
error percentage over 40% or failed stop-trials outside of the 25–75% 
range  (Congdon  et  al.,  2012).  Group  differences  in  performance  was 
tested  using  t-tests  and  repeated-measures  ANOVAs  (RM-ANOVA) 
including the two groups over the three time points. 

2.5. Image acquisition and analyses 

MRI was done on a 3 T General Electric Discovery MR750 with an 
eight-channel head coil at Haukeland university hospital, Bergen, Nor-
way. An anatomical T1-weighted image was recorded in a 256 × 256 
matrix, 192 slices, voxel size approximately isotropic 1 mm3, TE = 30 
◦
, FoV = 256 mm. We acquired 430 echo 
ms, TR = 7000 s, flip angle = 12
planar images using a 64x64 matrix, 34 slices (2.8 mm thickness with 
◦
0.2 mm gap), TR = 2100 ms, TE = 30 ms, flip angle = 80
, FoV = 22 mm, 
voxel size = 3.44 × 3.44 × 3 mm, interleaved slice excitation. Functional 
data were preprocessed in SPM12 using slice time correction, realign-
ment, coregistering anatomical and functional images, normalization to 
MNI using unified segmentation, reslicing voxels to 3 mm3, and 8 mm 
smoothing with a FWHM kernel. Participants with movement exceeding 
one voxel were excluded. Accurate go-trials, accurate stop-trials, failed 
stop-trials were then modeled as 0 s events in subject-level models, along 
with six motion parameters. A high pass filter with 128 s cut-off was then 
applied to remove low frequency noise. 

We  used  the  generalized  psychophysiological  interaction  toolbox 
(gPPI) (McLaren et al., 2012) to model task-related functional connec-
tivity  during  accurate  go-trials,  accurate  stop-trials,  failed  stop-trials. 
The  left  (MNI  -23,-2,-16)  and  right  amygdala  (MNI  23,0,-16)  were 
defined  as  spherical  5  mm  seed  regions  based  on  the  Anatomical  La-
beling  Atlas  as  previous  studies  have  found  aberrant  amygdala  con-
nectivity during tasks probing action cancellation and working memory 
in OCD patients and their unaffected siblings (de Vries et al., 2014; van 
Velzen et al., 2015). PPI models included the three task regressors, three 
PPI  regressors,  time  course  of  the  seed  region,  and  six  motion 

parameters. 

Group comparisons for both activation and connectivity were done 
by entering successful response inhibition (SucStop > SucGo) and failed 
inhibition (FailStop > SucStop) into separate second-level models. We 
used permutation-based statistics for imaging analyses, as they are less 
dependent on statistical assumptions (Winkler et al., 2014). The Statis-
tical  Nonparametric  Mapping 
(http://nisox. 
org/Software/SnPM13/)  was  used  for  baseline  t-tests,  and  the  Multi-
variate  and  Repeated  Measures  (MRM)  toolbox  (McFarquhar  et  al., 
2016) for RM-ANOVAs. 

toolbox 

(SnPM) 

We defined regions of interest (ROI) based on the findings of a recent 
meta-analysis  of  the  SST  (Cieslik  et  al.,  2015).  To  ensure  optimal 
placement we first investigated the effect of successful and failed inhi-
bition across the whole sample at baseline (N = 59, voxel-wise pFWE <
0.05), and then placed 10 mm spheres in the bilateral anterior insula/ 
IFG, pre-SMA, operculum, inferior parietal cortex, and midline posterior 
cingulate  cortex  for  successful  inhibition  (Table  2  and  Supplemental 
Results). We excluded two healthy controls due to signal loss in the IFG. 
We did not find an effect of inhibition in the thalamus, dACC or sub-
thalamic  nucleus  and  these  ROIs  were  therefore  excluded.  For  failed 
inhibition  we  defined  the  midline  dACC  and  pre-SMA  (Table  2  and 
Supplemental Results). ROIs were combined into two separate binary 
masks  for  successful  and  failed  inhibition,  respectively.  ROI  analyses 
were  performed  by  limiting  the  included  voxels  to  the  binary  mask, 
which provided a single volume correction including all ROIs. Statistical 
significance was set at voxel-wise pFWE < 0.05. Exploratory analyses at 
uncorrected p < .001 are also presented for comparisons with previous 
studies. Results of whole-brain analyses at an uncorrected threshold are 
presented in the Supplement. 

3. Results 

3.1. Demographics, symptoms, and executive problems 

OCD patients and healthy controls were matched on age, gender and, 
educational  status  (Table  1).  OCD  patients  showed  significant  im-
provements over time on the Y-BOCS (F(2, 46) = 112.07, p < .001) and 
GAD-7 (F(2, 36) = 12.71, p < .001), but not PHQ-9 (F(2, 34) = 1.37, p =
.27). Healthy controls showed no significant changes in GAD-7 or PHQ-9 
over time (Table 3). One week after treatment, 16 (67%) patients were 
in remission, six (25%) significantly improved, and two (8%) were un-
changed.  After  three  months,  19  (79%)  were  in  remission,  two  (8%) 
significantly  improved,  and  three  (13%)  unchanged.  Based  on  the 
BRIEF,  OCD  patients  reported  worse  problems  in  most  executive  do-
mains  than  the  normal  population,  particularly  in  task  shifting  and 
initiation. This was also supported by informant reports from the family 
of the patient (Supplemental Table 1).

3.2. Task performance 

There were no significant group differences in SSRT or go-trial re-
action time at any time point (Table 4). The RM-ANOVA of SSRT showed 
no significant effects of group (F(1, 41) = 0.59, p = .44), time (F(1,82) =
0.06, p = .81), and group × time interaction (F(2,82) = 1.03, p = .36). 

3.3. Task-related brain activation 

During  successful  inhibition,  OCD  patients  (n  = 31)  showed  less 
activation than healthy controls (n = 26) in the right IFG before treat-
ment (Table 5, Fig. 1). This right IFG hypoactivation in OCD patients was 
not  found  in  the  RM-ANOVA,  which  showed  no  significant  effects  of 
group, time or group × time interaction (OCD n = 24 versus HC n = 17). 
Right  IFG  hypoactivation  in  OCD  patients  before  treatment  was  also 
evident  in  whole-brain  analyses  at  an  uncorrected  threshold  (Supple-
mental Table 6). 

During error processing, OCD patients (n = 24) showed less pre-SMA 
activation than healthy controls (n = 26) (MNI 0,14,62, t = 2.98, pFWE =
0.05) before treatment. The RM-ANOVA showed no significant effects of 
group, time or group × time interaction (OCD n = 24 versus HC n = 17). 
Pre-SMA hypoactivation in OCD patients was not significant in explor-
atory whole-brain analysis (Supplemental Table 7). 

3.4. Task-related connectivity 

Before treatment, OCD patients (n = 31) compared to controls (n =
26) showed significantly more connectivity between the right amygdala 
and pre-SMA during successful inhibition, while more connectivity with 
the right IFG reached a trend level (Table 6). Right amygdala-pre-SMA 
hyperconnectivity  was  also  found  at  a  corrected  threshold  in  whole- 
brain  analysis  (Supplemental  Table  8).  There  were  no  significant 
group  differences  for  left  amygdala  connectivity  in  ROI  analyses,  but 
some  findings  emerged  in  exploratory  whole-brain  analyses  (Supple-
mental Table 9). To investigate the group differences over time for the 
right amygdala we ran a 2x3 RM-ANOVA (24 OCD versus 17 HC over 
three time points), which revealed a significant effect of group in the 
right  pre-SMA,  with  no  significant  effects  of  time  or  group  × time 
interaction  (Table  7,  Fig.  1).  This  was  also  evident  in  whole-brain 

analysis at an uncorrected threshold (Supplemental Table 12). Within- 
group  analyses  of  extracted  beta  values  found  that  OCD  patients 
showed increased positive connectivity between the right amygdala and 
the right IFG for successful inhibition versus go-trials (t(30) = 2.37, p =
.02), while healthy controls showed no significant difference between 
task conditions (t(25) = -1.78, p = .09, Fig. 2). For connectivity between 
amygdala and pre-SMA, 2x3 RM-ANOVAs (successful stop- versus suc-
cessful  go  over  three  time  points)  found  that  OCD  patients  showed 
increased  connectivity  during  successful  inhibition  versus  go-trials  (F 
(1,23)  = 9.89,  p  < .01,  η2
p  = .30).  In  comparison,  healthy  controls 
showed decreased connectivity during successful inhibition versus go- 
trials (F(1,16) = 6.68, p = .02, η2

p = .29). 
On the failed inhibition contrast, there were no group differences in 
connectivity  with  the  left  or  right  amygdala  before  treatment.  RM- 
ANOVAs also found no significant group, time, or group × time inter-
action effects. 

3.5. Correlations of task performance and imaging with behavioral and 
clinical measures 

We  used  MarsBar  to  extract  the  mean  estimate  of  IFG  activation, 
amygdala-pre-SMA, and amygdala-IFG connectivity using 6 mm spheres 
around the peak voxel. Peak voxels for pre-treatment IFG activation and 
amygdala-IFG connectivity was defined as the voxel with the highest t- 
value  in  the  t-test  comparing  OCD  patients  and  healthy  controls  (Ta-
bles 5 and 6), while the peak voxel for amygdala-pre-SMA connectivity 
was defined as the voxel with the highest F-value in the effect of group in 
the repeated-measures ANOVA (Table 7). Exploratory tests in IBM SPSS 
Statistics  25  were  then  used  to  assess  the  relationship  between  these 
variables  and  symptom  severity  or  task  performance.  Using  Pearson 
correlations  we  found  no  significant  relations  between  pre-treatment 
activation or connectivity and pre-treatment Y-BOCS, GAD-7 or PHQ-9 
severity.  A  multilevel  regression  analysis  including  all  time  points 
found that more right amygdala-IFG connectivity during successful in-
hibition was related to longer SSRT in OCD patients (b = 7.39, SE =
3.45, t = 2.14, p = .037), which was not found for right amygdala-pre- 
SMA connectivity. Linear regression models were used to investigate if 
pre-treatment SSRT, IFG activation, amygdala-pre-SMA, or amygdala- 
IFG  connectivity  predicted  Y-BOCS  severity  after  treatment  while 
adjusting for baseline Y-BOCS severity, but these models did not result in 
any  significant  findings.  Finally,  two-sample  t-tests  suggested  that 
medication use,  age of  onset, or  comorbid anxiety or  mood disorders 
were not significantly related to IFG activation, amygdala-pre-SMA, or 
amygdala-IFG connectivity in OCD patients (Supplementary Figs. 5–8). 

4. Discussion 

We  compared  OCD  patients  and  healthy  controls  on  task  perfor-
mance, task-related brain activation, and connectivity during response 
inhibition  and  error  processing,  and  studied  how  these  measures 
changed  after  effective  behavioral  treatment.  As  hypothesized,  OCD 
patients compared to controls showed less right IFG activation during 
successful  response  inhibition  before  treatment,  but  there  were  no

markers of OCD that are unrelated to treatment outcome. 

Norman and colleagues (Norman et al., 2019) have suggested that 
key regions for inhibitory control are underrecruited in OCD, leading to 
worse inhibitory control. They further propose that patients are aware of 
this underperformance, leading to an increased error response. In turn, 
this  leads  to  greater  limbic  involvement  and  even  poorer  inhibitory 
control (Norman et al., 2019). The present findings of less task-related 
IFG  activation  and  more  fronto-limbic  connectivity  partially  support 
these  hypotheses.  However,  we  did  not  see  worse  task  performance 
during inhibition nor more activation during error processing. Norman 
and colleagues (Norman et al., 2019) only found a very small difference 
in response time between OCD patients and healthy controls suggesting 
that  very  large  samples  are  needed  to  reliably  detect  this  behavioral 
difference.  Further,  a  combined  EEG-fMRI  study  found  that  OCD  pa-
tients compared with healthy controls can show stronger error-related 
negativity  without  a  significant  difference  in  pre-SMA  BOLD  ampli-
tude (Grutzmann et al., 2016). 

The  finding  of  IFG  hypoactivation  in  OCD  patients  versus  healthy 
controls replicates the finding of our earlier cross-sectional study using 
this  same  stop-signal  paradigm  in  a  different  sample,  scanner,  and 
country (de Wit et al., 2012). It is also in line with structural studies 
showed altered volume of this region in OCD (de Wit et al., 2014) and a 
negative association between IFG volume and inhibitory performance 

(Menzies et al., 2007). Hypoactivation of the IFG in OCD patients could 
be related to subtle alterations in attention to the stop-signal, response 
selection or inhibitory impairment, since the IFG plays an integral role in 
these processes (Aron et al., 2014). Although we did not observe any 
differences  in  task  performance  at  the  group-level,  we  did  find  that 
increased connectivity between the right amygdala and right IFG during 
successful inhibition was related to longer SSRT in OCD, suggestive of 
limbic  interference  on  inhibitory  control  (de  Vries  et  al.,  2014;  van 
Velzen et al., 2015). 

The  increased  amygdala-pre-SMA  connectivity  during  successful 
inhibition  versus  go-trials  in  patients  may  be  indicative  of  increased 
salience of the stop-signal in general, possibly due to an oddball phe-
nomenon  (Dayan-Riva  et  al.,  2019).  Interestingly,  fronto-limbic  con-
nectivity  in  the  same  sample  of  OCD  patients  was  reduced  after 
treatment when measured at rest (Thorsen et al., 2020). This suggests 
that limbic interference may be modulated by increased task demands 
(de Vries et al., 2014). Future work could use tasks with varying task 
loads and emotional stimuli to better understand if abnormal task per-
formance or network activation are a result of altered cognitive capacity, 
emotional interference, or inflexibility (Bradbury et al., 2011; Thorsen 
et al., 2018). 

Contrary  to  our  previous  reports,  we  did  not  replicate  findings  of 
increased  pre-SMA  activation  (de  Wit  et  al.,  2012)  or  increased 

NeuroImage:Clinical28(2020)1024606A. Lillevik Thorsen et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      

connectivity between the left IFG and the amygdala in patients versus 
controls (van Velzen et al., 2015). These null findings could be influ-
enced  by  sample  size  and  sample  characteristics.  Moreover,  we  here 
observed  more  positive  fronto-limbic  connectivity  during  successful 
inhibition in OCD compared to controls, whereas we previously found 
increased negative connectivity during inhibition, but positive connec-
tivity during working memory (de Vries et al., 2014). We cannot exclude 
the possibility that differences in direction of fronto-limbic connectivity 
alterations  are  related  to  methodological  differences  in  PPI  analyses. 
Less pre-SMA activation during failed inhibition versus successful stop 
trials  in  OCD  patients  compared  to  healthy  controls  before  treatment 
was also an unexpected finding. A recent meta-analysis found that OCD 
patients  on  average  showed  more  pre-SMA  activation  during  error 
processing than healthy controls (Norman et al., 2019), but this was not 
found in either of the two included studies using the SST (de Wit et al., 
2012;  Rubia  et  al.,  2010).  It  is  unclear  if  the  correlates  of  error  pro-
cessing  differ by the  kind of response  inhibition. The SST  specifically 
measures action cancellation, as the stop signal is presented after the 
presentation of the go-signal (van Velzen et al., 2014). Action cancel-
lation may be a more difficult form of response inhibition and may be 
particularly  relevant  for  OCD  as  these  patients  show  difficulties  in 
stopping compulsions that have already been initiated (van Velzen et al., 
2014). Parametric studies of working memory and planning have sug-
gested that OCD patients are unable to maintain the required increases 
in  activation  during  more  difficult  trials  when  compared  to  healthy 
controls (de Vries et al., 2014; Heinzel et al., 2018; van den Heuvel et al., 
2005). It is therefore possible that OCD patients are similarly unable to 
maintain pre-SMA activation during error processing in the more diffi-
cult SST than other response inhibition tasks. 

This study is limited by the sample size. Thus, most findings from ROI 
analyses  were  only  significant  at  an  uncorrected  threshold  in  whole- 
brain  analyses.  The  limited  sample  size  also  precluded  equivalence 
tests to formally determine that activation and connectivity estimates 
were equal over time in OCD patients. A wait-list control condition may 
also have formally excluded the possibility of non-specific variation over 
time. 

This is the first study to show that IFG activation and fronto-limbic 
connectivity during response inhibition in OCD does not change after 
concentrated  ERP.  Furthermore,  we  found  no  evidence  that  pre- 
treatment IFG activation or fronto-limbic connectivity predicted treat-
ment outcome. The present findings extend previous evidence that both 
OCD patients and unaffected siblings (de Wit et al., 2012; van Velzen 
et al., 2015), compared to unrelated healthy controls, show abnormal 
IFG  activation  and  fronto-limbic  connectivity  during  response  inhibi-
tion. Together  with the lack of change over  time as  presented in this 
study, this suggests that these are trait markers of OCD.
