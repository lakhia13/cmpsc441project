Abstract

Background A collaborative health-care relationship is considered
critical in managing chronic illness like diabetes. Poorly controlled
diabetes can greatly diminish one’s quality of life and lead to
severe complications or even death.

Rationale Understanding how to improve the relationship between
patients and their providers supports improved diabetes health
outcomes.

Objective We conducted a grounded theory study to examine the
types of relationships that diabetic patients and their spouses pre-
fer to form with their health-care providers.

Results The analysis of in-depth interviews with 18 diabetic cou-
ples reveals four major relationship preferences that diﬀer by the
nature of caregiving and decision-making power demonstrated by
the physician.

Conclusion Using illustrative examples, we show how the type of
health-care relationship couples prefer is explained by their con-
nection with one another and suggest implications for practitioners
that expand current collaborative models of care.

Diabetes aﬀects more than 25.8 million people
living in the United States and is linked to seri-
ous medical complications.1 Treatment can be
challenging and often consists of monitoring
blood-glucose levels, medication, exercise and
dietary therapy. Collaborative, patient-centreed
care is considered the ideal approach in the
treatment of chronic illness, of which shared
decision making is a principal component.
Both providers and patients are experts who
contribute valuable information to medical
decisions.2 The need for long-term treatment
and adherence to self-care for patients with
diabetes makes it important to develop eﬀective

relationships with their health-care systems,
and more speciﬁcally their treating physicians.
Our study explores health-care preferences of
married couples when at least one partner has
diabetes.

in making treatment-related decisions is also

Treatment for diabetes has become increas-
ingly holistic and collaborative. In a critical
review of literature, Daiski12 concluded that
provider-directed treatment was generally less
eﬀective. Lutfey13
found that providers are
often ﬂexible and strategic in their style of
relating to patients with diabetes and may tai-
lor their approaches to meet individual patient
needs. Similarly, Montori et al.14 questioned

Another major inﬂuence on the experience
and management of diabetes is the spousal rela-

researchers found that participants were 26%
more likely to acquire type 2 diabetes when a
spouse has a history of diabetes.15 In another
study, participants who were married demon-
strated enhanced self-care eﬀorts when com-
pared to non-married participants.16 Marital

partner’s perceptions of diabetes is related to
how patients with diabetes understand and man-

rather it occurs in the context of a family sys-
tem. In a recent study, researchers gathered
responses from 2057 participants who were
family members to someone with diabetes and
found that their experiences were full of unique
challenges and unmet needs.29 This is congru-
ent with our
that
encourages us to understand that behaviour is
embedded within multiple relational and larger
systems.30 The spousal subsystem is of particu-
lar importance given its intimate nature and
executive position within the family. It can pro-
vide partners and other members of the family
‘a supportive platform for dealing with the ext-
rafamilial world’.31 Believing that the couple
relationship is a central organizing component
in how patients cope with diabetes and navi-
gate their systems of care, we used this context
for understanding patient preferences for their
provider’s way of engaging.

In this study, we explore health-care prefer-
ences of persons with diabetes and their
spouse. Our purpose is to add to the literature
that is considering care more systemically and
expanding
about providing patient-
centreed care. Speciﬁcally, we privilege the
marital relationship and its impact on health-
care preferences and highlight nuances within
known ways of providing care.

Method

We utilized grounded theory methodology to
articulate and explain couples’ health-care rela-
tionship preferences.32 This method allows
researchers to generate theory from data that
are gathered and analysed systematically and
reciprocally.33 Considered a standard in quali-
tative research, grounded theory is especially
suited for identifying categories,34 understand-
ing relationships among them32 and distin-
guishing
complicated
nuances within
processes.34 The demands of simultaneous and
careful data collection and analysis make it a
rigorous methodology, as do the requirements
of
saturation. The ability to identify and
explain complex phenomena makes grounded
theory ideal for our research design.

approval
to conduct our study, participants
were recruited primarily from San Bernardino
County in Southern California by marriage
and family therapy students at (INSERT) Uni-
versity. We utilized convenience and snowball
sampling methods to identify our target popu-
lation of married couples in which one member
of the spousal unit was diagnosed with diabe-
tes.35 Our aim was to recruit those who would
engage in meaningful conversation regarding
their experience of health-care relationships
rather than ascertain the type of representative-
ness desired in quantitative research. Our focus
was to reach the point of data saturation in
which no new information was obtained about
health-care relationship preferences. To partici-
pate in our study, the participants needed to
meet two key requirements: (i) be married or
cohabiting adults in a committed relationship,
with at least one partner who has type 2 diabe-
tes, and (ii) be willing to be interviewed
together about their relationship and experi-
ences with diabetes. Theoretical sampling was
utilized throughout
to further generate and
reﬁne emergent categories.

Our sample consisted of 18 married couples
who had been together an average of 29 years.
The average age of wives was 51; the mean for
husbands was 52. Of the 18 couples, wives
were diagnosed with diabetes in seven couples,
and husbands were the identiﬁed patients in
10. The average time diagnosed was 8 years,
ranging from 3 to 15. In one couple, both part-
ners were diagnosed with diabetes. Although

about how couples engage emotionally was,

with ‘In general, what has been your experi-

follow-up questions being, ‘What does he/she
do to help?’ Interviewers followed participants’
leads, using explorative prompts to expand
and deepen couple
responses. When we
ﬁnished transcribing the interviews, more than
400 pages of information were available for
examination.

Findings

‘Employer’,

This study investigated couple preferences for
the health-care relationship when at least one
spouse has been diagnosed with diabetes. Our
analysis reveals two major dimensions that
organize how couples prefer to relate to their
health-care provider: decision making and care-
giving. Within these two major dimensions, we
found four speciﬁc preferences of provider to
couple relationships:
‘Colleague’,
‘Parent’ and ‘Sibling’
(See Table 1). Results
also reveal that couple preferences are main-
tained across daily and acute care, but are
heightened by crisis. For instance, one couple
who preferred emotional support was frus-
trated by their doctor’s instrumental approach
and described their frustration quickly escalat-
ing when she was critically ill. They needed
hope and encouragement, and their doctor was
focused on medical management. Diﬀerences in
preferences were not identiﬁed within couple.

With regard to the dimension of decision
making, some couples (eight of 18) reﬂect a
preference for providers who make treatment
decisions collaboratively. Much to our surprise,
the slight majority (10 of 18) described wanting
providers to make decisions for them. Within
the dimension of caregiving, exactly half of the
couples in our study have a strong desire for a
provider who oﬀers emotional support, while
the other half of our couples prefer a more
instrumental way of providing care. Below, we
ﬁrst describe the dimensions of caregiving and
decision making and then consider each speciﬁc
preference and the
that
support these.

Analysis

Using conventional grounded theory methodol-
ogy,32 data analysis began immediately, concur-
rent with data collection, and continued until
the point of saturation. We ﬁrst transcribed
interviews verbatim. Next, we utilized open
coding to group similar phenomena,32 searching
for text describing the couple, their provider
and the
relationship between them. This
allowed us ‘to label, separate, compile and
organize data’.37 (p. 111) Reﬂective memos focus-
ing on the relationship between codes and cate-
gories were kept throughout analysis.37

The primary analytic tool was the constant
comparative method in which data were com-
pared and examined for similarities and diﬀer-
ences. Independent coders compared codes and
discussed emergent themes to ascertain inter-
rater reliability. Axial coding helped us to fur-
ther examine the relationship between and

employed to ascertain redundancies among the
data to consolidate and reconcile codes as well
as to examine the emerging theory as being
accurate reﬂections of
the data. Participant
checks were also employed to further reﬁne
relationships between categories and determine
the ‘ﬁt’ or appropriateness of our ﬁnal theory.38
All researchers ‘no matter how unstructured
or inductive, comes to ﬁeldwork with some ori-
enting ideas’.39 (p. 17) It seems appropriate to
state our relationships with diabetes to enhance
credibility.40 The ﬁrst author’s

couples with diabetes results from having two
family members diagnosed with diabetes, one
of whom describes his relationship with his
provider as highly problematic and the other
who died from complications related to uncon-
trolled diabetes. The second author has a close
friend who was diagnosed with diabetes several
years ago and has experienced diﬃculty in rela-
tionships with both family members and
health-care providers as a result. Furthermore,
both of us are medical
family therapists
(MedFTs) who work in a hospital setting with
patients diagnosed with diabetes and other
chronic illnesses. We have seen ﬁrsthand how

treatment options, providing referrals or admit-
ting someone to the hospital. A patient’s wife

monitoring him. . . .[the] provider for him has

Other couples described the meaningfulness
of emotional support, much like the type of
concern and care that might be expected from
a loving family member. Most often discussed
was the importance of oﬀering encouragement
and expressing compassion or sensitivity. A
patient spouse indicated, ‘My wife’s doctor is
great; he takes the time to get to know you,
he’s really personable and warm; he treats you
like you should be’. A diﬀerent patient relayed
frustration with a physician who did not live
up to her preferences for caregiving:

He would say, ‘Do you want me to save your
ass?’ It’s like a regimen. When I almost went into
a diabetic coma, my doctor. . . looked at me and
just shook his head. It seems that there are few
good doctors out there who really care.

This couple expressed a desire for more con-
cern and sensitivity and described their physi-
cian as punitive, leading them to believe that
he did not care about them.

Decision-making dimension

Couples who wanted providers to make treat-
ment decisions willingly complied with physician
prescriptions. For example, one participant said,
‘Do I disagree? No, whatever they say. . . I
believe, I do it’. Couples who preferred collabo-
ration emphasized how important it was for
them to have a say in their treatment or
expressed dissatisfaction when providers made

decisions unitarily. A wife with diabetes dis-
cussed her frustration with her doctor in telling
her, ‘You can’t have any more kids’. Instead of
dictating her care, she wanted support in manag-
ing diabetes during pregnancy. Interestingly,
couples in both categories wanted information
and education on diabetes management: even
those who were happy to follow doctor’s orders
wanted to understand the illness process and
treatment.

By examining the dimensions of decision mak-

ness or compassion. One husband stated, ‘Well,
we have had a good experience with profes-
sionals. The one we have now is the one my
wife says is her half-relative. He is a wonderful
person’. The couple discussed their doctor’s
dedication and relational style of interaction.
They appreciated their doctor taking the lead
on diabetes management, never disagreed with
him and claimed to always follow his recom-
mendations. Another husband described his

. . .I can’t hear someone say ﬂat out
you’re going to kill yourself. I just can’t hear
that’. She then relayed that she’s labelled as
either a ‘good’ or ‘bad’ patient depending on
whether or not she follows her doctor’s orders.
She indicated a preference for a provider that
takes her
into consideration
rather than implementing a one-size ﬁts all
treatment and explained,
‘I need someone to
help me through it, and guide me, instead of
saying, “you’re doing it wrong”’. The couple

Preference for an employer
These couples (5) expected the physician to pre-
scribe treatment and provide instrumental care.
They often described feeling satisﬁed with
receiving advice and emphasized the importance
of following doctors’ orders, ‘[I] try to do the

things that he tells you that you need to do.
That is one of the important things. He tells me
what I need to do and I go, “yes”’. Instead of
expecting to collaborate in treatment decisions,
these patients trusted their doctors’ prescrip-
tions implicitly and valued action-based ways
of providing patient care. This same patient
husband emphasized how important it is for
the doctor to provide him with information and
direction related to diabetes treatment. When
asked by the interviewer whether or not the
provider cares he stated, ‘I think if he didn’t
care he’d just say, “Okay you just go ahead and
do what you’re going to do”’. These couples
consistently emphasized the role of their physi-
cian as one of leadership and action, much like
might be expected of an eﬀective employer.

Preference for a colleague
These couples (4) described a preference for a
provider whose care is expressed instrumen-
tally, but whose relationship is built on mutual
inﬂuence. They emphasized the importance of
negotiating treatment when they disagree with
their doctor’s ability to work eﬃciently. One
couple described various tasks the physician
completed and their physician’s quick response
to help during a time of crisis, ‘The next thing
he did was to take my blood/sugar level. . . .
He acted. He put me in the hospital, which
was where I belonged because you need to be
under a controlled environment’. When he dis-
agrees with the provider he responds by telling
his doctor readily. . ., ‘I told her that I need to
change to another medication. So I called her
up and told [her that I] want to switch back’.
He described an appreciation for how much
his provider values his opinion and elevates
him as a member of the treatment team.

Another couple who preferred a ‘Colleague’
relationship experienced signiﬁcant frustration
when a provider operated from a place of hier-
archy instead of collaborative support. Despite
their desire to be heard, their provider was
reluctant to alter the patient’s treatment plan
when the couple was convinced that changes
needed to be made. The couple relayed the fol-
lowing experience:

3142

Preferential relating, S I Falke and L Lawson

Before we were on the pump, I would give you
two cents as far as I could throw him. Now that
we are on the pump, he knows what is going on.
But before, when her blood sugar was so darn
high and low you would think that he would do
something about it, and get it kind of leveled
out. . . he just wasn’t with the game at all.

They described not only their dissatisfaction
with the physician’s inability to receive input,
but also his failure to accomplish tasks eﬀec-
tively. Like those who preferred an ‘Employer’,
these patients indicated an appreciation for
instrumental care, but wanted a say in their
treatment.

Explanation of decision-making preferences

Couples who preferred that their provider take
the lead on treatment decisions by assuming
the role of ‘Parent’ or ‘Employer’ maintained
an element of hierarchy in their spousal rela-
tionships. They seemed to subscribe to more
traditional gender roles where the husband
makes the decisions and tasks are speciﬁcally
divided. One wife noted,
‘I let him decide
mainly the big things. As far as money goes,
he knows more about it’. Another wife com-
‘We have our duties’ and that indi-
mented,
cated that when major decisions are made her
husband will ‘impose his power’. Male partners
often answered questions about
fairness or
equality by stating that they ‘don’t think about
it’ or that equality does not play an important
part in understanding their relationship. Hus-
bands in this category seemed to frequently
interrupt their wives or answer questions ﬁrst.
Interestingly, they tended to do the majority of
the talking around issues related to equality or
division of household tasks.

Couples who preferred collaborative rela-
tionships with their providers, whether a
‘Sibling’ or
‘Colleague’, demonstrated more
egalitarian couple relationships. They often
they share tasks and as one
reﬂected that
patient stated, ‘do what you gotta do’ rather
than operate based on clearly deﬁned roles.
They participated more evenly in the interview
and when asked about equality, both spouses

responded to and underscored the importance
of equality and teamwork. Some proudly drew
a distinction between their relationship and a
more traditional one. For instance, one couple
happily discussed how they both worked full
time and explained how they accommodate to
the needs of one another. Another husband
indicated, ‘We’re equal in every way: mentally,
education, work, sharing responsibility with
the kids’. He went on to say that he was a
pharmacist and that at times, he disagrees with
physicians. He stated, ‘I advise him and so he
knows about it and he is pretty cool about
it. . . We work together’. Clearly, the couple
expected to contribute to their health care in
being elevated as a member of the treatment
team. It is possible that for this couple, the
husband’s profession, as well as couple dynam-
ics,

Explanation of caregiving preferences

Couples who preferred providers to ﬁll the role
of ‘Sibling’ or ‘Parent’ felt cared for when the
provider expresses emotional support. These
couples more openly expressed their feelings
about what it is like to live with diabetes and
about other life-experiences, and were warm,
aﬀectionate or expressed love towards one
another during the interview. For instance, one
couple expressed pain around the management
of diabetes. The husband cried several times
during the interview as he reﬂected on his
struggle. Another
couple openly expressed
heartache around changes in social support
and status experienced due to immigration.
These couples also emphasized the importance
of kindness and compassion within their couple
relationship. A husband explained that his wife
calling to say she missed him ‘really touched
me’ and stated, ‘I love her so much.’ Another
husband described his wife as ‘caring’ and
‘loving’ and indicated that what he appreciates
most about her is how caring she is. Not sur-
prisingly, these warm and expressive couples
felt cared for when their physician provides
them with sensitivity and emotional support.

rather

service,

In contrast, patient couples who preferred
more instrumental means of care demonstrated
love through tasks or
than
through emotional support. For instance, a
husband with diabetes explained that he knows
his wife cares about him because ‘she fusses
about the meal’. He felt valued by her service
and elaborated on how she washes his clothes
and keeps a clean house. Couples within this
category even talked about the lack of emo-
tional expression in their relationships. One
wife stated,
‘He doesn’t share feelings’ and
indicated that her husband rarely
another
shows emotion. The narratives show that cou-
ples who preferred instrumental care consis-
tently emphasized how grateful they were for
the things their provider did for them and
described their marital relationship in ways
that reﬂect an appreciation for service.

Discussion

Our ﬁndings reveal that patients with diabetes
have unique preferences for how they connect
with their provider. These
seem largely
impacted by how they engage in and under-
stand non-health-care relationships. Namely,
the spousal relationship seems to meaningfully
inﬂuence health-care preferences. Although a
top-down approach to health-care conﬂicts
with best care practices, we speculate that there
might be considerable diﬀerence between cou-
ples who want this type of health-care relation-
ship and those who do not. A patient’s
opportunity to say how they would like to
relate might in and of itself be empowering,
even if they desire a less active role in making
treatment decisions. This might be a signiﬁ-
cantly diﬀerent experience than couples who
want to equally contribute to decision-making
processes but feel devalued or undermined by
their provider.

Almost half of our couples (10 out of 18) felt
cared for when their providers did instrumen-
tal health-care management on their behalf.
They
switched medications, ordered tests
and facilitated other health-related changes to
foster successful disease management. Perhaps

instrumental care enticed these couples to feel
like their physician was doing all she could to
take care of them physically. Among couples
who emphasized the importance of emotional
support (eight out of 18), it seemed as though
their physicians’ verbal expressions of comfort
or hope led them to feel a sense of closeness
with their doctor that they appreciated. For
these couples, emotional support allowed them
to feel as though their physician personally
cared for them and had their best interest in
mind.

Our data suggest that health-care preferences
are largely impacted by couple relationship
dynamics. This is not surprising when we con-
sider the power of attachment. We learn about
ourselves and others through early attachment
experiences
as we develop what Bowlby
referred to as internal working models.41 These
models frame our way of relating, and we
carry
relationships.
Moreover, when our primary attachment rela-
tionship moves from parent
to spouse, our
ways of interacting continue to be reﬁned and
applied to our interactions with others.42 It fol-
lows that expectations for relating stemming
from the couple relationship are transferred to
the health-care relationship.

them into subsequent

When couples relate to one another in more
egalitarian ways,
they seem to transfer this
same expectation onto their provider, assuming
relationship in
a collaborative health-care
which they share power. However, when cou-
ples conform to more traditional roles, collabo-
ration becomes less expected and the provider’s
expertise is privileged. This seems to reﬂect a
transfer of internal working models from one
relational
another. Previous
into
research seems to corroborate this idea by ﬁnd-
ing that patients who experience a dismissive
attachment style seem to relate to their provid-
ers in ways that lead to poorer health out-

needs (See Table 2). Furthermore, enhanced

patient care might help providers consider
ways to adjust when patients prefer something
other than the provider’s natural
inclination.
This might be especially useful when there is
an impasse in patient care.

Couple and family interactions might pro-
vide a unique window into patient health-care
preferences. Observing couple interactions and
asking couples how they make decisions might
oﬀer useful
information (See Table 2) about
how to best join with them in the management
of their illness, particularly when couples have
diﬃculty directly expressing their needs to their
provider. For instance, do patients and their
spouse make decisions together or unitarily?
Do they seem openly aﬀectionate and expres-
sive, or do they emphasize how loved ones help
them manage diabetes day-to-day? Approach-
ing patient relationships with these kinds of
questions in mind, as well as observing whether
or not the patient’s relationships reﬂect a more
traditional or dynamic family structure, might
provide valuable information about how to
best interact to meet particular patient needs.
As our results suggest, a universal approach to
health care is questionable, even when it is a
collaborative or a shared decision-making
approach.

Although the results of the present study are
fruitful, a few limitations should be noted.
With the exception of one couple, the partici-

pants were all located in Southern California
and were married heterosexual couples, which
excludes same-sex partners and those who are
unmarried but cohabiting. In addition, 15 of
the 18 couples identiﬁed themselves as reli-
gious, with a large representation of Catholics
and Seventh-day Adventists. It should be noted
that the area in which interviews were collected
is known for a higher-than-normal percentage
of these aﬃliations. A majority of the couples
identiﬁed themselves as White or Hispanic, and
we hope that future studies address the needs

with patients before or after medical encoun-
ters, or intervene alongside physicians during
appointments.
Individual meetings might
highlight patient beliefs related to their illness
and care, debrieﬁng past negative health-care
experiences and discussing ways to connect and
communicate with their physician.

From a systemic point of view, we are curi-
ous to know how providers’ spousal and famil-
ial relationships impact their styles of working
with patients. At present, there is little research
on the emotional and relational experiences of
health-care providers and we believe that there
is a need for further study around these pro-
cesses. Our ﬁndings indicate that connections
between patients and providers are multilayered
and we hope that additional research will centre
around the development of interventions specif-
ically targeted towards improving these rela-
tionships. We understand that couples ﬁnd
themselves on a continuum of styles of relating,
rather than neatly deﬁned categories, and we
hope that future studies will further address the
nuances of these relationships. Finally, we rec-
ognize that family systems are much wider than
the couple relationship, and we anticipate that
further study will expand the focus to include
the interactional patterns of non-spousal family
members, gendered ways of experiencing and
providing care and the larger community.
