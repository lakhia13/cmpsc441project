Predicting repeated self-harm or suicide in
adolescents and young adults using risk
assessment scales/tools: a systematic
review protocol

, Sophie Beese and David Moore

Abstract

Background: Self-harm and suicide have been identified as serious public health problems in children, adolescents,
and young people across the world. Suicide is a major cause of mortality in this population and is commonly
preceded by self-harm. Both suicide and self-harm are difficult to predict, and several risk scales and tools are in use
for this purpose. Currently, there is only a small amount of evidence available regarding their predictive ability in
clinical practice, and no consensus as to which is the most suitable for particular populations or settings. The aim of
this review is to evaluate the ability of risk scales to predict future episodes of suicide or self-harm in adolescents
and young adults presenting to clinical services with attempted suicide or an episode of self-harm.
Methods: A comprehensive search of electronic databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and PsycINFO) from
inception will be conducted to identify studies that look at the ability of risk scales to predict suicide or future
episodes of self-harm in adolescents and young adults presenting to clinical services with attempted suicide or an
episode of self-harm. Two authors will independently carry out key methodological steps such as study screening
and selection and data extraction. Quality assessment will be carried out using a checklist developed from the
QUIPS and QUADAS-2 tools. Data will be grouped by tool and a narrative synthesis undertaken. For each tool,
meta-analysis will be undertaken for ability to predict suicide or repeat self-harm where clinical and methodological
homogeneity exists.

Discussion: This systematic review will be the first to explore the use of assessment scales/tools in an adolescent
population and will help to inform current practice regarding scales/tools with higher predictive ability. There is
currently no evidence specifically for this population and a clear need with a high prevalence of self-harm and
suicide in adolescents. Additionally, this review will help guide future research into suicide and self-harm prediction
and prevention.

Introduction
Background
Self-harm and suicide have been identified as serious
public health problems in children, adolescents, and
young people aged 25 years and under across the world
[1–3]. The term self-harm can be used to refer to acts of
self-poisoning or self-injury (e.g. cutting, scratching,
breaking bones, burning) carried out intentionally re-
gardless of motive or suicidal intent [1, 4, 5]. The preva-
lence of self-harm can be difficult to determine as it is
usually a secretive and hidden behaviour [5]. Less than
20% of adolescents who self-harm seek treatment result-
ing in substantial unreported cases [6, 7]. Despite this,
community-based studies have reported prevalences of
10–18% in adolescent populations [6–13], and these
rates appear to be rising [14, 15]. Data from the UK
shows that the highest rates of self-harm occur in ado-
lescent and young adult populations and that there is
marked gender disparity between those aged 16–24 [9,
11], with 25.7% of young women having self-harmed
compared with 9.7% of young men [15]. Repetition of
self-harm is common, with 15–25% of adolescents
treated at hospital for an episode of self-harm return for
treatment within 12 months [2, 16]. Repetition has also
been shown to be common in those not engaging with
clinical services [7].

There are 164,000 suicides per year worldwide in those
aged less than 25 years, but this is thought to be vastly
less than the true figure [17]. Whilst the prevalence of
suicide in young people in the UK is low compared to
the older population, it still remains a major mortality
cause in young people [18, 19]. Adolescent suicide is
suspected to be under-reported due to perceived stigma
and misclassification [20]. Worldwide, it is the most com-
mon cause of death for female adolescents and the third
most common for male adolescents after road traffic acci-
dents and violence [17]. There is a strong association be-
tween self-harm and risk of future suicide [21, 22], with
approximately 50% of adolescents who die by suicide hav-
ing previously self-harmed [19]. Suicide prevention has
been identified as a public health priority, with both na-
tional and global initiatives in place targeting early identi-
fication and risk management as key strategies to prevent
suicide attempts and save lives [23, 24].

Rationale
Both self-harm and suicide are difficult to predict in ad-
olescents [1, 25]. The UK guidelines for the management
of self-harm in those aged over 8 years recommend that
all patients who present with self-harm should undergo
comprehensive psychosocial assessment including asses-
sing the risk of repetition of self-harm or suicide [4, 26,
27]. This recommendation was informed by evidence
from a systematic review carried out as part of the

guideline development process [4]. Risk scales/tools tend
to be a key part of this assessment; however, there is cur-
rently only a small amount of evidence available regard-
ing their use and effectiveness, and no guidance as to
which to use or which is best for particular populations
or settings [4, 28].

There is a large variation in the type, format, and con-
tent therein of risk scales/tools being used across the UK
[29–31]. Some only assess a few parameters and others
assess a more extensive range. The content of these tools
includes previous self-harm, method of harm, current
psychiatric treatment, age, and employment status [32–
35]. Some are short,
for example the Manchester
Self-Harm Rule and the ReACT Rule assessing four and
five parameters respectively. In contrast, the Repeated
Episodes of Self-Harm (RESH) Score and the SADPER-
SONS Scale are longer, assessing about nine and 11 dif-
ferent parameters respectively [32–35].

There is a desire for consistent good practice with calls
for further research and a recommendation from the
Royal College of Psychiatrists UK that locally developed
scales/tools should no longer be used [36]. A survey of
32 English hospitals found that over 20 different risk
scales/tools were in use, many of these were locally de-
veloped, highlighting a lack of consistency of practice
[28].

Scoping searches of Medline and the Cochrane library,
without restriction on population age,
identified two
published systematic reviews [3, 37]. Both focus on an
adult population and neither was able to conclude that
any one scale performed better than another, or say with
any certainty which scale had the best ability to predict
future self-harm or suicide attempts. Both reviews agree
that further work is required to explore the use of risk
assessment scales/tools further as currently there is a
paucity of robust evidence on the topic.

As neither review focused specifically on adolescents,
and as this is a key age group affected by self-harm and
suicide, a review targeting scales/tools for adolescents is
clearly required. The scoping searches identified a body
of published literature specific for this population sup-
porting feasibility [38–42].

Aim
This systematic review aims to evaluate the ability of risk
scales to predict suicide or future episodes of self-harm in
adolescents and young adults presenting to clinical ser-
vices with attempted suicide or an episode of self-harm.

Methods
This protocol has been prepared according to the Pre-
ferred Reporting Items of Systematic Reviews and
Meta-Analysis Protocols (PRISMA-P) statement
[43]
and registered on PROSPERO (CRD42017058686).

Eligibility criteria
The criteria outlined below will be used to select studies
for inclusion in the review.

Study designs

cohort

and

Participants
The participants are adolescents who have self-harmed
or attempted suicide.

Adolescence is a term that lacks a formal definition. It
can refer to age, physical characteristics, or cognitive de-
velopment [1]. The World Health Organisation defined
adolescence as being between 10 and 19 years [44]; how-
ever, in the literature, the upper limit for adolescents can
range from 18 to 25 years [1]. In an attempt to include
all relevant data in this review, reflecting this and that
self-harm is rare before the age of 12 [45], a broad range
of adolescents and young people aged 10–25 who have
self-harmed or attempted suicide will be included. Stud-
ies also containing older populations will be included if
data for 10–25-year-olds is presented separately. If not
presented separately, study authors will be contacted to
try to obtain data for the subgroup before study exclu-
sion. Studies containing adolescents who have and have
not self-harmed or attempted suicide will be included.
Where data on self-harm/suicide attempters is presented
as a subgroup, only this data will be used; where the data
is not presented as a subgroup, the study will only be in-
cluded if 50% or greater of the population are self-harm/
suicide attempters. This is an arbitrary threshold. The ef-
fect of such studies on the analysis will be explored in
sensitivity analyses if appropriate.

Intervention/assessment
Any risk assessment carried out on patients who have
presented to clinical services or been treated by a health-
care professional. No restrictions will be placed regard-
ing the content of the assessments.

Setting
Risk assessment must be carried out within a clinical set-
ting or by a health care professional. This can be an in-
patient or outpatient
facility or as part of a home
treatment program.

Timing
There will be no restriction on the length of follow-up
so long as outcomes occur after the assessment is car-
ried out.

Outcome
In repeat self-harm and/or attempted suicide or com-
pleted suicide, it is acknowledged that these may be re-
corded individually or grouped together as a composite
outcome. Strategies for dealing with this are outlined
further in the protocol.

Language
No language restrictions will be put in place.

Search strategy
Electronic searches of bibliographic databases (MED-
LINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and Open Grey)
will be carried out with a search strategy developed
using where appropriate index and free-text terms re-
lated to self-harm, suicide, adolescents, and risk assess-
ment. Terms for self-harm, suicide, risk, prediction, and
adolescents will be combined using the AND operator.
The MEDLINE search strategy is presented in Table 1.
The strategy will be adapted to the syntax and subject
headings of each database. Articles cited by included
studies will be checked to identify any additional studies.

Study records
Data management
Results from the literature search will be imported into
EndNote X7 software (Clarivate Analytics), allowing
automatic and manual identification and removal of du-
plicate records.

Selection process
The titles and abstracts will be screened for relevance
against the selection criteria. Full text of relevant arti-
cles will be obtained and selected for review against
the full inclusion criteria. Clarification will be sought
from study authors where possible if eligibility cannot
independently
be determined. Two reviewers will
undertake the screening process, and disagreements
will be resolved by discussion and, if required, involv-
ing a third person. Reasons for articles not meeting
the inclusion criteria will be recorded. Translations
will be sought for languages other than English to aid
selection and/or subsequent reviewing. If no transla-
tion can be obtained, articles will be reported as
non-assessable rather than as excluded. The article se-
lection process will be fully reported in the PRISMA
flow diagram format [46].

Data collection process
Two reviewers will independently extract data from each
article using a piloted extraction form. A third independ-
ent person will be consulted to resolve disagreements.
Data will be managed using Excel 2010 (Microsoft). Data

Unadjusted and adjusted data along with factors ad-
justed for will be recorded. If any data are found to
be missing, the corresponding author of the article
will be contacted by email. One email and one
follow-up email will be sent if no response is received
to the first email.

Quality and risk of bias assessment
Quality and risk of bias assessment of articles will be
carried out by two reviewers independently. A checklist
modified from Quality in Prognostic Studies (QUIPS)
[47, 48] and Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy
Studies-2 (QUADAS-2) [49], checklists suitable for prog-
nostic and diagnostic tests, will be used. This is appro-
priate for this review as the inclusion of studies that may
have prognostic or diagnostic features, and the nature of
the data to be extracted, means that neither checklist in-
dividually would completely assess all
important ele-
ments. These tools assess bias risk in several domains
including the selection of patients and reporting of
outcomes.

Analysis
A narrative synthesis will be carried out presenting in-
formation from all included studies to explore similar-
ities, differences, and findings within and between them.
Information will be presented in a variety of formats in-
cluding tables, figures, and text. The content of tools/
scales will be reported and compared. Where possible,
studies will be grouped and analysed by scale/tool for
both descriptive and numeric data. Each scale/tool will
be considered separately with regards to the outcomes
of repeat self-harm, attempted suicide, or completed sui-
cide. Potentially, there may be discrepancies between
studies in how outcomes are recorded and that studies
may not record the three outcomes separately as consid-
ered by this review. For example, one study may record
self-harm as attempted suicide and another study may
record the same behaviour as self-harm, or a study may
just look at one outcome comprising all behaviours.

Additionally, completed suicide is a rare outcome, and
therefore, it may be that there are not many reports of
this outcome or a zero event rate will be reported. Com-
pleted suicide, attempted suicide, and/or a composite
outcome will be considered separately.

Depending on the data available, it may be possible to
consider the prognostic ability (how well the scale/tool
can predict each individual patient
that will repeat
harm/suicide) of each scale/tool. A decision will be made
about whether to consider prognostic ability will be
made after data extraction has been carried out.

It is possible that prognostic models have been devel-
oped either using data collected from a checklist or the
checklist derived from a model. Therefore, it would be
appropriate to assess these using tools appropriate for
models. Assessment of models involves consideration of
the development of the model and the consistency of
performance and decision-making of the model [50].
Studies reporting prognostic models may be reporting
either model development, validation of the model, or
both [51]. If studies reporting models are included, it

Subgroup analyses will be carried out if feasible and
warranted to examine potential effect modifiers based
on gender, setting (e.g. inpatient vs outpatient), and pa-
tients presenting after a first occurrence of self-harm/
attempted suicide versus patients presenting after a re-
peated occurrence, or patients who are assessment-naïve
versus patients who have had risk assessments carried
out before. Further analysis will also be carried out if
possible grouping studies by tool intent, i.e. those that
are specific for self-harm/suicide and those that are
non-specific (e.g. general depression screening tools).
These are, however, very dependent on the data being
present in the included studies, and it is recognised that
this may not be possible.

Sensitivity analyses will be carried out to assess the im-
pact of decisions taken during the review if feasible to ex-
plore the effects of age (over and under 18 years) and risk
of bias. The sensitivity analyses around age are of particu-
lar relevance and interest to this review due to the previ-
ously mentioned lack of formal definition for the term
adolescence. Analyses in this area would offer more
insight across the age range as there is a wide difference
between the lower and upper limits of the 10–25-year
range included in this review in terms of life stage and de-
velopment, as well as purely chronological age.

If more than ten studies are included in a single
meta-analysis, a funnel plot will be used to explore the
potential for biases including publication bias.

contribute to the body of evidence for self-harm and sui-
cide prediction and prevention. Understanding of how
to predict self-harm and suicide in the population most
at risk is crucial to tackling this major public health
problem and provide an evidence base to ensure that in-
formed decisions can be made regarding predication of
future risk.

This review is needed as there is currently no system-
atic review examining risk scales/tools in an adolescent
population, and this has been identified as a key age
group affected by self-harm and suicide. Specifically fo-
cusing on this age group will allow greater understand-
ing of the use of risk assessments in this population.
Additionally, the documented wide variety in the type of
risk scales/tools being used across hospitals and current
lack of guidance surrounding their use in particular pa-
tient groups and settings (including hospitals, outpatient,
and home treatment settings) warrants further investiga-
tion to improve and standardise patient care. The lack of
consensus mentioned previously shows that more know-
ledge is required in this area to address the needs of
high-risk patients and to try to identify a gold standard
for assessment of these patients.

The findings will be of benefit to a variety of stake-
holders as it will provide knowledge to guide best prac-
tice, providing clarity to healthcare professionals and
benefit to patients, and highlight areas requiring further
research in this population.
