Obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) has become a paradigmatic case of
goal-directed dysfunction in psychiatry. In this article, we review the neurobio-
logical evidence, historical and recent, that originally led to this supposition
and continues to support a habit hypothesis of OCD. We will then discuss a
number of recent studies that have directly tested this hypothesis, using behav-
ioural experiments in patient populations. Based on this research evidence,
which suggests that rather than goal-directed avoidance behaviours, compul-
sions in OCD may derive from manifestations of excessive habit formation, we
present the details of a novel account of the functional relationship between
these habits and the full symptom profile of the disorder. Borrowing from a
cognitive dissonance framework, we propose that the irrational threat beliefs
(obsessions) characteristic of OCD may be a consequence, rather than an insti-
gator, of compulsive behaviour in these patients. This lays the foundation for
a potential shift in both clinical and neuropsychological conceptualization
of OCD and related disorders. This model may also prove relevant to other
putative disorders of compulsivity, such as substance dependence, where
the experience of ‘wanting’ drugs may be better understood as post hoc
rationalizations of otherwise goal-insensitive, stimulus-driven behaviour.

1. Introduction
‘Compulsivity’, although a young concept, has captured the imagination of
researchers fast in the fields of psychology, psychiatry and neuroscience, and
this burgeoning interest is reflected in the dramatic rise in the number of articles
referring to this term in the last 5 years in particular. A range of maladaptive
human behaviours are now popularly considered to be examples of compulsi-
vity, including psychiatric problems such as drug use in substance-dependent
individuals [1], repetitive behaviours [2] and tics [3] in Tourette’s syndrome, exces-
sive and restrictive eating behaviours in eating disorders [4] and the repetitive,
avoidance behaviour seen in the eponymous disorder of compulsivity, obses-
sive–compulsive disorder (OCD) [5]. Although the list of overt behaviours that
have been classified as compulsive is quite varied, there is consensus that compul-
sivity is ‘a hypothetical trait in which actions are persistently repeated despite
adverse consequences’ [6]. In OCD, hand-washing behaviour, for example, is
often continued in spite of the development of abrasions to the skin, along with
the more typical loss of occupational and social function that is associated
with the time taken to perform most compulsions. Although compulsivity has
been successfully operationalized in terms of the resistance of this kind of behav-
iour to punishment, there is disagreement in the literature regarding the
psychological mechanism which gives rise to compulsive behaviour. In this article,
we aim to address this issue with reference to OCD, via recent research aimed at
elucidating the neural and psychological basis of compulsive behaviour. While
the majority of data discussed will pertain to OCD, the issues raised may also be
relevant for understanding other purported disorders of compulsivity, for which
empirical data in patient populations are currently lacking.

There are arguably two main schools of thought regarding the underlying
mechanism that leads to compulsive behaviour. The first school is ‘cognitive’

and purports that compulsivity is mediated by dysfunction in
the assignment of value to available alternatives, that is, the
compulsive individual may view the cost of cessation of behav-
iour to be higher than the benefits thereof. In this sense, the
choice to continue the behaviour is purposeful and goal
directed; it is simply deemed compulsive by the outside obser-
ver (i.e. a clinician or society) to whom this choice appears
suboptimal. Concordant with this view, many researchers
have speculated that compulsions in OCD are performed to
reduce the likelihood that an unwanted, or feared, consequence
will take place [7–9]. Disordered valuation or ‘cognitive bias’ is
primary and motivates patients to perform avoidance compul-
sions as a form of coping with these distressing thoughts [10].
‘Cognitive bias’ is a broad term; it may subsume an exaggerated
sense of personal responsibility [10] over the environment and
thought–action fusion, the belief that thinking about something
is equivalent to doing it [11,12]. Cognitive bias accounts of
OCD purport that patients with OCD initially experience
obsessions associated with potential threat or discomfort,
and as a consequence of such distressing beliefs, anxiety is
engendered. As a consequence of the two factor theory of
avoidance [10], which suggests that Pavlovian fear arises first
and motivates avoidance in healthy animals, compulsions are
carried out as goal-directed, purposeful, attempts to reduce
the likelihood of threat, or more generally to provide relief [13].
This article will argue that contrary to the cognitive
account, OCD does not necessarily arise from faulty value
attribution, or ‘cognitive bias’, but rather, it may result from
goal-directed dysfunction that interacts with anxiety and
irrational belief in a manner not hitherto discussed in the litera-
ture. This position holds that patients with OCD largely
understand the relative value of the available outcomes and
the cost of actions, and aim to promote expected values of out-
comes and desist from compulsive behaviour, but cannot exert
the necessary control over their actions to realize this goal. One
way in which this lack of control over behaviour might arise is
as a result of an imbalance between two fundamental associat-
ive learning systems that are relatively well characterized in
both psychological and neurobiological terms.

2. Neurobiological parallels: habit and
obsessive–compulsive disorder

in terminology,

Habits are responses that are automatically triggered by
stimuli and are considered the functional reciprocal of goal-
directed behaviours that are intentional, considered, and as
the name suggests, sensitive to the value of prospective
goals [14]. The relative control that these two systems exert
over behaviour have been described using a number of differ-
ent theoretical frameworks [15 –18]. However, in spite of
differences
these frameworks converge
around a common theme; that animals use both reflective
and reflexive modes of action selection [19,20]. Goal-directed
behaviour is more accurate, but that accuracy requires effort
and attention. It follows that this mode of action selection
suffers in times of stress [21], perhaps as a result of increases
in working memory load [22], and is seen later in childhood
development
famously,
however, goal-directed control over action subsides as
we become comfortable with repetitive action following
over-training of the stimulus –response pair [24], and when
outcomes are less tightly coupled to responses [25].

learning [23]. Most

than habit

In 2000, Graybiel & Rauch [26] proposed the theory that
OCD can be characterized as a disorder of maladaptive
habit
learning on the basis of neurobiological parallels
between the brain regions implicated in OCD and the then
proposed functional
loci of repetitive behavioural habits,
namely regions comprising the ‘fronto-striatal circuits’ [27].
Since then, a plethora of studies in rodents and humans has
been conducted to elucidate the neural basis of habit for-
mation and has reached consensus that a shift
from
associative to sensorimotor fronto-striatal circuits mediates
the transition from goal-directed to habitual control over be-
haviour [28,29]. To test for habits, a procedure called outcome
devaluation is most commonly used (another is that of
contingency degradation [30]; figure 1).

In this procedure, the outcome of a given action is made
undesirable and continued responding for the stimulus is
measured in an extinction test. When behaviour is under
the control of the goal-directed (action – outcome) system,
responding to stimuli
that produce devalued outcomes
should decline, whereas if habits (stimulus–response) are
dominant, behaviour will become insensitive to the value of
the outcome [31]. Research in rodents using this technique
has revealed an important double dissociation between
medial and lateral subregions of the dorsal striatum in the
balance between goal-directed and habitual control over be-
haviour. Specifically, habitual responding can be induced in
rodents by lesions of the dorsomedial striatum (DMS: cau-
date in primates) [32], suggesting that this region is critical
for goal-directed action control. Disrupting activity in the
dorsolateral striatum (DLS: putamen in primates), on the
other hand, preserves sensitivity to outcome value in rodents,
even after extended training [33,34]. In the rodent prefrontal
cortex, although the literature is less clear, there has been
some suggestion of a similar double dissociation between
the prelimbic and infralimbic cortices, with the former
being associated with goal-directed learning (but see [35])
and the latter necessary for the execution of habits [36–38].
However, these data are contentious and it is presently
unclear if and how rodent –primate homologies in the pre-
frontal cortex can be legitimately drawn, and so these data
to interpret. The prelimbic cortex has been
are difficult
suggested to correspond to the human area 32 (a portion of
anterior cingulate cortex) and the infralimic (IL) cortex to pri-
mate area 25 (although there is some doubt also about this).
Rather
than processing stimulus– response associations
the IL may arbitrate
directly, some have proposed that
between controllers, inhibiting the goal-directed system in
favour of performing previously reinforced actions [37,39].
On the other hand, the IL is also implicated in both fear and
appetitive (cocaine) extinction [40], and this role is entirely con-
sistent with an inhibitory role for IL in the learning and
expression of stimulus–outcome and action–outcome associ-
ations. In mice, recent data have highlighted an important
role for the medial orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) (more rostral to
the IL cortex in the rat) whereby inhibition of activity in this
region interferes with goal-directed behavioural control, and
furthermore, neuronal firing rates in the DMS, DLS and OFC
in healthy animals dynamically change in concert with a shift
between goal-directed and habitual actions in a manner sugges-
tive of a key role for the OFC in goal-directed action selection
[41]. In line with this finding, in the rhesus monkey, lesions
to areas 11 and 13 of the OFC cause impairments in goal
devaluation, whereas lesions of area 14 disrupt extinction [42].

Figure 1. Outcome-devaluation procedure. (a) Animals are trained to press a level to gain food pellets. (b) Food pellets are typically devalued by, for example,
pairing with lithium chloride, which induces nausea, or by feeding to satiety. (c) Animals are tested on extinction. Continued responding reflects insensitivity to
outcome devaluation, and thus dominant control of the habit system.

Studies using functional magnetic resonance imaging
(fMRI) in humans are broadly consistent and suggest a key
role for subregions of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex
(vmPFC) in goal-directed control over action. Using selective
satiety to devalue outcomes, Valentin et al. [43] showed that
activity in portions of the medial, central and lateral OFC
were sensitive to the choice of actions that led to valued or
devalued outcomes, suggesting these regions play a key
role in determining the incentive value of outcomes in
goal-directed decision-making. Another study used incon-
gruent associations to create conflict in the goal-directed
system, forcing subjects to rely instead on habits. Brain acti-
vation was compared for activation during these trials to
congruent trials, devoid of conflict. The authors found that
a more posterior portion of the vmPFC, corresponding to
the perigenual anterior cingulate was more active when par-
ticipants were carrying out goal-directed as opposed to
habitual actions [44]. Other studies using computational
analysis have similarly revealed that the anterior caudate
nucleus, in addition to the medial OFC, and more rostrally,
the medial prefrontal cortex, track the level of contingency
between actions and outcomes [45 – 47]. Few studies, how-
ever, have been able to elucidate the neural basis of habits
in humans, save for reductions in activation in goal-directed
subregions of the vmPFC and caudate described above. One
study, however, compared groups who received brief (1 day)
versus extended (3 days) training on a free-operant habit task
for food outcomes. In a subsequent devaluation test, Tricomi
et al. [48] observed that activity in the putamen increased
when behaviour became autonomous from outcome value
following over-training, a finding mirrored in the lack of

behavioural sensitivity in the over-trained group. More
recently, de Wit et al. [49] found convergent evidence observ-
ing that increased white matter tract strength between the
putamen and premotor regions was predictive of habitual
control over behaviour in healthy humans, while the
strength of connectivity between the medial prefrontal
cortex and caudate predicted goal-directed behavioural
choice. To summarize, there is good cross-species consist-
the putamen for
ency regarding the importance of
stimulus – response habit learning and the caudate for goal-
directed action selection. The role of the prefrontal cortex is
less clear (and less well specified), but in humans the
data converge on an important role for the vmPFC in goal-
directed control over behaviour, particularly the medial
portions of the OFC and prefrontal cortex.

The dominant neuroanatomical model of OCD centres on,
but
limited to, abnormalities within the regions
involved in the balance between goal-directed behaviour
and habits. Broadly speaking, neurobiological changes
associated with OCD have been identified within circuits
that run from the frontal
lobes to the striatum, and via
direct and indirect pathways to the thalamus and back to
the frontal cortex, the ‘fronto-striatal
loops’ [27,50,51]. In
terms of specific loci, the caudate nucleus and the orbital
gyrus are the most consistent regions where OCD patients
show abnormal patterns of functional activation [52]. Evi-
dence for this comes primarily from symptom provocation
studies [53 –56] and treatment response studies following
pharmacotherapy and behavioural therapy [57 –59] using
positron emission tomography and single photon emission
computed tomography. In terms of structural brain changes,

Figure 2. Experimental tests of goal-directed dysfunction in OCD. Reproduced with permission from [48 – 50]. (a) OCD patients show a tendency towards habit
formation following appetitive instrumental training. Habits are assessed using an outcome-devaluation test wherein one outcome is ‘devalued’ and another remains
valuable. Responding to stimuli that predict devalued outcomes is evidence for dominant stimulus – response habit associations [62]. (b) In an economic choice task,
OCD patients exhibit impaired use of prospective action – outcome comparisons relative to controls [63]. (c) OCD patients exhibit dominant stimulus – response habit
associations in a devaluation test following instrumental shock avoidance training [64]. Error bars denote standard error of the mean.

a recent meta-analysis of voxel-based morphometry studies
revealed that OCD patients have increased grey matter
volumes in the putamen (extending to the caudate nuclei)
relative to healthy controls and other anxiety disorder
groups [60], whereas all anxiety groups (including OCD)
showed common decreases in dorsolateral prefrontal and
anterior cingulate cortex. Another meta-analysis
found
increased volume of the OFC, putamen and insula in OCD
patients, which was a function of age, such that the normal
loss of volume was not observed in patients as they aged.
This suggests the possibility that these changes may reflect
altered neuroplasticity associated with disease duration, for
example the performance of compulsive behaviours through-
out the lifespan [61]. We will not summarize the findings of
fMRI studies in OCD here because no studies to date have
investigated the neural correlates of habit learning in this
patient group. However, we will describe some studies that
may be tangentially relevant later in this review.

3. Experimental evidence for goal-directed

dysfunction in obsessive–compulsive disorder
The first study to directly test the contribution of the goal-
directed system to OCD was carried out using an appetitive
instrumental learning task [62], which has been since shown
to rely upon white matter tract connectivity within and

between the fronto-striatal circuits [49]. Following trial and
error learning of positively reinforced stimulus–response–
outcome associations, subjects were given a series of tests to
determine the contribution of goal-directed (action–outcome)
and habitual (stimulus–response) associations to instrumental
learning. The results indicated that OCD patients have a signifi-
cant bias towards stimulus–response learning, at the expense
of acquiring action–outcome associations. This result was evi-
dent across three independent tests. In an outcome-devaluation
(‘slips-of-action’) test, OCD patients had deficits in their ability
to refrain from responding to outcomes that were no longer
worth any points (i.e. devalued; figure 2a). This result was com-
pounded by behavioural and explicit tests of contingency
knowledge, where OCD patients’ action–outcome associa-
tive knowledge was impaired, but their stimulus–response
knowledge was intact.

Further support for the notion that a goal-directed dis-
turbance plays a role in OCD was provided in a follow-up
study which assessed counterfactual decision-making in
OCD patients on an economic choice paradigm [63,65].
The design of the paradigm was such that there was no rep-
etition of stimulus – response – outcome pairings, but rather,
participants had to choose between two wheels depicting
points and their respective probabilities. In this way, we
could assess goal-directed choice behaviour in the absence
the potentially confounding influence of concurrent
of
formation of habits over the course of training. Rather

approach to understanding

than using outcome devaluation, this study adopted a com-
putational
goal-directed
behaviour, wherein trial-by-trial choice behaviour was
used as the dependent measure. Goal-directed behaviour
was operationalized as the degree to which ‘potential
regret’ influences choice behaviour. Potential regret is a
goal-directed computation that relies upon the comparison
of prospective action – outcome states, that is, the ability to
simulate and compare options in a decision tree. Healthy
adults are known to use this computation to reduce their
chances of experiencing regret in this decision environment
[63,65]. Consistent with the suggestion that OCD patients
have a deficit in goal-directed control over action, the influ-
ence of
computation on decision-making was
attenuated in OCD patients (figure 2b). Rather than being
linked to a muted emotional experience of regret, as has
been observed in patients with lesions to the OFC who
also show this kind of choice behaviour [66], OCD patients
experienced regretful trials as being even more aversive
than healthy comparison subjects. OCD patients and com-
parison subjects did not differ in the extent to which their
choices were based on the expected value of the available
options, suggesting that basic decision processes were not
affected in these patients.

this

A third study tested whether the deficits in appetitive
goal-directed behaviour observed in OCD would be evi-
dent in avoidance. This question is not trivial because
OCD is a disorder of compulsive avoidance rather than
reward-seeking behaviour, and habits in avoidance had
previously not been experimentally demonstrated in
humans or animals. In this paradigm, OCD patients and
healthy controls were trained to avoid aversive electrical
shocks to their wrists by performing the correct response
to a predictive stimulus, constituting negatively reinforced
stimulus – response – outcome discriminations [64]. Follow-
ing an over-training period, participants were tested for
habit formation using a selective outcome-devaluation pro-
cedure, wherein the shock electrodes were removed from
one of their wrists (devalued), but remained connected on
the contralateral side (valued). While OCD patients and
in the number of avoidance
controls did not differ
responses made in response to the stimulus that predicted
the valued shock, OCD patients made significantly more
responses to the stimulus that predicted the devalued
shock (figure 2c). A devaluation sensitivity test revealed
that OCD patients were proficient in their goal-directed
control over their responses prior to over-training and
that their behaviour became excessively habit-based over
the course of over-training. There was no evidence to
suggest that habits were driven by associated failures in
fear extinction in OCD patients using both physiological
(i.e. skin conductance response) and evaluative condition-
ing (i.e. shock expectancy) measures. However,
is
possible that avoidance habits are associated with impaired
instrumental extinction in a more general sense, a prop-
osition, which to our knowledge has not yet been tested.
It is however unclear if and how these might be parsed
experimentally.

it

Using different methodologies,

these three studies
show that in OCD there is a consistent shift in balance
away from goal-directed associative control over action
towards stimulus – response habits. There are a number
of potential causes for this imbalance, three of which we

subsequent

links, producing deficits

will consider now. The first is that OCD patients may
have a deficit
in action – outcome associative learning,
which causes them to rely excessively on stimulus –
response links that were previously reinforced. There is
ample evidence in support of this possibility, given that
explicit knowledge of action – outcome associations
is
deficient in OCD following instrumental
learning, and,
furthermore, that these explicit learning deficits were cor-
related with patients’
show
sensitivity to devaluation [62]. Next, an alternative possi-
bility is that excessive stimulus – response learning in
OCD might cause patients to lose their sensitivity to
action – outcome
in explicit
action – outcome knowledge. However,
the observation
that OCD patients exhibit goal-directed deficits on a
decision-making paradigm that does not permit stimulus–
response habit learning does not sit well with this interpret-
ation [63]. Rather, these data suggest that a fundamental
problem in action–outcome associative learning and/or
execution exists in OCD, and it is not dependent on excessive
habit formation in the disorder. In line with this account,
recent fMRI work has found that OCD patients show under-
activation of the ventral striatum during a reward anticipation
task that requires goal-directed behaviour [67], and this is
remediated by deep-brain stimulation of this region [68]. Con-
versely, in the avoidance habit experiment described above,
habit biases were observed despite intact action–outcome
knowledge in patients tested in this study, using a compara-
tively less complex paradigm compared with the original
study on appetitive habit learning. This indicates that habit
biases in OCD are not necessarily driven by deficits in goal-
directed contingency knowledge. It is plausible then that
both habit-based and goal-directed learning may be affected
in OCD, however, until a behavioural definition of habit learn-
ing that does not rely on an absence of goal-directed control
can be formalized, there is perhaps little use in making a
distinction between processes that are somewhat reciprocal.
The recent ‘model-based, model-free’ reinforcement-learning
schema [16], wherein model-based behaviour is hypothesized
to map onto goal-directed action and model-free supports
habit learning, does not consider the two systems reciprocal,
and can therefore assess their independent contributions to
choice behaviour. Using this paradigm, there is recent evidence
to suggest that model-based control over action is selectively
diminished in OCD patients [69]. Although this is a promising
avenue for future research, more work is needed to assess how
this schema maps onto the habit-based, goal-directed dichot-
omy, as a direct comparison is currently lacking.

of model-based and model-free

A third possibility, which we will touch on only briefly, is
that rather than abnormalities in goal-directed control or
habits,
in OCD the problem could lie in the arbitration
between these controllers. Recent evidence suggests that
this arbitration is carried out in the frontal polar and inferior
lateral prefrontal cortex, which track the reliability of the pre-
dictions
controllers,
respectively, and use these signals to inhibit the model-free
system, where appropriate [70]. This postulate awaits testing
in OCD patients, however, given the neurobiological evi-
dence outlined earlier,
seems more plausible that
dysfunctional goal-directed learning processes (outcome
valuation, contingency) associated with the caudate and
medial OFC are responsible for biases towards habitual
responding in OCD (figure 3).

Figure 3. Proposed model of the relationship between core quantifiable traits and symptomatology in OCD. Biases towards habit formation and trait anxiety
(although may not be necessary for diagnosis) act in concert to foster compulsive urges, probably supported by the putamen, where action control is transferred
from a misfiring ( putatively hyperactive) caudate and OFC. Obsessions may be a cognitive interpretation of compulsive urge, which ultimately interacts with anxiety
and reinforces the desire to perform compulsions through cognitive dissonance. Brain schematic illustrates important nodes in the fronto-striatal circuits implicated in
OCD, of which the mOFC and the caudate are most consistently implicated. Disruption in these regions may be necessary and sufficient for OCD diagnosis, but
probably contribute to a range of disorders along the anxious and compulsive spectrums.

4. Habits and compulsive-obsessive disorder

‘COD’

We have previously suggested an alternative way of conceptua-
lizing the functional relationship between obsessions and
compulsions in OCD, a model captured by a rearrangement
of the letters OCD to COD [6]. This simple reshuffle belies
what is a possibly crucial and maybe overdue shift in thinking
away from the previously prescribed unidirectional nature of
reinforcement that exists in the cycle of OCD symptomatology
(figure 3). As outlined in the Introduction, classic cognitive
models of OCD posit that obsessions precede compulsions,
which are considered active attempts to gain relief from obses-
sive thoughts. Indeed, it is impossible to ignore the tight
coupling between the content of obsessions and compulsions
in OCD, which leads to the intuitive inference: ‘I fear contami-
nation and therefore I feel compelled to clean excessively’.
Based on recent observations, we propose that the reverse—‘I
feel compelled to clean excessively and therefore I must be
afraid of contamination’—may better capture the OCD
phenomenon.

There are two main problems with the current OCD fra-
mework ascribed by cognitive models of
the disorder,
which have led us to consider this alternative possibility.
The first is that existing cognitive models rely on the supposi-
tion that obsessions drive OCD and compulsions are
secondary phenomena [7– 9]. But in the three studies of
habit formation described above, there is clear evidence that
excessive compulsive-like, automatic behaviours develop in
OCD patients in the absence of any prior obsessions relating
to the experimental task procedures. First, this demonstrates
there is a purely behavioural disturbance in OCD
that
that is independent of obsessionality. Second, OCD is an

ego-dystonic disorder; the thoughts experienced and actions
performed by patients are discordant with their concept of
self, either categorically or proportionally. In other words,
patients have insight
(although it can be diminished in
some cases) into the irrationality of their compulsive actions;
they want to stop but cannot exert control over the urge to
act. Cognitive models of OCD cannot account for this insight,
how a patient can be aware that there lacks a contingency
between flicking a light-switch and averting a traffic accident,
and yet feel compelled to perform the action.

feature of

One way to reconcile this apparent paradox in OCD is to
embrace it. Rather than a problematic footnote in the diagnostic
criteria of OCD, the ego-dystonic nature of obsessions and
compulsions in OCD may more accurately be considered a car-
dinal
the disorder. By definition, habits are
behaviours insensitive to contingency and outcome value; in
other words, they are ego-dystonic, purposeless acts. We pro-
pose that the excessive habit learning reliably observed in
these patients captures the divergence between will and
action that typifies OCD. We hypothesize that this behavioural
disturbance is the critical component of the OCD diagnosis and
has its neurobiological basis in the circuits running between the
OFC and the caudate, whose (putative) hyper-activation dis-
rupt normal goal-directed behaviour, fostering reliance on
habits (figure 3). We will now outline a model of OCD in
terms of ‘COD’, in which a tendency towards compulsive
habit learning is central and furthermore, we will suggest
a mechanism through which the other critical features of the
disorder, anxiety and obsessions, can be explained as both
propagators and consequences of compulsivity.

Anecdotally, habits are considered to be automatic errors
that go below the level of conscious awareness. We make
slips when we are distracted and may, for example, take a

familiar turn in the road instead of driving straight on to our
intended destination. Recent data, however, have challenged
this popular conception of habits as mere action-slips, finding
that habits are associated with a hitherto unreported premoni-
tory ‘urge to respond’ [64]. This urge may be critical
in
elaborating a model of how compulsive behaviour could give
rise to obsessional thinking. To do this, we borrow from cogni-
tive dissonance theory. Cognitive dissonance describes a state
of conflict that arises when two or more competing beliefs
are simultaneously held, and cognitive dissonance theory
states that humans are motivated to reduce this conflict by
altering one of these beliefs [71]. This effect is also observed
in humans when behaviour contradicts belief. In a forced
compliance study, subjects completed an exceptionally mono-
tonous experiment, after which a subset were instructed to tell
new participants who were arriving for the study that it was in
fact ‘a very interesting and enjoyable experience’. They found
that those subjects who were induced to give a positive
report to new participants gave more favourable ratings of
their own experience in the study on a subsequent question-
in
naire [72]. This study convincingly demonstrates that
situations of cognitive dissonance, when behaviour contradicts
belief, humans alter their beliefs to match their behaviour. As
has been elegantly put by others, ‘actions create—not just
reveal—preferences’ [73].

The suggestion that cognitive dissonance may arise as a
result of compulsivity is not altogether new, but has been pre-
viously alluded to in the context of substance dependence.
Everitt & Robbins [74] suggested that the subjective urge to
consume drugs (i.e. wanting), often considered a precursor
to consumption, may be a post hoc rationalization of the
objectively ‘out of control’ behaviour. In the case of OCD,
the argument is analogous, wherein the irrational thoughts
often considered to induce compulsive responding, may in
fact be the product of the mind’s attempt to resolve the dis-
crepancy between patients’ cognitions and their otherwise
inexplicable urge to perform compulsive behaviours. Specifi-
cally, the experience of the irresistible urge to perform, or the
very performance of, compulsive avoidance behaviours
may engender cognitive dissonance that is reconciled by the
in
development of a new irrational belief about
the environment. This new ‘fear’ makes sense of the need
to compulsively perform avoidance responses and may of
course contribute to the motivation of subsequent avoidance
responding, forming a vicious cycle of sorts.

threat

The avoidance habit paradigm discussed earlier in this
article is the only study, to our knowledge, which begins to
test this possibility directly [64]. OCD patients and healthy
controls were asked to provide an explanation for why they
continued to make avoidance responses to the stimulus that
predicted the now devalued outcome. While many patients
used the word ‘habit’ or variants of it (i.e. automaticity) to
describe their actions, a subset reported irrational hypotheses
regarding the task procedure. For example, some patients
reported that they thought they could still be shocked, in
spite of the fact that they had been disconnected from the
offending stimulator. These comments become particularly
illuminating when considered alongside the ratings of
shock expectancy and explicit contingency knowledge tests,
which were taken moments before this qualitative question.
Patients were unimpaired on these tests, reporting very low
likelihood that they could still be shocked following devalua-
the contingency
tion and having intact knowledge of

structure of the task. Like obsessions in OCD, these irrational
threat beliefs were discordant with subjects’ knowledge of
the task structure. Although these data were collected in an
exploratory manner, they provide good early evidence in sup-
port of the suggestion that irrational thinking may sometimes
be a consequence of habit formation.

It may be surprising to some how irrational threat beliefs
such as these could survive without being promptly disconfir-
med through experience. However, the fact that compulsions
in OCD are avoidant, rather than appetitive, can readily
account for this. It is a feature of avoidance that performance
of this response naturally precludes the extinction of irrational
beliefs about contingency (e.g. fear), because when avoidance
responses are continually, but unnecessarily, performed, the
only demonstrable contingency the individual is exposed to
is one where a state of safety follows the performance of an
avoidance response. This prevents exposure to the crucial dis-
confirming case or extinction, i.e. when a state of safety is also
followed by no response [75]. In this way, the maladaptive
cycle of compulsions, obsessions and anxiety may be cyclically
maintained and reinforced, allowing for irrational fears to pro-
pagate and develop into more persistent obsessions over time.
It is possible that anxiety may arise in some patients with
OCD as a product of
the aforementioned ‘COD’-cycle,
induced as a result of, or in tandem with, irrational threat
beliefs. However, it is likely that anxiety plays a much more
crucial role in OCD than an epiphenomenal one, given the
high rate of co-morbidity and common shared heritability
that exists between OCD and other anxiety disorders [76]
and the elevated level of trait anxiety reliably documented
in the disorder itself in the absence of anxiety disorder co-
morbidity (e.g. [64]). It has been consistently demonstrated
in both humans and other animals that laboratory stressors
promote habit
formation in healthy subjects [21,77,78].
Although no study to our knowledge has directly tested the
contribution of anxiety to habit formation, there is evidence to
suggest that anxiety biases attention to stimuli, and away
from outcomes, potentially causing a similar failure to execute
goal-directed behaviours as seen during stress manipulations
[79]. Indeed,
individuals with anxiety disorders [80], and
healthy students with high levels of trait anxiety [81], have def-
icits in their ability to ignore distracting stimuli, an attentional
function, which, like goal-directed behaviour, relies on acti-
vation in the prefrontal cortex [81,82]. However, unlike other
anxiety disorders, attentional bias has not been consistently
observed in OCD [83], suggesting that while anxiety-related
mechanisms may contribute to habit biases in some patients,
it is unlikely to fully account for them. Indeed, the available
empirical data relevant to this issue suggest that there is no
direct association between trait anxiety or physiological
measures of conditioned fear learning and extinction and
habit formation biases in OCD patients [64]. However, as the
design of this study was not capable of parsing out Pavlovian
(i.e. stimulus –outcome) physiological fear responses from
those that are confounded with the instrumental avoidance
response, these data are not definitive.

In studies that have examined purely Pavlovian fear con-
ditioning in OCD, the results are not altogether clear. Some
studies find that OCD patients have elevated blood oxygen
level dependent responses in the amygdala, a limbic structure
associated with emotion processing and fear, when viewing dis-
[84,85].

more general emotionally relevant (but disorder irrelevant)
stimuli may also be disrupted in OCD [84], but the direction
of this effect is not consistent [86]. A recent study, using disorder
irrelevant conditioned stimuli, showed that like in post-trau-
matic stress disorder [87], OCD patient have deficits in the
recall of extinction memories and show reduced activation in
the medial portion of the OFC during extinction learning, but
there were no group differences in amygdala activation [88].
These data, although somewhat inconsistent, indicate that the
contribution of anxiety to habit biases in OCD cannot be ruled
out, suggesting there is room for a more classic interpretation
of the relationship among obsessions, anxiety and compulsions,
that can coexist with a ‘COD’ account, which hypothesizes that
there is a bidirectional mechanism of maladaptive symptom
reinforcement. At a minimum, it is likely that trait anxiety may
play a role in targeting OCD patients’ general tendency towards
excessive habit learning specifically to the avoidance domain,
rather than towards ‘appetitive compulsivity’, e.g. stimulant
drug addiction (but see [89] for a negative reinforcement hypoth-
esis of addiction). This postulate awaits further study.

With this in mind,

the considerable neurobiological,
pharmacological and genetic heterogeneity of OCD might be
explained by understanding how trait anxiety, as an indepen-
dent contributor to compulsive avoidance habit learning, fits
into a trans-diagnostic model of the disorders along the
respective compulsive and anxiety spectrums.
In other
words, it may be the case that there are many routes to the
OCD phenotype, and that dysfunction in habit learning and
interacting diatheses.
trait anxiety are independent, yet
Future research will need to test this possibility, which is in
the spirit of the recent National Institute of Mental Health’s
Research Domain Criteria initiative [90], a major goal of
which is to develop therapeutic strategies that can target
biologically defined traits that are presumed to be hetero-
geneous within diagnostic categories of the Diagnostic and
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 5 [91]. Within this fra-
mework, it is plausible that trans-diagnostic dimensions, for
example, habit learning, could be specifically targeted by cer-
tain treatments,
receptor
antagonists (which are particularly effective in patients with
co-morbid tics [92], or behaviour modification techniques,
such as response prevention or habit reversal therapy. Like-
wise, trait anxiety might respond preferentially to selective
serotonin reuptake inhibitors, through their anxiolytic proper-
ties [93], or exposure therapy, which is aimed at extinguishing
inappropriate Pavlovian fear responses.

for example, dopamine (D2)

Whether there is a specific causal role for obsessions in this
formulation is unclear. It is possible that obsessions in OCD
reflect dysfunction in an entirely independent process that
interacts with compulsivity in a bidirectional fashion, much
like what we have proposed for anxiety. However, the impor-
tance of obsessions in OCD has recently been called into
question with the observation that ‘Pure O’, that is patients
who experience obsessions in the absence of compulsive be-
haviour, may be a clinical misnomer. Williams et al. [94]
found that these patients appear to exhibit previously over-
looked mental
to seek
reassurance. Another interesting possibility is that the histori-
cal distinction between obsessions and compulsions in OCD
may be superficial and that obsessions are a form of compul-
sive, automatic thought. In this way, both obsessions and
compulsions could be considered products of a disrupted
goal-directed system, leading to over-active automatic thoughts
(obsessions) and actions (compulsions), rather than being
discrete traits that interact with one another.

compulsions and compulsions

5. Summary and conclusion
The hypothesis that a shift from goal-directed to habitual con-
trol over action mediates compulsivity in OCD ties well with
the neurobiological and pharmacological basis of habit learn-
ing in rodents and humans. This hypothesis also accords well
with the neurocognitive profile of motor inhibition failures in
OCD that are observed following repetition of action [95].
The ‘COD’ model of OCD proposed here has implications
outside of the specific domain of this disorder. It is a plausible
interpretation that the experience of premonitory ‘want’, or
‘urge’, reported in not only OCD but also substance-dependent
individuals and tic disorders, may be a consequence of exces-
sive stimulus–response associations. Future research should
test this exciting possibility, articulated first by George Eliot
in Silas Marner [96, p. 17]:

. . .repeating some trivial movement or sound, until the repetition
has bred a want, which is incipient habit.
