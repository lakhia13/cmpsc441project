Behaviour therapies have a well-established, useful tradition in psychological
treatments and have undergone several major revisions. Acceptance and
Commitment Therapy (ACT) and mindfulness-based approaches are con-
sidered a third wave of behavioural therapies. Emerging evidence for ACT
has demonstrated that this paradigm has promising effectiveness in improving
functionality and well-being in a variety of populations that have psychological
disturbances and/or medical problems. In this review we ﬁrst evaluate tra-
ditional cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) interventions used to manage
psychological problems in distressed individuals who have sustained an
acquired brain injury (ABI). We provide an overview of the ACT paradigm
and the existent evidence base for this intervention. A rationale is outlined
for why ACT-based interventions may have potential utility in assisting dis-
tressed individuals who have sustained a mild to moderate ABI to move
forward with their lives. We also review emerging evidence that lends prelimi-
nary support to the implementation of acceptance and mindfulness-based inter-
ventions in the rehabilitation of ABI patient groups. On the basis of existent
literature, we recommend that it is an opportune time for forthcoming research
to rigorously test the efﬁcacy of ACT-based interventions in facilitating ABI
patient groups to re-engage in living a valued and meaningful life, in spite of
their neurocognitive and physical limitations. The promising utility of testing
the efﬁcacy of the ACT paradigm in the context of multimodal rehabilitation
programmes for ABI populations is also addressed.

INTRODUCTION

On an annual basis, thousands of individuals worldwide sustain an acquired
brain injury (ABI) due to: a medical condition or disease, e.g., primary
brain tumour; accident or assault, i.e., traumatic brain injury (TBI); or result-
ing from a degenerative disorder, e.g., dementia. Approximately two-thirds of
individuals with an ABI are diagnosed with only mild to moderate brain
impairment (e.g., Busch & Alpern, 1998); hence, the majority of these indi-
viduals have a good prognosis. Yet, despite this, there is a growing body of
research that has evidence that up to 40% of mild to moderately impaired
ABI patients experience clinical levels of anxiety and/or depression (e.g.,
Bowen, Neumann, Connors, Tennant, & Chamberlain, 1998; Schoenhuber
& Gentili, 1988; Seel & Kreutzer, 2003; Starkstein, Jorge, Mizrahi, &
Robinson, 2005; Wellisch, Kaleita, Freeman, Cloughesy, & Goldman,
2002), hindering physical, functional and social well-being, and overall
quality of life. Historically, rehabilitation programmes for persons with
ABI primarily focused on cognitive deﬁcits as well as externalising behav-
ioural problems (i.e., behaviours that comprise an acting-out style, such as
aggression, non-compliance, and poor impulse control), whilst overlooking
the emotional
impact and psychosocial adjustment of these conditions.
However, in the past 15 years, increasing attention has focused on the psycho-
social difﬁculties, including internalising problems (i.e., problems comprising
an inhibitory style, such as anxiety and depressive disturbances) experienced
by ABI survivors. It is noteworthy that this more holistic approach to neurop-
sychological rehabilitation was historically recognised by Goldstein (1959),
and pioneering rehabilitation programmes around the world have been devel-
oped by Ben-Yishay (1996), Diller (1976), Prigatano (1986) and Wilson et al.
(2000). Undeniably, the management of psychological problems for individ-
uals with an ABI is pivotal given that chronic psychological problems not
only hamper the quality of life of ABI survivors, but also has broader
socio-economic consequences due to reduced social, community, and occu-
pational functioning.

Although certain pharmacological interventions have been documented
to decrease anxiety and depressive symptoms in ABI patients, they exacerbate
existing psychosomatic symptoms and induce further side-effects including
nausea, dizziness, and feelings of derealisation and depersonalisation
(Williams, Evans, & Fleminger, 2003). Consequently, in recent years, the
focus has turned to psychological interventions to manage emotional problems

252

following ABI. Cognitive behavioural therapies (CBT) have a strong evidence
base for the treatment of anxiety and depression in various clinical and medical
populations including (non-brain) cancer survivors (e.g., Osborn, Demoncada,
& Feuerstein, 2006). A growing number of studies have also evaluated tra-
ditional CBT approaches for managing emotional disturbances in several
types of ABI populations, including individuals with mild TBI and dementia,
many with promising outcomes (e.g., Bradbury et al., 2008). Even so, while
CBT can be effective, not all studies that have utilised CBT interventions
have found positive effects for managing psychological distress in ABI
samples. Mixed (e.g., Hodgson, McDonald, Tate, & Gertler, 2005; Rasquin,
Van De Sande, Praamstar, Van Heugten, 2009) and even negative results
have also been documented (e.g., Lincoln & Flannaghan, 2003; Ramaratnam,
Baker, & Goldstein, 2003).

The traditional CBT paradigm is a multi-modal treatment approach that
evolved from behavioural/learning theory. Currently, the evolution of the
behavioural therapies can be seen as covering three generations (Hayes,
2004) each of which has relevance to ABI. The ﬁrst generation encompassed
the traditional behaviour therapies based on operant and classical condition-
ing principles. Such techniques have been used successfully to manage overt
behavioural dysregulation following ABI. The second generation comprised
the traditional cognitive therapy and CBT interventions, including Albert
Ellis’s Rationale Emotive Behavioural Therapy (REBT), and Aaron Beck’s
CBT approaches, which have also been applied to people with ABI and
will be discussed further below. Finally, the current, third wave of behaviour-
al therapies include ACT, mindfulness-based therapies, including Mindful-
ness-Based Cognitive Therapy, and Dialectical Behavioural Therapy (Hayes,
Luoma, Bond, Masuda, & Lillis, 2006). The key differentiating principle
between the second and third generation of behavioural interventions is that
the second wave of traditional cognitive and CBT approaches focus directly
on altering psychological events, notably, thoughts, beliefs, perceptions and
cognitive schemas (e.g., Beck, 1993); whereas the third wave of therapies
aim to change the function of these events and the individual’s relationship
to their psychological and contextual experiences (Hayes et al., 2006). As
the premise of ACT-based interventions is on facilitating functional change,
this third wave of behavioural interventions may have particular utility for
helping distressed ABI individuals to re-engage in living a meaningful life,
in spite of their neurological and physical deﬁcits. The purpose of this paper
is to review traditional CBT interventions used to manage and/or treat psycho-
logical problems (notably, anxiety and mood disturbances) in distressed ABI
samples and then to examine whether ACT-based interventions may have
additional applicability to ABI populations, especially those that have experi-
enced mild to moderate impairments.

CBT: RE-EXAMINING THE EFFICACY FOR MANAGING
EMOTIONAL PROBLEMS IN ADULT ABI POPULATIONS

There are two central tenets to traditional CBT approaches. First, one’s cog-
nitions (including thoughts, beliefs, and perceptions) have an inﬂuence on
one’s emotional and behavioural reactions; and, second, one’s behavioural
responses can also inﬂuence one’s cognitions and emotions (Wright,
Basco, & Thase, 2006). In accordance with the CBT model, cognitions
and behavioural reactions are also modulated by biological mechanisms as
well as environmental and interpersonal inﬂuences (Wright et al., 2006). A
common misunderstanding of CBT is that it is simply a mechanistic approach
comprising of a set of techniques (Neenan & Dryden, 2004; Wydo, 2001).
However, assessment and treatment
to CBT
(Persons, 2008; Wright et al., 2006).

formulation are integral

A key component of formulating a CBT-based treatment plan is setting
speciﬁc therapy goals that are collaboratively determined and agreed upon
by the patient and therapist (Wright et al., 2006). Treatment goals may focus
on reducing psychological symptoms (e.g., decreasing anxiety and stress symp-
toms); and/or may focus on increasing desired behaviours or outcomes (e.g.,
engaging in more social activities for persons who are isolated). Goals set
need to be realistic (e.g., in the context of ABI, curing a chronic disability
may not be realistic, however, improving functioning by getting a part-time
job suitable to one’s current functioning and/or resuming daily activities is a
more realistic goal in terms of improving functional well-being); and must
also be measurable (Persons, 2008). Indeed, a collaborative therapeutic
relationship is central to CBT, as is the use of Socratic questioning when utilis-
ing cognitive methods, particularly cognitive restructuring techniques, in order
to identify and modify unhelpful and/or maladaptive automatic thoughts and
underlying schemas (Neenan & Dryden, 2004; Wright et al., 2006). Other
key components of CBT comprise the use of structuring sessions, psycho-
education and rehearsal to enhance learning, as well as behavioural methods
including imaginal and in vivo exposure, relaxation and problem-solving
techniques (Hawton, Salkovskis, Kirk, & Clark, 1989; Wright et al., 2006).

The potential beneﬁts of CBT techniques for people with ABI have been
increasingly recognised due to (1) their effectiveness in other clinical popu-
lations, and (2) the relatively structured, time-limited and practical focus on
concrete behaviours and thoughts that provide the scope to bypass cognitive
deﬁcits. In order to accommodate even mild cognitive impairments following
ABI, modiﬁcations to traditional CBT-based interventions are strongly rec-
ommended (Khan-Bourne & Brown, 2003; Mateer & Sira, 2006). Modiﬁ-
cations include the provision of written material, prompts, repetition, and
summarising of information (Anson & Ponsford, 2006; Khan-Bourne &
Brown, 2003).

254

KANGAS AND McDONALD

Studies utilising either traditional or modiﬁed CBT approaches have been
conducted in the past 10–15 years to evaluate CBT interventions for emotion-
al problems in distressed persons who have sustained an ABI. A number of
these CBT intervention studies report positive outcomes, improving emotion-
al well-being in distressed (including anxious, traumatised and/or depressed)
ABI patient samples. For example, several single case reports have reported
beneﬁcial outcomes for traditional CBT-based interventions for the treatment
of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) (Williams et al., 2003a), post-
traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (Williams, Evans, & Wilson, 2003b),
seizure-related panic attacks (Gracey, Oldham, & Kritzinger, 2007), and
depression (Mateer & Sira, 2006), in adults recovering from ABI. There
are also a number of group studies reporting positive outcomes. For
example, Bryant, Moulds, Guthrie, and Nixon (2003) used a randomised
controlled design to test the efﬁcacy of a brief, ﬁve-session, individualised
CBT intervention for the treatment of acute stress disorder in persons who
had sustained mild TBI (N ¼ 24). Participants were randomly allocated to
either the CBT programme or a non-directive supportive counselling inter-
vention. Signiﬁcantly fewer individuals (8%) met the criteria for PTSD
post-CBT intervention compared to persons who received the counselling
intervention (58%). Effects for the most part were retained at 6-month
follow-up although depressive symptoms did not improve. The efﬁcacy of
this trauma-focused CBT programme for people with TBI is in line with
the broader strong evidence base for trauma-focused CBT in ameliorating
PTSD in other civilian populations (e.g., Nemeroff et al., 2006)

In a more recent study, utilising a matched-control trial, Bradbury et al.
(2008) tested the efﬁcacy of an 11-session CBT programme to reduce distress
and improve coping and community integration compared to a psycho-
educational programme. Results indicated that individuals with ABI (n ¼
10) who received the CBT intervention experienced a signiﬁcant reduction
in overall distress symptoms compared to individuals (n ¼ 10) who received
the educational programme; and up to 80% of participants in the CBT con-
dition reported normative levels of distress post-intervention. No signiﬁcant
gains were found for coping skills and community integration for participants
who received the CBT programme. Hence, improvements in emotional well-
being did not seem to extend to improvements in functionality. In yet another
empirical study, Tiersky et al. (2005) tested the efﬁcacy of a combined indi-
vidual-based CBT and cognitive remediation programme with a small sample
(N ¼ 20) of emotionally distressed TBI patients. The CBT arm of the reme-
diation programme entailed 50-minute sessions, 3 days per week over 11
weeks. Cognitive functioning returned to normal levels post-intervention.
Although anxiety and depressive symptoms also improved post-therapy,
only anxiety symptoms returned to normal levels, whilst depressive symp-
toms remained at clinical levels. No improvements in functionality were

ACCEPTANCE AND COMMITMENT THERAPY FOLLOWING ABI

255

evident. Indeed, the researchers concluded that participants in their sample
“remained emotionally distressed and functionally impaired despite improve-
ment in cognitive functioning” (p. 1572).

These studies do suggest that traditional CBT, with some modiﬁcations to
ameliorate the problems associated with cognitive impairment, can be effec-
tive. However, the evidence is not universally positive, with other studies
reporting mixed ﬁndings (i.e., both positive and negative outcomes; e.g.,
Anson & Ponsford, 2006; Hodgson et al., 2005; Lincoln, Flannaghan,
Sutcliffe, & Rother, 1997), or negative outcomes (e.g., Lincoln & Flanna-
ghan, 2003). The variable results across studies is, in part, due to design
and sampling variations including differences in ABI patient samples,
inclusion/exclusion criteria, and speciﬁc CBT components included in the
multi-modal programmes, as well as variations in research aims. Moreover,
the majority of these studies are hampered by methodological limitations,
including small sample sizes (typically , N ¼ 30) and paucity of longer-
term follow-up assessments (beyond the 1–2 month post-intervention
period). Importantly, only a very limited number of studies have utilised
the gold standard of a randomised controlled trial (RCT) design (Bryant
et al., 2003; Hodgson et al., 2005), with the greater proportion of intervention
trials reliant upon single-case series (including case reports), or non-RCT
group designs (Soo & Tate, 2007).

Nevertheless, the lack of consistent beneﬁt seen for the application of
CBT to people with ABI does raise the question as to whether traditional
CBT is always the best choice for this population. In particular, while many
facets of CBT are well suited to modiﬁcation to circumvent cognitive
deﬁcits, some core strategies in CBT are inherently cognitively demanding
(Aeschleman & Imes, 1999). Cognitive restructuring (CR), in particular, is a
central component of CBT that entails identifying, evaluating, challenging
and replacing negative, dysfunctional thoughts with more adaptive, realistic
thinking (Beck, 1993; Mansell, 2008). CR is a meta-cognitive strategy that,
by its nature, is abstract and therefore likely to be challenging for those with
cognitive impairments that compromise attention, working memory, infor-
mation processing speed and/or executive dysfunction. The majority of ABI
studies that have evaluated CBT use traditional approaches (e.g., Beck,
Rush, Shaw, & Emery, 1979; Hawton et al., 1989) that include CR strategies
(e.g., Anson & Ponsford, 2006; Bryant et al., 2003; Lincoln et al., 1997;
Lincoln & Flannaghan, 2003; Rasquin et al., 2009; Tiersky et al., 2005).
While there is limited evidence as to how the inclusion of such strategies
impact upon efﬁcacy, a few studies have reported direct evidence related to
participant perceptions.

Firstly, in a recent study by Anson and Ponsford (2006), feedback was
sought regarding how well participants understood and applied principles
covered in CBT therapy aimed at improving their emotional adjustment

256

and coping post-ABI. Between 23 –40% of the group (N ¼ 33) reported that
their understanding and implementation of skills had improved to a moderate
extent or better. The remainder reported much smaller gains and a minority
reported no change at all. The CBT programme tested by Anson and Ponsford
(2006) was found to signiﬁcantly improve adaptive coping in participants at
the end of therapy; however, a waning and waxing effect for coping was
found at 5 weeks, and 2 years follow-up, respectively. No signiﬁcant
reduction in anxiety or depressive symptoms, or improvements in self-
esteem and overall psychosocial well-being was found. One complication
in this study was that emotional distress was not a speciﬁc inclusion criterion
in this study limiting the scope for the study to demonstrate efﬁcacy of CBT
techniques on alleviating distress. Notwithstanding this methodological limit-
ation, the study ﬁndings suggest that more than 50% of the TBI patients
involved experienced difﬁculty in understanding and therefore implementing
CR strategies.

In another RCT study by Hodgson et al. (2005), the effects of an individ-
ual-based CBT programme was tested in terms of reducing social anxiety and
improving emotional well-being in a small sample of socially anxious indi-
viduals (N ¼ 12) who had sustained various types of mild ABIs at least 12
months prior. The CBT programme was modiﬁed to accommodate mild cog-
nitive deﬁcits using shorter therapy sessions, frequent repetition of material,
provision of information in a structured format, use of visual aids, simpliﬁca-
tion of CR strategies, including use of guided self-talk and role plays to
promote procedural learning. Participants in the CBT programme (n ¼ 6)
were compared to a group of participants (n ¼ 6) randomised to the wait-
list control condition. Individuals in both conditions experienced a signiﬁcant
improvement in social anxiety post-intervention; however, the CBT interven-
tion was found to have a stronger effect size and these effects were maintained
at 1-month follow-up. With the exception of assertiveness training, the bulk
of the programme comprised traditional CBT segments including relaxation,
graded exposure and simpliﬁed CR strategies. Participants had minimal difﬁ-
culties understanding and implementing the behavioural components, includ-
ing relaxation, exposure and assertion training but did report difﬁculties
understanding the abstract concepts involved with the CR segments of this
programme.

Other evidence for the potential difﬁculties experienced by people with
ABI when using CR techniques is more indirect. Rasquin et al. (2009) docu-
mented mixed ﬁndings for the CBT intervention they applied to distressed
individuals who had sustained a stroke. Using a single-subject quasi exper-
imental design (N ¼ 5) to address emotional complaints, each participant
was provided with eight weekly sessions of the CBT programme which
appeared to include CR (i.e., “patients [were taught] how to recognise nega-
tive thoughts and to challenge them”; p. 210), relaxation strategies, and

ACCEPTANCE AND COMMITMENT THERAPY FOLLOWING ABI

pleasant activity scheduling. At the completion of therapy, three of the ﬁve
patients evidenced clinically signiﬁcant improvements in their mood, whilst
two participants experienced no change in depression. Furthermore, three par-
ticipants experienced no shift in quality of life, and four of the participants
were found to have nil improvement in general distress at the completion
of therapy. In another study, Lincoln and colleagues (1997), using an AB
single case experimental design for a series of cases (N ¼ 19) and later a
large RCT (N ¼ 123; Lincoln & Flannaghan, 2003), evaluated traditional
CBT for individuals experiencing depression after stroke. Findings from
both studies were variable echoing Rasquin et al.’s (2009) results. Indeed,
in the larger RCT no signiﬁcant improvements in depression were evidenced
for participants who received the CBT intervention, compared to individuals
who received the placebo conditions. In both studies the researchers noted
that participants who evidenced more difﬁculties with memory and reasoning
abilities did not beneﬁt from the CBT intervention. In addition, Lincoln et al.
reported that the cognitive strategies were the most challenging for partici-
pants to implement.

In summation, although there is evidence that traditional CBT-based pro-
grammes have utility for certain ABI patient groups in terms of reducing
stress (e.g., Bryant et al., 2003; Williams, Evans, & Fleminger, 2003;
Wilson, Evans, & Wilson, 2003) and mood symptomatology (e.g., Mateer
& Sira, 2006), the efﬁcacy of CBT in treating emotional problems following
ABI is not uniform across studies. Notably, the majority of RCT interventions
have documented mixed outcomes. From the evidence reviewed, it is possible
that inclusion of CR techniques may have contributed to the variable results
even when these techniques were simpliﬁed to accommodate cognitive deﬁ-
cits of the ABI samples. Several studies cited evidence that at least a pro-
portion of individuals with ABI struggled to understand and/or implement
the cognitive procedures (e.g., Anson & Ponsford, 2006; Lincoln et al.,
1997; Lincoln & Flannaghan, 2003). This is a pivotal issue as the inability
to understand and/or consistently implement cognitive skills may have
reduced the focus and potency of the behavioural components of treatment,
and thus hindered the efﬁcacy of the overall CBT programme.

There is growing evidence that within CBT, it is the behavioural-based
interventions that are instrumental in the treatment of anxiety and depressive
problems and enhancing the quality of life in various non-ABI, clinical and
medical populations (e.g., Borkovec, Newman, Pincus, & Lytle, 2002;
Hopko et al., 2008). In fact, a number of dismantling and component
studies of CBT have shown that CR contributes minimal additive beneﬁts
to behavioural components across several clinical populations (Borkovec
et al., 2002; Longmore & Worrell, 2007; Lovell, Marks, Noshirvani,
Thrasher, & Livanou, 2001). Furthermore, in the context of recovering
from an ABI, it could be argued that CR strategies are contra-indicated for

258

KANGAS AND McDONALD

individuals who are coming to terms with primarily negative appraisals
grounded in the reality of lifestyle change. That is, it is understandable that
a proportion of individuals with ABIs may experience reduced mood and
elevated distress as they try to come to terms with the limitations imposed
by their ABI deﬁcits in their daily, occupational and interpersonal function-
ing. For these reasons, the new, “third-wave generation” of behavioural
psychotherapeutic approaches, particularly Acceptance and Commitment
Therapy (ACT; Hayes, Strosohl, & Wilson, 1999; Hayes, 2004) and mindful-
ness-based approaches, may offer new possibilities for the treatment of
emotional problems in distressed ABI patient groups, particularly individuals
who have only experienced a mild to moderate ABI. To our knowledge, no
study to date has speciﬁcally tested the efﬁcacy of ACT in ABI populations.
Hence, in the ﬁrst instance, the efﬁcacy of ACT interventions needs to be
tested with patients who have sustained mild to moderate brain impairments
in order to validate whether the core processes of ACT (reviewed below) can
be effectively implemented by persons with only mild to moderate ABIs,
before proceeding to test this intervention with individuals who have more
severe cognitive deﬁcits.

ACCEPTANCE AND COMMITMENT THERAPY (ACT)

Core processes of ACT interventions

ACT, with its foundations in behavioural principles, is conceptually grounded
in functional contextualism (Hayes, Bissett, et al., 1999). Hence, it is con-
sidered to be a contextual-based cognitive behavioural therapy. It also
shares some features associated with Gestalt and emotion-focused psy-
chotherapies, as well as with Eastern meditative practices (Hayes, Strosahl,
et al., 1999). The theoretical underpinnings for the ACT paradigm are
based on Relational Frame Theory, which focuses on how environmental
interactions inﬂuence a wide range of human thoughts and behaviours
(Hayes, Barnes-Holmes, & Roche, 2001). For example, Relational Frame
Theory uses Pavlovian and operant conditioning to explain spontaneous
and apparently uncontrolled human anxiety responses. Thus, a person who
experiences terrible bouts of sea-sickness, may elicit a spontaneous aversive
anxiety response to the word “boat” as well as to other verbal (e.g., sea,
waves), and non-verbal, contextual stimuli (e.g., smell and sounds of the
ocean) associated with boats and seasickness (Hayes, 2004). Similarly, a
person who is traumatised or highly distressed by their brain tumour may
experience adverse reactions to verbal and other contextual cues associated
with their medical treatment experience, such as viewing cancer advertise-
ments or news about brain items in the media. The tenets of Relational

ACCEPTANCE AND COMMITMENT THERAPY FOLLOWING ABI

259

Frame Theory have been empirically substantiated with over 70 empirical
studies to date examining their validity in explaining a wide array of psycho-
logical phenomenon including anxiety, depression, self-awareness, self-
concept, and rule following (Hayes et al., 2006). In line with this theory, a
shift in context that supports the relations between thought, action, and
emotion is necessary in order to initiate change. To this end, ACT conceptu-
alises “psychological events as a set of ongoing interactions between the
organism and historically and situationally deﬁned contexts” (Hayes, 2004,
p. 646).

The acronym “ACT” has dual meanings: “Acceptance and Commitment
Therapy” pertains to the descriptive formal name of this therapeutic paradigm
which focuses on acceptance of human suffering and commitment to living a
purposeful life. The second meaning of ACT describes its three core com-
ponents: (1) Accept what an individual has and cannot be changed; (2)
Choose valued life directions; and (3) Take action to live a meaningful life
(Hayes, Bissett, et al., 1999). Importantly, one of the central premises of
ACT is to improve functionality rather than focus on symptom reduction
per se. Although there are commonalities between ACT and traditional
CBT interventions (Arch & Craske, 2008; Heimberg & Ritter, 2008)
because ACT does not include CR techniques it circumvents the logistical
and feasibility problems inherent in applying such techniques in populations
that are cognitively challenged.

ACT adheres to a health rather than illness model (Hayes, Strosahl, et al.,
1999). Emotional problems are acknowledged to be an inevitable part of
living and therefore deemed to be a universal human experience. Accord-
ingly, the core goal of ACT is to facilitate individuals to live a purposeful
and meaningful life, by focusing and engaging with their goals and values
whatever their personal circumstances (Forsyth & Eifert, 2007). In accord-
ance with ACT principles, the focus for distressed individuals with an ABI
would be to try to live a valued life, taking into account the limitations
imposed by their physical and neurological deﬁcits. For example, if an ABI
individual values being part of a loving family and social network, the goal
would be to continue or “re-engage” in activities that they can still do (in
spite of their neurological deﬁcits) with their family members and close
friends, and which enable them to be loving and caring towards people
who are important to them. As previously noted, a core feature of traditional
CBT is collaborative goal setting, which is typically addressed during the
treatment
the goal setting
approach in CBT is compatible with the evaluation of client goals in ACT
programmes. However, a major divergence between these two therapeutic
models is that traditional CBT approaches tend to focus on controlling or
eliminating anxious or distressing thoughts and feelings (e.g., via cognitive
strategies such as CR), whilst ACT trains the individual to live with such

formulation phase (Persons, 2008). Hence,

260

thoughts. In particular, ACT-based interventions “teach clients to feel
emotions and bodily sensations more fully and without avoidance, and to
notice fully the presence of thoughts without following, resisting, believing
or disbelieving them” (Hayes, Bissett, et al., 1999, p. 1). Essentially,
whereas ACT focuses primarily on altering the functionality of cognitions,
traditional CBT that includes CR methods focuses on altering the form and
frequency of cognitions (Hayes, Bissett, et al., 1999).

ACT views psychological inﬂexibility as a central feature of emotional
disturbances. Hence, psychological ﬂexibility is established via six core
processes that are conceptualised as positive psychological skills (Hayes
et al., 2006). The six core processes include acceptance, cognitive defusion,
contact with present moment, self-as-context, values, and committed
action. These processes are not linear; rather they overlap and are inter-
related and collectively facilitate psychological ﬂexibility (Hayes et al.,
2006). The core principle of acceptance entails learning to accept both posi-
tive and negative feelings and thoughts, particularly pertaining to events and
circumstances one has no control over or cannot change. For example,
anxious individuals are taught
to feel anxiety fully without defence
(Forsyth & Eifert, 2007). Similarly, persons with somatic problems (e.g.,
chronic pain) are taught methods to let go of the struggle with pain in order
to live a meaningful life (Wicksell, Ahlqvist, Bring, Melin, & Olsson, 2008).
The principles of ACT have been applied to a diverse range of populations
(Pull, 2008). In a recent study, an ACT intervention was administered to indi-
viduals of low socio-economic status from South Africa who had epilepsy, in
order to improve the management of their seizures as well as enhance their
well-being and life satisfaction (Lundgren, Dahl, Melin, & Kies, 2006;
Lundgren, Dahl, & Hayes, 2008). In this study, individuals were taught accep-
tance strategies to help them to become aware of and habituate to the sen-
sations of an impending seizure attack, as well as making room for
thoughts and feelings associated with their anticipatory fears of seizures, in
place of adopting avoidant reactions.

As the second core principle, cognitive defusion techniques aim to alter the
undesirable function of thoughts, rather than trying to alter their form and fre-
quency, as is the case with CR strategies. That is, individuals are taught to
view the process of thinking in a more mindful way without disputing the
content of the thought itself. For example, in the Lundgren et al. (2006) epi-
lepsy study, cognitive defusion was used to teach patients how to view their
distressing thoughts about their seizures (including anticipatory fears of
having the next seizure) from a different perspective. This entailed learning
to view thoughts as simply thoughts (that will come and go) instead of
giving weight to the content of the thoughts that, otherwise, posed obstacles
to living in accordance with each individual’s values (Lundgren et al., 2008).
That is, the more attention is given to upsetting thoughts, the more potent

ACCEPTANCE AND COMMITMENT THERAPY FOLLOWING ABI

261

negative inﬂuence they will have on functioning. In contrast, by learning
experientially to let upsetting thoughts come and go, the less inﬂuence they
will have on well-being as the individual will experientially habituate to
their content. In this way, in the Lungren et al. study, cognitive defusion tech-
niques curtailed avoidance reactions that have been found to have detrimental
effects on both emotional and physical well-being.

The third ACT principle of being present in the here and now is facilitated
by learning brief mindfulness exercises which can be efﬁciently applied in
relevant situations. By learning to be focused on being present-in-the-
moment, individuals are able to interact with their experiences and environ-
ment in a non-judgemental manner. In the context of Lundgren et al.’s
(2006) study, patients with epilepsy were encouraged not to struggle with,
nor resist, their thoughts, feelings and sensations pertaining to their seizures.
This enabled individuals to learn experientially that their world and their
sense-of-self encompasses more than just being a “person with epilepsy”.

The fourth component, “self-as-context” is also facilitated by applied
mindfulness and experiential exercises. This component teaches individuals
how to differentiate between their physical/somatic and psychological
experiences relative to the essence of self. Referring to the epilepsy studies,
once again, patients learned to view their medical condition as just one
aspect of their life among other important and meaningful components
(Lundgren et al., 2008). By doing so, individuals were able to view their
goals and values more objectively without being attached to the sole identity
of “being an epileptic”. This process has particular utility for ABI patient
groups as studies have revealed that individuals who have sustained a TBI
have reported changes in sense-of-self (Tyerman & Humphrey, 1984), as
well as loss of sense-of-self (Meili & Kabat-Zinn, 2004; Nochi, 1998).
ACT and mindfulness-based approaches may therefore have utility in facili-
tating persons recovering from a TBI to regain their sense-of-self.

The ﬁfth component of ACT addresses values, deﬁned as “chosen qualities
of purposive action” (Hayes et al., 2006, p. 8). This component helps patients
to identify valued life goals and implement them in the face of obstacles
(Hayes, Bissett, et al., 1999). In the context of neurological and physical
impairments, this can be achieved by the therapist guiding individuals to
think of ways to pursue their “valued” goals whilst accommodating their def-
icits. Although values and goals are related, they are also distinct. Whereas
goals have an end (e.g., getting a job), values are a lifelong process or part
of one’s life journey (e.g., being a caring friend or partner, taking part in
social activities, or engaging in work that is stimulating). To assist patients
identify their values a “life compass” (valued directions) is typically pre-
sented in the format of a user-friendly worksheet (e.g., Forsyth & Eifert,
2007). This involves getting the client to consider values in up to 10
domains including work (i.e., getting the client to identify what is important

262

KANGAS AND McDONALD

about work for them, such as interacting or helping people); intimate/per-
sonal relationships (e.g., wanting to be a caring and loving partner); parenting
(e.g., wanting to be a parent that takes part in their child’s extracurricular
activities); education/learning/personal development (e.g., continuing to
learn skills of interest, such as training in ﬂoristry); social life (wanting to
be a caring friend); health/physical care (e.g., engaging in physical exercise
to regain and maintain health); family relationships (other than marriage or
parenting); spirituality (e.g., does the client have faith values?); community
life/environment/nature (e.g., being outdoors and/or being involved with
community groups); and recreation/leisure (e.g., enjoying the social
aspects of playing soccer or basketball). Although these 10 broad life
domains may be presented to the patient, this does not mean that the individ-
ual has to value something in every single domain. Also some domains may
not be applicable to certain individuals (e.g., parenting).

The ﬁnal component of ACT comprises committed action; that is, taking
effective action that moves clients towards directions in various life
domains they value. This component comprises conventional behavioural
strategies to initiate and maintain behavioural change. Methods include
exposure, skills acquisition, shaping methods and goal setting. Accordingly,
once individuals select their values, the next steps entail ranking the impor-
tance of each value as well as generating goals that would manifest each
value (Hayes, Bissett, et al., 1999). For instance, if an individual with a
TBI was seeking to return to work following an accident because he or she
valued the stimulation as well as helping people, one goal set to live by
this value may include undertaking vocational rehabilitation to help the
person obtain a job that accommodates his or her physical and cognitive def-
icits. To this end, the therapist needs to facilitate this process by helping the
client to identify and consider external environmental as well as intrapersonal
physical and psychological barriers in working towards this valued goal.

In summary, the key processes of ACT entail learning or re-learning to act
in accordance with one’s values in order to improve one’s functionality and
overall quality of life, (despite one’s shortcomings and deﬁcits). Essentially,
ACT is a process-oriented approach to learn to re-engage in living a valued
and purposeful life. An advantage of ACT over traditional CBT is that it
does not require cognitive restructuring, a meta-cognitive process that is
potentially very difﬁcult for people with cognitive impairments to understand
and implement. It also does not put the expectation on clients that they should
attempt to challenge negative, although often realistic, thoughts related to
their changed life circumstances. This is not to say that ACT approaches
will necessarily be suitable for people with severe cognitive impairment. In
order to implement all six core dimensions of ACT (especially cognitive defu-
sion and acceptance-based strategies), participants do require a level of cog-
nitive awareness and ﬂexibility. Hence, as noted earlier, in the ﬁrst instance,

ACCEPTANCE AND COMMITMENT THERAPY FOLLOWING ABI

263

the efﬁcacy of ACT needs to be tested with persons who have sustained a mild
to moderate ABI.

Evidence base for ACT interventions

A growing evidence base of controlled studies has demonstrated that ACT is
effective in the treatment of depression and anxiety disorders (e.g., Foreman,
Herbert, Moitra, Yeomans, & Gellar, 2007; Roemer, Orsillo, & Salters-
Pedneault, 2008; Zettle & Hayes, 1986). In particular, Roemer and her
colleagues (Roemer & Orsillo, 2007; Roemer et al., 2008) have demon-
strated the beneﬁts of ACT in the treatment of generalised anxiety in clinical
populations. Notably, in their most recent published RCT study, the ACT
intervention was effective in reducing generalised anxiety and comorbid
depressive symptoms, as well as signiﬁcantly improving end-state function-
ing in individuals experiencing generalised anxiety problems (Roemer et al.,
2008). These effects were maintained at both 3 and 9 month follow-up.
Given that generalised anxiety and depression are common psychological
problems following ABI (Bowen et al., 1998; Hiott & Labbate, 2002),
ACT has a potentially useful role to play in remediation. Furthermore,
ACT interventions have been found to be effective in the self-management
of diabetes symptoms (Gregg, Callaghan, Hayes, & Glenn-Lawson, 2007),
addictions (smoking and illicit drug use) (Gifford et al., 2004; Hayes
et al., 2004), chronic pain (e.g., Dahl, Wilson, & Nilsson, 2004) including
trichotillomania
whiplash-associated disorders (Wicksell et al., 2008),
(Woods, Wetterneck, & Flessner, 2006), and psychotic symptoms (Gaudiano
& Herbert, 2006). These ﬁndings further lend support to the application of
ACT in a diverse range of patient groups with psychological disturbances,
medical conditions, or both.

Not only does ACT appear to be effective for a range of clinical and medical
conditions, but the magnitude of the effect is impressive. Hayes and colleagues
(2006) conducted a meta-analysis of ACT interventions which utilised con-
trolled methodology. The effects of ACT interventions on psychological out-
comes (including anxiety and depressive symptoms) were examined across
32 studies (N ¼ 6628), and an overall weighted effect size (ES) of .42 was
evident. Eight studies measured depressive outcomes, and a moderate aggre-
gated ES was indicated (.50). A moderate aggregated ES was also found for
anxiety (.50), based on ﬁve studies. The second part of Hayes et al.’s review
examined the efﬁcacy of ACT intervention trials compared to (1) other types
of interventions (including CBT), and (2) wait-list and treatment-as-usual
control conditions. An overall weighted average ES of .66 was found at
post-treatment (K ¼ 21 studies, N ¼ 704 participants) as well as at longer-
term follow-up (K ¼ 4, N ¼ 580). Twelve studies (N ¼ 456) were identiﬁed
that compared ACT interventions to other types of structured therapeutic

264

KANGAS AND McDONALD

interventions, including traditional CBT, and a weighted moderate effect was
indicated at post-intervention (ES ¼ .48), whilst a stronger effect was found
for retention of effects at longer term follow-up (ES ¼ .63; K ¼ 9; N ¼
404). Furthermore, a strong effect was found for ACT interventions compared
to wait-list, or treatment-as-usual at post-intervention (ES ¼ .99; K ¼ 9; N ¼
248) as well as at follow-up (ES ¼ .71; K ¼ 4; N ¼ 176).

It is noteworthy that stronger effects were evidenced for ACT interventions
which were conducted with patient samples experiencing more severe
psychological disturbances and medical conditions, including individuals
with psychosis (Guadiano & Herbert, 2006; ES ¼ 1.11), self-harming
patients diagnosed with borderline personality disorder (Gratz & Gunderson,
2006; ES ¼ .98), individuals with depression (Zettle & Hayes, 1986; ES ¼
1.23), chronic pain patients (Dahl et al., 2004; ES ¼ 1.17), and individuals
with epilepsy (Lundgren et al., 2006; ES ¼ 1.43). Collectively, the ﬁndings
from Hayes et al.’s (2006) meta-analysis demonstrates good preliminary
support for the efﬁcacy of ACT interventions in assisting individuals diag-
nosed with a wide range of psychological and somatic problems. In several
updated systematic reviews, the efﬁcacy of ACT interventions continues to
be supported across a wide range of medical and clinical populations (Pull,
2008; Ruiz, 2010). On the basis that ACT interventions to date have been
found to be effective with individuals experiencing more severe psychologi-
cal and physical deﬁcits, this outcome has important implications for the
potential utility of ACT to be applied to persons with mild to moderate
ABI who are experiencing heightened psychological distress and adjust-
ment-related disturbances.

UTILITY OF ACCEPTANCE AND MINDFULNESS-BASED
INTERVENTIONS IN ABI

No published study to date has tested the efﬁcacy of an ACT intervention that
explicitly incorporates all six key processes of this paradigm with an ABI
population. There are, however,
two lines of preliminary evidence to
support utilising acceptance and mindfulness-based approaches for ABI
patient groups. In particular, the processes of cognitive defusion, present
awareness, and self-as-context have been reported separately in different
mindfulness-based clinical applications involving individuals with an ABI.
The ﬁrst line of evidence is indicated from Be´dard et al.’s (2003) mindful-
ness-based intervention trial for TBI patients. This pilot study investigated
the effectiveness of a mindfulness-based group-support intervention for indi-
viduals (aged between 18 and 65 years) who had sustained a mild or moderate
TBI, with the aim of improving quality of life, reducing depressive symptoms,
and increasing the sense of control patients experienced over their lives;

ACCEPTANCE AND COMMITMENT THERAPY FOLLOWING ABI

265

although participants were required to not be experiencing any major mental
health disorders. This 12-week group intervention was manualised and based
on Jon Kabat-Zinn and colleagues’ (Kabat-Zinn, 1990; Kabat-Zinn Lipworth,
& Burney, 1985) mindfulness-based stress reduction therapy as well as
Kolb’s (1984) experiential learning paradigm. Kolb’s experiential theory is
a four-stage cyclical model that combines experience, perception, cognitions
and behaviour. Although Be´dard et al. did not report what components of
Kolb’s theory were incorporated into their mindfulness-stress reduction inter-
vention, it was noted that the emphasis of their intervention programme was
on developing present moment awareness as well as acceptance by using
insight meditation, breathing exercises, guided visualisation and group dis-
cussion. In particular, through self-exploration and group discussion, patients
were encouraged to view their TBI-related disabilities from a new perspective
facilitated by approaching life via acceptance in order to move forward with
their life (Be´dard et al., 2003). Accordingly, the therapeutic framework uti-
lised in this pilot study is comparable with ACT processes; notably, the
core processes of acceptance, contact with present moment, and self-as-
context.

Ten eligible participants who completed Be´dard et al.’s (2003) intervention
(and who were between 3 and 10 years post-TBI), were compared to three par-
ticipants who dropped out of treatment. Results indicated that the TBI patients
who completed the intervention had a substantial improvement in overall
quality of life (p , .05), as well as experiencing a reduction of depressive
symptoms (p ¼ .059), reporting a signiﬁcant decline in cognitive-related
mood symptoms (p ¼ .029) compared to participants who did not complete
therapy. No change, however, was evident in participant functioning post-
intervention (assessed by the Community Integration Questionnaire). This
research needs to be replicated given that this study had several notable meth-
odological limitations including a very small sample of TBI patients (N ¼ 10).
Moreover, the researchers did not use an RCT design, relying upon a compari-
son group comprised of the individuals (N ¼ 3) who dropped out of treatment
and who agreed to take part in the follow-up assessment. In addition, individ-
uals with clinical levels of depression and/or anxiety were excluded from this
trial, limiting the trial to those who were already coping adequately with their
TBI experience.

The second line of preliminary evidence comes from a survivor of TBI,
Trisha Meili, who survived a brutal physical and sexual assault in 1989
(Meili, 2003; Meili & Kabat-Zinn, 2004). Trisha Meili’s identity was only
revealed in 2003. Prior to this her brutal attack received international
media coverage with her case referred to as the “Central Park Jogger”, as
her attack took place on the evening (between 9 p.m. and 9.35 p.m.) of
April 19, 1989 in Central Park, New York. Following this attack, Trisha
was comatose for 12 days with an initial Glasgow Coma Score of between

266

KANGAS AND McDONALD

4 and 5 points (Meili & Kabat-Zinn, 2004). She sustained multiple contusions
in the left frontal and right temporal/occipital regions with signs of diffuse
brain damage as indicated on EEG reports. She also had multiple left
orbital fractures and severe left facial and mouth lacerations (Meili &
Kabat-Zinn, 2004). She experienced retrograde amnesia, with loss of
memory from 5 p.m. on the day of her attack until 6 weeks post-injury.
Seven-weeks post-injury and shortly after coming out of her coma, Trisha
was transferred to a rehabilitation hospital.

What is unique about Trisha Meili’s case is that although her prognosis
was very poor, given the extent of her brain injuries, she made a remarkable
recovery by the time she revealed her identity in 2003, 4 years following her
attack (Leskowitz, 2004). During the early phases of her rehabilitation, Trisha
innately trained herself to “develop an attitude of mind” that was compatible
with meditative principles (Leskowitz, 2004, p.4). In Trisha’s own words she
reported that she learned “to live in a new body – mentally, physically and
emotionally” and although her “body is different” since the attack, it is
“not necessarily worse” (Meili & Kabat-Zinn, 2004, p. 11). Notably, she
learned to accept the changes in her physical being whilst being committed
to moving forward in terms of regaining her sense-of-self and values by
living in the present; rather than being ﬁxated on the past, and ruminating
on why the attack happened to her. Indeed, Trisha reported that “living in
the present and accepting her reality” was integral to her healing (Meili &
Kabat-Zinn, 2004, p. 11). This was facilitated by applying acceptance and
mindfulness-based practice. While she innately applied these principles at
the beginning, she later received tutelage from Kabat-Zinn in the application
of mindfulness meditation training (Leskowitz, 2004).

Trisha Meili’s recovery from her TBI appears to have been facilitated by
practising mindfulness and acceptance-based practices, including contact
with present moment, self-as-context, and committed action to living a
valued life. Moreover, given she had sustained a severe TBI her substantial
overall recovery lends further support to the potential of mindfulness-based
interventions for emotional problems after ABI. Jon Kabat-Zinn’s reﬂection
of what rehabilitation entails and the role of mindfulness practices in rehabi-
litation is noteworthy. In particular he asserts that the term “rehabilitation”
has at least two inter-related meanings; the ﬁrst common meaning denotes
“to re-enable” or to “do again what for a time we have been unable to do”
(Meili & Kabat-Zinn, 2004, p. 8). The second meaning is derived from the
roots of the term “habitat” which denotes “to inhabit, to dwell inside”,
hence meaning “to learn to live inside again” which attests to learning to
become sensitive to the interior processes of what is taking place inside the
body, post-injury, during rehabilitation (Meili & Kabat-Zinn, 2004, p. 11).
Acceptance of these changes is therefore an important step in rehabilitation,
in order to learn or re-learn to live inside again. Indeed, Trisha Meili’s

ACCEPTANCE AND COMMITMENT THERAPY FOLLOWING ABI

267

experience reﬂects that applying acceptance and mindfulness-based practices
can facilitate this process of healing and regaining a sense-of-self and purpo-
seful existence.

ACT in context of rehabilitation programmes

While ACT has developed from the general clinical literature, many of its
principles are, in fact, compatible with the aims of the holistic neuropsycho-
logical rehabilitation programmes established worldwide (e.g., Ben-Yishay,
1996; Prigatano, 1986; Wilson et al., 2000) as well as more recent innovations
in brain injury remediation programmes (Wilson, 2008, 2010). Notably, four
of the core ACT principles (acceptance, self-as-context, valued goals, and
committed action) seem to be incorporated in the multidisciplinary pro-
grammes conducted in the holistic rehabilitation setting. However, as outlined
previously, the six core processes of ACT also include present-moment
awareness and cognitive defusion. Collectively, these six core interactive
processes are aimed to enhance psychological ﬂexibility in order to assist
individuals struggling with emotional and/or psychosocial problems. To
this end, an ACT-based psychotherapy programme for distressed TBI patients
would necessitate including all six core components within the same
programme.

Furthermore, the majority of the ACT principles are also encompassed
within the metaphoric identity mapping (MIM) model pioneered by Ylvisaker
and colleagues (Ylvisaker & Feeney, 2000; Ylvisaker, McPherson, Kayes, &
Pellett, 2008). This approach is postulated to facilitate identity re-construction,
goal setting and re-engagement for persons who have sustained a TBI (Ylvisa-
ker et al., 2008). The MIM approach focuses on (1) identity reconstruction fol-
lowing a TBI, with emphasis on focusing on “actual self” in the here-and-now,
versus “possible/hoped-for-self”, which may be unattainable; and (2) realistic
goal setting to live a meaningful life post-injury. Hence, comparable to the
holistic rehabilitation programmes, four of the core ACT principles (accep-
tance, self-as-context, valued goals, and committed action) are, thus, also
encompassed within the MIM model. Furthermore, metaphors (easy to com-
prehend analogies) are utilised routinely in ACT (Eifert & Forsyth, 2005;
Harris, 2009; Hayes, 2004). Until recently, metaphors were misconstrued as
too difﬁcult for persons who may be too concrete in their thinking. In contra-
diction, a number of studies have demonstrated that individuals with impaired
working memory or slow processing, and even young children are capable of
understanding and utilising metaphors (Lakoff & Johnson, 1999; Ylvisaker
et al., 2008). Speciﬁcally, Ylvisaker et al. (2008) reported that in their
work with adolescents and adults with TBI, metaphors were “effective in
exploring otherwise difﬁcult-to-comprehend abstract or challenging concepts”
(p. 720).

268

KANGAS AND McDONALD

To date, the MIM approach has only been applied in comprehensive
multi-disciplinary rehabilitation programmes. There are no studies to our
knowledge that have examined the effectiveness of MIM procedures in the
context of a psychotherapy programme for distressed persons with an ABI
(cf. Ylvisaker et al., 2008). To this end, given the compatibility of the
MIM approach with ACT principles, an ACT-based intervention may be
able to address this gap in the literature. Conversely, as a psychotherapy inter-
vention, ACT, like MIM, has the potential to be included within a more com-
prehensive rehabilitation programme for individuals recovering from mild to
moderate ABI, particularly in order to assist those individuals who are strug-
gling with emotional and psychosocial problems. Speciﬁcally, both MIM and
CBT (Mateer, Sira, & O’Connell, 2005) have been advocated as useful thera-
peutic approaches to assist clients negotiate personally meaningful goals in
rehabilitation. ACT also has potential in this regard as it would enable
distressed clients to re-learn and/or facilitate reliving a purposeful life in
accordance with their values, whilst also learning and practising cognitive
remedial skills.

FUTURE DIRECTIONS: CLINICAL AND RESEARCH
IMPLICATIONS

The current review has indicated that the third wave of behavioural therapies,
notably ACT and other mindfulness-based interventions, may be potentially
useful in facilitating individuals to reclaim their lives following an ABI. In
particular, acceptance-based strategies may be particularly suitable for ABI
patient groups, given that to move forward with life, ABI patients must
learn to accept their neurocognitive and physical limitations. Similarly,
individuals who have sustained a mild or moderate ABI need to come to
terms with living with some degree of uncertainty and the ACT focus on
value-driven strategies may be especially useful in this context.

Over the past decade, the evidence base for ACT-based interventions in
non-ABI populations has exponentially increased, which is also reﬂected in
the number of meta-analytic reviews emerging in recent years (e.g., Pull,
2008; Ruiz, 2010) as well as the emergence of manualised and therapist work-
books (e.g., Forsyth & Eifert, 2008). However we cannot assume that the
promising ﬁndings emerging from non-ABI medical populations will be
equally efﬁcacious with ABI patient groups. Therefore, future research
needs to be directed towards testing the efﬁcacy of ACT with distressed
ABI patient groups. Whether or not ACT-type approaches are more accessi-
ble than traditional CBT for people with cognitive deﬁcits, such as poor
slowed information processing and executive dysfunction,
memory,
there are issues that
remains an empirical question. In the meantime,

ACCEPTANCE AND COMMITMENT THERAPY FOLLOWING ABI

269

should be considered when deciding whether or not to implement an ACT-
based therapy for people with ABI.

Based upon the literature, we recommend the following guidelines. First,
we would recommend ACT for distressed individuals who are experiencing
at least moderately elevated anxiety, stress or depression in response to
their ABI experience. We would not however recommend ACT for any dis-
tressed person who reports suicidal ideation, as these individuals require more
specialised psychiatric treatments. Secondly, until further empirical evidence
is available for the suitability of ACT for ABI patient groups, we would rec-
ommend that ACT-based interventions are suitable for individuals recovering
from mild to moderate ABI, and who have, at minimum, sufﬁcient levels of
cognitive, executive and language functioning, for example, who achieve
scores on standardised measures of language, memory and executive function
that are within 95% (1.65 SD) of the normative average.

When designing treatment programmes based on ACT principles we rec-
ommend that therapists follow a number of steps that are consistent with
current practice of ACT as reported in the literature, as well as implementing
modiﬁcations that would equally apply to any psychological treatment to be
used with people with some cognitive impairments following ABI.

1. ACT therapy is most commonly, and effectively, administered one-to-

one, face-to-face with a therapist.

2. Participants should be provided with an easy-to-read written hand-out
at the end of each therapy session, which summarises the key com-
ponents covered in each session.

3. When experiential exercises are ﬁrst introduced in therapy (e.g., cogni-
tive defusion strategies, mindfulness exercises) we recommend that an
audiotape or CD which includes these exercises should be issued to the
client so that they can practise these exercises between therapy sessions,
in order to procedurally learn and consolidate these skills into their
daily repertoire.

4. To enable clients to learn and practice skills between sessions, therapy
should ideally occur on a weekly basis at least in the initial stages.
5. We also suggest that, based upon common practice in the literature,
therapy programmes should run for 60 –90 minutes duration for
approximately 6–10 sessions. The speciﬁcation of therapy duration
needs to be contingent on the patient’s speciﬁc therapy goals.

6. Initial sessions would usefully be modiﬁed to focus on educating,
normalising and validating common reactions to being diagnosed and
treated for an ABI.

7. Initial and following sessions should introduce individuals to the six
core principles of ACT. In terms of introducing clients to re-evaluating
and re-connecting with their valued life goals, patients should be guided

270

KANGAS AND McDONALD

to reﬂect on their current strengths and weaknesses (including any
ongoing medical/ABI side-effects) as well as reﬂecting on, (1) how
the ABI experience may have hindered their ability to participate in
valued activities they would like to re-engage in, and (2) how they
would like to continue to live their life from here-on, whilst taking
into account any physical and cognitive limitations that need to be
considered in re-connecting to pursuing their life goals.

8. Final sessions may occur less frequently (e.g., on a fortnightly basis),
to enable individuals to have extended personal practice to further
consolidate the skills learned in their daily repertoire, and to have the
opportunity to commit to purposeful living in accordance with their
values.

Research guidelines

The methodological quality of empirical research is crucial in terms of estab-
lishing evidence-based clinical practice guidelines for interventions that are
suitable for ABI populations (Perdices et al., 2006). In terms of future
research aimed at testing the efﬁcacy of ACT interventions with ABI popu-
lations, it is clear that controlled trials are needed. In the ﬁrst instance,
given there is a dearth of controlled trials that have tested ACT with ABI
samples, a wait-list controlled (WLC) intervention design would be suitable.
The WLC design is also ethically appropriate as all eligible participants
would eventually receive the intervention. If the efﬁcacy of ACT in enhan-
cing the emotional well-being and quality of life of distressed ABI patient
groups is demonstrated based on WLC designed interventions, then the
next logical step for future research in this ﬁeld would be to further test the
efﬁcacy of ACT interventions against alternative, suitably “active” treat-
ments, including traditional CBT and pharmacotherapy. Indeed, conducting
trials that directly compare ACT to traditional CBT programmes would
have utility in also determining which persons with ABI beneﬁt more from
each speciﬁc type of intervention. Increasingly, there is recognition in the
broader psychotherapy literature that “one therapy model” does not necess-
arily suit all types of individuals. To this end, given the heterogeneity in def-
icits sustained by different types of ABI populations (e.g., low to medium
grade primary brain tumour compared with low to moderate TBI, versus
mild dementia), multi-group controlled designed studies are also warranted
in future research. This type of research would be able to determine
whether a particular ACT-based intervention is uniformly efﬁcacious
across different types of ABI patient samples who have sustained low to mod-
erate deﬁcits.

In conducting research in this area, it is also important for the intervention
programme to be manualised so as to systematically monitor therapists’

ACCEPTANCE AND COMMITMENT THERAPY FOLLOWING ABI

271

adherence to the therapy programme. The format and length of the treatment
intervention also needs to be standardised. Selecting primary and secondary
outcome measures, as well as delineating assessment end-points a priori, is
also important. Selection of assessment measures should reﬂect the primary
objectives of the study. For example, if the primary aim is to assess the
efﬁcacy of ACT for reducing emotional distress and improving quality of
life, including community integration, there should be outcome measures
for each of these variables.

Selection of appropriate secondary measures is also critical as these
measures are instrumental in testing moderator and mediation effects of the
intervention in order to determine which types of individuals with ABI do
best with the given intervention. Indeed, there is a paucity of studies in the
existent ABI-based literature that have extended research into testing the
moderator and mediation effects of psychological treatments, although this
is gaining momentum in the broader CBT and ACT literature. Finally,
multiple assessment time frames are necessary to determine the immediate,
short and longer-term (3 or more months) effects of the intervention.
Longer-term follow-up assessment is necessary to test retention effects,
especially if the intervention is proven to be beneﬁcial for patients in the
short-term. If the longer-term effects wane, this information is also instrumen-
tal for the future revisions of the treatment protocol. For example, increasing
the duration of treatment, and/or inclusion of several intermittent booster
sessions may be warranted to enable ABI patients to further consolidate
skills learned as well as reduce the risk of relapse.

CONCLUSION

Overall, there is a paucity of RCT intervention studies for the treatment of
psychological problems (e.g., Soo & Tate, 2007) and adjustment-related dis-
turbances in ABI populations. When evaluating the efﬁcacy of psychosocial
interventions to improve functionality and overall quality of life after an
ABI, it is crucial that the therapeutic interventions have a valid conceptual
basis. The recent emergence of the evidence base for ACT interventions
across a variety of psychological and medical populations (Hayes et al.,
2006; Pull, 2008) accentuates that this is the opportune time for clinicians
and researchers working with ABI populations to begin to conduct rigorous
RCT interventions in testing the efﬁcacy of ACT interventions in enhancing
the well-being and quality of life of persons who have sustained these life-alter-
ing conditions. Given that ACT interventions are oriented towards improving
functionality, this type of intervention should be evaluated in a range of
contexts and, particularly,
in the context of multimodal rehabilitation
programmes for ABI patient groups. The evolution of behavioural-based

272

KANGAS AND McDONALD

interventions provides clinicians and researchers with more options for testing
appropriate conceptually based therapeutic models in helping ABI patients
resume their lives post-diagnosis and/or injury, by facilitating reliving a
purposeful life, consistent with their values. We therefore owe it to our patients
to test whether the ACT paradigm has utility in achieving this goal.
