Abstract

Suicide is a leading cause of death in youth. Evidence highlights the importance of identifying 
youth at risk for suicide in pediatric primary care, and suggests this is a crucial setting for 
improving youth mental health. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends primary care 
providers not only screen and assess for suicide risk, but also become educated on how to better 
manage certain mental health conditions. This article discusses the epidemiology of youth suicide 
in the U.S. and describes evidence-based strategies and innovative practices for suicide prevention 
in pediatric primary care including suicide risk screening, assessment, intervention, and follow-up 
care.

Introduction

Page 2

Suicide is a leading cause of death among youth aged 10-19 years in the United States and 
in 2022 accounted for 23% of all deaths in this age group.1 Following a steady decline since 
1999, suicide rates in this age group increased 27% between 2011 and 2022 (from 4.9 to 
6.3 per 100,000).2 Suicidal ideation, defined as thoughts of ending one’s life, and suicide 
attempts, a non-fatal self-injurious behavior with stated or inferred intent to die, have also 
increased substantially in youth, and are strong predictors of future suicide.3 According to 
the 2021 Youth Risk Behavior Survey of U.S. high school students, 22% of youth indicated 
they seriously considered suicide, and 10% of youth reported they attempted suicide at least 
once in the prior 12 month.4

Primary care practices are a major point of contact for healthcare services and youth who 
may be at risk for suicide, and in some cases the de facto mental health care setting.5 A 
2019 survey by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) found over 90% of pediatricians 
had a patient screen positive or disclose suicide ideation, and 81% reported having a patient 
who attempted or died by suicide.6 Research further shows approximately 80% of suicide 
decedents are seen by primary care providers in the year prior to death, while only 20% 
have contact with a mental health professional.7,8 This is particularly concerning for rural 
and underserved communities where economic, geographic, or cultural barriers may limit 
access to mental health services.9,10 Also, many youth would prefer to see their primary care 
provider concerning emotional problems, as there is less stigma and more accessibility.

Evidence highlights the importance of identifying youth at risk for suicide in pediatric 
primary care and suggests this is an essential setting for improving youth mental and 
behavioral health. The AAP also recommends that primary care providers not only screen 
and assess for suicide risk, but also become educated on how to manage certain mental 
health conditions and more effectively link patients to necessary specialized care and follow 
up services.11 Although research has advanced many effective strategies to prevent youth 
suicide, continued efforts are needed to address this pressing public health problem. This 
article will discuss the current epidemiology of youth suicide in the U.S. and describe 
research and evidence-based best strategies for suicide prevention in pediatric primary 
care including suicide risk screening, assessment, intervention, follow-up monitoring, and 
innovative practices.

Epidemiology of Youth Suicide

Age / Sex—Youth suicide and suicidal behavior are associated with risk factors across 
multiple domains including individual (e.g., psychopathology, prior suicidal behavior), 
family (e.g., familial suicide, family discord, child maltreatment), and social (e.g., school/
peer-related problems, media effects)12 (Table 1). Developmental and demographic factors 
also influence rates of youth suicide. Between 2001-2021, youth suicide rates in males were 
3 times higher than females and represented 77% of all suicide deaths in 10- to 19-year-
olds2 (Figure 1). However, recent data reveals a narrowing gap between male and female 
youth suicide.2,13 Regarding age, suicide rates among youth aged 10-14 years increased 
59% between 2012 and 2022 (from 1.4 to 2.4 per 100,000), compared to a 20% increase in

youth aged 15-19 years (from 8.3 to 10.0 per 100,000)2; females aged 10-14 years showed 
the sharpest increase, with suicide rates more than doubling during this timeframe (from 0.8 
to 1.9 per 100,000).2

Race / Ethnicity—American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) youth experience the highest 
rates of suicide in the U.S2 (Figure 2). From 2018-2022, the suicide rate among AI/AN 
youth aged 10-19 years in the U.S. (25.8 per 100,000) was 3 times the rate for White youth 
(7.8 per 100,000), and over 4 times higher than rates for Black, Asian/Pacific Islander, and 
Hispanic youth.2 Differences by race/ethnicity have also been identified in suicide rates 
among younger children. Bridge et al,14 found the suicide rate in children younger than 13 
years to be roughly two times higher for Black children compared with White children.

Sexual and Gender Minority Youth—Sexual and gender minority youth are also at 
greater risk for suicide than their peers. Raifman et al,15 evaluated youth sexual orientation 
and suicide attempts among U.S. high school students from 2009 to 2017 and found 
students identifying as sexual minorities were more than 3 times as likely to attempt 
suicide compared to heterosexual students. An additional study showed bisexual youth were 
associated with significantly more suicide risk factors (depression, trauma, victimization) 
and less protective factors (parent-family connectedness, positive affect), along with elevated 
rates of both ideation and attempts compared to heterosexual and other sexual minority 
youth.16

Psychopathology—Research consistently shows a significant association between youth 
suicide and mental health issues,17,18 which includes previous suicide attempts, the most 
robust clinical predictor of a future suicide attempt.14,19 Depression is strongly linked to 
youth suicidal thoughts and behaviors (Nock et al., 2013), and a national survey shows 
19.5% of youth aged 12-17 years experienced a past year major depressive episode in 
2022.20 Comorbidity of mental health issues and substance abuse disorders are also shown 
to significantly increase the risk for youth suicide and suicidal behavior.21

Family Factors—Multiple family-related factors have been linked to youth suicide. A 
study examining the familial transmission of suicidal behavior showed children of parents 
with a history of mood disorders and suicide attempts had a 5-fold increased odds of suicide 
attempt.22 A study of children aged 9-10 years found family conflict and low parental 
monitoring were significantly associated with suicidal ideation even after controlling for 
demographic and psychosocial variables.23 Studies further indicate increased risk for suicide 
due to parental loss from death, divorce, or abandonment.24 Child maltreatment is also 
a significant risk for youth suicide, suicide attempts, and suicidal ideation;12,25,26 a meta-
analysis examining specific types of child maltreatment found sexual abuse to be the most 
significant predictor of future suicidal behavior (Angelakis et al., 2020; Gomez et al., 
2017).25,26

Peer Relations—Using data from 48 countries, a global study found bullying 
victimization was associated with a 3-fold increased odds of suicide attempt among youth 
aged 12-15 years.27 An additional study assessed bullying and suicidal ideation in patients 
aged 12-17 years presenting to an emergency department with mental health issues.28

Slightly more than 75% of youth indicated they experienced bullying at some point during 
their lives. Findings further revealed that victims of bullying were 9 times more likely to 
report suicidal ideation than youth with no history of bullying.28 Previous research also 
suggests suicidal behaviors are influenced by affiliation with peers who have engaged in 
suicidal behaviors,29 however positive peer influence is shown to be effective in school-
based suicide prevention programs.30,31

Media / Social Media Effects—A systematic review investigating social media/internet 
use and suicide attempts in youth aged 11-18 years found more frequent social media/
internet use was associated with increased odds (1.03 to 5.10) for suicide attempt.32 In an 
additional review, up to 25% of studies suggested positive aspects of social/media internet 
use, revealing youth with a history of suicidal behavior used the internet as a form of support 
and sense of community to seek help and connect with others.33 Another concern is media 
contagion effects, referring to the media’s direct and indirect influence on youth suicidal 
behavior. Recent studies indicate that sensational reports of celebrity suicide deaths that 
disregard reporting guidelines34 and irresponsible fictional accounts of suicide such as those 
found in 13 Reasons Why Season 135 may increase the rate of suicides in the population.

Evidence-Based Strategies for Suicide Prevention in Pediatric Primary Care Suicide Risk 
Screening

Early identification of suicide risk in youth is a critical step in suicide prevention, yet 
many youths often go undetected. To address this issue, many healthcare settings have 
implemented routine suicide risk screening. The AAP recommends that all pediatric patients 
be screened for depression annually, and to also inquire about factors shown to be associated 
with elevated suicide risk.11 In the Blueprint for Youth Suicide Prevention, the AAP and 
the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, in collaboration with the National Institute 
of Mental Health (NIMH), more specifically call for universal suicide risk screening in 
youth ages 12 years and older in primary care and other clinical settings. The AAP 
further recommends youth aged 8-11 years be screened when clinically indicated, such 
as presenting with mental health concerns, or if there is a known history of suicidal thoughts 
and behaviors. For younger youth, guidelines suggest screening if there are warning signs of 
suicide risk or parental reports of youth suicidal thoughts and behaviors.

Suicide is closely linked with depression, and screening for depression is often the gateway 
to suicide prevention in primary care settings. A commonly used evidence-based depression 
screening instrument is the Patient Health Questionnaire PHQ-9.36-37 While depression 
screening is important, research shows screening for depression alone is not adequate to 
detect suicide risk, and that not all youth at risk for suicide have depression symptoms.16,38 
In a study among medical inpatients aged 10-21 years, 39.5% of participants who screened 
positive for suicide risk did not screen positive for depression using the Patient Health 
Questionnaire-Adolescent Version (PHQ-A), and 56% did not report thoughts of self-harm 
or “being better off dead” on item 9 of the PHQ-A.16 An additional study found that suicide 
specific screening identified an additional 8.3% of patients aged 12-20 years at risk for 
suicide compared to depression screening alone.38

Evidence suggests screening for both depression and suicide risk can significantly detect 
more individuals with elevated risk for engaging in suicidal behavior.16 To facilitate this 
process, the AAP recommends brief and easy to administer youth suicide screening tools 
to effectively guide clinicians in the assessment of suicide risk in pediatric care. One such 
evidence-based screening tool developed specifically for youth in medical settings is the Ask 
Suicide-Screening Questions (ASQ).39,40 The ASQ is comprised of 4 initial questions that 
assess suicide ideation and suicidal behavior to identify patients who may need further risk 
assessment. A “yes” response or nonresponse to any of these questions results in a positive 
screening result for suicide risk, and prompts a fifth question to assess acuity.40 Studies 
show the ASQ has high sensitivity, specificity, and negative predictive validity, and that it 
can detect patients at risk for suicide that depression screening alone fails to identify.40-42 
Additional risk screening tools shown to be effective in youth populations include the 
Suicidal Ideation Questionnaire (SIQ-JR),43 Youth Suicide Ideation Screen (YSIS-3),44 and 
the Concise Health Risk Tracking Self-Report (CHRT-SR) 45

Suicide Assessment

Following a positive screen, assessment is a comprehensive evaluation, typically conducted 
by a medical provider or mental health clinician, to obtain more specific information about 
risk and protective factors, including diagnostic and psychosocial considerations, to guide 
next steps.46,47 Commonly used assessment tools in pediatric primary care include the 
ASQ-Brief Suicide Safety Assessment (BSSA), Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale 
(C-SSRS), and the Suicide Assessment Five-Step Evaluation and Triage (SAFE-T).47

The BSSA was developed as a brief (15 minute) tool for clinicians/providers to aid in 
classification of risk to guide determining the next steps in care. The BSSA is part of the 
NIMH ASQ Suicide Risk Screening Toolkit (http://www.nimh.nih.gov/ASQ) and includes 
the following steps: 1) Praise patient, by expressing appreciation for disclosing their 
suicidal thoughts and/or behaviors; 2) Assess the patient, including asking about frequency 
of suicidal thoughts, presence of suicide plan, past self-injurious and/or suicidal behavior, 
psychiatric symptoms, and social support and stressors; 3) Interview patient and parent/
guardian together, to elicit parent’s perspectives on any assessed aspects above as well 
as any family/friend history of suicide attempt, parental comfort with keeping child safe at 
home, and potentially dangerous items in home; 4) Make a safety plan with the patient, 
which includes coping strategies, means restriction guidance, and asking about self-efficacy 
related to keeping safe; 5) Determine disposition, such as whether patient is at imminent 
risk requiring emergency psychiatric evaluation, whether further evaluation is necessary via 
urgent 72 hour mental health referral, or whether a non-urgent mental health referral is 
needed ; and 6) Provide resources to all patients, such as 988 and/or other local crisis 
resources. There are no psychometric validation studies of the BSSA at this time, though 
providers have reported this approach is acceptable.47-49

The C-SSRS (http://www.cssrs.columbia.edu/) is a tool to aid providers/clinicians in 
assessing more detailed suicide risk elements, including suicidal ideation, the intensity 
of suicidal ideation (including frequency, duration, controllability, deterrents, and reasons 
for ideation), suicidal behaviors and preparation (including actual attempts, interrupted

attempts, aborted attempts, and preparatory acts or behaviors), and lethality (including actual 
and potential). The C-SSRS Risk Assessment version also includes an initial page with a 
checklist of risk and protective factors (e.g., past week suicidal and self-injurious behavior, 
activating events, treatment history). The C-SSRS has demonstrated convergent validity 
with established suicidal ideation and behavior scales and strong divergent validity with 
depression scales.47

The SAFE-T, developed from the American Psychiatric Association Practice Guidelines 
for the Assessment and Treatment of Patients with Suicidal Behaviors, includes a five-step 
process: 1) identify risk factors; 2) identify protective factors; 3) conduct suicide inquiry, 
including suicidal thoughts, plans, behavior, and intent; 4) determine risk level/intervention; 
and 5) document. The SAFE-T has frequently been used in primary care training and 
practice, though was not included as a suggested suicide risk assessment tool by the 
American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (AACAP) Pathways in Clinical 
Care (PaCC) Workgroup.50

Suicide risk assessment should use systematic tools, include interviews with the child 
patient and parent/guardian, and result in informed clinical judgement regarding an 
immediate and longer-term disposition plan. Given their inclusion in the PaCC Workgroup 
recommendations for clinical pathways to address suicide risk in pediatric hospitals, the 
BSSA or C-SSRS are recommended as follow-up to a positive ASQ screen in pediatric 
primary care.50 It is vital for providers to consider the cultural, societal, institutional, 
neighborhood, and family context in interpreting assessment findings.51 These contextual 
factors have potentially differential implications for diagnosis and treatment in youth of 
color and minoritized youth who may experience poorer or delayed access to care.47,51

Pediatric providers should discuss with patients what to expect with regard to parent/
guardian involvement during the assessment process. The Blueprint for Youth Suicide 
Prevention emphasizes having confidential, one-on-one time between the clinician and 
patient during clinic visit to discuss mental health and suicide risk. This conversation should 
include reviewing confidentiality and any limits and specific planning for how suicide risk 
information will be disclosed to the parent (i.e., give patient a choice as to whether they 
want to be present or not when safety concerns are discussed with parent). The provider may 
meet with the parent individually after the suicide risk disclosure to answer questions about 
the child’s safety and to more thoroughly discuss any action steps related to lethal means 
restriction or care planning.

Brief Suicide Interventions

Youth suicide screening and assessment practices must include management strategies to 
address both immediate and longer-term safety needs. Given the difficulties in accessing 
specialty mental health care and the high treatment dropout rates, pediatric primary care is 
the setting in which many youth with recent suicidal crises are likely to present. Families 
report seeing their pediatric primary care providers as someone who can help during times of 
suicidal crisis.52 This underscores the need for screening, assessment and brief interventions 
to address safety, lethal means restriction counseling, and motivation/problem-solving to 
support mental health care linkage in this setting.

Brief youth suicide prevention interventions have been most robustly tested in ED settings, 
despite holding strong potential for effectiveness and current use across a wide variety 
of care settings, through implementation by a wide variety of care providers. Asarnow 
and colleagues53 demonstrated that a brief family-based ED intervention, the Family 
Intervention for Suicide Prevention (FISP), could effectively link youth and parents to care 
and this intervention was effectively delivered in the ED setting in 80.9% of patients54. 
This approach has recently been adapted for use with pediatricians and is being piloted with 
pediatricians across Texas.

A recent meta-analysis of studies comparing safety-planning type interventions to control 
conditions included six studies in adult samples reporting outcomes on at least one of the 
following: suicidal behavior, suicide attempts, death by suicide, or suicidal ideation55. The 
meta-analysis found risk of suicidal behavior was significantly reduced by 43% [number 
needed to treat (NNT)=16] in the intervention conditions. In the three studies that included 
outcomes on suicidal ideation, there was no significant effect of safety planning. Safety 
plans appear to support behavior change for suicide prevention but may not impact levels 
of cognitive distress related to suicidal ideation.56 Safety plans do increase self-efficacy and 
coping.57,58 Studies have shown that clinicians report safety plans help get patients linked to 
care.59 Of note, in this meta-analysis: 1) safety planning was operationalized as the safety 
plan containing, as a minimum, personalized coping strategies and sources of support; 2) 
all studies included development of the safety plan collaboratively with the clinician; 3) the 
safety plan was provided in person, on paper, or sent by mail. In four of the studies, the 
safety plan also included developing a list of personal warning signs of a suicidal crisis.55 
Two commonly used approaches to safety planning with suicidal youth include the Safety 
Planning Intervention (SPI) and the FISP (also known as SAFETY-Acute). Table 2 describes 
the core components of these two approaches, as well as their similarities and differences.

SPI is a brief intervention that has been included as a best practice strategy by the 
Suicide Prevention Resource Center (SPRC)/American Foundation for Suicide Prevention 
(AFSP).60-61 In SPI, the safety plan is a hierarchically arranged, written list of coping 
strategies and sources of support that the adolescent can use in a suicidal “crisis” or to avert 
such a crisis.61 The safety plan is the product of a collaborative process between the provider 
and the patient, and to an appropriate extent, the parents. SPI was initially developed as 
part of the CBT-SP intervention in the NIMH-funded Treatment of Adolescent Suicide 
Attempters (TASA) study.62,60 The current standalone SPI63 intervention combines SPI and 
telephone follow-up, with the goal of contacting patients at least 2 times to monitor suicide 
risk, review and revise the SPI, and support treatment engagement. Patients who received 
the intervention were less likely to engage in suicidal behavior (3.03%) versus usual care 
(5.29%) during 6 months of follow-up.63 An ongoing study is testing SPI with structured 
follow-up (SPI+) with adolescents.64

FISP, also included as an evidence-based intervention by SPRC/AFSP , is an enhanced 
mental health intervention involving a family-based CBT session in the ED designed to 
increase motivation for follow-up treatment, support, coping, and safety.53 FISP is also 
the first session in an evidence-based outpatient intervention for youth with a recent 
suicide attempt, SAFETY.65-68 FISP is a second-generation adaptation of the Specialized

Emergency Room Intervention for Suicidal Adolescent Females69, which was designed 
with the primary goal of increasing linkage to outpatient mental health services. Primary 
targets of FISP are: 1) to directly address short-term risk of repeated suicidal behavior 
through enhancing motivation to seek follow-up treatment, strengthening youth and family 
coping skills, and educating the family about restricting access to potentially lethal means; 
2) to educate about the importance of linking to follow-up care. FISP was tested in a 
randomized controlled trial in which suicidal youths at two EDs (N=181; aged 10-18) 
were individually randomized to 1) Usual ED Care enhanced by provider education (UC); 
or 2) FISP, supplemented by care linkage telephone contacts after discharge. Intervention 
patients were significantly more likely to attend outpatient treatment compared to UC 
patients (92.1% vs 76.2%, p=0.00453. The intervention group also had a significantly higher 
rate of psychotherapy, combined psychotherapy/medication, and more psychotherapy visits, 
but no significant effects on suicidality or other clinical/functioning outcomes (exploratory 
analyses).53

Lethal means restriction, or efforts to limit a person’s access to methods which may be 
used to attempt suicide, have demonstrated efficacy lowering suicide rates.70 Lethal means 
restriction counseling provided to parents of youth in the ED resulted in parents being four 
times more likely to restrict their child’s access.71 In a survey of pediatric primary care 
providers, only 19.4% reported consistently screening for firearms or providing lethal means 
restriction counseling.72

The American Board of Pediatrics (ABP) and the AAP have called for increased training 
of pediatricians in managing patients with behavioral and mental health concerns, with 
the AAP specifically developing an educational resource for youth suicide prevention: 
“Suicide: Blueprint for Youth Suicide Prevention.”73 Given the impact on preventing 
suicidal behavior,55 safety planning should continue to be identified as best practice for 
the prevention of suicidal behavior in individuals at risk of suicide, and should be strongly 
recommended in clinical practice and guidelines for suicide prevention. The AAP, SPRC, 
and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommend safety planning for 
youth presenting with elevated suicide risk.

While the primary purpose of a safety plan is for the individual, in collaboration with the 
clinician, to identify personalized coping strategies to be used when experiencing suicidal 
thoughts or urges, a safety plan also includes individual suicide warning signs, resources 
for contacting social and professional support, including crisis lines and emergency services, 
and a focus on reducing access to lethal means. Motivational interviewing strategies, which 
are often used to address health behavior change in pediatric primary care, may enhance 
adherence to youth safety plan use and parents’ motivation to encourage safety plan use.57,58 
Pediatric providers may consider using “Lock and Protect,” a user-friendly web-based 
tool for parents to support lethal means counseling efforts with parents/caregivers.74 This 
decisional aid uses behavioral economics approaches, such as “nudges” to guide parents 
through important considerations for home safety, such as who can help them take steps 
to lock up potentially dangerous means, which rooms in the house to consider, what they 
might need to secure items (such as a lockbox), and how to initiate crisis services if needed.

Follow-up Care and Monitoring

Ensuring that youth at risk for suicide receive timely, seamless, uninterrupted follow-up care 
as they transition from one health setting to another has the potential to save lives and reduce 
suicide attempts.75 Follow-up interventions are defined as services that improve access to 
and engagement in care as well as to prevent suicide and related behaviors.76 This approach 
consists of the practice of contacting people, connecting them to care, and providing social 
support after discharge using phone calls, tele-assistance, or in-person visits, sending letters, 
emails, postcards, or caring contacts text messages.77 In contrast to other resource intensive 
suicide-specific interventions that require a mental health specialist, follow-up interventions 
are typically brief (6-12 sessions), low cost, nondemand interventions that can be conducted 
by anyone and occur according to a structured schedule over a designated period (e.g., 1 
year).77,78

Although there is a paucity of randomized clinical trials on follow-up interventions for 
suicidal patients, existing research generally suggests that follow-up contacts may reduce 
repeat suicide attempts and prevent death by suicide for patients discharged from inpatient 
or emergency departments.76,79,80 Specific follow-up strategies that have been shown to 
be effective in reducing repeat suicide attempts and/or suicide include the sending of 
caring letters,81 or postcards,82 crisis cards,83 or short- or long-term phone or in-person 
contacts after hospital discharge.84,85 Based on this evidence, the National Action Alliance 
for Suicide Prevention’s Clinical Care and Intervention Task Force has recommended the 
inclusion of follow-up care for those patients at risk for suicide leaving care or transitioning 
from one health setting to another as one of the four components of evidenced based suicide 
prevention care.86

Within primary care settings, follow-up care is necessary to monitor suicide risk, connect 
patients to outpatient mental health specialty treatment, and promote engagement in care. 
Simple methods such as caring contacts and phone call contacts can easily be implemented 
in primary care settings by a case manager (e.g., social workers nurses, psychologists) or 
health care assistants.76 Another promising innovative strategy that has potential to improve 
access to and engagement in mental health care is the integration of care navigators into 
primary care settings. Care navigators, who may be clinicians, peers, or paraprofessionals, 
aim to support families by ensuring ongoing access to care, promoting engagement with 
care, facilitating shared decision making with providers, and increasing awareness of 
community resources.87 Major functions and services that care navigators provide include 
education and coaching, advocacy, linkages to health systems and community services, 
and assessment and triage. While research on care navigation for pediatric populations, 
especially those with mental health issues or at risk for suicide, is limited, studies on 
adult populations with conditions like cancer or severe mental illness have shown that care 
navigation leads to increased health services utilization, including improved linkages to care, 
adherence to treatment recommendations, and timeliness in accessing health services.88 In

Innovative Practices in Suicide Prevention in Pediatric Primary Care The Clinical Pathway

Clinical pathways are tools used by health professionals to guide evidence-based practice 
and improve the interaction between health-care professionals by adapting guidelines to a 
local context and detailing essential steps in assessment and treatment.89 Clinical pathways 
can have positive impact on the quality of care delivered to individual patients, on the health 
of populations of patients with particular diseases or conditions, on the workflow of frontline 
providers, and on processes within the health care organization.90,91 Suicide prevention and 
management strategies have been implemented by some organizations but have not been 
widely applied and there is a high degree of variability in care delivery across providers 
and settings.92 Current estimates suggest that 30%-40% of patients do not receive treatments 
with proven effectiveness.93 Within primary care, 20%-40% of adolescents have high levels 
of distress or suicidal ideation, yet PCPs identify less than half.94-96 Failure to identify and 
intervene with youth at risk for suicide likely confers a high potential for morbidity and 
mortality.97

The Clinical Pathway: Risk Screening, Assessment, and Management—The 
clinical pathway for screening in outpatient primary care setting is depicted in Figure 
3. The outpatient clinical pathway was developed by the Pathways in Clinical Care 
(PaCC) workgroup from within the Physically 111 Child committee of the AACAP to 
assist hospitals and EDS, and inpatient medical/surgical units implementing suicide risk 
screening to pediatric patients,98 with subsequent versions developed for outpatient primary 
and specialty care modified by NIMH.99 Similar pathways have been developed for adult 
populations.100 The NIMH pathway generally uses a three-step approach to suicide risk 
screening (see Figure 2).: 1) step 1 Brief screening for suicide risk; 2) Step 2: brief suicide 
safety assessment; and step 3: determining disposition and course of action for patients 
deemed to be at imminent risk, in need of further evaluation or low risk for suicide.99 
The pathway was created as an evidence-informed guide to improve risk screening and 
effectively manage screen positive patients using the ASQ and the BSSA for screening 
and risk stratification (ASQ toolkit). The specific components of the clinical pathway are 
described below.

Step 1: Universal Screening for Suicide Risk.: Universal screening for suicide risk in 
primary care involves screening every patient who has a primary care visit regardless of 
presenting complaint. The pathway is initiated by asking the child the questions on the ASQ 
verbatim, which takes about 20 seconds on average to complete. The initial ASQ screening 
should be conducted early during the primary care visit, typically at the initial nursing 
assessment without the parent present in the room to ensure privacy. If the child answers 
“no” to all ASQ questions, the screening is complete, and no further intervention is needed. 
If the child answers “yes” to any of questions 1-4, this is considered a positive screen and 
prompts administration of the 5th question, which captures acuity of suicide risk. If the child 
answers “no” to question 5, this is considered a non-acute positive screen. These patients 
will require further assessment using the BSSA. Answering “yes” to question 5 indicates an

acute positive screen. In such instances, immediate arrangements should be made for a full 
mental health evaluation and safety precautions initiated.

Step 2: Brief Suicide Safety Assessment (BSSA).: The BSSA is designed to allow 
clinicians/providers to quickly (10-15 minutes) assess the level of suicide risk based on 
clinical judgement and determine if a more comprehensive mental health evaluation is 
needed. The BSSA should be conducted by a clinician/providers with appropriate training in 
suicide risk assessment.

Step 3: Developing a Disposition Plan.: After completing the BSSA, the clinician 
determines the next action steps which are categorized into one of three levels of risk and 
discusses these recommendations with the patients and parents or guardian.

1.

2.

3.

Low Risk: A low risk BSSA outcome indicates that no further evaluation 
is needed at this time. Depending upon the circumstances, some patients 
may benefit from a non-urgent mental health follow-up referral. For patients 
referred for mental health care, a safety plan should be created with the child 
and/or parent/guardian for potential future suicidal thoughts. The recommended 
standard of care would be to provide the patient and parent or guardian basic 
safety education (e.g., lethal means safe storage and removal), education about 
warning signs for suicide, and crisis resources.

Moderate Risk: Further evaluation is Needed. A moderate risk BSSA result 
indicates that further mental health evaluation is needed as soon as possible. 
If a mental health evaluation is not available within the primary care practice, 
the patient should be referred to an outpatient mental health specialty clinic or 
crisis intervention service. As part of the mental health evaluation, a safety plan 
should be developed with the patient and family and lethal means safe storage 
and removal should be discussed. Patients should also receive follow-up care 
within 72 hours of the initial visit for a safety check and to determine whether or 
not they were able to obtain a mental health appointment. Patients should also be 
given crisis resources such as the National Suicide Lifeline and the crisis text line 
upon discharge home.

Imminent Risk: Patients at imminent risk have acute suicidal thoughts and need 
an urgent full mental health evaluation. Safety precautions (e.g., keeping the 
patient under direct observation removing dangerous items) should be initiated 
within the primary care practice and the patient should be sent to the emergency 
department for a full mental health/safety evaluation. It should be noted that less 
than 1% of youth who present to primary care settings are at imminent risk for 
suicide.99

The Clinical Pathway: Follow-Up and Continuity of Care—Follow-up care both 
within and outside the primary care clinic is essential for patients who screen positive for 
suicide risk to ensure continuity of care and prevent future suicide behavior and suicide. As 
previously discussed (see section on follow-up and monitoring), caring contacts (including 
following up phone calls or texts within 72 hours of the initial visit) can be an effective

strategy for reducing suicidal behavior. Other linkage/bridging strategies such as contacting 
the outpatient mental health provider to provide a warm handoff can also help to ensure 
continuity of care.

Educating Pediatric Primary Care Providers in Suicide Prevention—Despite 
being at the forefront of suicide prevention, recent surveys suggest that PCPs often 
lack adequate training in suicide prevention and intervention strategies.101-103 Research 
highlights that properly training primary care doctors and nurses can significantly lower 
rates of suicide, non-fatal suicide attempts, and suicidal thoughts.70 This underscores the 
importance of expanding training opportunities for PCPs. It is essential that pediatric 
residency programs and continuing medical education events integrate curricula focused 
on assessing and managing youth suicide risk. These training opportunities should teach 
PCPs how to engage in validating, effective, and nonstigmatizing conversations with at-risk 
patients, utilize validated and evidence-based screening tools, and apply best practices such 
as safety planning and lethal means counseling.101 Additionally, training should cover how 
to connect patients with community resources to ensure continuous support.

Collaborative Care Models—Collaborative care models (CCMs) in primary care are 
increasingly recognized as effective approaches for addressing suicide risk, particularly due 
to their integrated, team-based nature that enhances the delivery of mental health care. 
Collaborative care models are comprehensive, system level interventions that restructure 
care delivery. These models optimize efficiency by connecting PCPs and patients with 
mental health specialists to enhance evidence-based treatment for mental health disorders.104 
Care managers play a vital role in coordinating interventions, supporting decision-making 
and communication between the patient and the PCP, monitoring mental health symptoms 
and medication use, and ensuring treatment adherence.104

Although no studies have evaluated the effectiveness of CCM on suicidal behaviors in 
pediatric populations, research on older adults has shown that CCMs can significantly 
reduce suicidal ideation and symptoms of depression.105,106 Additionally, several 
randomized controlled trials focusing on adolescents with depression in primary care 
settings have demonstrated the effectiveness of CCMs in decreasing depression and 
improving adherence to evidenced-base treatments.107-110

Conclusion

Suicide among youth represents a significant public health challenge, and primary care 
providers are crucial in addressing this issue. Key strategies for prevention in primary 
care include using validated tools for suicide risk screening, conducting comprehensive 
assessments, and implementing brief interventions like safety planning. Continuous follow-
up and monitoring are also essential. Additionally, CCMs have been shown to be effective 
in reducing suicidal ideation and attempts by integrating behavioral health services with 
primary care. The NIMH Clinical Pathway offers an innovative framework for incorporating 
these interventions, but the effectiveness of such strategies depends heavily on the training 
and preparedness of clinicians. By investing in comprehensive and ongoing training, the 
healthcare system can better equip primary care providers to manage this critical aspect

Key Points:

Youth suicide is a major public health concern.

Primary care practices are increasingly faced with addressing youth mental 
health concerns.

Evidence-based screening, assessment, and management strategies can aid 
pediatric primary care providers in youth suicide prevention efforts.

Enhanced residency and continuing medical education training opportunities 
can better equip pediatric primary care providers to manage suicide risk.

Future research is needed to evaluate the clinical pathway effectiveness in 
primary care settings.

Core Components and Comparisons of Two Safety Planning Approaches

Table 2.

Core
Component

Written Safety 
Plan Document

SPI

FISP

Similarities/Differences

Hierarchically arranged list of 
coping strategies. Participant and 
parent/caregiver (if applicable) 
receive copy of written safety plan

Collaboratively developed safety plan, 
including behavioral and cognitive 
coping strategies. Provides youth with 
concrete tools, including a “safety plan 
card” to support safety after discharge

In FISP, tied to youth’s 
individualized risk using 
“emotional thermometer” where 
youth identify feelings, triggers/
thoughts/behaviors

Individualized to 
Participant Risk

Identify personalized warning signs 
for an impending suicide crisis

Internal Coping 
Strategies

Determine internal coping strategies 
that distract from suicidal thoughts 
and urges

Engaging Support 
System

Identification of 
Mental Health 
Supports

Identify family and friends to 
distract from suicidal thoughts and 
urges; social places for interaction; 
individuals who can provide support 
during suicidal crisis

Develop a list mental health 
of professionals and urgent care 
services to contact during a suicidal 
crisis

Provide family and youth with effective 
way to conceptualize the hierarchy 
of suicide-related situations using an 
“emotional thermometer”

Identify coping strategies, such as 
distraction/ self-soothing techniques, 
helpful thoughts, and ideas for a hope 
kit

Develop a list of supportive individuals

Provide psychoeducation regarding 
the importance of youths receiving 
outpatient mental health treatment

Focus on 
Protective Factors

Meet any discussion of protective 
factors with enthusiasm and interest 
to underscore existing coping and 
supports

Highlight and reinforce strengths and 
protective factors in youth and family 
through discussion of positive attributes 
and interactions to enhance family 
support and communication

Lethal Means 
Restriction 
Counseling

Follow-up Phone 
Calls

Lethal means restriction counseling 
for making the environment safe

Lethal means restriction counseling for 
making the environment safe

Contacts made within 72 hours after 
discharge. Three components: 1) 
brief risk assessment/mood check; 
2) review and revision of SPI, 
if needed; and 3) facilitation 
of treatment engagement. Weekly 
follow-up phone calls concluding 
after 2 calls if patient attended 
at least one outpatient behavioral 
health appointment or no longer 
wished to be contacted.

Telephone contacts to enhance linkage 
to outpatient mental health care. First 
call made within the first 48 hours after 
ED or hospital discharge with additional 
contacts as needed (usually at 1, 2, 
and 4 weeks after discharge). Structured 
Phone calls, focused on enhancing 
motivation for seeking treatment, and 
providing referrals as needed to youths 
and families.

In FISP, distress tolerance skills 
taught in this process and family is 
included.

In FISP, hope kit developed

SPI includes discussion of friends/
family and place that can 
provide distraction, in addition 
to individuals who can provide 
support

SPI includes section on safety 
plan with specific services; FISP 
includes psychoeducation with 
youth and parents regarding 
importance of follow-up care

FISP specifically includes activity 
“positives” to elicit youth and 
family strengths

Similar in both SPI and FISP; 
conducted separately with parent/
caregiver and youth

SPI phone calls include brief 
assessment of risk and mood, as 
well as review of safety plan, and 
linking to care. FISP phone calls 
only focus on linking to care.
