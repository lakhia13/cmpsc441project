Imagine you're a researcher studying how sleep affects mood. To explore the connection, you would look at two key "variables": sleep (how much someone gets) and mood (how happy or irritable they feel). In psychology research, variables allow researchers to study certain pieces of information and determine if changes in one lead to changes in another.

Variables in psychology are things that can be changed or altered, such as characteristics or values. Variables are generally used in psychology experiments to determine if changes to one thing result in changes to another.

Variables in psychology play a critical role in the research process. By systematically changing some variables in an experiment and measuring what happens as a result, researchers can learn more about cause-and-effect relationships.

The two main types of psychological variables are the independent and dependent variables. Both variables are important in collecting data about psychological phenomena.


## Dependent and Independent Variables


Two of the most important variables you should learn about are an experiment's independent and dependent variables. Sometimes, these are fairly easy to identify, particularly if the experiment is quite simple. However, this task can become more difficult as the complexity of an experiment increases:

- Theindependent variableis the variable that is manipulated by the experimenter. An example of an independent variable in psychology: In an experiment on the impact of sleep deprivation on test performance, sleep deprivation would be the independent variable. The experimenters would have some of the study participants be sleep-deprived while others would be fully rested.

- Thedependent variableis the variable that is measured by the experimenter. In the previous example, the scores on the test performance measure would be the dependent variable.

So, how do you differentiate between the independent and dependent variables? Start by asking yourself what the experimenter is manipulating.

The things that change, either naturally or through direct manipulation from the experimenter, are generally the independent variables. What is being measured? The dependent variable is the one that the experimenter is measuring.


## Intervening Variables in Psychology


In the real world, variables often don't stand alone. In many cases, factors affect the main variables of interest.

Intervening variables, also sometimes called intermediate or mediator variables, are factors that influence the relationship between two other variables. For example, sleep problems in university students are often influenced by factors such asstress.

As a result, stress might be an intervening variable that influences how much sleep people get, which in turn may influence how well they perform on exams.


## Extraneous Variables in Psychology


Independent and dependent variables are not the only variables present in many experiments. In some cases, extraneous variables may also play a role.

This type of variable may impact the relationship between the independent and dependent variables.

For example, in our previous example of an experiment on the effects of sleep deprivation on test performance, other factors such as age, gender, and academic background may have an impact on the results. In such cases, the experimenter will note the values of these extraneous variables so any impact can be controlled for.

There are two basic types of extraneous variables:

- Participant variables: These extraneous variables are related to the individual characteristics of each study participant that may impact how they respond. These factors can include background differences, mood, anxiety,intelligence, awareness, and other characteristics that are unique to each person.

- Situational variables: These extraneous variables relate to things in the environment that may impact how each participant responds. For example, if a participant is taking a test in a chilly room, the temperature would be considered an extraneous variable. Some participants may not be affected by the cold, but others might be distracted or annoyed by the room's temperature.

Other extraneous variables include the following:

- Demand characteristics:Clues in the environment that suggest how a participant should behave

- Experimenter effects: When a researcher unintentionally suggests clues for how a participant should behave


## Controlled Variables in Psychology


In many cases, extraneous variables are controlled for by the experimenter. A controlled variable is one that is held constant throughout an experiment.

In the case of participant variables, the experiment might select participants that are the same in background and temperament to ensure that these factors don't interfere with the results. Holding these variables constant is important for an experiment because it allows researchers to be sure that all other variables remain the same across all conditions.

Using controlled variables means that when changes occur, the researchers can be sure that these changes are due to the manipulation of the independent variable and not caused by changes in other variables.

It is important to also note that a controlled variable is not the same thing as acontrol group. The control group in a study is the group of participants who do not receive the treatment or change in the independent variable.

All other variables between the control group andexperimental groupare held constant (i.e., they are controlled). The dependent variable being measured is then compared between the control group and experimental group to see what changes occurred because of the treatment.


## Confounding Variables in Psychology


If a variable cannot be controlled for, it becomes what is known as aconfounding variable. This type of variablecanhave an impact on the dependent variable, which can make it difficult to determine if the results are due to the influence of the independent variable, the confounding variable, or an interaction of the two.


## Operationalizing Variables in Psychology


An operational definition describes how the variables are measured and defined in the study.Beforeconducting a psychology experiment, it is essential to create firm operational definitions for both the independent variable and dependent variables.

For example, in our imaginary experiment on the effects of sleep deprivation on test performance, we would need to create very specific operational definitions for our two variables. If ourhypothesisis, "Students who are sleep deprived will score significantly lower on a test," then we would have a few different concepts to define:

- Students: First, what do we mean by "students?" In our example, let’s define students as participants enrolled in an introductory university-level psychology course.

- Sleep deprivation: Next, we need to operationally define the "sleep deprivation" variable. In our example, let’s say that sleep deprivation refers to those participants who have had less than five hours of sleep the night before the test.

- Test variable: Finally, we need to create an operational definition for the test variable. For this example, the test variable will be defined as a student’s score on a chapter exam in the introductory psychology course.

Once all the variables are operationalized, we're ready to conduct the experiment.

Variables play an important part in psychology research. Manipulating an independent variable and measuring the dependent variable allows researchers to determine if there is a cause-and-effect relationship between them.


### Frequently Asked Questions


- Which type of investigations typically include independent and dependent variables?Independent and dependent variables are used in experimental research. Unlike some other types of research (such ascorrelational studies), experiments allow researchers to evaluate cause-and-effect relationships between two variables.

- How do you determine the strength of a relationship between two variables?Researchers can use statistical analyses to determine the strength of a relationship between two variables in an experiment. Two of the most common ways to do this are to calculate a p-value or a correlation. The p-value indicates if the results are statistically significant while the correlation can indicate the strength of the relationship.

- What is an independent variable in cognitive psychology?Just as with other types of research, the independent variable in acognitive psychologystudy would be the variable that the researchers manipulate. The specific independent variable would vary depending on the specific study, but it might be focused on some aspect of thinking, memory, attention, language, or decision-making.
