Abstract

Background/Objectives: Gestalt therapy traditionally opposes categorical diagnostic la-
belling due to its fundamental inconsistency with phenomenological and process-oriented
ontology. However, this epistemological rigour can limit integration with structured
evidence-based interventions for complex personality organizations such as Borderline
Personality Disorder (BPD). Despite the evidence base for DBT and Schema Therapy in
treating BPD, these approaches may inadvertently minimize the lived phenomenological
experience and organismic wisdom central to recovery. Meanwhile, Gestalt therapy’s
anti-diagnostic stance limits its integration with structured evidence-based protocols. This
paper proposes a hybrid theoretical model that addresses this gap by integrating the clinical
epistemology of Gestalt therapy with Linehan’s biosocial theory of Dialectical Behaviour
Therapy (DBT) and schema-focused interventions, while preserving the core principles
of Gestalt. Methods: we present a model of theoretical integration that draws on Gestalt
contact theory, the four modules of DBT (mindfulness, distress tolerance, emotional reg-
ulation, interpersonal effectiveness) and the experiential techniques of Schema Therapy.
The integration focuses on the dialectic of acceptance and change, which mirrors Gestalt’s
paradoxical theory of change. The proposed framework preserves the non-protocol di-
mension of Gestalt therapy while incorporating the pragmatic utility of DBT and Schema
Therapy. Results: key conceptual contributions we propose include: (1) theorizing the
“Draft Self” as the object and subject of therapeutic work, (2) integrating mindfulness and
grounding as embodied processes within live Gestalt experiments, (3) activation techniques
to explore the identity fragmentation endemic to BPD. Conclusions:his integration offers
a coherent, embodied, and process-oriented framework for understanding and treating
BPD that validates patients’ lived experience, mobilizes evidence-based interventions, and
opens up meaningful intertheoretical dialogue.

1. Introduction

Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) affects approximately 1–2% of the general popu-
lation and is associated with substantial functional impairment, high rates of self-harm, and
significant healthcare utilization [add recent epidemiological reference]. While evidence-
based treatments such as Dialectical Behaviour Therapy (DBT) and Schema Therapy have
demonstrated efficacy in reducing suicidal behaviour and improving emotion regulation,
clinical outcomes remain heterogeneous, and many patients continue to experience identity
confusion and existential distress even after symptom reduction.

Current evidence-based approaches, while structured and effective, have been cri-
tiqued for potentially overlooking the phenomenological depth and organismic self-
regulation capacities emphasized in humanistic-experiential traditions.

The clinical Gestalt approach to borderline personality organization favours phe-
nomenological exploration over diagnostic categorisation [1]. Isadore From’s concept of the
“Draft Self”—a fragile and provisional construct that borderline individuals maintain in
order to preserve identity coherence amid internal fragmentation—provides a framework
for therapeutic engagement [2]. This “draft” represents not a fixed structure of the self but
a precarious gesture towards coherence in the face of overwhelming uncertainty.

Recent empirical research has provided a nuanced understanding of the complex etiol-
ogy of BPD. A large-scale study of 602 participants that examined dissociative experiences
and temperamental-characterological traits showed that dissociative symptoms had greater
predictive weight (89% significance) for the diagnosis of BPD than characterological traits
alone [3]. This finding reinforces clinical observations that many individuals with BPD
report histories of trauma, particularly sexual abuse [4].

However, trauma alone is insufficient to explain the development of BPD. Only indi-
viduals whose temperamental and characterological traits fall at certain extremes—such
as high harm avoidance and low self-direction and cooperativeness—appear particularly
vulnerable to translating traumatic stress into dissociative symptomatic patterns and iden-
tity disruption [5]. This complex interaction supports a model in which BPD emerges
from non-linear and recursive processes involving constitutional vulnerabilities, traumatic
environmental experiences, and dissociative coping mechanisms.

Network theories of psychopathology have argued that such disorders are not the
product of single causal pathways but dynamic constellations of symptoms that reinforce
each other over time [6]. Gestalt therapy responds to this complexity by cultivating
awareness of how dissociation [7], identity diffusion and relational turbulence manifest
themselves in the immediacy of contact.

This paper aims to: (1) develop a theoretically coherent integrative framework that
preserves Gestalt therapy’s phenomenological rigour while incorporating the structured
interventions of DBT and Schema Therapy; (2) articulate how the concept of the ‘Draft
Self’ can serve as a unifying clinical focus; (3) propose practical session structures and
therapeutic domains that operationalize this integration; and (4) identify the epistemic
challenges and training requirements inherent in such hybrid practice. We present this
as a conceptual model requiring future empirical validation rather than an established
treatment protocol.

2. Methods: Approach to Theoretical Integration

This paper presents a conceptual synthesis rather than empirical research. The inte-
grative framework was developed through: (1) systematic narrative review of theoretical
literature on Gestalt therapy, DBT, and Schema Therapy; (2) identification of conceptual
resonances and epistemological tensions between approaches; (3) clinical workshop discus-
sions conducted at the Puglia Gestalt Summer School 2025, where preliminary integration

Brain Sci. 2025, 15, 1109

3 of 16

strategies were explored with practicing clinicians; (4) iterative refinement based on case
consultation experiences within our training institute.

The session structures, therapeutic domains, and clinical illustrations presented rep-
resent theoretical proposals derived from this synthesis process, informed by clinical
observation but not systematically tested. These should be understood as hypothetical
frameworks requiring empirical validation through case studies, process research, and
eventually comparative outcome trials.

3. From Diagnostic Label to Process Field

Borderline Personality Disorder is characterized by pervasive emotional instability,
identity diffusion, impulsivity and patterns of interpersonal chaos. Kernberg’s influential
model conceptualizes these phenomena as arising from three fundamental intrapsychic
processes: identity diffusion, reliance on primitive defences (splitting and projective identi-
fication) and fluctuations in reality testing [8].

In Gestalt therapy, these patterns are reformulated as dynamic and observable disrup-
tions of contact and self-regulation: projection, confluence, retroflection, and deflection.
Diagnosis becomes a process rather than a label, monitoring real-time indicators that
include:

•
•
•

Dysregulated contact boundaries (over-merging or withdrawal);
Somatic signals of splitting: muscle rigidity, frozen gaze, shallow breathing;
Behaviours that interfere with therapy: chronic tardiness, sudden anger, seduction or
avoidance, seen as emerging field phenomena rather than resistance.

3.1. The Draft Self as a Therapeutic Focus

To preserve the draft of the Self, we can feel the therapeutic presence in contact with

others with this type of attitude towards the patient.

•

•

•

•

Clear boundaries: Therapists maintain their embodied individuality during relational
storms (“I am here and I am not consumed by your accusations”).
Curious engagement: Genuine interest in how the patient enacts the draft fosters trust
and co-presence.
Embodied exploration: Inviting patients to trace bodily sensations as they enact the
draft deepens contact with emerging individuality.
Affirmative moment-to-moment dialogue: This micro-process respects the function of
the draft, allowing subtle changes that suggest emerging integration.

The draft of the self thus becomes both the object and subject of therapeutic work:
object as what the patient presents; subject as living, emerging and transformable within
the field of contact.

3.2. Epistemological Reconciliation: Pragmatic Use of Diagnostic Categories

The integration proposed here requires explicit acknowledgment of an epistemological
tension: Gestalt therapy’s foundational rejection of categorical diagnosis appears incompat-
ible with the medical-model origins of DBT and Schema Therapy. However, we argue for a
pragmatic rather than ideological stance toward diagnostic frameworks.

We adopt the diagnostic category of BPD not as an ontological truth about the patient’s
being, but as a provisional organizational map—a shared language that facilitates commu-
nication with other clinical systems, insurance providers, and research communities. This
pragmatic instrumentalism allows us to interface with evidence-based protocols without
reifying the diagnosis as the patient’s essential nature.

In practice, this means: (1) using BPD criteria as initial phenomenological indicators
rather than fixed traits; (2) remaining vigilant against the pathologizing effects of diagnostic

Brain Sci. 2025, 15, 1109

4 of 16

language in the therapeutic relationship; (3) continuously returning attention to the lived,
emergent experience rather than diagnostic confirmation. The diagnosis serves as a starting
point for clinical conversation, not its endpoint. This approach resonates with critical
psychiatry perspectives that view diagnostic categories as socially constructed tools rather
than natural kinds.

4. Integration: Gestalt Therapy, DBT and Schema Therapy
4.1. Integration of Dialectical Behaviour Therapy (DBT)

Dialectical Behaviour Therapy (DBT), developed by Linehan, is one of the most
influential contemporary treatments for BPD, demonstrating significant reductions in
suicidal behaviour, hospitalisations and BPD symptoms [9,10]. Its conceptual core lies
in biosocial theory, which posits that chronic emotional dysregulation stems from the
interaction between biological vulnerabilities (increased limbic reactivity) and invalidating
environments that punish, trivialize, or ignore emotional expression.

Linehan has operationalised this model in a structured treatment with four primary

modules, each adaptable within a Gestalt framework:

Mindfulness: Learning to observe thoughts and emotions without judgement, bringing

attention back to the present moment.

Gestalt adaptation: Include guided body scans of 2–3 min in sessions to anchor

attention and raise awareness of physiological arousal.

Tolerance to suffering: Cultivate the ability to survive emotional crises without self-

harm or impulsivity.

Gestalt adaptation: Experiment with changes in temperature or position, body activa-
tions, changes in breathing, continuum of awareness and progressive relaxation practised
in session.

Emotional regulation: Increase understanding and modulation of emotional responses.
Gestalt adaptation: Map somatic triggers and emotional vulnerabilities with phe-
nomenological reformulations; create experiments to observe different emotions using
different media (artworks, books, music, etc.).

Interpersonal effectiveness: Develop assertive communication and the ability to

set boundaries.

Gestalt adaptation: Use chair work or group work to recognize the integration between

polarities: assertive vs. destructive aggression, empty vs. full, fear vs. excitement.

4.1.1. Integration of Schema Therapy

Schema Therapy, developed by Jeffrey Young [11], is a therapeutic approach that
combines evidence-based cognitive-behavioural techniques with elements of interpersonal,
experiential and psychodynamic therapies, specifically designed for the treatment of per-
sonality disorders and other complex issues. The principles of this approach concern
the following.

4.1.2. Early Maladaptive Schemas

Early maladaptive schemas are emotional, cognitive, and behavioural patterns that
arise at an early age when some of the basic emotional needs are chronically unmet by
parental figures. These patterns form during childhood and/or adolescence and manifest
themselves in adulthood as attitudes, thoughts or emotions that are dysfunctional in
relation to the situation experienced in the present.

We have summarized them in Table 1:

developed by the authors, integrating concepts from Spagnuolo Lobb’s ‘now-for-next’ framework [12]

Description

Gestalt Integration

1. Detachment and
rejection

Emotional
deprivation

The belief that
fundamental
emotional needs
cannot be met by
others.

Abandonment/
Instability

The expectation
that relationships
with others are
unstable and may
end.

Distrust/Abuse

The expectation
that others will
hurt, humiliate or
deceive us.

Social isolation

A feeling of not
belonging to any
community.

Inadequacy/
Shame

The belief that one
cannot be loved
because one is
imperfect, inferior,
or bad.

Contact boundary work: Explore how
deprivation schema manifests as retroflection
(turning needs inward, self-denial) or deflection
(minimizing or dismissing needs). Gestalt
experiments focus on articulating and voicing
needs directly in the present therapeutic
relationship, allowing the patient to experience
the possibility of contact rather than perpetual
deprivation. The therapist’s embodied presence
offers a corrective relational experience.
Draft Self preservation: Abandonment fears
reflect the fragility of the provisional “Draft Self”
that cannot sustain relational disruption without
existential collapse. The therapist’s consistent,
non-reactive presence—surviving the patient’s
relational storms without withdrawal—offers
lived evidence of relational continuity.
Experiments explore the phenomenology of
“staying” versus “leaving” through body
awareness and boundary work.
Projection and introjection work: Distrust often
involves projecting past abusive experiences onto
current relationships. Gestalt work focuses on
differentiating “then” from “now” through
phenomenological inquiry: “What are you
experiencing right herewith me?” The therapist
models transparency and authenticity, making the
therapeutic process visible and co-constructed,
thereby reducing projective distortions.
Field theory perspective: Social isolation is
reframed as disrupted organism-environment
contact. Rather than an internal deficit, it
represents a creative adjustment to environments
that failed to provide belonging. Gestalt group
work and experiments exploring “reaching out”
gestures can help patients experience moments of
authentic connection and membership in the
therapeutic community.
Shame as interrupted contact: Shame represents a
profound interruption of contact with self and
other. Gestalt work involves tracking the
embodied experience of shame (body posture,
gaze aversion, voice quality) and supporting
gradual exposure to being “seen” by the therapist
without withdrawal. The paradoxical theory of
change suggests that accepting shame (rather
than fighting it) creates space for transformation.

2. Reduced
autonomy

Bankruptcy/Failure

The belief that one
does not have
sufficient skills to
achieve results
similar to others.

Dependency/
Incompetence

A feeling of being
powerless and
unable to function
independently.

Vulnerability to
damage

Entanglement/
Enmeshment

3. Lack of rules

Entitlement/
Grandiosity

Insufficient
self-control/Self
discipline

The expectation
that the world is
full of dangers and
that we do not have
the resources to
deal with them.

Excessive
emotional
involvement in the
lives of one or more
loved ones, fusion
of identity.

Believing in one’s
own superiority,
having special
privileges or being
above the rules.

Recurring
difficulties with
self-control,
emotional
management, and
frustration
tolerance.

Organismic self-regulation: Reframe “failure” as
interrupted contact with innate competence and
wisdom. Gestalt experiments support small,
achievable autonomous choices in session,
validating emerging agency and resourcefulness.
The focus shifts from comparison with others to
reconnection with one’s own organismic capacity
for creative adjustment and problem-solving.
Support function development: Dependency
schemas involve confluence (over-merging with
others) and loss of the ego function (capacity to
make choices). Experiments focus on
micro-moments of independent decision-making:
“What do you want right now?” The therapist
supports differentiation while remaining
available, embodying the dialectic of autonomy
and connection.
Grounding and embodiment: Vulnerability to
harm involves chronic activation of survival
responses and disconnection from present safety.
Gestalt grounding techniques (feet on floor,
breath awareness, sensory orientation) help
patients experience present-moment safety.
Experiments explore “risk assessment in real
time”—differentiating actual from imagined
threat through phenomenological investigation.
Contact boundary clarification: Entanglement
represents confluence—the loss of boundary
between self and other. Gestalt boundary work
focuses on the phenomenological question:
“Where do I end and you begin?” Experiments
using spatial distance, voice differentiation, and
body awareness help patients experience their
own separateness while maintaining connection,
resolving the false dichotomy of fusion versus
isolation.

Deflection and narcissistic structure: Entitlement
can represent deflection from underlying shame
or fragility. Gestalt work involves gentle
confrontation through phenomenological
feedback: “I notice when I set a limit, you
respond as if rules don’t apply to you. What
happens in your body right now as I say this?”
The focus is on exploring the protective function
of grandiosity rather than moralizing.
Integration with DBT skills: Lack of
self-regulation is understood as impaired contact
with the Es function (impulses) and Ego function
(choice-making). Gestalt experiments incorporate
DBT distress tolerance skills—taught not as
behavioural control but as expanding the “space
between impulse and action.” The therapist
supports awareness of the exact
phenomenological moment when choice becomes
possible.

and emotional
inhibition

Emotional inhibition

Giving up one’s
desires, believing
that
the will of others
takes priority in
order to avoid
negative
consequences.

The belief that one
must constantly
satisfy
the needs of others
at the expense of
one’s own.

Basing self-esteem

A reduction in

Unrelenting

Hypercriticalness

The belief that
extremely high
standards must be
met in order to gain
approval.

Negativity/Pessimism

A view of life
focused on the
negative aspects, on
what can go wrong.

Retroflection and aggression work: Subjugation
involves retroflecting healthy aggression
(self-assertion) and maintaining confluence to avoid
conflict. Gestalt experiments invite the patient to
speak their truth in session, even if it conflicts with
the therapist’s suggestions. The therapist’s
non-defensive response demonstrates that healthy
assertion does not destroy relationships—challenging
the core schema assumption.
Reclaiming organismic needs: Self-sacrifice
represents chronic deflection from one’s own
needs and over-identification with caretaking
roles. Gestalt work focuses on the
phenomenological question: “What do you need
right now?” Experiments may involve role
reversals (e.g., chair work where the patient
receives care rather than gives it) to experientially
challenge the schema.
Validation from within: Approval-seeking reflects
interrupted contact with intrinsic self-validation.
Gestalt experiments explore the embodied
experience of self-approval: “Can you place your
hand on your heart and say ‘I see you’?” The
therapist models authentic appreciation (not
praise) and supports the patient in tracking
internal rather than external validation cues.

Expression experiments: Emotional inhibition
involves chronic retroflection (holding back
expression) and desensitization. Gestalt work
uses experiments in graduated emotional
expression—perhaps starting with naming
emotions, then using voice tone variation, then
full embodied expression. The therapist’s
capacity to receive and “survive” emotional
expression without rejection is therapeutic.
Perfectionism as top-dog/underdog split:
Perfectionism reflects an internal split between
the critical “top dog” (demanding perfection) and
the overwhelmed “underdog” (never good
enough). Gestalt chair work externalizes this split,
allowing dialogue between parts. The therapeutic
stance emphasizes “good enough” contact rather
than perfect performance, embodying the
paradoxical theory of change.
Figure/ground reversal: Pessimism involves
selective attention to negative figures while
positive experiences recede into background.
Gestalt experiments deliberately shift attention:
“What is going well in this moment?” or “Notice
three things in this room that bring you pleasure.”
This is not positive thinking but
phenomenological rebalancing of the perceptual
field.

Punitiveness

The belief that
people should be
severely punished
for their mistakes.

Introjection work: Punitiveness often represents
an introjected parental or cultural voice. Gestalt
work involves identifying and “chewing”
(critically examining) these harsh introjects:
“Whose voice is this?” Experiments may involve
speaking the punitive voice aloud, then
responding from an alternative, compassionate
perspective, creating internal dialogue rather
than monologue.

Empirical research on Schema Therapy has shown promising outcomes for BPD,
with studies indicating significant improvements in personality pathology and quality
of life. The experiential and relational components of Schema Therapy—particularly
Chairwork and limited reparenting—demonstrate convergence with Gestalt’s emphasis
on embodied contact and authentic therapeutic presence. Recent research suggests that
emotion regulation strategies shared across DBT and Schema Therapy may represent
common active ingredients [13], supporting the theoretical coherence of the integration
proposed here.

4.2. Coping Strategies

There are three coping strategies that individuals can employ:
Surrender: behaving as if there were no alternative to the pattern;
Hypercompensation: behaving as if the opposite of the pattern were true;
Avoidance: avoiding both thinking about and experiencing situations that trigger

the pattern.

4.3. Mode

A mode is a combination of various activated Early Maladaptive Schemas mixed
with coping strategies; the concept of mode describes the emotional-cognitive-behavioural
state in which the person finds themselves at a given moment. Functional modes promote
positive adaptation, while dysfunctional modes are characterized by strategies that can
culminate in states of distress, avoidance, or self-sabotaging behaviours.

In Gestalt work with patients with borderline personality disorder, the integration of
Schema Therapy concepts significantly enriches the phenomenological understanding of
the patient’s experience. Schema Therapy modalities find a natural correspondence with
the Gestalt concept of figure/background, where different configurations of the Self emerge
and recede in the phenomenological field depending on the contact activated.

Coping strategies—surrender, overcompensation, and avoidance—can be reinter-
preted as creative ways for the organism to adapt, which, in the therapeutic here-and-now,
manifest themselves through specific modes of contact or interruptions of contact itself.
The Gestalt therapist, supporting moment-to-moment awareness, accompanies the patient
in observing how these early patterns are actualized in the therapeutic relationship, not
to analyze them cognitively but to experience them phenomenologically. This integration
allows the anti-pathologizing approach of Gestalt to be maintained—recognizing patterns
as creative adaptations of the patient in invalidating environments—while using the con-
ceptualization of Schema Therapy to navigate the complexity of borderline configurations,
promoting the emergence of more functional modes through the experience of authentic
contact (Figure 1).

Figure 1. Conceptual Integration Model: Gestalt Therapy, DBT, and Schema Therapy for BPD.

In the experience of the tolerable novelty of the therapeutic encounter, one can play
with inventing new personal patterns, recognizing one’s own, modifying them, and tracing
their boundaries [14].

E.g., To do after grounding
Imagine entering a space that you recognize intimately. It is an environment that you feel is
yours, even if it does not always give you peace of mind. This place is very familiar to you. . . it
once offered you shelter, but now it seems to limit your movements. Perhaps it is the habit of always
having to appear invulnerable. . . or the tendency to put the needs of others before your own. Observe
this environment with curiosity. What colors characterize it? What atmosphere do you perceive?
Are there any elements that attract your attention? Presences? Paintings or photos on the walls?
Now, in front of you, a passageway appears. This passageway invites you outside this space. . .
toward an unexplored dimension. Move toward it calmly. . . Before crossing it, feel that you can
decide. . . Do you want to stay in this familiar environment, or do you want to experience, even
briefly, what it means to cross it?

You don’t need to have all the answers. It is enough to feel curiosity for something new. Cross

the threshold.

Beyond it, you feel a refreshing breeze, brightness, spaciousness. Perhaps there is a little fear,
but it is accompanied by a sense of openness. Keep in mind that you can always return to this
dimension whenever you wish.
The choice is yours.

5. Dialectical Interventions Between Acceptance and Change

If a patient says to the therapist:
“The moon is made of cheese,” and the therapist replies:
“The moon and cheese are both yellow,”
we are witnessing a hermeneutic and clinical revolution.
Giovanni Salonia

Brain Sci. 2025, 15, 1109

10 of 16

The paradoxical theory of Gestalt change and working with polarities naturally align
with the dialectic (dià-legein meaning “to speak through,” but also “to gather” + tèchne,
meaning “the art” of dialogue and bringing together) acceptance-change of DBT. Rather
than denying the patient’s experience, therapists reconnect with “AND” statements that
are perceptually verifiable and non-judgmental, keeping relational fields alive.

Examples of the application of this work include:
Integrating chairs as drafts of oneself: One chair expresses the punitive parental

schema while the other embodies the vulnerable child.

Dramaturgy: Applied in Gestalt therapy by guiding patients to reimagine painful

scenes and insert nurturing figures.

Research has shown how schema-focused imagery and DBT emotional regulation
strategies effectively adapt to emotional regulation patterns, illustrating their compatibility
with the embodied orientation of Gestalt [13].

6. Clinical Implementation
6.1. Session Structure and Process

The integrated approach maintains the non-protocol essence of Gestalt by incorporat-

ing structured elements:

6.1.1. Pre-Contact

Establish awareness of the present moment and assess your current emotional state
(look at the draft in the present moment with possible experiences of mindfulness, listening,
storytelling, drawing, writing, etc.) to create a shared here and now.

6.1.2. Start of Contact

Phenomenological tracking of emerging contact patterns, with particular attention to:

•
•
•

Fluctuations in boundaries.
Somatic indicators of dissociation or splitting.
Interpersonal enactments within the therapeutic relationship.

6.1.3. Full Contact

Recognize the domains [12] of the therapeutic relationship with a patient with BPD

and support the integration process (Table 2).

6.1.4. Post Contact

Support assimilation and discarding processes by emphasizing directionality (next).

6.2. Therapeutic Posture and Relationship

The therapist maintains a dual awareness:
Holding space for the Draft Self while containing phenomena at the process level.
To improve one’s therapeutic posture, the therapist’s embodied presence is the first
essential element, referring to the clinician’s ability to maintain their emotional and physical
grounding (countertransference) during the intense relational dynamics that characterize
working with emotionally dysregulated patients [15]. This stable presence provides a
safe container for the patient’s experience. The second component is phenomenological
curiosity, which directs therapeutic attention toward the how of the patient’s symptomatic
manifestations, rather than toward premature causal interpretations of the why. This shift
in focus allows for a more immediate and concrete understanding of the patient’s lived
experience. Finally, collaborative formulation is a mode of co-constructing meaning that
integrates neurobiological understanding with subjective experience. When patients ask
questions such as “Why am I so reactive?”, the therapist can respond with formulations
that acknowledge both individual biological sensitivity and environmental influences
on dysregulation, while simultaneously redirecting attention to the phenomenological
analysis of the present moment: “You are biologically sensitive and your environment
has not helped to regulate this—let’s explore how it manifests itself right here in our
interaction.” This integration of presence, phenomenological curiosity, and collaboration
allows the therapeutic process to be anchored in the immediacy of shared experience,
facilitating co-constructed regulation processes.

6.3. Training Requirements and Supervision Framework

The implementation of this integrative model requires substantial clinical competence
across three complex modalities, raising important questions about training pathways and
quality assurance.

6.3.1. Minimum Training Requirements

Therapists should possess: (1) foundational training in Gestalt therapy with supervised
clinical experience in contact boundary work and phenomenological tracking; (2) certified
training in DBT fundamentals, including the four skill modules and biosocial theory;
(3) basic familiarity with Schema Therapy concepts, particularly early maladaptive schemas
and experiential techniques.

6.3.2. Supervision Architecture

We recommend a developmental supervision model that includes:

(1) Phase 1
(6–12 months): Focus on maintaining Gestalt phenomenological stance while introduc-
Integration of
ing DBT skills in a structured manner; (2) Phase 2 (12–24 months):
schema-focused interventions with emphasis on avoiding cognitive over-interpretation; (3)
Phase 3 (ongoing): Advanced work on managing epistemological tensions and developing
flexible responsiveness.

Supervision should address not only technical integration but also the therapist’s ca-
pacity to hold multiple theoretical frameworks without rigidity. Group supervision formats
that include peer review of session recordings can support this developmental process.
Without adequate training infrastructure, there is risk of superficial eclecticism rather than
coherent integration—a concern we take seriously in proposing this demanding model.

7. Clinical Illustration: Managing Emotional Dysregulation in Session

The following composite vignette illustrates the integrated approach during a moment

of acute emotional dysregulation.

Context: Maria, a 28-year-old woman with BPD, arrives 15 min late, visibly agitated.
She immediately accuses the therapist of “not caring” because he didn’t respond to her
late-night text.

Phenomenological Tracking (Gestalt): The therapist notices Maria’s shallow, rapid
breathing, clenched fists, and averted gaze—somatic indicators of splitting and potential
dissociation.

Therapist intervention: “Maria, I notice your breathing is very quick right now, and
you’re holding your hands tightly. Can you feel that?” [Grounding in embodied awareness]

Maria: “I don’t care about breathing! You don’t care about me!”
Dialectical Response (DBT-informed): “I hear that you’re feeling abandoned right now,
and I want you to know I’m here with you now. Can we stay with what’s happening in
your body for just a moment?” [Validation + redirection to present moment]
Maria: [Breathing slows slightly] “I just. . . I felt so alone last night.”
Schema-Focused Exploration: “That feeling of being alone. . . where do you notice it
in your body right now?” [Maria places hand on chest] “Can you stay with that sensation?
What does it need?”

Maria: [tears forming] “It needs. . . to know someone is there.”
Gestalt Experiment: “I’m right here, Maria. Can you see me? I’m not looking away.
I’m here.” [Therapist maintains steady eye contact, embodying reliable presence] “What do
you notice as you look at me?”

Maria: “You’re. . . you’re still here.” [Integration moment: experiencing relational

continuity despite internal fragmentation]

Post-Contact Assimilation: “You came in feeling I didn’t care, and you just experienced

me staying present with you even when you were angry. What is that like for you?”

This brief sequence demonstrates: (1) immediate phenomenological attention to
somatic indicators; (2) dialectical validation without abandoning therapeutic structure;
(3) schema activation made visible through embodied exploration; (4) Gestalt contact work
that supports integration of the ‘Draft Self’ through lived relational experience.

8. Discussion
Theoretical Consistency

The integration of the biosocial theory of DBT, mindfulness, and dialectical work
between polarities significantly enriches the theoretical framework of Gestalt. Evidence
from recent meta-analyses supports the efficacy of both DBT and Schema Therapy in
reducing BPD symptomatology [16–18]. The biosocial lens of DBT, which places emo-
tional dysregulation at the intersection of innate sensitivity and invalidating environments,
finds phenomenological complementarity in Gestalt’s emphasis on moment-to-moment
awareness of lived experience.

This integrative process [19] accompanies observation and reorganization that is
tolerable for the patient and creates a minimalist relationship of contact with the therapist,
maintaining an optimal distance for both that prevents retraumatization. We hypothesize
that this integration may facilitate a conscious and dynamic outline of the “consequences
of love” that can lead to regulating emotional processes without completely identifying
with them, but observing them when they can modify the outline without destroying it.

From this perspective, the Self is no longer merely fragmented but becomes a form
of functioning in the environment and, consequently, in the relationship between patient
and therapist, in line with the Gestalt principle of Self theory, according to which the Self is

Brain Sci. 2025, 15, 1109

13 of 16

not a static entity but a dynamic process that emerges from the creative contact between
organism and environment and is articulated through three interconnected functions that
operate at different times: Es function—Represents the receptive dimension of experience,
characterized by a passive quality that concerns “what happens to us” beyond our conscious
will. Ego Function—Allows us to modulate the degree of openness or closure in contact,
deciding whether to accept, reject, or limit what emerges from experience. Personality
Function—Constitutes the internal representation of the self, deriving from the integration
of experiences lived throughout existence. It is the identity substrate that allows us to
recognize ourselves over time and to give continuity and meaning to our experiences.

We propose that borderline presentations may be particularly well-suited to Gestalt
therapy’s anti-neurotic epistemology, as symptoms can be understood as creative adapta-
tions rather than pathological deficits—though this theoretical affinity requires empirical
examination. Rather than pathologizing symptoms, they are recognized as creative adap-
tations of the organism to difficult situations. Integration with DBT tools does not aim to
eliminate “negative” emotions, but to develop a more fluid and conscious relationship with
the entire emotional spectrum.

As Greenberg points out, “changing emotions with emotions” [20], the therapeutic
process is not based on suppression or control, but on transformation through access to
more adaptive and authentic emotional resources. This principle resonates deeply with the
Gestalt approach of supporting organismic spontaneity and the intrinsic wisdom of the
self-regulation process [21].

9. Conclusions

This integrated approach is not limited to simply modulating emotional reactions, but
aspires to a deeper and ontologically significant transformation: the metamorphosis of the
unbridgeable void that characterizes the borderline experience into what Gestalt defines as
a “Fertile Void” [22].

While the pathological void of BPD is experienced as devastating absence, iden-
tity fragmentation, and existential horror vacui, the Fertile Void represents a potential
space for creativity, a field open to emerging possibilities [23], and a generative terrain for
self-realization [24]. Through the integration of biosocial validation, restructuring of mal-
adaptive schemas, and embodied presence in the here-and-now, the patient can gradually
experience this emptiness no longer as an abyss to be compulsively filled, but as a space for
conscious breathing, a creative pause between stimulus and response, a fertile silence from
which new gestalts of meaning can emerge.

This transmutation of emptiness—from an experience of annihilation to a therapeutic
resource—is perhaps the most distinctive contribution of this integrated model, offering
patients with BPD not only symptomatic stabilization but access to an existential dimension
of fullness paradoxically rooted in the conscious acceptance of their own inner space [25].

9.1. Practical Implications for Clinical Training and Practice

Beyond its theoretical contributions, this integrative framework offers several con-
crete implications for clinical training and supervision. Training programmes seeking
to implement this model should prioritize three developmental competencies: (1) Phe-
nomenological precision—the capacity to track moment-to-moment somatic and relational
indicators without premature interpretation; (2) Dialectical flexibility—the ability to hold vali-
dating and change-oriented stances simultaneously without collapsing into either pole; and
(3) Epistemological humility—recognizing when to employ structured interventions versus
when to trust organismic process.

Supervision architectures should incorporate video-modelling, live session obser-
vation or recording review to identify moments where therapists default to cognitive
interpretation rather than embodied exploration, or conversely, where phenomenological
tracking could benefit from structured DBT skill application. Peer consultation groups us-
ing the five therapeutic domains (Table 2) as reflective frameworks can support clinicians in
recognizing their characteristic response patterns with borderline presentations—whether
tending toward over-containment or under-structure.

For practicing clinicians trained primarily in one modality, we recommend gradual
integration rather than wholesale adoption: DBT-trained therapists might begin by in-
corporating 2–3 min grounding experiments before skills coaching; Gestalt practitioners
might systematically introduce distress tolerance psychoeducation while maintaining phe-
nomenological stance; Schema therapists could emphasize embodied awareness during
Chairwork rather than exclusively cognitive processing. The integration succeeds not
through theoretical mastery but through lived experimentation within one’s existing clini-
cal competence, allowing the model to emerge organically from practice rather than being
imposed as protocol.

9.2. Limitations

This framework carries important limitations. First, as a theoretical synthesis with-
out empirical testing, claims about therapeutic efficacy remain speculative. Second, the
integration assumes high therapist competence across multiple modalities, which may
limit real-world applicability. Third, we have not addressed how this model adapts across
diverse cultural contexts or comorbid presentations (e.g., BPD with substance use disorders
or psychotic features).

Fourth, the epistemological tensions between approaches—particularly Gestalt’s anti-
pathologizing stance and the medical-model origins of DBT/Schema Therapy—are man-
aged pragmatically here but may prove more intractable in practice. Finally, the heavy
reliance on Gestalt-oriented literature may limit the model’s accessibility to clinicians
trained primarily in cognitive-behavioural traditions. These limitations underscore the
preliminary nature of this proposal.

9.3. Future Direction

This theoretical framework opens several promising avenues for development. First,
empirical validation through systematic case studies and eventually randomized con-
trolled trials comparing this integrated approach with standard DBT or Schema Therapy
would provide crucial evidence for its clinical efficacy. Process research examining specific
mechanisms—such as how embodied Gestalt experiments facilitate schema change, or how
phenomenological tracking enhances emotional regulation—could illuminate the active
ingredients of integration.

Second, the development of structured training programmes and treatment fidelity
measures would support wider dissemination while maintaining theoretical coherence.
Third, exploration of how this model adapts across cultural contexts and diverse clinical
presentations beyond classic BPD would test its flexibility and generalizability.

Finally, theoretical dialogue with emerging frameworks such as the Power Threat
Meaning Framework and neuroscience-informed psychotherapy could further enrich this
integrative paradigm. We view this paper as an invitation to such collaborative inquiry
rather than a definitive statement.

9.4. Methodological Considerations for Empirical Validation

Several research designs could systematically test this integrative framework.

Brain Sci. 2025, 15, 1109

15 of 16

Single-case experimental designs (SCEDs) using multiple baseline or alternating treat-
ment formats would allow fine-grained examination of how specific integration elements
(e.g., embodied grounding before DBT skills training) impact measurable outcomes such as
dissociative symptoms or emotional dysregulation episodes. These designs preserve the
idiographic, process-oriented nature of Gestalt work while providing experimental rigour.
Qualitative phenomenological studies employing Interpretative Phenomenological
Analysis (IPA) or grounded theory could explore how patients with BPD experience the
integration—particularly whether the dialectical stance and embodied focus address the
existential dimensions (identity coherence, Fertile Void transformation) that quantitative
symptom measures may overlook. Interviews focusing on patients’ lived experience of the
“Draft Self” concept and its therapeutic utility would illuminate whether this theoretical
construct resonates with subjective phenomenology.

Dismantling studies comparing standard DBT, standard Gestalt therapy, and the
integrated model across matched samples could identify whether the integration produces
additive or synergistic effects. Process measures tracking therapeutic alliance rupture-repair
sequences, use of contact boundary language, and frequency of embodied experiments
versus cognitive interventions would illuminate mechanisms of change.

Finally, task analysis methodologies—microanalytic examination of session tran-
scripts identifying “change events”—could map the exact sequencing of interventions
(e.g., phenomenological tracking → validation → schema identification → embodied ex-
periment) that facilitate integration moments. This approach aligns with both Gestalt’s
process-orientation and contemporary psychotherapy research emphases on mechanisms
rather than manualized protocols.
