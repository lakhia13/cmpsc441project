The  COVID-19  pandemic  of  2020  is  a  major  global 
health challenge. At the time of writing, over 11.6 million 
people around the world had been registered as infected 
and  538,000  had  died  (Worldometers,  2020,  accessed 
July  7,  2020).  Public  health  responses  to  COVID-19 
need to balance direct efforts to control the disease and 
its  impact  on  health  systems,  infected  people,  and  their 
families with the impacts from associated mitigating in-
terventions. Such impacts include social isolation, school 
closure, health service disruption stemming from recon-
figuring health systems, and diminished economic activ-
ity.  The  primary  focus  of  both  the  United  Nations  (UN) 
and the World Health Organization (WHO) has been on 
addressing COVID-19 as a physical health crisis, but the 
need  to  strengthen  mental  health  action,  including  sui-
cide prevention, is increasingly recognized, as is the need 
for  mental  health  research  to  be  an  integral  part  of  the 
recovery plan (UN, 2020a). The impacts of the pandem-
ic  on  physical  and  mental  health  will  unfold  differently 
over  time  and  will  vary  depending  on  the  duration  and 
fluctuating  intensity  of  the  disease.  Research  is  needed 

to help ensure that decision-making regarding all aspects 
of health, including mental health (Holmes et al., 2020), 
is informed by the best quality data at each stage of the 
pandemic.

The pandemic poses a prolonged and unique challenge 
to  public  mental  health,  with  major  implications  for  sui-
cide and suicide prevention (Gunnell et al., 2020; Reger, 
Stanley,  &  Joiner,  2020).  A  rise  in  suicide  deaths  in  the 
wake of the pandemic is not inevitable. There is consensus, 
however, that the mitigation of risk will be contingent upon 
a proactive and effective response involving collaborative 
work between the state, NGOs, academia, and local gov-
ernments and coordinated leadership across government 
ministries,  including  health,  education,  security,  social 
services, welfare, and finance. Countries have responded 
in  different  ways  to  the  pandemic,  effectively  creating  a 
series  of  natural  experiments.  Thus,  regions  of  the  world 
affected  later  in  the  pandemic  can  draw  on  lessons  from 
countries,  such  as  China  and  Italy,  affected  in  its  early 
phase.  Likewise,  lessons  learned  early  in  the  pandemic 
(e.g.,  on  the  impact  of  lockdown  and  physical  distancing

measures) can be used to inform responses to any future 
surges in the incidence of COVID-19.

Although  there  are  important  parallels  between  coun-
tries  in  the  course  of  the  pandemic,  some  stressors,  re-
sponses,  and  priorities  are  likely  to  differ  between  high- 
and  low–middle-income  countries  and  between  cultures 
and  regions.  As  COVID-19  appears  to  be  disproportion-
ately affecting Black, Asian, and minority ethnic communi-
ties, the response – and suicide prevention research carried 
out to inform the response – needs to be sufficiently granu-
lar and account for the complexity of risks in these groups 
(O’Connor et al., 2020).

Throughout this editorial, when we refer to suicide and 
suicidal behavior, we mean to include both fatal and nonfa-
tal suicidal behaviors and self-harm.

The Need for Evidence-Based 
 Suicide Prevention Responses 

Suicide  is  the  most  extreme  outcome  of  a  mental  health 
crisis and should therefore be a key priority in any broad-
er mental health response to the pandemic (Gunnell et al., 
2020;  Reger  et  al.,  2020).  Suicide  prevention  responses 
need to be informed by research that is as specific as possi-
ble to the current situation and takes account of the many 
mechanisms that have an impact on suicide, as they may 
vary  during  the  different  phases  of  the  pandemic.  At  the 
same time, given the risks involved, strategic development 
of policy and implementation responses cannot wait until 
all  aspects  of  the  epidemiology  and  consequences  of  the 
disease  on  mental  health  and  risk  of  suicide  are  under-
stood. 

The dilemma here is that few studies have investigated 
the impact of previous pandemics – or even epidemics – on 
suicide (Cheung, Chau, & Yip, 2008; Wasserman, 1992; 
Zortea et al., 2020), and none has evaluated suicide pre-
vention measures in the current context. An analysis of the 
impact  of  the  Spanish  Flu  epidemic  (1918–1920)  in  the 
United States indicated that it resulted in a small rise in su-
icides (Wasserman, 1992). Cheung and colleagues (2008) 
reported  a  rise  in  suicide  among  older  people  during  the 
2003 SARS epidemic in Hong Kong. Similarly, what can be 
learned  from  other  types  of  public  health  emergencies  is 
limited. Much of the related research comes from one-off 
events, such as terrorist attacks and natural disasters (e.g., 
earthquakes). Findings from such events might not be ap-
plicable to the current situation (Devitt, 2020).

Early Research Findings Relevant 
to Assessing the Impact of  
COVID-19 on Mental Health 

Early  publications  relevant  to  the  COVID-19  response 
have largely come from literature reviews, small selective 
surveys  or  case  reports,  often  using  indirect  measures  of 
suicide  risk  or  from  modeling  approaches  to  predict  the 
impact of the pandemic. These have addressed issues such 
as the impact of quarantine (Brooks et al, 2020), highlight-
ed possible high-risk groups (Yao, Chen, & Xu, 2020), and 
assessed  mental  health  service  disruption  (Royal  College 
of Psychiatrists, 2020). 

Physical  distancing  and  related  measures,  which  have 
been at the forefront of the public health response, carry a 
strong risk of increasing isolation, particularly in vulnera-
ble populations such as older people and people who have 
been bereaved (Brooks et al., 2020; De Leo & Trabucchi, 
2020; Wand, Zhong, Chiu, Draper, & De Leo, 2020; Yip & 
Chau, 2020). Physical distancing measures may also lead 
to increases in household stress levels, domestic violence, 
and  alcohol  misuse  and  affect  the  accessibility  of  mental 
health  services  (Brooks  et  al.,  2020;  Reger  et  al.,  2020). 
The stresses of lockdown may be worse in low- and mid-
dle-income countries where extended families tend to live 
together with limited housing space. 

Concerns  have  been  expressed  about  increases  in  de-
mand  for  psychiatric  emergency  care  (Royal  College 
of  Psychiatrists,  2020).  In  the  context  of  overwhelmed 
health-care  systems  and  shortages  of  resources  to  treat 
people with COVID-19 in healthcare settings, qualitative 
findings from China indicate that the intensity of work dur-
ing  the  pandemic  drained  health-care  workers  physically 
and emotionally (Liu et al., 2020). In the United Kingdom, 
the British Medical Association well-being support servic-
es have seen a 40% increase in use after the onset of the 
pandemic (Torjesen, 2020). 

Positive  effects  of  the  pandemic  on  the  public,  such  as 
increased  prosocial  behavior  (e.g.,  donating  and  volun-
teering)  and  the  strengthening  of  community  ties,  may 
help  to  mitigate  detrimental  impacts  of  physical  distanc-
ing (Van Bavel et al., 2020). The move of some health and 
third-sector  services  into  online  settings  may  also  have 
long-lasting  benefits  in  improving  service  accessibility, 
particularly to those who find face-to-face consultation dif-
ficult. The effect on people with mental illness of replacing 
face-to-face treatment with remote delivery of care, how-
ever,  remains  unclear.  Moreover,  in  low-  and  middle-in-
come countries the technology to support remote assess-
ment is limited (De Sousa, Mohandas, & Javed, 2020; UN, 
2020a). In these, and other settings, where there is limited

peer support becomes extremely important. 

The potential for the COVID-19 virus to affect the brain 
and  to  cause  long-lasting  physical  morbidity  means  it 
might  become  relevant  as  a  risk  factor  for  mental  illness 
and suicide in the future (Holmes et al., 2020; Rogers et al., 
2020; Wu et al. 2020). Review findings indicate that the 
incidence of psychosis, a major risk factor for suicide and 
suicidal behavior, appeared to be high in people following 
SARS,  MERS,  and  H1N1  infection  (Rogers  et  al.,  2020). 
Given emerging evidence that the virus can have severe ef-
fects on different organ systems including kidney and liver 
function (Zhang, Shi, & Wang, 2020), the physical conse-
quences of infections might include a prolonged reduction 
in  functional  capacity  and  disability  in  some  patients,  all 
of which might have potential implications for suicide risk 
and prevention. 

However,  longer-term  risks  for  suicide  are  likely  most 
closely related to the economic consequences of the pan-
demic, including financial strain and unemployment. In a 
study based on suicide data from 54 countries, the reces-
sion  of  2008  was  associated  with  a  3.3%  increase  in  su-
icides  in  men  (but  not  women)  in  the  following  year  and 
more  prolonged  increases  in  several  countries  (Chang, 
Stuckler,  Yip,  &  Gunnell,  2013).  The  increase  varied  de-
pending  on  the  regional  depth  of  the  recession  and  the 
specifics of the social insurance systems (e.g., regulations 
for  unemployment  benefits  or  payed  sick  leave;  Chang 
et al., 2013; Norström & Grönqvist, 2015). The economic 
downturn  associated  with  the  COVID-19  pandemic  may 
be more rapid in onset than the 2008 recession and may 
push an estimated 500 million people, particularly in low- 
and middle-income countries, below the poverty line (UN, 
2020b).  

Early Research Findings Relevant 
to Assessing the Impact of COVID-19 
on Suicide and Suicidal Behavior 

There  is,  as  yet,  no  direct  evidence  of  the  impact  of  the 
pandemic  on  suicidal  behavior.  While  a  number  of  news 
stories  from  Japan,  New  Zealand,  and  Germany  report  a 
decrease in suicides in the period around the time of lock-
down (Deutsche Welle, 2020; New Zealand Herald, 2020; 
The  Guardian,  2020),  these  are  all  based  on  preliminary 
data/anecdotal  reports  and  unsubstantiated  by  peer-re-
viewed  publications.  General  population  survey  findings 
from  the  United  Kingdom  have  shown  no  clear  evidence 
of a rise in reported self-harm during the weeks following 
lockdown (after March 23), but no pre-lockdown data are 

323

available (Fancourt, Bu, Mak, & Steptoe, 2020). Many sur-
veys  have  been  carried  out  in  the  wake  of  the  pandemic, 
these  often  use  convenience  samples,  which  are  prone 
to  selection  bias  (Pierce  et  al.,  2020).  In  addition,  there 
have been multiple case reports from some low- and mid-
dle-income  countries  highlighting  occurrences  of  suicide 
thought to be related to COVID-19 (De Sousa et al., 2020; 
Mamun & Ullah, 2020). These reports must, however, be 
interpreted  with  great  caution  –  and  even  more  so  when 
they are based on mass media reports, which are unlikely 
to have been validated.   

Some researchers have attempted to model the possible 
pandemic-associated increase in suicides, largely based on 
predicted rises in unemployment (Kawohl & Nordt, 2020; 
McIntyre & Lee, 2020; Moser, Glaus, Frangou, & Schech-
ter, 2020). Risk estimates vary widely, from a 1% increase 
in global suicides (Kawohl & Nordt, 2020) to a doubling of 
national suicides in a Swiss study, using prison incarceration 
as a questionable proxy for modeling the social distancing 
effects of lockdown (Moser et al., 2020). These discrepan-
cies are partly due to differences in modeling assumptions, 
which  are  associated  with  considerable  uncertainty  and 
may be very misleading. Given the uncertainty of the base-
line assumptions about how events will unfold, the results 
of these tentative projections can at best provide a guide as 
to where action should be directed but are largely unhelpful 
for accurate quantifications of future suicidal behavior and 
suicide.

  In  this  regard,  access  to  real-time  suicide  mortality 
data is a key priority (Gunnell et al., 2020). Further, active 
surveillance  systems  for  suicide  attempts  are  warranted 
(WHO, 2016).

In  the  absence  of  direct  evidence  about  trends  in  su-
icide,  some  researchers  have  used  search  behavior  on 
Google Trends for terms related to suicide, as a proxy for 
suicide  risk  (Knipe,  Evans,  Marchant,  Gunnell,  &  John, 
2020; Sinyor, Spittal, & Niederkrotenthaler, 2020). Their 
findings indicate that, although relative search volumes for 
financial and work-related concerns have increased (Knipe 
et al., 2020), searches for suicide and suicide methods have 
not (Knipe et al, 2020; Sinyor et al., 2020). The potential 
limitations of Google search data for surveillance are well 
recognized and include uncertainty about the algorithms 
used and issues with the stability of findings provided by 
Google  Trends,  as  well  of  inconsistent  associations  with 
suicide (Tran et al., 2017).

Gaps  in  knowledge  about  the  epidemiology  of  suicide 
and suicidal behavior during COVID-19 and the effective-
ness  of  intervention  and  prevention  measures  underline 
the  need  for  a  strategic  approach  to  suicide  research  and 
prevention  at  a  global  level.  The  uncertainties  regarding 
the  direct  and  indirect  effects  of  COVID-19  on  suicide 
can only be addressed with good-quality tailored research.

Furthermore, suicide prevention in the age of COVID-19 
needs  to  build  on  what  we  know  about  the  effectiveness 
of various measures, but also needs to take account of the 
unique challenges posed by the situation in order to devel-
op novel approaches. Our knowledge is currently still very 
limited and building the evidence base on suicide preven-
tion is crucial. 

Research Considerations  
During COVID-19 

There are several considerations in relation to suicide pre-
vention  research  carried  out  during  crisis  situations  and 
in  the  present  global  pandemic  (Table  1).  These  include 
ensuring the safety of research participants and research-
ers  as  well  as  the  need  for  research  to  focus  on  low-  and 
middle-income settings as well as high-income countries, 
keeping  in  mind  that  findings  from  one  setting  may  not 
generalize to another. We expand on a few specific issues in 
the following section. First, the limited research conduct-
ed thus far on suicide and its prevention during COVID-19 
has focused mostly on high-income countries. While com-
plementary  research  in  this  area  in  low-  and  middle-in-
come  countries  should  be  prioritized,  the  poor  quality  of 
routine mortality and hospital attendance data as well as 
the  limited  availability  of  resources  to  carry  out  research 

in many of these settings present very real challenges. In 
2014 the WHO considered that only just over one third of 
member states had good-quality suicide registration data, 
and such data were largely absent in low- and middle-in-
come countries (WHO, 2014). The establishment of senti-
nel sites to gather as accurate data on suicidal behavior as 
possible  to  supplement  those  that  already  exist  would  be 
one way forward (WHO, 2016). 

Second, as a result of the pandemic, mental health ser-
vices have had to develop new ways of working to deliver 
care to suicidal individuals, including new care pathways, 
the  mass  roll-out  of  remote  consultation,  and  increased 
use  of  digital  interventions.  These  new  ways  of  working 
require  real-time  evaluation  and  ongoing  adaptation  in 
response  to  findings.  Traditional  evaluation  approaches, 
such  as  randomized  trials,  may  need  to  be  adapted  in  a 
manner  that  is  still  consistent  with  making  robust  infer-
ences about their effectiveness.

Third,  with  school  and  university  closures  in  place  in 
a  number  of  countries,  the  traditional  setting  for  carry-
ing out research into children and young people’s health 
is no longer available. Given current concerns about the 
impact of the pandemic on young people, mental health 
researchers will need to find alternative routes to study-
ing the impact of the pandemic on this potentially vulner-
able group. 

Fourth, for all studies it is vital that those with lived ex-
perience of suicide are involved in shaping the research at 
all stages – from developing the research questions to data 

Table 1. Considerations for suicide and suicidal behavior research during the COVID-19 pandemic

Research considerations

The COVID-19 suicide research response should be truly multidisciplinary. This will foster research that addresses the different aspects and 
layers of risk and resilience relating to the health consequences of COVID-19, including suicide and suicidal behavior. It will also foster research 
that informs prevention efforts by taking a range of perspectives.

People with lived experience of suicide should be involved at all stages of the research process.

Researchers should ensure that key risk groups that are often under-represented in suicide research are represented appropriately in studies.

The safety and well-being of participants should remain at the forefront of research design considerations.

Researchers’ safety must not be compromised if they are carrying out field work in situations where they may be at increased risk of infection.

Researchers should embrace Open Science research practices, such as registering research questions in advance and sharing data, wherever 
possible.

To ensure research findings inform practice, researchers should consider the potential real-world impact of their studies during the design 
phase and develop a clear, a priori dissemination strategy.

Research findings, particularly those making bold statements about risk or about effective treatments, should be peer reviewed prior to 
dissemination. If researchers decide that early dissemination is warranted, outputs should clearly state the preliminary status of the research 
and that it is yet to be peer reviewed. In this case, conclusions should be stated cautiously, in a manner that is consistent with the preliminary 
nature of findings.

When talking about research findings with the media, researchers should remain vigilant about not increasing risk for people who are already 
vulnerable. They should take care not to contribute to sensationalist headlines, should not make monocausal attributions of suicide to 
COVID-19, and should not use stigmatizing language (e.g., COVID-19 suicides). Researchers should recommend that media professionals use 
COVID-19-specific media reporting guidelines (see IASP, 2020b).

Research teams should be supported, particularly because some team members will be working in difficult home circumstances and many will 
be personally affected by concerns about the pandemic and its consequences.

search needs to comply with ethical standards. Research-
ers who do not normally work in the area of mental health 
and suicide prevention but who are now shaping conversa-
tions on suicide prevention need to obtain necessary train-
ing and background information on how to conduct suicide 
research, including the need to follow established research 
protocols and safety considerations that are specific to the 
field (Townsend, Nielsen, Allister, & Cassidy, 2020). Sixth, 
it is important that research resources (i.e., staff, funding) 
are  rapidly  mobilized  to  ensure  timely  research  evidence 
is available. However, this presents tensions between the 
time  researchers  have  available  to  write  robust  funding 
applications,  time-scales  for  the  grant  review  by  fund-
ing bodies, and, if funded, the availability of high-quality 
fieldworkers and analysts as these are likely to be already 
committed to other projects. Flexibility and clear commu-
nication  with  funders  about  project  delays  and  re-alloca-
tion of resources should help ameliorate these challenges. 
There is a distinct possibility that research funding may be 
adversely affected by a post-pandemic recession. Seventh, 
any proposed research should have a clear pathway to im-
pact to ensure that clinicians and policy-makers can imple-
ment the findings of research in their work.

Lastly, traditional models of research publication, with 
the need for peer review, introduce delays between article 
submission  and  on-line  publication,  reducing  the  speed 
with  which  evidence  is  disseminated  and  recommenda-
tions  implemented.  One  solution  is  the  fast-track  review 
processes for selected papers – these were already in place 
before  COVID-19,  but  have  been  extended  and  adopted 
by more journals since the beginning of the outbreak. An-
other solution is open science publication models that in-
volve on-line publication of articles while they await peer 
review, although there is a danger of low-quality research 
findings  being  disseminated  and  acted  upon  precipitous-
ly, without scrutiny of their validity (Armstrong, 2020). In 
order to mitigate this risk, researchers need to label their 
findings as preliminary and implement a communications 
strategy that addresses the preliminary nature of findings. 

The International COVID-19 Suicide 
Prevention Research Collaboration 

High-quality timely research to understand the suicide-re-
lated  consequences  of  COVID-19  and  to  determine  how 
best to mitigate the risk stemming from these consequenc-
es is now needed. The UN highlights the need for “rapid 
knowledge  acquisition,”  establishing  research  priorities, 
coordinating  research  efforts,  open-data  sharing,  and 
funding (UN, 2020a). In response to widespread concerns 

325

about  the  impact  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic  on  suicide 
and suicidal behavior, a group, initially consisting of 44 su-
icide prevention researchers and leaders of suicide preven-
tion  charities  from  around  20  countries,  came  together  to 
pool their expertise about the likely impact of the pandemic 
on  suicidal  behavior  and  to  identify  prevention  priorities. 
The International COVID-19 Suicide Prevention Research 
Collaboration (ICSPRC) sought to include at least one repre-
sentative from many of the most affected countries and also 
representation from high-, middle-, and low-income coun-
tries  (https://www.iasp.info/COVID-19_suicide_research.
php).  The  ICSPRC  assessment  of  the  risks  posed  by  the 
pandemic and suggested responses to mitigate these were 
summarized in a Lancet Psychiatry commentary published 
in April 2020 (Gunnell et al., 2020). 

Building on this initiative, the collaborative network has 
been extended to include suicide researchers from a wider 
range of countries (including countries in Africa, the Mid-
dle East, and South America), with skills ranging from pop-
ulation  health  to  biological  psychiatry  and  incorporating 
expertise in quantitative and qualitative methods, together 
with ethics. The objectives of the group are to:
a)  Share  early  findings  (and,  where  appropriate,  data)  on 
the impact of the pandemic, and the public health meas-
ures (e.g., physical distancing) to contain its spread, on 
suicidal behavior in participants’ countries  and to pro-
vide timely policy advice to those in other countries.
b)  Facilitate collaboration/avoid duplication through shar-
ing  information  about  ongoing  research  studies  and 
COVID-19  research  tools/questionnaires  focused  on 
suicide prevention, as well as advice about study design.  
c)  Harmonize  data  collection  approaches  to  facilitate 
pooling of data, where possible, from different settings 
and contexts.

An early example of the success of this approach has been 
the collaboration between two groups working on almost 
identical  systematic  reviews  investigating  the  impact  of 
pandemics/epidemics  on  suicide,  self-harm,  and  suicidal 
ideation  (Zortea  et  al.,  2020).  Another  group  has  estab-
lished real-time surveillance of the emerging literature on 
 COVID-19 and suicide to become a “living review” (John 
et  al.,  2020).  The  global  distribution  of  group  members 
will facilitate rapid combined efforts in response to fund-
ing  opportunities,  where  cross-national  studies  would 
strengthen the evidence base. 

Conducting  high  quality  suicide  prevention  research 
is challenging. Suicide, in population terms, is a low-inci-
dence event and thus studies are often under-powered to 
identify  small  but  potentially  important  effects.  Further-
more,  a  focus  on  intermediate  or  proxy  outcomes  (e.g., 
self-reported suicidal ideation) is sometimes necessary but 
these  have  a  questionable  relationship  to  suicidal  behav-

What is the impact of the pandemic on suicide and suicidal behavior and does risk differ over its course and in its aftermath?

Are there underlying country- or region-level differences that may explain differing changes in rates of suicide and suicidal be-
havior? For example, do the background rates of suicide and suicidal behavior seem to have a bearing on any increases? What 
about the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths, the capacity of the health-care system, and the pandemic response? Are any 
observed relationships the same for low- and middle-income countries as they are for high-income countries?

Does any change in the incidence of suicide and suicidal behavior vary by population subgroup? For example, is there vari-
ation by demographic factors (e.g., age, gender, ethnicity, religious affiliation), household structure (e.g., living alone, living 
with children, living with joint/extended families), socioeconomic factors (e.g., socioeconomic status, job loss, financial 
strain, debt, access to resources, occupation)?

Risk, protective, and new individual-level factors

Risk factors

Protective 
factors

New factors

Are there recognized risk factors for suicide and suicidal behavior that are heightened during the pandemic that might 
 explain any increases? For example, how do any changes in suicide and suicidal behavior relate to changes in levels of 
anxiety, depression, alcohol use, or feelings of entrapment that might be increased by isolation, loneliness, uncertainty, 
domestic violence, economic hardship, and reduced social participation?

Are there recognized protective factors for suicide and suicidal behavior that might be bolstered during the pandemic and 
potentially keep rates of suicide and suicidal behavior from increasing? For example, if communities rally around and pro-
vide support for those who might be vulnerable, does this have a positive impact?

Are there new risk or protective factors for suicide and suicidal behavior that correspond to the emergence of the pandem-
ic? Are there risk or protective factors that have been exacerbated or changed in importance? For example, has face-to-face 
and online racism against Asian people during the pandemic led to an increase in their risk of suicidal behavior?

Population-level factors

Access to the 
means

Have changes in access to the means of suicide resulted in changes to methods used and affected rates of suicide and 
suicidal behavior? For example, has suicide by firearms, pesticides, and medications increased as a result of people 
 stockpiling these? Have rail suicides decreased due to travel restrictions?

Media reporting

How does the media report on COVID-19 and on COVID-19-related suicides, and what is the impact of this reporting on 
 suicide and suicidal behavior? For example, are suicide-related narratives different compared with pre-COVID-19?

Social media 
use and other 
online activity

Have patterns of social media usage/consumption and other online activity changed during the pandemic, and, if so, is this 
associated with suicidal behavior? For example, does repeated exposure to information about the pandemic heighten fear 
and increase the risk of suicide and suicidal behavior? Or does the connectedness afforded by digital technologies counter 
the isolation effects of physical distancing?

Ways we live and 
behave

Has the pandemic changed the way we live and behave, or will it do so in the future? If so, which changes are beneficial and 
which are harmful with respect to the risk of suicide and suicidal behavior?

High-risk groups

COVID-19 related high-risk groups

Bereaved

Are people who have lost someone to COVID-19 at increased risk of suicide and suicidal behavior?

Vulnerability to 
COVID-19

Do people who may be particularly vulnerable to COVID-19 (e.g., older people, those living with chronic conditions or other 
medical complications) have elevated risk of suicide and suicidal behavior?

Infected by 
COVID-19

Are people who are recovering or have recovered from COVID-19 at increased risk of suicidal behavior? Are there 
 neurobiological mechanisms that mediate any increased risk for these people? Are people experiencing longer-term 
 physical consequences of COVID-19 infection at increased risk of suicide and suicidal behavior?

Frontline care 
workers

Is there an increased risk of suicide and suicidal behavior among frontline health and social care staff who are looking after 
patients with COVID-19? If so, is this risk associated with exposure to the virus, loss and grief, ethical challenges of having to 
make unprecedented choices, or something else?

Other high-risk groups

Mental health 
problems

Suicide 
 attempters

Has the risk of suicide and suicidal behavior increased for people with pre-existing mental health problems?

Are there increased numbers of people who make suicide attempts without presenting to hospital?

Economically 
affected and 
high-risk occu-
pational groups

Are people whose economic circumstances have been adversely affected by the pandemic (e.g., those who have lost 
their jobs, those whose businesses have folded) at increased risk of suicide and suicidal behavior? What is the impact of 
COVID-19 on suicide and suicidal behavior in different occupational groups, e.g., health-care staff, those working in the 
retail sector, artists, and groups in precarious working conditions?

Table 2. continued

General population

Young people

Are children and adolescents at increased risk of suicidal behavior as a result of factors such as changes to their educational 
and vocational opportunities and reduced face-to-face contact with their peers? Are there particularly sensitive developmen-
tal stages or ages where interruptions will have the greatest impact on suicide and suicidal behavior in adulthood? What is the 
impact of COVID-19 on trends in suicide and suicidal behavior among children, adolescents, and young adults?

Older people

Are older people at increased risk? What are the impacts of bereavement, loneliness, vulnerability to COVID-19, and stigma? 
Do living arrangements (e.g., living alone, living in aged care facilities) have an influence on risk?

Migrants/ 
refugees and 
displaced 
people

Is there an increased risk of suicide and suicidal behavior for migrants who may be living without a job in their host country 
or being forced to return to their native country? And what about refugees and displaced people living in camps with limited 
access to support or care? Are there differences between migrant groups and are refugees, asylum-seekers, and irregular 
migrants at increased risk of suicidal behavior?

Table 3. Example research questions relating to whether particular approaches/responses might help to mitigate any risk of suicide and/or suicidal 
behavior associated with the pandemic

Mental health 
consequences 
of lockdown

Are there country- or region-level differences in the pandemic response that are associated with greater or lesser changes 
in rates of suicide and suicidal behavior? For example, does the timing, scale, intensity, and duration of lockdown make 
a difference? What about the way physical distancing measures are enforced? Does the extent to which the public buys 
into and observes the restrictions (and whether this changes as time goes by) impact on any changes seen in suicide and 
suicidal behavior? Does it make a difference whether the lockdown is a well-articulated and coordinated national strategy 
or whether it is more fragmented in its conceptualization and implementation?

Economic 
 consequences 
of the pandemic

Burden of 
mortality from 
COVID-19

Health-care 
and crisis line 
responses

Do rates of suicide and suicidal behavior vary across different stages of the pandemic (e.g., during lockdown, once restric-
tions are eased), and what does this tell us about particular lockdown policies? Similarly, do sales of prescription psycho-
tropic medication and/or use of mental health services vary by pandemic stage, and what can we learn from this?

How can social networks be activated to identify and provide support to people who may be struggling due to lockdown?

How can care best be delivered to suicidal individuals when people are unable or afraid to leave their homes?

What can we learn from responses to previous pandemics or epidemics (e.g., the 2003 SARS outbreak) and economic crises 
(e.g., the 2008 recession) to inform our response to COVID-19?

Are there country- or region-level differences in economic responses that are associated with greater or lesser changes 
in rates of suicide and suicidal behavior? For example, do income guarantees, employment protection, and labor market 
programs make a difference? What about equity of access to resource provision?

How can care best be provided to individuals who have been bereaved through COVID-19 and to individuals who have been 
bereaved by suicide during the pandemic?

What sort of interventions might improve media reporting in relation to deaths due to COVID-19 and suicides during the 
pandemic?

How is availability of mental health services related to risk of suicide and suicidal behavior? Are there ways of scaling up 
mental health-care delivery?

How does knowledge of sociodemographic and clinical risk factors and neurobiological mechanisms inform prevention/
treatment approaches? 

What are the best ways to reach out to people who are not in touch with services? How can we encourage help-seeking?

How can mental health services best be delivered to suicidal individuals during the pandemic? How well do telehealth and 
online options work? Is it possible to identify and evaluate new forms of health-care services based on experiences and 
adaptations during the pandemic?

How can general health and mental health professionals be trained to respond effectively to suicidal clients or patients 
during the course of the pandemic? Do they need to learn new ways of operating?

Have crisis lines providing telephone and online chat support been used as resources for suicide prevention during the 
pandemic? Has the use of these sorts of services by suicidal individuals increased? Do people find them helpful?

Workplaces and 
educational 
institutions

How can workplaces help mitigate the risk of suicide and suicidal behavior during the pandemic? Are there ways they can 
support workers who may be working fewer hours or taking home less pay? And can they play a role in helping workers who 
may have lost their jobs?

How can schools and universities keep students positive, motivated, and safe during the pandemic?

iors (Mars et al., 2019; May & Klonsky, 2016). The collab-
oration provides a mechanism to work together, pool data 
using shared protocols, and investigate different outcomes 
with  a  range  of  research  designs.  It  should  also  facilitate 
reaching  global  consensus  on  issues  such  as  the  impact 
of lockdown on suicide risk and how best to mitigate risk, 

especially  if  further  periods  are  required  to  address  the 
re-emergence of COVID-19, as has recently been report-
ed in countries such as Iran (Worldo meters, 2020).  

The collaboration has identified several suggestions for 
research to help inform responses to the current and future 
pandemics,  formulating  these  as  research  questions  (see 

Editorial© 2020 Hogrefe Publishing. Distributed as a Hogrefe OpenMind article  under the license CC BY 4.0 (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0)  Crisis (2020), 41(5), 321–330328

Table 2 and Table 3). The proposed research questions link 
to the gaps in knowledge that we identified earlier. Table 2 
highlights research questions relating to whether rates of 
suicidal behavior increase as a result of the pandemic and 
what mechanisms may be driving any increase, suggesting 
specific research for the general population and for high-
risk  groups.  Table  3  presents  research  questions  relating 
to whether particular responses might help to mitigate any 
risk  of  suicide  associated  with  the  pandemic.  Members 
of  the  collaboration  have  worked  with  the  International 
Association  for  Suicide  Prevention  (IASP)  to  establish  a 
searchable on-line list of ongoing COVID-relevant studies 
on suicidal behavior, managing suicidal crises, and suicide 
prevention  (https://www.iasp.info/covid-19/covid-19-sui 
cide-research-studies) to facilitate collaboration and avoid 
duplication,  similar  to  the  website  developed  for  longitu-
dinal studies on mental health during COVID-19 (https://
www.covidminds.org/longitudinalstudies). The role of the 
IASP, in collaboration with other international and nation-
al  organizations  (e.g.,  WHO,  International  Association  of 
Suicide Research [IASR], American Foundation for Suicide 
Prevention [AFSP], and others), is to provide up-to-date in-
formation on suicide research and prevention in its global 
network. The IASP is developing a strategic plan to reduce 
COVID-19-related  suicidal  behavior  and  building  a  cen-
tral  pool  of  resources  (expertise,  research,  guidelines  for 
good  practice,  briefings)  that  will  be  available  to  support 
organizations  globally  (IASP,  2020a,  b).  Members  of  the 
ICSPRC have contributed to an IASP briefing paper on re-
porting suicide during the COVID-19 pandemic and IASP 
members have developed guidance to help workplaces and 
professional  associations  through  the  COVID-19  Crisis 
(IASP, 2020a, b). The combination of the specific research 
focus in the ICSPRC and IASP, with its prevention network 
and links to the WHO, as the leading organization for sui-
cide prevention globally, is a core strength of this collabo-
ration and many members are active in both. 

A  key  issue  the  group  needs  to  consider  is  how  best  to 
ensure  the  rapid  dissemination  of  research  and  surveil-
lance  information  to  inform  policy-making  and  preven-
tion  activities.  Furthermore,  there  is  a  need  to  consider 
the  best  way  of  responding  to  (sometimes  unsubstantiat-
ed) findings reported in news articles that may be hastily 
picked up by policy-makers and politicians. Three sorts of 
information are relevant: (a) routinely available data (e.g., 
national mortality, survey data, research publications) that 
not everyone will be aware of – this could be disseminated 
via regular briefings/updates; (b) pre-publication research 
data  and  findings  that  may  inform  policy,  but  are  going 
through  peer  review  –  one  possible  approach  to  sharing 
these data is via regular webinars/research presentations; 
and  (c)  highly  sensitive  surveillance  data,  for  example, 
known only to government officials and individuals on na-

tional suicide prevention strategy groups who have agreed 
not  to  disclose  them.  The  latter  data  are  unlikely  to  be 
shareable, but it will be important to consider approaches 
to share broad findings to give those working in different 
settings  the  opportunity  to  act  pre-emptively  and  before 
local data are available. 

Facilities  for  sharing  data/measures/protocols/pre-
peer-reviewed manuscripts (e.g., the Open Science Frame-
work and PsyArXiv) are possible options for building a re-
pository of research that can have a digital object identifier 
(DOI)  and  thus  are  traceable  and  citable.  Crisis  now  also 
publishes Registered Reports, which allow authors to sub-
mit  research  protocols  for  review  before  the  research  is 
conducted. 

Conclusion 

The  unique  challenges  posed  by  the  current  pandemic 
require  suicide  researchers  to  collaborate  in  order  to  un-
derstand the impact of COVID-19 on suicide and suicidal 
behavior and effective ways of mitigating the risk. We urge 
colleagues to complete the recently launched register of su-
icide prevention research studies to facilitate this (https://
www.iasp.info/covid-19/covid-19-suicide-re search-stud-
ies).  In  a  challenging  economic  environment,  suicide  re-
searchers will need to advocate strongly for the importance 
of the issues we have identified and make sure the research 
that is conducted is of the highest possible quality and eth-
ical  standard  to  inform  public  health,  policy,  and  health-
care  responses.  Lessons  learned  and  subsequent  changes 
made will contribute to improving response plans for future 
possible waves in this pandemic and future pandemics. The 
establishment of the International  COVID-19 Suicide Pre-
vention  Research  Collaboration  is  an  important  contribu-
tion to this effort and we ask suicide researchers particular-
ly from regions currently not represented to join us.
