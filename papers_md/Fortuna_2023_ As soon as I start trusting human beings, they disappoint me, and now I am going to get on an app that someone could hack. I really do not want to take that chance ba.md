Background: Certiﬁed peer support specialists often use technologies such as
smartphone applications to deliver digital peer support in community mental
health centers. Certiﬁed peer support specialists are individuals with a mental
health diagnosis, trained and accredited by their state to provide mental health
support services. Digital peer support has shown promising evidence of
support, and medical and psychiatric
promoting recovery, hope,
self-management among patients with a diagnosis of a serious mental illness.
Interest in digital peer support as part of the patient experience has grown.
Understanding barriers and facilitators to the implementation process of digital
peer support into community mental health centers is a critical next step to
facilitate uptake.
Methods: Semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted with 27 patient
illness; N = 10 certiﬁed peer
participants (N = 17 persons with serious mental
support specialists) from an urban community mental health center. Participants
responded to open-ended questions on the barriers and facilitators of engaging
with digital peer support technologies within community mental health centers.
The interview guide and the responses were categorized according to the
Consolidated Framework for Implementation Science Research (CFIR) constructs.
Results: Nine barriers and two facilitators were identiﬁed for the implementation
of digital peer support in community mental health centers. The overarching
domains for the identiﬁed barriers included (1) intervention characteristics (i.e.,

Conclusions: The identiﬁed barriers and facilitators represent a starting point for developing or
modifying digital peer support technology requirements to ease implementation in community
mental health centers. Building technology requirements and implementation processes based
on these ﬁndings may facilitate uptake of digital peer support technologies by people with
serious mental illness and certiﬁed peer support specialists in community mental health centers.

Introduction

Certiﬁed peer support specialists may represent an effective solution
for supporting recovery for people with serious mental illness (SMI) (1).
SMI is deﬁned as a mental illness resulting in serious functional
impairment and limitations in one or more major life activities, (e.g.,
schizophrenia spectrum disorder, bipolar disorder, major depressive
disorder) (2). Certiﬁed peer support specialist support is deﬁned as
“social and/or emotional support that combines expertise from lived
experience that is delivered with mutual agreement by persons who
self-identify as having or had mental health as well as other social,
psychological, and medical challenges to service users sharing similar
challenges to bring about self-determined personal change to the
service user” (3). In a previous systematic review, in-person peer
support demonstrated reduction in self-stigma and inpatient service
use, better treatment engagement, higher level of empowerment,
higher levels of patient activation (perceived ability to self-manage
health), and higher levels of hopefulness for recovery (4). The
emergence of digital peer support (DPS) in 2005 (5) and the later
expansion of digital peer support in 2019 due to the COVID-19 crisis
has increased the reach of peer support services (5). Digital peer
is deﬁned as “live or automated peer support services
support
delivered through technology media” (6).

A 2019 systematic review found that digital peer support
interventions showed promising evidence of increasing patient
engagement in services as well as increases in empowerment,
self-
and medical
hope, quality of
management (7). However, most of the studies included in this
systematic review did not examine implementation considerations
of digital peer support. As such, while digital peer support

technologies show burgeoning effectiveness,
real-world settings outside of research settings is not known.

life,

Understanding digital peer support implementation processes
may facilitate uptake beyond clinical research settings. As such,
this study aims to identify the barriers and facilitators of the
implementation of digital peer support based on patients with
SMI and certiﬁed peer support specialists’ perspectives.

Methods

Review Board at Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth and
with the 1964 Helsinki Declaration and its later amendments.

Agency staff reviewed clinical cases and identiﬁed patients that
met study criteria. The criteria for the potential participant’s
eligibility to participate in a semi-structured interview included the
following: (1) participants will be adults aged 18 or older with a
medical chart diagnosis of schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder,
bipolar disorder, or persistent major depressive disorder; (2) been
enrolled in treatment at the community mental health center for
at least 3 months; (3) able to speak and read English. Certiﬁed
peer support specialists’ eligibility included the following:
(1)

(i.e., to qualify to be a certiﬁed peer support specialist, a person
must
self-report any mental health diagnosis, be in active
treatment, and complete an 80-hour training that includes classes,
small group activities, and homework on fundamentals of peer
support,

interview guide was developed based on the Consolidated
Framework for Implementation Science Research [CFIR) (9)].
CFIR is a conceptual framework that was developed to guide the
implementation contexts to
systematic assessment of multilevel
identify factors that might inﬂuence intervention implementation
and effectiveness (9). CFIR is composed of 38 constructs divided
across ﬁve domains. Three domains of interest were chosen for
evaluation in this study based on the expected barriers and
facilitators. These domain themes included the following: (1)
intervention characteristics (i.e., adaptability, complexity, and
cost), (2) inner settings (i.e., implementation climate, readiness
for implementation, and access to knowledge and information),
and (3) characteristics of individuals (i.e., knowledge and beliefs
about
the intervention and other personal attributes). The
interview guide included six broad questions and probes, as
follows: (1) are you familiar with technology such as digital peer
support that can help people with SMI?; (2) do you think a digital
peer support intervention would work in a community mental
health center?; (3) do you think a digital peer support intervention
would lead to improved outcomes for patients with SMI?; (4) what
is new and interesting about digital peer support intervention?; (5)
why would a digital peer support intervention work?; and (6) why
wouldn’t a digital peer

Data analysis

The data analysis was informed using a thematic analysis
approach (11) (i.e., a method for identifying, studying, and
communicating patterns in the data material). The ﬁrst author
(KF), third author (SN), and the fourth author (AB) read all the
interview transcripts independently to familiarize themselves with
the data. These authors assigned data-driven codes to segments
of the text that represented relevant ﬁndings in the data aligned
with the research purpose. The codes were collated and grouped
into preliminary themes documenting reoccurring concepts or
statements about
the research subject. KF, AB, and SN met
virtually and discussed the codes, their relations to the themes, as
well as characteristics to and naming of each theme. Including
two researchers in the coding process is considered important for
validation purposes and for broadening the breadth and depth of
the analysis (12). All authors agreed on the naming of
the
themes and placement of themes under CFIR domains. Data
were triangulated to examine similarities and differences in
responses from patients with SMI and certiﬁed peer support
specialists.

and (3) characteristics of individuals (i.e., knowledge and beliefs
about the intervention and other personal attributes).

Intervention characteristics
Adaptability
The most mentioned theme among the barriers to implementation
included patients’ and certiﬁed peer support specialists’ views that
the digital peer support technology should be adaptable to the
needs of older patients (14/51.9%). Damschroder et al. deﬁned
“adaptability” as “the degree to which an intervention can be
adapted, tailored, reﬁned, or reinvented to meet local needs” (9).
Patients desired an app able to be adapted to individual needs,
including training for people with SMI to use the technology,
and age-speciﬁc technology features (e.g., option to increase text
reported, “older
size). For example, one patient participant
generation does not necessarily like technology, and if the app is
simple and easy to get into, that would help.” A certiﬁed peer
support specialist said, “it might be difﬁcult to implement with
older clients who are not interested or savvy with technology”.

meaning and values attached to the intervention by involved
individuals, how those align with individuals’ own norms, values,
and perceived risks and needs, and how the intervention ﬁts with
existing workﬂows and systems” (9). Patients with SMI stated
that concerns about privacy and security were barriers to the use
of digital peer support technology. One person with SMI said,

communications within an organization” (9). One certiﬁed peer
support specialist saw technology as a place for self-expression
and another said it could lead to more open communication
between patient and clinician or certiﬁed peer support specialist.
A certiﬁed peer support specialist reported that texting on a
digital peer support mobile application would make it easier to
connect when it is difﬁcult to communicate via the phone. In
this domain, Network and Communications, a certiﬁed peer
support specialist also stated the need to consider preferences in
communication, “I just, I think that some people could say that it

deﬁned “available resources” as “the level of resources dedicated
for implementation and on-going operations, including money,
training, education, physical space, and time” (9). Certiﬁed peer
support specialists believed that the patients would need device
training, access to compatible mobile phones, and peer support
services to utilize a digital peer support application. A certiﬁed
peer support specialist reported “a lot of people that we [peer
specialists] service do not have the technology even to download
an app.” A certiﬁed peer support specialist said, “you’d have to
show them initially and show them how useful it is.” A certiﬁed
peer support specialist commented that “the more resources the
better” and indicated a preference for an app that would “put all
the resources in one place for meditation, coping skills and support
groups”.

Access to knowledge and information
Patient participants and certiﬁed peer support specialists indicated
that readiness for implementation of a digital peer support
intervention would differ based on the information available
regarding the application (5/18.5%). Damschroder et al. deﬁned
“access to knowledge and information” as the “ease of access to
digestible information and knowledge about the intervention and
how to incorporate it into work tasks” (9). Respondents indicated
SMI are different mental illness and each person has different
expectations regarding information and knowledge. This applies
to the information needed to use the app (i.e., usability) as well
as the information within the app (i.e., content related to speciﬁc
symptoms or diagnoses).

group and the diverse mental illness diagnoses of people with SMI
concerned both the patients and certiﬁed peer support specialists
regarding the adaptability of the technology and recommended
personalizing technology to their needs.

Both patients and certiﬁed peer support specialists require
resources to utilize digital peer services. The lack of smartphone
ownership, technology training, data plan cost, and cost concerns
hinder patients’ engagement to the digital peer support service.
Training can partially offset these barriers. For example, lack of
smartphone access due to cost can be addressed by training
agency staff and peer support specialists about the availability of
free or low-cost access programs like Safelink, which offers free
smartphones and data plans to people who qualify for Medicaid
reimbursement. Additionally, training on how to use technologies
for both patients and certiﬁed peer support specialists may
support user conﬁdence and increase the uptake of technologies.
Patients and certiﬁed peer support specialists noted the value of
human connection as the preferred method of interaction. As such,
digital technologies that integrate automated, non-live interactions
with digital peer support
technologies such as chatbots may
consider opportunities for live interactions with certiﬁed peer
support
and potential
engagement in technologies. Both groups indicated that a beneﬁt
of digital peer
compared to live
interaction was that the technologies could be accessed by the
patient on-demand and as-needed without requiring a certiﬁed
peer support specialist or a clinician to be available. Community
