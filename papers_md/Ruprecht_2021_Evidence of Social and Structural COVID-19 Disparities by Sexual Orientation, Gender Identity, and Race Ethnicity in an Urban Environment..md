Abstract The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has had
widespread social, psychological, and economic im-
pacts. However, these impacts are not distributed equal-
ly: already marginalized populations, specifically racial/
ethnic minority groups and sexual and gender minority
populations, may be more likely to suffer the effects of
COVID-19. The COVID-19 Resiliency Survey was con-
ducted by the city of Chicago to assess the impact of
COVID-19 on city residents in the wake of Chicago’s
initial lockdown, with particular focus on the experi-
ences of minority populations. Chi-square tests of inde-
pendence were performed to compare COVID-19-
related outcomes and impacts on heterosexual vs. sexual
minority populations, cisgender vs. gender minority
populations, and White vs. racial/ethnic minority sub-
groups. Marginalized populations experienced signifi-
cant disparities in COVID-19 exposure, susceptibility,
and treatment access, as well as in psychosocial effects
of the pandemic. Notably, Black and Latinx populations
reported significant difficulties accessing food and sup-
plies (p = 0.002). Healthcare access disparities were also
visible, with Black and Latinx respondents reporting
significantly lower levels of access to a provider to see
if COVID-19 testing would be appropriate (p = 0.013),
medical services (p = 0.001), and use of telehealth for
mental health services (p = 0.001). Sexual minority

respondents reported significantly lower rates of using
telehealth for mental health services (p = 0.011), and
gender minority respondents reported significantly low-
er levels of primary care provider access (p = 0.016).
There are evident COVID-19 disparities experienced in
Chicago especially for Black, Latinx, sexual minority,
and gender minority groups. A greater focus must be
paid to health equity, including providing increased
resources and supplies for affected groups, adapting to
inequities in the built environment, and ensuring ade-
quate access to healthcare services to ameliorate the
burden of COVID-19 on these marginalized
populations.

Introduction

The ongoing pandemic of the novel coronavirus SARS-
CoV-2 (i.e., COVID-19) has had grave social, psycho-
logical, and economic impacts on a global and national
scale. As of August 9th, 2020, there have been over
161,000 deaths in the USA alone [15]. Beyond morbid-
ity and mortality, precautionary health measures related
to COVID-19 have had devastating economic impacts
in the USA, resulting in high rates of unemployment and
closed businesses [40]. The medical system has been
overwhelmed [37], and social isolation, fear, and grief
may be leading to unprecedented levels of COVID-19-

related traumatic stress and other mental health conse-
quences [25, 26].

Historically, infectious diseases have not had an
equal impact across society [10]. Therefore, unsurpris-
ingly, the impacts of COVID-19 have been and will
likely continue to be felt most by those populations
already marginalized by systemic discrimination and
oppression [58]. Current national data show that Black,
Latinx, and Native American populations are much
more likely to contract and suffer from COVID-19 than
their White counterparts [16]. While data on COVID-19
among sexual and gender minority (SGM) populations
is not widely available due to lack of measurement in
electronic health records or public health surveillance
[52], available evidence indicates that SGM populations
may also be disproportionately burdened by COVID-19
impacts and infection compared to their cisgender, het-
erosexual peers. Due to existing financial inequality
[29], Black and Latinx populations have been dispro-
portionately impacted by the social and financial im-
pacts of COVID-19 [32]. Similarly, as data have already
begun to show, SGM populations have also been se-
verely impacted by the social and economic impacts of
COVID-19 [27]. As explored by Blumenshine et al.,
racial/ethnic and other socioeconomic disparities in in-
fectious diseases operate on three levels—exposure,
susceptibility, and treatment access—that when com-
bined lead to overall worse health outcomes [10].

Firstly, Black and Latinx people are more likely to be
exposed to COVID-19 as they are more likely to have
jobs in underpaid “essential industries,” which require
in-person or face-to-face contact, thereby increasing
potential exposure [56], as are many SGM populations
[27]. Institutional discrimination within built environ-
ment, specifically high housing density as a result of
racist zoning laws, also makes physical distancing more
challenging in many communities of color [3, 60].
Moreover, as a result of racist policing practices and
systemic injustices within the court system, Black and
Latinx individuals are highly overrepresented in the
prison population [41], as are SGM populations, partic-
ularly Black and Latinx SGM [7]. This is a critical
element of exposure given that COVID-19 has been
shown to spread rapidly in carceral spaces [24].

There are furthermore visible disparities in suscepti-
bility for marginalized populations. Underlying condi-
tions associated with COVID-19 morbidity and mortal-
ity, such as asthma [18, 23], diabetes [8, 49, 59],
unsuppressed HIV viral load [17, 42, 59], and

cardiovascular diseases [18, 45, 48], are more prevalent
in Black and Latinx populations, as well as in SGM.
This places these groups at higher risk for severe cases
of COVID-19. SGM individuals may have greater sus-
ceptibility to COVID-19, due to their more frequent use
of cigarettes and marijuana (known risk factors for
COVID-19 morbidity) than their cisgender, heterosexu-
al counterparts [53]. Finally, existing disparities in rates
of psychological stress and trauma may impact the
susceptibility of certain groups to COVID-19-related
trauma and mental distress [5]. For example, higher
rates of mental health problems in SGM populations as
a result of discrimination and minority stress and lower
levels of social support may make coping with the
psychological challenges of isolation and trauma asso-
ciated with the COVID-19 pandemic more difficult [11,
22]. The higher rates of certain mental health conditions
including trauma in Black and Latinx populations place
them similarly at risk for psychological conditions to be
worsened by the pandemic [38, 46].

Finally, in regard to treatment access, COVID-19 has
amplified existing healthcare disparities in highly visible
ways with issues such as lack of healthcare facilities and
lack of health insurance becoming even more pertinent
for racial/ethnic minority and SGM populations [35,
55]. Not only may Black and Latinx individuals be less
likely to seek care due to cost, lack of insurance, medical
mistrust, and a lack of appropriate healthcare facilities in
one’s own community [6] but also may receive substan-
dard care after treatment is sought due to racism at point-
of-care [39]. This is compounded by other structural and
neighborhood-level
issues including problems
accessing childcare, transportation, and linguistic bar-
riers [14, 36]. SGM populations are also highly likely to
experience gaps in receipt of timely and effective treat-
ment. Due to both financial barriers to care, lower
rates of insurance, medical mistrust, and discrimina-
tion at point-of-care, SGM individuals report lower
rates of healthcare engagement [9, 34]. These effects
are further magnified for multiply marginalized indi-
viduals,
including racial/ethnic minority SGM
groups [34]. Furthermore, expanding beyond just
disparities in physical impacts, both racial/ethnic mi-
nority and SGM populations report even greater dis-
parities in accessing quality, culturally competent
mental healthcare [1, 51], meaning that they may
not be able to get appropriate professional support
for the psychosocial distress brought on by the
pandemic.

These disparities in exposure, susceptibility, and ac-
cess did not arise spontaneously during the COVID-19
p a n d e m i c [ 1 3 ] . R a c i s m , W h i t e s u p r e m a c y ,
homo/biphobia, transphobia, and other forms of struc-
tural violence have constructed social conditions which
operate at all three disparity levels, impacting Black,
Latinx, and SGM peoples’ likelihood of being exposed
to the virus, risk of contracting the disease when ex-
posed, and likelihood of receiving timely and effective
treatment after infection. These structures thereby in-
crease exposure and susceptibility, while reducing ac-
cess to resources for marginalized populations [30],
including racial, ethnic, sexual, and gender minority
individuals [28]. Further investigation into the specific
social and material support needs of these communities
is critical in order to ameliorate the ongoing damages of
COVID-19 in marginalized populations.

The Current Study

The city of Chicago, like most US cities, has seen drastic
disparities in COVID-19 incidence and mortality.
Roughly 68% of COVID-19-related deaths and 52%
of COVID-19 cases have been among Black
residents [61], though only 30% of the city’s population
is Black [57]. Similarly, while just 29% of Chicago’s
total population identifies as Latinx [57], this group
represents 31.5% of COVID-19-related deaths and
47.7% of cases [61]. Such disparities, while troubling,
are not surprising given the widespread racial segrega-
tion and discrimination in Chicago [43]. Further data is
needed to inform strategies for equitable and effective
future pandemic control and response particularly in
urban areas.

Methods

As part of a Racial Equity Rapid Response (RERR)
initiative, the Mayor’s office conducted a COVID-19
Resiliency Survey to assess the impacts of COVID-19
on city residents at the start of Chicago’s initial lock-
down, with particular focus on the experiences of mi-
nority populations. The survey included questions about
COVID-19 symptoms, testing, vulnerabilities, behav-
ioral patterns, structural barriers to health, and social
needs. Notably, the Chicago COVID-19 Resiliency Sur-
vey was one of few surveys nationally about COVID-19
to include questions about sexual orientation and gender

identity. The survey was designed to identify unmet
needs among marginalized groups in order to tailor
social services and inform a more equitable COVID-
19 response.

The survey sample consisted of 227 participants,
ranging in age from 21 to over 70 years. Only partici-
pants indicating valid ZIP codes within Chicago were
included in analyses, resulting in a final sample of 206
participants. Data were collected between 4/16/2020
and 5/14/2020 during phases I and II of the pandemic.
This unpaid survey was distributed online and dissem-
inated via Listservs and community agencies, with a
focus on reaching citizens on the south and west sides
who were most affected by the pandemic.

Survey Design

Measures

Demographics

Sexual Identity Sexual identity was assessed by asking,
“Which of the following terms do you use to describe
your sexual orientation?” Response options included
gay, lesbian, bisexual, pansexual, queer, heterosexual,
some other terms, and prefer not to respond. Due to
sample size limitations, all sexual minority subgroups
(gay, bisexual, lesbian, and queer) were collapsed to
form a “sexual minority” category; this is a non-ideal
method for analysis which should only be considered
appropriate in cases where analysis would not be possi-
ble with subgroup differentiation.

Gender Gender modality—that is, the state of being
transgender or cisgender [4]—was assessed by asking
participants if they identified as transgender (yes or no).
Gender identity was then assessed by asking participants
to select the terms they use to describe their gender from
the following list: woman, man, non-binary, some other
term, and prefer not to respond. Due to sample size
limitations, participants were categorized and were col-
lapsed to form one “gender minority” category if they
either selected “yes” in the gender modality question or
selected “non-binary” in the gender identity question.
All other responses were categorized as cisgender. We
refer to this construct as gender modality moving for-
ward, as we are not distinguishing participants based on
their gender alone (i.e., male or female) but rather by
their relation to their assigned sex at birth.

30

Ruprecht et al.

Race/Ethnicity Race and ethnicity were assessed by
combining two questions. First, participants were asked
if they identified as Hispanic or Latino/a/x (yes or no). If
participants endorsed a Hispanic/Latinx identity, their
race/ethnicity was coded as such, regardless of reported
race. If they did not, their race was categorized in
accordance with their response to the question “How
do you describe your race? Please chose all that apply to
you?” with the response options being American Indian
or Alaska Native, Asian, Black or African American,
Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander, White, and
not listed. Hence, the response categories were (1) Black
or African American, (2) Hispanic/Latinx (regardless of
reported race), (3) White, and (4) other.

COVID-19 Exposure

Exposure was assessed by asking about symptoms,
household members having symptoms, feelings of safe-
ty at home and commuting to work, and prevention
behaviors, including physical distancing, masks, isola-
tion, and washing hands (See Supplementary Table 1 for
further detail).

COVID-19 Susceptibility

Susceptibility to the negative impacts of COVID-19,
both physically and mentally, was assessed by asking
about chronic compromise of immune system among
household members, shortages of food and sanitation
supplies, support from community organizations and
mutual aid services, spending time with household,
feeling alone/isolated, and access to technology (See
Supplementary Table 1 for further detail).

COVID-19 Treatment Access

Access to treatment, both for COVID-19 and for mental
health distress related to the pandemic, was assessed by
asking about access to medical services, health insur-
ance, a primary care provider, a mental healthcare pro-
vider, and a medical provider to indicate whether or not
COVID-19 testing is appropriate. Usage of telehealth
for mental health services, telehealth for physical health
services, and apps for mental health support was also
assessed (See Supplementary Table 1 for further detail).

Statistical Analysis

All data cleaning, recoding, and analyses were conduct-
ed in SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). De-
scriptive analyses were conducted to determine the
prevalence of sexual identity, gender modality,
race/ethnicity, and other demographics within the entire
sample. Chi-square tests of independence were per-
formed to compare COVID-19-related outcomes in het-
erosexual vs. sexual minority populations, in cisgender
vs. gender minority populations, and between racial/
ethnic subgroups; statistically significant (p < 0.05) re-
sults are reported below.

Results

Demographics

The sample was racially/ethnically diverse; 51.9% (n =
107) of the sample was Black/African American, 31.1%
(n = 64) White, 12.1% (n = 25) Hispanic/Latinx, and less
than 2% of each of the remaining identities (Table 1).
Similarly, a diverse range of sexual identities was repre-
sented in the sample: 62.6% of respondents identified as
straight/heterosexual (n = 129), 13.1% as gay (n = 27),
6.3% as queer (n = 13), 6.3% as bisexual (n = 13), 2.9%
as lesbian (n = 6), and 5.8% preferred not to respond (n =
12). A small portion of the sample endorsed a gender
minority identity: 1.9% of the sample (n = 4) reported that
they were transgender, and 3.4% of the sample reported
that they were non-binary (n = 7), not mutually exclusive.
There was a broad representation of ages, from 21 to over
70 years, with 38.8% of the respondents under 40 (n = 87),
40.6% between 40 and 59 (n = 91), and 19.2% of the
sample 60 or older (n = 43). The sample was geographi-
cally spread throughout Chicago, with the north and south
sides especially represented (Fig. 1).

Disparities in Exposure

Despite high overall levels of adherence, White respon-
dents were significantly more likely to report adherence
to physical distancing than Black and Latinx partici-
pants (W: 100.0% vs. B: 90.4% vs. L: 92.0%; χ2 =
6.24; p = 0.044). White respondents were also signifi-
cantly more likely to report adherence to quarantine than
Black or Latinx participants (W: 82.3% vs. B: 58.7% vs.
L: 76.0%; χ2 = 10.78; p = 0.005). There were no

statistically significant differences in any other preven-
tive behaviors, such as mask wearing or washing hands
(Table 2), which had high reported adherence across
racial/ethnic groups. Latinx respondents were also more
than twice as likely to report feeling unsafe going to
work and/or commuting to work compared to White and
Black participants (L: 48.0% vs. W: 19.3% vs. B:
19.2%; χ2 = 10.11; p = 0.006) (Table 2). There were
no statistically significant differences in exposure, in-
cluding testing or preventive behaviors, by sexual iden-
tity or gender modality (Tables 3 and 4).

Disparities in Susceptibility

(W: 61.3% vs. B: 36.5% vs. L: 40.0%; χ2 = 9.91; p =
0.007). While 17.3% of Black and 8.0% of Latinx
participants reported experiencing food shortages dur-
ing the pandemic, not a single White respondent report-
ed this experience (χ2 = 12.60; p = 0.002). Similarly,
Black and Latinx participants frequently reported short-
ages in sanitation or cleaning supplies though White
respondents were significantly less likely to report these
same shortages (B: 45.2% vs. L: 40.0% vs. W: 17.7%;
χ2 = 13.01; p = 0.002; Table 2). There were no signifi-
cant differences in household members with compro-
mised immune systems or reported food/supply short-
ages by sexual identity or gender modality.

Participants impacted by systemic discrimination al-
so reported factors that suggest higher susceptibility to
mental health problems during the pandemic. For exam-
ple, there were statistically significant differences in the
amount of social support received: while Latinx and
White participants reported similar rates of feeling
alone/isolated, Black respondents noted significantly
lower levels of feeling alone/isolated (W: 50.0% vs. L:
52.0% vs. B: 32.7%; χ2 = 6.30; p = 0.043). Heterosex-
ual participants reported overall greater levels of social
support: they were less likely to feel alone/isolated
compared to sexual minority participants (34.1% vs.
53.5%; χ2 = 7.13; p = 0.008; Table 3). Heterosexual
participants were additionally more likely to spend time
with household members compared to sexual minority
respondents (54.3% vs. 38.0%; χ2 = 4.83; p = 0.028).
Gender minority respondents were over twice as likely
to report feeling alone/isolated compared to cisgender
respondents (90.0% vs. 40.3%; χ2 = 9.60; p = 0.002)
(Table 4). No other significant differences in social
support or connectedness were found.

Respondents differed by race/ethnicity in terms of how
they connected with others: Black and Latinx respondents
were more likely to access support from a community
organization in their area (17.3% and 16.0% of partici-
pants), compared to only 1.6% of White participants (χ2 =
9.46; p = 0.009). White participants were, however, more
likely to report accessing videoconferencing tools (such as
Zoom, Skype, Google Hangouts, Facetime; 87.1%) com-
pared to 69.2% of Black respondents and 72.0% of Latinx
respondents (χ2 = 6.96; p = 0.032).

Disparities in Treatment

White respondents were more likely to report having no
household members with compromised immune sys-
tems compared with Black and Latinx respondents

Overall, White respondents had greater access to phys-
ical and mental health medical services: they were

significantly more likely to report accessing telehealth
from a mental health professional (W: 30.7% vs. B:
9.7% vs. L: 16.0%; χ2 = 13.48; p = 0.001) and more
likely to have a medical provider to contact if they felt
that they needed COVID-19 testing (W: 96.8% vs. B:
89.4% vs. L: 76.0%; χ2 = 8.68; p = 0.013). Black and
Latinx respondents were more likely to report barriers to

accessing medical services, such as emergency care,
basic medical care, or needed prescriptions compared
to White participants (B: 53.9% vs. L: 32.0% vs. W:
25.8%; χ2 = 13.70; p = 0.001, Table 2). Heterosexual
participants had greater access to mental health treat-
ment in particular compared to sexual minority partici-
pants, as they were more than twice as likely to report

likely to have a mental health provider (34.9% vs.
52.1%; χ2 = 5.62; p = 0.018) compared to sexual mi-
nority participants (Table 3). Gender minority respon-
dents experienced significant disparities in access to
physical, though not mental, healthcare: cisgender par-
ticipants were significantly more likely to have a prima-
ry care provider or physician (87.2% vs. 60.0%; χ2 =
5.84; p = 0.016) compared to gender minority respon-
dents. Cisgender respondents were, however, less likely
to report accessing telehealth from a mental health pro-
fessional compared to gender minority respondents
(14.8% vs. 60.0%; χ2 = 13.79; p = 0.001; Table 4).

As we would predict based on the work of Blumenshine
et al., there were significant disparities in COVID-19
exposure, susceptibility, and treatment access, both for
the virus itself and related psychosocial consequences,
among marginalized populations. These structural de-
terminants are, however, unsurprising given the omni-
present and pervasive stigma and discrimination that

lations in Chicago.

While there were significant differences by race/
ethnicity in preventive behaviors, it is critical to examine
these from a structural, rather than individual, level

perspective to inform effective intervention strategy, since
these are likely attributable to larger economic and social
disparities. For example, Black and Latinx individuals
reported less physical distancing and quarantine compared
to White respondents. This difference is likely a result of
systemic factors related to the built environment, which
made physical distancing and isolation more difficult for
many within these populations, not individual choice.
These include high-density housing, larger household/
family size, working in “essential services,” and being
unable to take time off work due to economic insecurity
and a lack of paid sick time [30]. The reported shortage of
cleaning and sanitation supplies also likely contribute to
differences in preventive behavior. Thus, to increase

preventive behaviors, it is not enough to provide education
or inform about the proper precautions. Rather, policy-
level changes, including guaranteed paid sick leave, an
expansion of safe and affordable housing, universal basic
income, expansion of unemployment benefits during the
pandemic, and increased availability of resources, must be
undertaken to ensure that adherence to preventive mea-
sures are equitable across subpopulations. In the short
term, however, increased guidance, drafted in collabora-
tion with community leaders, should be made for how to
physical distance for families in high-density housing or
facing other structural obstacles to engaging in preventive
behavior. Safety remains a concern for some groups: a
staggering 48% of Latinx participants reported feeling

unsafe on their way to/from work. This underscores the
importance of investing in community infrastructure and
providing accessible personal protective equipment (PPE)
for all who need it.

Differences in susceptibility similarly underscore the
importance of investing in communities. Black and
Latinx respondents and their households showed greater
susceptibility to COVID-19, being more likely to report
having a family member with a compromised immune
system. This is in line with previous research which
stated that Black and Latinx populations had higher risk
for COVID-19 morbidity and mortality [47]. The com-
bination of higher levels of vulnerability and decreased
ability to engage in preventive behaviors, along with

systemic racism within the medical system, contributes
to the higher levels of COVID-19 morbidity and mor-
tality seen among racial/ethnic minority populations
[19, 30, 55]. It furthermore creates an added urgency
in deploying supplies, food, PPE, financial assistance,
and other emergency measures to impacted communi-
ties. This can subsequently help ameliorate these nega-
tive outcomes, in conjunction with structural change, to
combat the higher levels of vulnerability seen in Black
and Latinx populations. Black and Latinx respondents
also reported significantly greater trouble accessing
food and basic supplies. However, it is difficult to know
if this is due to store closures, individuals not being able
to shop due to risk of exposure, or because of financial

36

Ruprecht et al.

difficulties caused by COVID-19. Therefore, further
investigation into the specific food and supply needs
of vulnerable populations is warranted to inform more
targeted intervention. Still, immediate relief measures
can be taken in the forms of emergency food supply
delivery, expansion of unemployment benefits, and pro-
visions of stipends to communities disproportionately
impacted by COVID-19.

Clear deficits in social needs appeared for certain
populations, which could represent higher susceptibility
to psychological distress: SGM respondents reported
high levels of feeling alone and isolated. As these two
populations already have higher rates of mental health
concerns [11, 22], finding methods to increase social
support while maintaining physical distancing is critical
for SGM populations. Still, while online support groups
or social events may be a useful tool for creating this
support, they may also leave out those who do not have
a stable internet connection. Furthermore, Black and
Latinx populations reported lower overall use of video-
conferencing technologies to maintain social connec-
tion. This could reflect differences in the accessibility
of technology—Black and Latinx adults are less likely
to have access to a laptop and high-speed internet in
their home [44]. Therefore, ensuring that all households
have access to low-cost, high-speed internet is critical,
especially as increasingly more essential functions of
everyday life, including schooling, move online.
Expanding Wifi access and improving the quality and
consistency of Internet, especially in low-income neigh-
borhoods, should remain a priority for local govern-
ments. However, these differences also should force
caution in the meantime regarding an overreliance on
the implementation of online services; an overreliance
on internet-based technologies for COVID support may
disadvantage populations who struggle to access
internet.

One of the most obvious disparities was in access to
healthcare. Black, Latinx, and gender minority partici-
pants were less likely to report having a primary care
provider and were less likely to have a doctor to contact
regarding COVID-19 testing. Black and Latinx respon-
dents, furthermore, experienced greater problems in
accessing medical services more generally. While dif-
ferences for sexual minority populations were not sta-
tistically significant, they too reported lower levels of
healthcare engagement in many areas. This is consistent
with previous literature which shows lower rates of
healthcare engagement among SGM populations and

racial/ethnic minority populations [34, 39]. As such,
these disparities in healthcare access and engagement
exist outside of the context of COVID-19. Expanding
access to affordable, culturally competent, and high-
quality healthcare located within communities must be
a priority to ensure long-term health equity. One area in
which SGM populations did have higher access to
healthcare was in mental health, which was an unex-
pected resilience factor. For example, gender minority
participants were more likely to have accessed care from
a mental health professional, which may be a sign of
proactive steps taken to ensure one’s mental wellbeing
during a pandemic. Of course, this result is difficult to
interpret with certainty due to the limited information
available. Given the higher overall rates of mental health
concerns in SGM populations [11, 31], this specific
group of respondents may have simply been more likely
to seek mental health treatment for existing conditions.
This higher rate of mental healthcare access could also
be attributable to gender minority individuals experienc-
ing crisis-level outcomes as a result of severe marginal-
ization, and therefore requiring greater interaction with
mental health professionals during the pandemic. Thus,
further research is needed to investigate which factors
promote mental healthcare utilization within this group.
While lacking in resources and social needs in many
areas, the minority populations in our sample also re-
ported resiliency-promoting factors in a number of
areas. For example, Black and Latinx participants re-
ported feeling, on average, less alone and more likely to
access a community organization in their area than
White individuals. These are critical assets which must
be taken into account when planning for equity-based
pandemic responses. In particular, the increased levels
of community organization usage among Black and
Latinx respondents suggests that community organiza-
tions may be a critical resource to support marginalized
populations during times of crisis, as they are able to
rapidly fill gaps in social programs and services. Future
research should be dedicated to exploring the role of
community organizations in supporting equity during
health crises, and resources should be made available to
support expansion of existing community organization
services.

This study is not without limitations. Due to sample
size, we collapsed all sexual minority respondents into a
single category and all gender minority respondents into
a single category. Certain subpopulations, including
bisexuals, are known to experience worse health

Evidence of Social and Structural COVID-19 Disparities by Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity, and...

37

outcomes, and as such, further research with these spe-
cific groups must be done to disentangle their experi-
ence from that of the larger sexual minority community
[20]. The specific measures of gender modality used
may have underestimated the actual number of gender
minority individuals in the sample, for example, if
someone did not currently identify as transgender but
had a gender identity different than their sex assigned at
birth. One of the largest limitations is the omission of
Native Americans from more detailed analyses due to
small sample size. However, given the large COVID-19
disparities impacting this population in particular, fur-
ther work, especially focusing on the social needs and
structural barriers to health among Indigenous popula-
tions in Chicago, is needed. The small sample size also
prevents an intersectional analytic approach, meaning
that the experiences of multiply marginalized groups
cannot be examined statistically with the current sample
[12]. For example, while family support may serve as a
form of resilience against racial discrimination, Black
and Latinx SGM individuals may have diminished ac-
cess to these social supports due to their sexual/gender
minority identity [2, 50]. Due to racism within the SGM
community, racial/ethnic minority SGM populations
may be excluded from these community spaces, causing
a deficit in another resiliency-promoting factor [21].
Multiply marginalized groups experienced a number of
health disparities pre-pandemic: for example, 18.6% of
White transgender individuals lived in poverty in 2019,
compared to 38.5% of Black transgender people and
48.4% of Hispanic/Latinx transgender people [54]. As
such, not investigating COVID-19-related impacts at
these intersections may be obfuscating critical dispar-
ities and areas for intervention. Further exploration,
including qualitative work and analyses with a larger
sample, must be done to elucidate these experiences. All
data were self-report; this could have led to an
underreporting of nonadherence to COVID-19 preven-
tion measures due to social desirability bias, though the
anonymity of the survey helps to reduce the impact of
this limitation. Due to sample size limitations, analyses
did not control for potential confounders and results
should therefore be interpreted with caution. Due to
the cross-sectional nature of the study, we cannot infer
causality, nor do we know concretely if the patterns we
observed among respondents were a direct result of
COVID-19 and related shutdown measures, or if these
patterns existed before the pandemic. Finally, results of
the survey were interpreted using the levels conceived

by Blumenshine et al.—exposure, susceptibility, and
treatment access; however, given the design of the
survey, the metrics do not perfectly align with these
levels. Regardless, it remains a useful framework for
understanding COVID-19-related disparities.

Despite these limitations, these early results provide
essential information which should be used both as
COVID-19 persists and in the case of future pandemics
which will, undoubtedly, disparately impact marginal-
ized populations. Taking into account the findings from
this survey, we have generated four critical recommen-
dations, applicable both to the city of Chicago and any
other jurisdictions experiencing similar disparities.

Invest Directly in Communities Black and Latinx re-
spondents reported relatively high utilization of commu-
nity organizations. As such, funding and supplies for
local, community-based organizations should be made
readily available so they can respond most effectively to
those they serve, particularly given their demonstrated
role in supporting communities of color as captured in
our results. Giving communities themselves direct own-
ership over supplies and resources promotes equitable
distribution and greater access for marginalized
populations.

Collect and Report Comprehensive Data Which In-
cludes Measures of Race/Ethnicity, Sex, Sexual Orien-
tation, and Gender Identity/Modality The exact magni-
tude of disparities in COVID-19 morbidity and mortal-
ity among SGM populations is unknown due to the lack
of consistent data collection. Critically, intersectional
analyses that were precluded in smaller-scale studies
would be enabled by such large-scale data collection
efforts, illuminating disparities experienced by racial/
ethnic minority SGM populations. Cities should priori-
tize sexual orientation and gender identity data collec-
tion, regarding not only morbidity and mortality but also
social and material needs [62].

Act Now and Plan for Later As supported by the re-
ported shortages and needs within our sample, certain
emergency measures can be taken immediately to re-
duce COVID-19 morbidity and mortality among mar-
ginalized populations. These include provision of food
and emergency supplies, expansion of medical services
in underserved areas, and more widespread access to
PPE. However, given that these disparities are caused by
structural racism and other inequities, long-term

38

measures must be taken to reduce overall systemic
inequality to ensure preparation for future pandemics.
That is, given that pandemics can magnify existing
health disparities [10], it will be most effective to take
the actions to reduce these disparities overall through
large structural change.

Given the evident disparities in treatment access,
disease exposure, and impact, equity for racial/ethnic,
gender, and sexual minority populations must be fur-
thermore centered in official pandemic preparedness
plans using an explicitly anti-racist, health equity–
focused lens to prevent these disparities from occurring
in future outbreaks. Using guidance from critical stake-
holders including community organizations and leaders,
disaster response experts, and healthcare providers, we
recommend provisions be added to current planning
documents to ensure equity in future pandemics and
disasters and to mitigate harms that may be dispropor-
tionately felt by certain groups [33].

Focus on Structural-Level Change to Support Individu-
al and Community Level Prevention Our study showed
disparities in preventive behaviors by race/ethnicity.
Due to the quantitative methodology of our study, we
are unable to uncover the reasons for the lower levels of
adherence to certain behaviors among these popula-
tions. However, it is likely that structural barriers, rather
than individual choice, are driving this disparity. As
such, instead of simply emphasizing individual-level
prevention behaviors, such as hand washing and phys-
ical distancing, governmental bodies should implement
structural change to aid in the promotion of positive
health behaviors, including the ability to take off work
if one is experiencing COVID-19 symptoms, expanded
medical services including telehealth, and being able to
consistently and accurately use PPE. Addressing these
overarching structural barriers is critical to ensuring an
equitable pandemic response.

Conclusion

Given the ongoing disparities experienced by marginal-
ized populations, within and outside of the context of the
COVID-19 pandemic, it is critical to take actions to
ensure that the needs of these groups are met. Our results
demonstrate a number of pressing unmet needs, espe-
cially for Black, Latinx, and gender minority

communities within an urban setting. However, with
both immediate action and consistent, structural-level
investment in dismantling oppressive systems, these
inequities can be addressed, not only to ensure an ap-
propriate COVID-19 response but also to ensure long-
term health equity for marginalized populations.
