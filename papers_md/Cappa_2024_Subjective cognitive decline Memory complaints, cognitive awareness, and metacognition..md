Cognitive complaints are common in elderly subjects and are a frequent reason for

referral to memory clinics. If the complaints are not associated with objective cog-

nitive impairment, the condition is labelled subjective cognitive decline (SCD). SCD

is often considered as a stage antedating objective impairment, and an at-risk condi-

tion for subsequent dementia. Recent large-scale studies indicate that a significantly

increased risk of clinical progression in subjects with SCD is associated with positiv-

ity for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) biomarkers, a finding supporting the notion that SCD

can be due to different mechanisms not associated with neurodegeneration, including

functional cognitive disorders. In this paper we present a selective review of research

on the relations among SCD, cognitive awareness, and metacognitive abilities. We

propose that longitudinal studies of metacognitive efficiency in SCD may provide use-

ful cues about the risk of progression to dementia and the possible presence of a

functional cognitive disorder, with different implications for the management of this

prevalent aging-related condition.

Highlights
∙ Subjective cognitive decline (SCD), a common cause of referral to memory clinics,

can be due to multiple conditions.

∙ The predictive value of SCD for progression to Alzheimer’s disease (AD) dementia is

high in association with AD biomarker positivity.

∙ The awareness of cognitive decline is the mechanism responsible for the emergence

of SCD and metacognition is the underlying neuropsychological function.

∙ The awareness of cognitive decline in clinical patients is usually assessed comparing

an informant rating to the patient self-assessment, a method that can be affected by

informant bias.

∙ While there is strong evidence that awareness starts to decline with the onset of

objective cognitive impairment, progressively leading to the anosognosia of AD, the

status of metacognitive efficiency in SCD needs to be further investigated.

∙ Quantitative, performance-based indexes of metacognitive efficiency may con-

tribute both to the assessment of progression risk and to the management of

subjects with functional cognitive disorders.

Cognitive complaints, present in 50% to 80% of the elderly popula-

to memory clinics. The presence and the severity of complaints, how-

posed for this “intermediate stage between normal cognition and MCI.”
According to Storandt et al.8 pre-MCI diagnosis should rely on decline

from a previous level of function, even though current objective per-

formance has not yet fallen below a cut-point for MCI based on group
norms. Duara et al.’s9 “ algorithmic” definition is based on a discrepancy

RESEARCH IN CONTEXT

1. Systematic review: The authors reviewed the litera-

ture using traditional (e.g., PubMed) sources. Our search

focused on key terms including “awareness of cogni-

tive decline,” “metacognition,” and “memory complaints.”

While existing literature extensively covers these mech-

anisms in patients with cognitive impairments, there is a

notable gap in data concerning individuals with subjective

cognitive decline (SCD).

2.

Interpretation: Our findings suggest that longitudinal

studies investigating metacognitive efficiency in SCD may

offer valuable insights into the risk of progression to

dementia and the potential presence of functional cog-

nitive disorders. Understanding these mechanisms could

have significant implications for the management of SCD

patients.

3. Future directions: The current paper proposes a frame-

work wherein cognitively unimpaired patients evaluated

at memory clinics undergo a metamemory assessment

before undergoing a dementia risk assessment. By ini-

tiating an initial metamemory screening, individuals at

lower risk of developing dementia (i.e., functional cogni-

tive disorders) could be identified. These individuals may

benefit more from metacognition training rather than

structured prevention interventions. This approach could

lead to more tailored and effective interventions for SCD

patients.

of its neural mechanisms may provide useful additional insights for the

clinical assessment of SCD.

THE NEURAL FOUNDATIONS OF
AWARENESS, METACOGNITION, AND
METAMEMORY

The first criterion for the current definition of SCD12 is “a self-

experienced persistent decline in cognitive capacity, compared with

a previously normal cognitive status, which is unrelated to an acute

event.” The criteria underline that the focus is on the “state of cog-

nitive decline from the perspective of the individual” (“observation of

such a decline by others is not required”), clearly entailing the notion

of self-awareness. The dictionary definition of awareness (Merriam

Webster) is “knowledge and understanding that something is hap-

pening or exists.” Self-awareness is then defined as “the capacity of

becoming the object of one’s own awareness.” A rich taxonomy of

“dimensions” of self-awareness has been proposed, from interoception

to autobiographical memory, associated with different neurobiological

mechanisms and thus liable to dysfunction in multiple brain disorders
(see Mograbi et al.18). Metacognition, that is, the awareness and con-

trol of one’s own cognition, is the aspect of self-awareness at play in the

case of self-experienced cognitive decline. Individual self-awareness is

of course not directly accessible, but can be inferred from behavioral

observation or, in the case of humans, verbal reports. In the case of

SCD, this takes the form of complaints, concerns, and worries, which

may be considered emotional reactions to the perception of decline of

a cognitive function.

CLINICAL MANAGEMENT OF SCD PATIENTS

SCD, especially in association with biomarker positivity, is an at-risk

investigated. All individuals with SCD should undergo an in-depth risk
profiling for dementia.61 Cognitively unimpaired patients could benefit

from a detailed ACD evaluation. The assessment of ACD is often lim-

ited to a questionnaire-based comparison between an informant rating

of cognitive (typically memory) performance and the subjects’ self-

assessment. This measure is useful but is prone to multiple biases. We

recommend the introduction in the neuropsychological assessment of

an objective measure of performance evaluation. There is no “gold

standard” for this form of assessment, an “unmet need” which needs

to be addressed in the future. Among the multiple possible formats,
the measurement of the “meta-memory ratio”62 and the meta-d’/d’

ratio, a measure of metacognitive efficiency taking into account the
performance level,27 appear to be promising measures. An adequate

estimation of cognitive performance (with a focus on metamemory

abilities), as well as an underestimation of decline, are indications for

a comprehensive evaluation of the risk profile, which may lead to

biomarker assessment. Underestimation, in particular, has been con-
sidered a possible risk marker for progression,51,63 likely related to

Proposed workflow for SCD patients. Modified from Altomare et al.,74 this figure illustrates a possible memory clinic work-up for

SCD individuals. Cognitively unimpaired patients evaluated at memory clinics could benefit from a metamemory assessment before going through
a dementia risk assessment, at least before the possible changing clinical scenario associated with the availability of validated blood-based
biomarkers. Based on the limited knowledge available, an initial metamemory screening could identify those at lower risk of developing dementia
(functional cognitive disorders) that could benefit from a metacognition training instead of risk reduction protocols. However, there may be

the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE; 27/30), Clock Drawing

Test (CDT; 10/10), and Three-Objects-Three-Places Psychological Test

(3O3P; 8/9). Specific cognitive function tests for memory, attention,

executive function, visuoconstructional abilities, and language all

yielded results within normal ranges. To assess the concordance of

complaints between the patient and the informant, we used the Cogni-

tive Change Index (CCI). Both the patient and the informant reported
the same level of complaints (38 CCI self – 38 CCI informant = 0).

Further investigation using AD biomarkers,

including amyloid

positron emission tomography (PET), tau PET, and magnetic resonance

imaging (MRI), revealed positive results. Subsequently, the patient was

enrolled in an observational research study of progression. Upon a

follow-up visit 2 years later, the patient demonstrated a decline of 3

points on the MMSE, along with borderline scores in episodic mem-

ory tests and impaired executive functions. Notably, both the patient

and the informant reported increased severity in complaints; how-

ever, the informant’s complaints exceeded those of the patient (58
CCI self – 66 CCI informant = −8). This discrepancy suggests a diver-

In conclusion, SCD is a common reason for people to seek help from

memory clinics, and the ability to predict the onset of AD is max-

imally useful in combination with positivity of AD biomarkers. The

emergence of SCD is related to the awareness of cognitive decline,

which is a metacognitive function. Assessment of ACD is typically done

by comparing informant ratings to patient self-assessment, a measure

which may be affected by informant bias. Over time, ACD deteriorates

progressively in AD, leading to anosognosia in the cognitive impair-

ment and dementia stage. Quantitative, performance-based measures

of metacognitive abilities can identify over- or underestimation of true

performance, and may provide useful insights into the risk of progres-

sion of SCD patients. Overestimation of cognitive decline is common

in healthy aging and functional cognitive disorder, while overestima-

tion of objective performance may indicate a higher risk of AD. Overall,

understanding the mechanisms underlying SCD and awareness of cog-

nitive decline is critical for accurate diagnosis and patient management

in the early and prodromal phases of the disease.
