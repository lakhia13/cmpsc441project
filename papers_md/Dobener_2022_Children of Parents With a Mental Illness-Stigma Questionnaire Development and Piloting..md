themselves and those are
associated with high stigma. Moreover, just like primary recipients of stigma, they
are affected by the social taboo surrounding mental
illness: they do not receive
enough information, are often left alone with their problems, and are thus considered
“invisible children”. In previous research, family stigma has only been assessed through
general questionnaires for all
family members. What has not yet been adequately
investigated is how stigma difﬁculties affect the children of parents with mental illness
in particular. To address these limitations, we developed the Children of Parents with
Mental Illness-Stigma-Questionnaire (COPMI-SQ), a self-report instrument for young
people aged 12–19 years, designed to assess young people’s stigma experiences
in daily life. Based on a systematic review preceding the questionnaire, we identiﬁed

In this paper, we report on the development process and initial pilot data (N = 32)
on the psychometric properties of the COPMI-SQ. Item analyses via an item difﬁculty
index, discriminatory power, as well as internal consistency analysis resulted in a revised
instrument reduced to 67 items. We observed very high internal consistencies (between α
= 0.868 and α = 0.975) for the subscales. The approach taken to develop the COPMI-SQ
followed scientiﬁcally accepted principles by ensuring different construction phases and
is considered a solid basis for further reliability and validity studies. The study is ongoing
and undergoing a further validation investigation; dimensionality and factor structure will
also be examined.

INTRODUCTION

Approximately 17–25% of all children worldwide live with at least one parent who has a mental
illness (1–4). Evidence shows that children of parents with a mental illness (COPMI) are exposed
to serious and diverse risks compared to their peers of similar age (3). The high prevalence and
known risks contrast with the very low visibility of these children (5). Mental illnesses of parents
can inﬂuence the living environment of children and adolescents in many ways, and they carry

themselves during their

various risks associated with reduced mental health, poorer
academic achievement, and impaired social well-being (3, 6).
Moreover, COPMI carry a signiﬁcantly increased risk of
developing mental health problems themselves (1). In addition
to genetic factors and familial
inﬂuences resulting from or
illness, there are environmental
accompanying the parental
factors that contribute to whether children develop a mental
illness
(1, 7). One social
environment mechanism that
inﬂuences the entire family
system and is known to be relevant in terms of children’s
personal development, wellbeing, and help-seeking behavior is
the stigma associated with a parent’s mental illness (8, 9). Despite
high prevalence rates of children of parents with a mental illness,
they are remaining “invisible” due to the lack of recognition
and formal identiﬁcation within (adult) health systems (10, 11).
Through the fear of stigma and negative repercussions of those
children and their families, many of these children remain
hidden (8, 9).

lives

Although the appearance of stigma is liable to historical,
cultural, and temporal changes, there is hardly a country, society,
or culture in the world where mental illness is not stigmatized
(12, 13). Stigma is an attribute leading to widespread social
disapproval, and encompasses the negative eﬀects of a label
placed on any group (14, 15). It occurs in social situations,
meaning that stigma does not reside in the person itself, but is the
result of the social context and the perception of the public (16).
People with a mental illness are frequently viewed as dangerous,
unpredictable, incompetent, abnormal, and of weak character
(17). While this is widely true for all types of mental disorders, the
perception of diﬀerent disorders varies and therefore the stigma
attached to it: for instance, schizophrenia is associated with much
more “dangerousness” than depression, resulting in greater social
distancing from the public to the people it is associated with (18).
With regard to the stigma of mental illness, as with other
stigmatized conditions, there is evidence that those aﬀected
themselves by mental illness are not the only individuals who
suﬀer social stigma (19). Goﬀman, who raised the concept of
stigma, has already outlined the phenomenon of the so-called
courtesy stigma in 1963 (15). Nowadays, it is widely known as
stigma by association (SBA) or family stigma, describing family
members as also being exposed to stigma resulting from a
family member’s mental illness (20). An abnormality attributed
to individual family members or the family as a whole is
considered key to the development of family stigma (21). Another
crucial factor in determining whether a SBA occurs appears
to be the entitavity,
i.e. the degree to which two or more
people form a signiﬁcant social unit (22, 23). The higher the
entitavity, the greater the likelihood of being stigmatized on the
basis of association (23). Intimate groups such as families are
attributed the highest degree of entitavity (23)—the association
with a stigmatized family member and one’s own experience of
stigmatization is therefore very likely.

Children and adolescents who grow up with parents with
a mental illness are thus—due to their dependent and close
relationship to the aﬀected person—a particularly vulnerable
group for stigma. They may face the stigma due to the parental
mental illness itself, and due to associated peculiarities and

“otherness” within their families as described above (21, 24,
25). Negative eﬀects in the aﬀected children and young people
arise both from the actual stigma experienced as well as the
fear of being stigmatized and the internalization of stigmatizing
attitudes toward them and their families (24, 26, 27).

There are many theories clarifying the various facets of stigma
for people with a mental illness. Yet there is no comprehensive
theoretical model for SBA. Research suggests that family stigma
is no monolithic phenomenon, because it varies depending on
the relationship the family member has with the person with
the mental illness: studies have shown that parents of children
with a mental illness are more likely to experience the stigma
of neglect and blame for their children’s disease onset (12, 28),
and the siblings of children with a mental illness and spouses of
someone with a mental illness are more likely to experience the
stigma of blame for the persistence of their relative’s disease (12);
COPMI are more likely to face the stigma of “contamination”—
meaning that the general population believes that parental illness,
and especially regarding COPMI, is passed on to children (29).
However, studies in this regard are very sparse. By describing a
“contamination” stigma, authors are often referring to the public
perception of stigma toward COPMI [e.g., (30, 31)], and are
thereby missing out to understand children’s lived experiences.
Thus, these studies possess little informative value if we hope to
understand how children perceive and experience family stigma.
A recent integrative review on the evidence of stigma concepts
for children of parents with a mental illness has shed light on
those limitations by identifying stigma-related experiences and
outcomes as reported by parents and children (29). Nevertheless,
this review shows that a concept which includes the various
dimensions of stigma experiences of children whose parent has
a mental illness is missing. The results of the review show that
children report feelings of embarrassment, shame, and the need
to hide their parental mental illness, but the authors do not
integrate those ﬁndings into an overall framework of diﬀerent
stigma dimensions.

To ﬁll this gap, we have conducted a systematic review to
analyze the COPMI’s experiences of stigma and to identify
speciﬁc stigma dimensions and their characteristics for this
speciﬁc target group (28). Our
review resulted in four
stigma dimensions: (1) Experienced SBA describes personally
experienced prejudice and discrimination (32, 33); (2) anticipated
SBA incorporates expectations that others will devalue and
discriminate against
them in the future (32); (3) aﬃliate
stigma describes the self-stigma of people associated with a
mental illness, i.e. the internalization of public stigma (34); and
(4) structural discrimination, entailing social institutions and
ideological systems that reproduce and maintain the stigmatized
status (14).

In a literature search, we identiﬁed nine scales measuring
mental
illness SBA or family stigma (34–42) as well as
one family-experiences interview with a stigma subscale (43).
Most of the scales only measure the stigma component self-
stigma/internalized stigma (34–36, 40). One of the scales was
a slightly modiﬁed version of a scale constructed for primary
stigma recipients, i.e., people with a mental illness (39). Another
scale was developed to measure the SBA of relatives of patients

with schizophrenia (42); the others were not restricted to a
speciﬁc relative’s mental illness. Six scales as well as the interview
schedule stigma scale were designed for all family members, while
two of the scales measure the stigma parents of children with
a mental illness suﬀer from (40, 41). None of the scales was
constructed or validated for minor children. The items’ wording
is often awkward [e.g., “Most people believe their friends would not
visit them as often if a member of their family were hospitalized
for serious mental illness” (37)]. In addition, the way the items
are phrased often presuppose a great deal of basic knowledge
of certain emotional and cognitive processes, such as “I feel
emotionally disturbed because I have a family member with mental
illness/intellectual disability” (34), or do not seem stigma-speciﬁc:
“Having a family member with mental illness/intellectual disability
imposes a negative impact on me” (34).

Furthermore, we know that stigma varies depending on the
individual’s role within the family, and none of the established
instruments combines all the stigma dimensions highlighted in
the review that are relevant to children with a mentally ill parent.
Our systematic review has revealed aspects of stigma that are
quite speciﬁc to their role as children, for example, being bullied
and teased in school, being isolated because of feeling ashamed
and therefore not inviting friends home, being afraid of passing
on the illness to another generation, being responsible as a child
for the parent’s wellbeing when psychiatrists turn them away,
having nobody to talk to, and not getting enough information
about their parent’s mental illness.

Overall,

for children of parents with a mental

illness,
no suitable instrument exists yet
to measure their stigma
experiences, expectations, self-stigma and the stigma’s structural
dimensions—especially none considering the special role of
children. The current study aimed to describe the development
and initial pilot data on our newly developed Children of Parents
with a Mental Illness—Stigma Questionnaire (COPMI-SQ). This
scale can provide important information to better understand
the complex phenomenon of stigma by association among young
people and shed light on experiences and needs of this group in
intervention studies or anti-stigma campaigns.

METHODS

Figure 1 shows the diﬀerent stages of development for the
COPMI-SQ. We have oriented ourselves to two guidelines for the
development of new scales (44, 45). We are currently reporting
on phase 3 and present our pilot data. Phase 4 is still under way.

Ethics
Research with children and adolescents is always in a ﬁeld of
tension between the respect of the various rights of children and
their special need for protection. In recent decades, a paradigm
shift has occurred within research, in which children are now
rather seen as “moral agents in their own right” (46). As a result,
more research is now being conducted with children to increase

their participation. Researchers and adults in general cannot
assume that their view of the world is congruent with that of
children (46). In order to comply with the UN Convention on
the Rights of the Child, we consider it of fundamental importance
to interview children and adolescents themselves when it comes
to their life experiences and the intention to improve their living
conditions. Since it can be assumed that stigma may aﬀect a lot of
children of parents with mental illness in particular, it is necessary
to obtain their perspectives before interventions are directed past
their needs.

In order to ensure the special protection of children under
guardianship, we followed the guidelines of the Central Ethics
Committee of the German Medical Association (47), which
stipulates a need for an informed consent both from their parents
with a mental disorder and the children themselves in age-
appropriate language prior to study participation. We considered
the costs and beneﬁts of a survey, which could be potentially
burdensome and concluded that the results of the survey oﬀered
great insights into the experiences of this population which could
be beneﬁcially used for further interventions for this population.
However, since it can be assumed that children of parents with
mental illness are particularly exposed to stresses that may also
be related to stigmatizing experiences, they were oﬀered to
contact the persons responsible for the study, who are child and
adolescent psychotherapists, at any time. In addition, they were
advised to contact any trusted adult person in case of need.
Furthermore, prior to study participation, they were informed
that they could withdraw from their participation in the online
study at any time and without giving reasons, up to when the data
were analyzed.

The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the
Psychology Department of Philipps University of Marburg (study
approval number: 2020-20).

Inclusion Criteria
Young people were eligible to participate in the study as long
as they were between 12 and 19 years old and one or both
parents had a mental illness. Information regarding the illness
was obtained through a self-report by the parents. Otherwise,
there were no exclusion criteria.

Phase 1: Item Generation
The ﬁrst step toward designing this new instrument,
the
systematic review, resulted in four diﬀerent dimensions of
i.e. experienced SBA, anticipated
family stigma in COPMI,
SBA, aﬃliate stigma (self-stigma), and structural discrimination.
Those ﬁndings were presented by a PhD student to 50 scientiﬁc
collaborators in Clinical Psychology and Clinical Child and
Adolescent Psychology working groups of Marburg University,
Department of Psychology,
including pre-, post-docs, and
professors. Post-docs and professors further possessed licenses
as psychotherapists and PhD students were psychotherapists in
training. Quotes from primary studies based on a systematic
review with the instruction to collect ideas for items for a survey
were presented to all participants. Initial items that may be used
in a survey for this population and for the diﬀerent dimensions
were generated through group discussions.

The inductively generated items were then compared with
already validated instruments measuring (family) stigma (see
above) to apply formulations already established whenever
possible. Using the established stigma scales, the generated items
were developed further and supplemented in their formulation.

To ensure that every aspect of stigma was covered, the
ﬁrst pool of items was then supplemented by adding further
inductively formed items for every (sub-)sub-category identiﬁed
in the review [for further information see Dobener et al. (28)].
Statements from the included primary studies were included
also to reﬂect as accurately as possible the comments of the
target group members themselves in the items. For each category
identiﬁed in the review, 5–15 items were formed. A total of 109
items was generated in phase 1.

Phase 2: Content Validity and
Comprehensibility Analysis
Expert Discussion
The entire item pool was then reviewed and discussed by a panel
of experts from our and other known working groups, with
knowledge in developing questionnaires as well as in the ﬁeld
of stigma. The experts were asked to rate all items according to
the extent to which they seemed to be an appropriate measure of
the intended construct. They were also asked to provide open-
ended feedback. Items agreed upon by at least two of the three
experts were retained or reworded according to their comments.
This ensured that only items that were understandable and
meaningful in terms of both content and language were used.
Through this process, the item pool was reduced to 96 items since
the expert panel revealed problems like overly complex wording,
repetition, or other violations of “best-practices” regarding item
structure (48).

Comprehensibility Analysis With Children
In a further step, ﬁve children and adolescents of diﬀerent ages
whose parents have a mental illness ﬁlled in the questionnaire
to check comprehensibility. They completed the COPMI-SQ
in the presence of the author L-MD, to enable immediate
feedback on any diﬃculties in understanding. In addition to the
comprehensibility check, this allowed us to see whether ﬁlling
in the COPMI-SQ was associated with any mental stress when
confronted with the eﬀects of their parents’ illness. According
to the children’s feedback, some items were reworded, and three
were removed entirely.

At the end of this second phase, the item pool was reduced
to 93 items, of which 91 were closed questions and two were
open-ended. Due to the complexity of wording and the general
need for any mental illness concept as well as children’s feedback,
we found our survey to be most suitable for children and
adolescents aged 12–19 years. For younger children, the language
and delivery as an online survey does not seem the right format.

Phase 3: Piloting
Our questionnaire was piloted in an online survey with a sample
of children and adolescents having at least one parent with a
mental illness.

COPMI-Stigma Questionnaire (COPMI-SQ)

The study was conducted using the online platform
SosciSurvey (49) between March and May 2021. All participants
were part of a convenience sample—either contacted as part of
an ongoing study [COMPARE-family, see (4, 50), via university
mailing lists or clinical
institutions; e.g., psychiatric clinics,
psychotherapy outpatient clinics]. Participants could participate
in a raﬄe of several gifts as study reimbursement. Inclusion
criteria for the COPMI-SQ-validation were having a parent with
a mental illness and being 12–19 years of age. Participants were
not excluded if they themselves had a mental illness.

Measures
Participants
responded to questions pertaining to socio-
demographic characteristics (age, school grade, living situation,
etc.) and questions about their parent’s mental illness and their
own health status.

COPMI-SQ
Stigma experiences in COPMI were measured via the 93 items in
the newly developed COPMI-SQ. Participants were ﬁrst asked to
complete two open-ended sentences: “I think about people with a
mental illness ...” and “Others think about people with a mental
illness ...”. Afterwards, they were asked to rate each of the 91
closed items on a visual analog scale (VAS). The VAS consisted
of a line with verbal anchors (“strongly disagree” on the far left
and “strongly agree” on the far right). All of the items were scored
from 1 to 101, with 1 meaning no agreement at all, 101 meaning
full agreement. Most of the items were preceded by an item
root like “Because my mother/my father has a mental illness,...”,
others were presented separately. The questionnaire consists
of 26 reversed coded items, whose agreement represented a
low stigma experience to control for and identify acquiescence
response bias (51), see Supplementary Table S1. For all other
items, the higher the agreement, the greater the experience
of stigma.

The ﬁrst theoretically assumed dimension, experienced stigma
by association (SBA), consisted of 18 items representing varied
aspects of directly experienced stigmatization as a result of the
parental mental illness; for example, experiencing rejection by
others, inappropriate and hurtful language or warnings, and
obviously discriminatory behavior such as bullying.

The second theoretically assumed dimension, anticipated SBA,
was captured across 20 items and included fears of stigmatizing
behavior or the attitudes of others if they found out about the
parental mental illness.

For the third theoretically assumed dimension, self-stigma, 23
items were constructed to capture diﬀerent facets of self-stigma:
the feeling of being “contaminated” by the parental illness, the
shame associated with the parental illness, feelings of guilt, and
feeling generally inferior compared to other people.

The fourth and last
the

theoretically assumed dimension
represents
experienced structural discrimination and
was captured by 30 items. This included discrimination in
the education system,
the media, and
discrimination in society as a whole. Our instrument’s entire
structure and all its items are found in Supplementary Table S1.

the health system,

Statistics
Sample Size
We aimed to recruit about 200 participants to validate the
scale’s psychometric properties. The sample size of 200 is
considered adequate for validating an instrument, i.e., for item
analyses, and factor analyses to examine the questionnaire’s
multidimensionality (52, 53).

Missing Values and Outliers
The online survey was designed so that all items had to be
answered. Thus, none of the included cases had any missing
values. However, there was a ﬁlter question addressing parental
hospitalization. If this was answered positively, all the subsequent
questions were posed only to COPMI whose parent(s) had
been hospitalized; this group formed a smaller subsample of
only 18 children. All items were analyzed for univariate outliers
using boxplots. Conspicuous cases were assessed as realistic after
examination and were in a generally inconspicuous range across
the mean values achieved; thus they were not excluded from
further analyses.

Item Analyses
General Procedure
The item analyses were carried out in three phases. In the ﬁrst
phase, items were checked at the subscale level for appropriate
item diﬃculty and discriminatory power, and subscales were
adjusted by removing inappropriate items. Due to content
considerations, some psychometrically inappropriate items were
retained. In the second phase, the adjusted subscales were
combined into an overall scale, the items were rechecked for
their characteristic values, and unsuitable items were removed
accordingly to improve global consistency and increase the
suitability of the overall instrument. In the third phase, the
subscales of the COPMI-SQ were adapted to the structure of
the ﬁnal overall instrument, and the ﬁnal instrument’s internal
consistency was calculated again. Statistical analyses were carried
out using SPSS, version 20.

Item Diﬃculty Index
Given that the COPMI-SQ is intended to allow diﬀerentiation
across a broad spectrum of
trait values, we aimed for a
distribution of item diﬃculties of 20 < Pi <80 [see (54)].
Since extremely diﬃcult, or very easy items hardly allow
diﬀerentiation between test persons, items with values below
20 and above 80 were considered more closely. Items of very
low or extreme diﬃculty were checked for their discriminatory
power and their retention or removal from the item pool was
supplemented with content considerations. The exact reasons for
retaining or deleting a given conspicuous item are provided in
Supplementary Table S1.

Discriminatory Power
The item discrimination index was calculated using the corrected
item-total-correlation. Values of rit between 0.3 and 0.5 were
considered acceptable; 0.5< rit <0.7 is considered good
discriminatory power (54). All
items whose discriminatory
power was below 0.3 were scrutinized, and usually removed to

COPMI-Stigma Questionnaire (COPMI-SQ)

ensure high internal consistency of the subscales and the overall
instrument. However, those items with cut-oﬀ values below 0.3
were checked for their relevance to the content and either deleted
or reformulated when evaluating strongly relevant content. They
were then removed one after the other and new item-total
correlations were calculated in each case to see how the items
interacted. The order of removal of the items and content-related
considerations is illustrated in Supplementary Table S1.

Internal Reliability
Cronbach’s alpha was calculated to measure the COPMI-SQ’s
internal reliability (55). This should attain a value of at least 0.7
for the subscales—the widely accepted criterion for Cronbach’s
alpha [e.g., (56)].

RESULTS

Sample
All participants (N = 32) were between 13 and 19 years of age
(M = 15.75, SD = 2.05). Sixty-ﬁve percent of the participants
were female. The COPMI usually lived together with their parent
with a mental illness (93.8%). Three COPMIs reported having
both parents with a mental illness. Mothers were most often
aﬀected (60%). The most common parental diagnosis was a mood
disorder such as bipolar disorder and depression (maternal:
54.2%; paternal: 82.3%), followed by anxiety disorders (maternal:
16.7%; 11.8% paternal). Almost half of the children stated to
have already suﬀered from a mental illness themselves (46.9%).
These were, similar to the parental diagnoses, usually mood
disorders (32%). All the sample characteristics are provided in
Table 1.

As COPMI are an exceedingly diﬃcult

target group to
reach (57, 58), we were unable to recruit enough COPMI to
assess decisively the questionnaire’s psychometric goodness of
ﬁt, despite intensive recruitment eﬀorts. Nevertheless, according
to Johanson and Brooks (59), 30 representative participants
from the population of interest suﬃce for a pilot study to
test a new instrument in terms of preliminary item analyses,
estimates of internal consistency and proportions of people
responding to speciﬁc options. For factor and further analyses,
more participants are needed, so we focused on the item analyses,
especially to reduce the number of items requiring further
validation and evaluation of the COPMI-SQ, in order to make the
questionnaire more practical and reduce participation thresholds
as well as raise the quality of the instrument.

Item Analysis on Subscale Level
Experienced SBA Subscale
Initial Cronbach’s alpha equalled 0.940 (see Table 4). In the
experienced SBA scale, two items revealed low item diﬃculty,
and one item a low item-total correlation. The item with the low
item-total correlation was thus removed. However, the two items
of low item diﬃculty were retained after content considerations.
Both had a discriminatory power above 0.7. The item “Because
my mother/my father has a mental illness, my friends no longer
want to be friends with me” was retained because this aspect
addressing the loss of friendship stood out in the review as a

by any other item. Similar considerations applied to the item
“Because my mother/my father has a mental illness, I’m bullied at
school/university/work”: the aspect of bullying has been described
in the literature, and as it is not covered by any other item in the
questionnaire, we retained this item.

Anticipated SBA Subscale
In the anticipated SBA subscale (initial Cronbach’s alpha of
0.927), four items revealed a low item-total-correlation; one
of
them also revealed low diﬃculty. The item with low
discriminatory power and low diﬃculty was removed ﬁrst.
After considering the content, the other items with too little
discriminatory power were also removed one after the other,
because they were either covered by other items or classiﬁed as

increased item-total correlation within the subscale.

Afﬁliate Stigma Subscale
In the Aﬃliate Stigma subscale with an initial alpha of 0.904,
two items were conspicuous due to low diﬃculty and two
items due to low discriminatory power. The item with negative
discriminatory power was removed ﬁrst, as it seems to be
misleading. Furthermore, its content was already covered by
other items. The other item with low discriminatory power was
also removed. The item “Because my mother/father has a mental
illness, I don’t think I should have children of my own later” was
retained despite its low diﬃculty because it measures the belief in
contamination, which has consequences for future plans, and is
not covered by any other items. Furthermore, the other item of
low diﬃculty “I feel like I’m carrying around a sign: He/she has a
mother/father with a mental illness” was also retained because, it
was adapted from an evaluated stigma scale and, additionally, the
aspect of “contamination” is otherwise not suﬃciently embodied
in comparison to “inferiority.”

Structural Discrimination Subscale
Out of the Structural Discrimination subscale with an initial
alpha of 0.817, 16 items revealed low discriminatory power.
Of these, one had very high and one very low item diﬃculty.
The ﬁrst ones deleted stepwise were those three items with
negative item-total correlation, indicating that they measured
something completely diﬀerent. Further items of very low
discriminatory power were then successively removed, starting
with those intended to measure discrimination within the mental
health system. This was because it was clearly overrepresented
compared to the other dimensions of the subscale.

The item “At school, I’d like to learn more about mental
illness” was retained despite its low discriminatory power,
ﬁrstly because it was on the edge of acceptance (rit = 0.295),
secondly, in order to maintain the proportions to the other
structural stigma dimensions to some extent, and thirdly, because
the content of the item was attributed a special signiﬁcance
concerning possible interventions. For the media as a source of
structural discrimination, the item “In the media, mental illness is
portrayed negatively, which contributes to many people developing
prejudices” was retained despite its low item-total-correlation; for
the reason of having at least two items representing this source
of discrimination. In addition, we reworded the item in order to
avoid multidimensionality as follows “Mental illness is portrayed
negatively in the media.”

Item Analysis on Total Scale
In the second phase of the item analyses, i.e., when assessing
the internal reliability of
instrument, one item
in the Aﬃliate Stigma scale and an item in the Structural
Discrimination scale showed low item-total correlations and
were therefore deleted. Supplementary Table S1 shows which
items were aﬀected.

the overall

Revised COPMI-SQ
Our instrument was reduced to a total of 67 items after the three
phases of item analyses. The revised instrument is illustrated
in Table 2. The ﬁnal version of the Experienced SBA subscale
now consists of 17 items, with Cronbach’s alpha = 0.948 and
item-total-correlations from good (lowest 0.395 for the item
“There are people I can talk to about my fears and worries.”)
to very high (highest 0.905 for item “Because my mother/father
has a mental illness, my classmates/colleagues/work colleagues
tease me.”). The ﬁnal subscale Anticipated SBA (Cronbach’s alpha
= 0.949) shows item-total correlations between 0.426 (item “If
others found out about my mother’s/father’s illness, it wouldn’t
change their behavior toward me”) and 0.877 (item “they’d bad-
mouth me.”), see Supplementary Table S1. The ﬁnal subscale of
Aﬃliate Stigma consists of 19 items, with item-total correlations
ranging between 0.449 (item: “I’m just a normal kid like any
other.”) to 0.820 (item: “Because my mother/my father has a
mental illness, I think there’s something wrong with me”), and
with Cronbach’s alpha = 0.933. The item-total-correlations for
the ﬁnal subscale of Structural Discrimination (STD) are the
lowest compared to the other subscales, and range from 0.282
(item “In media, mental illness is appropriately portrayed”), which
is actually below acceptable discriminatory power, but will be
kept to ensure the media source of discrimination is represented,
to 0.705 (item: “In school, I don’t feel disadvantaged because of my
mother’s/father’s illness”). The revised STD subscale results in a
Cronbach’s alpha of 0.868.

Table 3 shows our sample’s scores on the ﬁnal subscales
and the overall COPMI-SQ instrument. Overall, the sample
shows very similar average levels of
family stigma on the
subscales Experienced SBA, Anticipated SBA, Aﬃliate Stigma and
the overall instrument. Here COPMI, with a mean score of
30, tend to be in the lower third of the possible values. On
the STD subscale, COPMI are in the middle range of values.
Supplementary Table 2 illustrates the intercorrelations of the
ﬁnal instrument scales. Overall, these tend to demonstrate small
to very large correlations, all of which are signiﬁcant.

Internal Reliability
Table 4 shows the internal consistencies for both the initial
subscales and subscales adjusted by the item analyses as described
above. The internal consistencies for the overall instrument are
also visible in Table 4. We observed an improvement in all the
scales’ consistencies. We detected internal consistencies between
α = 0.868 and α = 0.975 across the scales.

DISCUSSION

This study reports on the development and piloting of a
questionnaire to assess stigma in children of parents with
a mental
instrument
illness. The COPMI-SQ is the ﬁrst
incorporating diﬀerent stigma by association dimensions tailored
to the stigma experiences of children of parents with a mental
illness. After reducing the item number, the ﬁnal version of
the COPMI-SQ consists of 67 items representing four subscales:
experienced stigma (17 items), anticipated stigma (16 items), self-
stigma (19 items) and structural discrimination (15 items). The

Scale characteristics of the sample on the revised subscales and the overall instrument
COPMI-SQ after adjustments according to the item analyses.

COPMI-SQ, once validated, can be used to better understand
the complex phenomenon of stigma by association among young
people and also to target the experiences and needs of this
group in intervention studies or anti-stigma campaigns. As the
questionnaire also captures which parental condition in which
parent is present, it can be used to create insights to the extent
to which stigma experiences vary for diﬀerent parental disorders.
In addition, it could potentially support shedding light on the
gendered theoretical landscape of parenting.

Developing the Instrument
The approach we took to develop the instrument followed
scientiﬁcally accepted principles (20) by ensuring various
construction phases. The construction process relied on (family)
stigma theories (14, 20, 39, 60, 61), incorporated qualitative
results from a comprehensive systematic review to best reﬂect
the expressed stigma experiences of aﬀected children (28), and
included expert opinions on the initially constructed items. The
COPMI-SQ is thus considered a solid basis for further reliability
and validity studies.

Item Reduction
We ran into diﬃculty with item analyses due to the fact that it
was not a test construction for which clear rules could be applied
while considering the required item diﬃculties or discriminatory
power. Although recommendations could be used as a guide,
each change or reduction of the item pool had to be made
by carefully considering the content. For example, the subscale
“Structural Discrimination” represents a very heterogeneous set
of items, as they were meant to represent diﬀerent institutional
sources of discrimination, for example the educational system,
as well as the media and the health care system. In this respect,
we had to assume that discrimination perceived in one societal
structure does not necessarily go hand in hand with a high level
of discrimination in another, as there are unintended public
and private sector policies that restrict opportunities for some
groups (62) and we do not yet know precisely how they interact
(62, 63). This means that the item-total correlations it did for not
have to meet the same requirements as did the other subscales.
We also had to make sure we did not over- or under-represent
some sub-aspects.

Nevertheless, a detailed explanation of

the reasons for
deleting or retaining the items ensures transparency, and very
high item-total correlations were achieved overall. Only in
the “Structural Discrimination” subscale one item with a low

internal consistency refers to all original

item-total-correlation, namely “In the media, mental illness is
appropriately portrayed” remained in the questionnaire. This can
be justiﬁed due to the item’s relevance to the content and that
its discriminatory power of 0.282 was only minimally below the
acceptable limit of 0.3. Nevertheless, items of low discriminatory
power or showing low item-total correlations must be examined
more closely in the further validation course in a factor analysis.
The very high values regarding internal reliability and the
increase in Cronbach’s alpha in each subscale, as well as in the
ﬁnal instrument compared to its ﬁrst version suggest that we
made the right decisions here.

We detected overall very strong correlations between the
various subscales in the questionnaire’s revised form. This may
be an initial indication that also a one factor model may be
considered. In a further validation study, factor structure and
dimensionality have to be examined.

Evaluating Reliability and Validity
The ﬁnal COPMI-SQ’s internal reliability can be considered
internal
as very good.
It demonstrates good to excellent
internal
consistency in the subscales, as well as excellent
reliability of the instrument as a whole. We ensured content
validity through an expert panel, and evaluated the diﬃculty of
understanding items with children themselves. However, due to
the impossibility of conducting a factor analysis, whether these
subscales are conﬁrmed by the instrument’s factor structure and
multidimensionality cannot be assessed yet.

Test-retest reliability could not be assessed due to an
insuﬃcient sample size. However, we can assume that stigma
experiences are also not constant variables. New experiences can
always emerge, so that if test-retest reliability is to be measured,
there should be a shorter time span between them. Furthermore,
the mere questioning of these experiences could also lead to
some young people, especially when confronted with the topic
for the ﬁrst time through the questionnaire, potentially being
sensitized to subsequent experiences and accordingly revealing
higher values at a later point in time.

Strengths and Limitations
The greatest strength of the present study is that the COPMI-
SQ was theory-based and developed supported by an extensive
systematic review.

COPMI-Stigma Questionnaire (COPMI-SQ)

There are several areas

improvement and further
for
investigations. About half of the participants reported having
a mental illness of their own—a good representation of the
population of children of parents with mental illness (64), but this
means that their responses may be cofounded by experiencing
stigma due to their own illness. Due to recruitment diﬃculties,
we were unable to identify enough participants to permit a factor
analysis and investigate multidimensionality and factor structure.
The assumed four factors are not supported by the very high
inter-correlations of the assumed subscales, but they cannot be
ruled out either. However, the study is still ongoing. With the
reduced number of items due to the item analyses, we can reach
our sample size more easily. Other recruitment strategies, such
as recruiting via schools, must be integrated in the future to
reach this vulnerable target group. Since this paper is concerned
with the methodology of developing a new instrument, content-
related considerations of the diﬀerent dimensions of stigma have
been marginalized. A more detailed discussion of the meaning
and interconnectedness of the diﬀerent dimensions can be found
in the paper reporting the results of the systematic review (28).

Implications for Further Research and Use
of the COPMI-SQ
In a further validation study, we will aim to recruit approximately
200 COPMI to examine our questionnaire’s multidimensionality.
In the ﬁrst step, this should be examined via an exploratory factor
analysis (EFA). An EFA is preferable to a conﬁrmatory factor
analysis (CFA), since it is possible that factor structures other
than those expected might emerge (45). Especially as high inter-
correlations between the subscales might indicate a one-factor
structure, uni-dimensionality should also be checked. A CFA
should then be conducted on a separate sample to conﬁrm the
structure of the scales resulting from the EFA.

A further validated COPMI-SQ could be used to help develop
anti-stigma and general interventions for this population. Our
ﬁrst pilot data promises good reliability of the a priori assumed
subscales. As our scale is constructed for young people aged 12–
19, it can be used as a starting point to develop a scale addressing
the same problem for younger children. A more creative and
interactive way of getting those information from younger
children, should be developed, to be able to incorporate younger
children’s views as well. Research in children’s lived experiences
is limited, and this is especially true for younger children.
