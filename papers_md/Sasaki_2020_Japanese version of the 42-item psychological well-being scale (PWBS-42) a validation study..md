Abstract

Background: The aim of this study was to examine the internal consistency, structural validity, and convergent/
known-group validity of the Japanese version of the 42-item Psychological Well-Being Scale (PWBS-42).
Methods: The PWBS-42 includes six 7-item subscales designed to measure the following dimensions of eudaimonic
psychological well-being: 1) autonomy, 2) environmental mastery, 3) personal growth, 4) positive relations with
others, 5) purpose in life, and 6) self-acceptance. A questionnaire was administered to 2102 community residents in
Tokyo aged 30 or over as a part of the Midlife in Japan (MIDJA) survey, in 2008. The internal consistency reliability
was tested using Cronbach’s α. Structural validity was examined using exploratory factor analysis (EFA). Convergent
validity was evaluated by calculating correlations of the Japanese PWBS-42 subscales with life satisfaction, negative
affect, negative adjectives, positive affect, positive adjectives, self-esteem, and perceived stress scales.

Results: Data from 1027 respondents (505 males and 522 females) were analyzed (valid response rate = 56.2%).
Cronbach’s α values ranged from 0.70 to 0.78 for five of the subscales, while that for purpose in life was lower
(0.57). EFA yielded a five-factor structure: The first two factors consisted of negative and positive items mostly from
the environmental mastery, purpose in life, and self-acceptance subscales. The third, fourth, and fifth factors
consisted mostly of items from the positive relations with others, autonomy, and personal growth subscales,
respectively. As hypothesized, the scores for life satisfaction, negative and positive affect/adjectives, self-esteem and
perceived stress were significantly correlated with all subscales of the Japanese PWBS-42.

Conclusion: The subscales of the Japanese version of the PWBS-42 showed accep. levels of reliability and support
for convergent validity in the Japanese population. The factor structure was slightly different from the theoretical 6-
factor model: items of three subscales (environmental mastery, purpose in life, and self-acceptance) loaded together
on two factors. This finding may be interpreted in light of the interdependent self construal found in Japan in
which these three components could be closely linked.

Background
Eudaimonic well-being has been often discussed as pur-
pose in life, meaning of life [1, 2], or as a concept rele-
vant to self-determination theory [3, 4]. One of the most
famous models of eudaimonic well-being is the psycho-
logical well-being (PWB) model, developed by Carol D.
Ryff [5]. PWB integrated psychological concepts such as
self-actualization [6] and being a fully functioning per-
son [7], distilling six key factors of well-being: autonomy,
environmental mastery, personal growth, positive rela-
tions with others, purpose in life, and self-acceptance.
The association of Ryff’s PWB with various health out-
comes has been well-documented [8]: overall longer sur-
vival [9],
low risk of physical diseases such as stroke
[10], myocardial infarction [11], and metabolic syndrome
[12], and low risk of mental illness such as depression
[13, 14], insomnia [15] and Alzheimer’s disease [16]. In
terms of biological functioning, higher levels of PWB as-
sociated with lower level of plasma cytokines [17, 18].

Since promoting PWB can contribute to people’s personal
growth, career development, and successful aging, measuring
and promoting PWB among the Japanese population might
be helpful for solving important issues in life at every stage.
PWB has been frequently measured with Ryff’s Psychological
Well-Being Scales (PWBS) [19]. The reliability and validity of
the PWBS has been established in more than 30 languages
and across various cultures [20, 21].

In Japan, three published articles have examined meas-
urement of PWB in Japanese samples [22–24]. However,
the measures the researchers used made it difficult to
compare scores with those in other languages: two of
them were not developed based on Ryff’s original items
of PWBS [22, 23], the other one [24] had 84 items which
were rated dichotomously, with categories of “Yes” or
“No”. However, in cross-cultural cohort studies, it is more
common for items to be rated on 6- or 7-point Likert
scales. In addition, the measures used in these three stud-
ies have limitations in terms of balance between the bur-
den on the participants of completing them and adequate
depth of measurement, thus raising questions about the
credibility of their assessments of the six well-being con-
structs. Although the length of the PWBS ranges from 18
[25] to 120 items [19], the ultra-short (18 items) version
had psychometric problems of low internal consistency
(0.33 < Cronbach’s alpha < 0.56) [25], while acceptable cri-
teria is regarded Cronbach’s alpha > 0.7. Moreover, the
84- and 120-items versions imposed an undue burden on
the respondents [8, 19, 26, 27]. The 42-item PWBS has
been recently recognized as achieving the needed balance,
and has been adopted in several studies including the
Midlife in the United States (MIDUS) survey, a large co-
hort study in the United States [8, 28].

Hence, the purpose of this study is to examine the in-
ternal consistency, structural validity, and convergent/

known-group validity of the Japanese version of the 42-
item PWBS among the general population in Japan. In
addition, we considered the interpretability of
this
measurement.

Methods
Study design and participants
This is a validation study for a self-report measure of
well-being. The Midlife in Japan (MIDJA) study surveyed
2102 community residents aged 30–79 years old living in
the 23 wards of Tokyo city from April to September
2008 [29]. The responses were collected from 1027
adults (505 men and 522 women; age range = 30 to 79
years). The overall response rate was 56.2%. It was found
that 275 participants were non-eligible (i.e., undelivered)
due to having moved, unknown address, being absent
during the time of the survey, illness, injury, being hospi-
talized or being deceased, which described in detail else-
where (data available upon request). The primary
objective of the MIDJA is to compare the Japanese sam-
ple (MIDJA) with the United States sample (MIDUS) to
test hypotheses linking constructs of
interdependence
and independence to well-being and health. All respon-
dents completed a self-administered questionnaire. The
Research Ethics Committee of the Graduate School of
Medicine in The University of Tokyo approved this
study (no. 1691- [5]).

The study was reported according to the Consensus-
based Standards for the Selection of Health Measurement
Instruments (COSMIN) guideline, which is used to im-
prove the quality of efforts to develop health-related self-
report measurement instruments [30]. Each finding for
properties of measurement in this study was assessed by
the COSMIN Risk of Bias checklist (Additional file 1).

Measurements
Psychological well-being scale (PWBS)
With permission from Professor Ryff, the developer of
the PWBS, we translated the 42 items of the PWBS into
Japanese. The PWBS [19] originally comprised six sub-
scales with seven items each to measure the six factors:
1) autonomy (e.g., I am not afraid to voice my opinions,
even when they are in opposition to the opinions of
most people.); 2) environmental mastery (e.g., In general,
I feel I am in charge of the situation in which I live.); 3)
personal growth(e.g., I think it is important to have new
experiences that challenge how I think about myself and
the world.); 4) positive relations with others(e.g., Most
people see me as loving and affectionate.); 5) purpose in
life(e.g., I have a sense of direction and purpose in life.);
and 6) self-acceptance(e.g., In general, I feel confident
and positive about myself.). Response categories for
these items are on a seven-point scale: ranging from 1
(“Strongly disagree”) to 7 (“Strongly agree”). The scores

for six subscales were calculated as averages; higher
scores mean greater psychological well-being.

The authors complied with the International Society for
Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR) task-
force guidelines [31], which constitute the standard proced-
ure for translation and adaptation of self-reporting scales in
other languages. The forward (from English to Japanese)
translation of the PWBS 42 items was prepared by Prof. Kar-
asawa, who is a research member of the MIDJA, with con-
siderable knowledge about the theoretical background of
PWB. The forward translation was reviewed and revised by
colleagues at The University of Tokyo to confirm its rele-
vance and meaningfulness. After these consultations with re-
searchers, the slightly amended version was back-translated
into English by an independent translator who was blind to
the original English version and reviewed by research mem-
bers of MIDJA. The original developer, Prof. Ryff, reviewed
this back translation and further corrections were made
based on her suggestions.

Life satisfaction (6 items)
Life satisfaction was measured by the newly developed
six items scale for the MIDUS/MIDJA (e.g., “How would
you rate your life overall these days”). Assessing overall,
work, health, family (the mean of ratings for relationship
with spouse/partner and relationship with children) and
financial satisfaction each question asked participants
about their satisfaction with their life on current days on
a scale ranging from 0 (the worst possible) to 10 (the
best possible). The overall score was constructed by cal-
culating the mean of the items. The scale was computed
for cases that had valid values for at least one item on
the scale. Higher scores reflect higher levels of overall
life satisfaction, meaning high hedonic well-being. In this
study sample, the internal consistency reliability of the
scale (Cronbach’s alpha) was 0.75 [32].

the indicators of hedonic well-being.

Positive and negative affect/adjective
Positive and negative adjectives were measured by four
and five items of each (e.g., enthusiastic, attentive, proud,
active, afraid, jittery, irritable, ashamed, upset) from The
Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS)
[33],
which is a widely used mood measurement and regarded
as one of
In
addition, positive affect was each measured by six items
(i.e., cheerful, in good spirits, extremely happy, calm and
peaceful, satisfied, full of life), because such low arousal
positive feeling has been reported to have stronger link
with health among Japanese people, other than high
arousal feelings, measured by PANAS [34]. The negative
affect was also measured by an original six-item scale
consisting one item on “nervousness” from PANAS and
items from other sources (i.e., so sad nothing could
that
cheer

fidgety, hopeless,

restless or

you up,

everything was an effort, worthless). Additional
items
both in positive and negative affect were retrieved from
the previous study [35]. This study used the past 30 days
as the time frame (i.e.., During the past 30 days, how
much of the time did you feel…). All items were rated
on a 5-point Likert-type scale, ranging from 1 “None of
the time” to 5 “All of the time”. Scales were constructed
by calculating the mean across each set of items. The
scales were computed for cases that had valid values for
at least one item on the scale. In this study sample, the
internal consistency reliability (Cronbach’s alpha) of the
scales for 1) positive affect, 2) positive adjective, 3) nega-
tive affect, 4) negative adjective was 1) 0.93, 2) 0.80, 3)
0.86 and 4) 0.82 respectively [32]. We used these four
sub-scales as a measurement of affect to keep their inde-
pendent construction. Positive affect and adjective in this
questionnaire is well validated elsewhere [34].

Self-esteem (7 items)
Self-esteem was measured with a scale consisting of seven
items taken from Rosenberg’s self-esteem scales [36] (e.g.,
“I am able to do things as well as most people”). A re-
sponse to each item was scored on a seven-point scale
ranging from 1 (agree strongly) to 7 (disagree strongly). In
this study sample, Cronbach’s alpha for men and women
was 0.63 and 0.69 [37], respectively.

Perceived stress (10 items)
Perceived stress was measured with the Perceived Stress
Scale (PSS) [38, 39], which asked 10 items about their
recognized stressors on these 30 days (e.g., “felt that you
were unable to control the important things in your
life?”). Each item was rated on five-point scale ranging
from 1 (Never) to 5 (Very often). In this study sample,
Cronbach’s alpha was 0.76 [37].

Demographic variables
A questionnaire was administered to assess demographic
variables, including gender (male or female), age, educa-
tion status (Junior high school, some high school, high
school, vocational school, 2 year college, some college, 4
or 6 year college or over graduate school), marital status
(married, divorced/widowed or single) and work status
(Have a paid job or Do not have a paid job).

Statistical analysis
Statistical significance was defined as p < 0.05. All the
statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 26.0, Jap-
anese version (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL).

Before conducting the analyses, the scores of some
items were reversed as recommended in Ryff’s original
PWBS [19]. For an item with a missing value, the mean
value of the completed items was imputed. The scales
were computed for cases that had valid values for at

least one item in each domain following the documenta-
tion of “Scales and Constructed Variables in MIDJA”
guide [32].

To assess the internal consistency of the Japanese
PWBS, Cronbach’s alpha (α) coefficients were calculated
for each of the six subscales. To assess structural valid-
ity, confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was conducted to
test the goodness of fit for the existing structure of psy-
chological well-being, and an exploratory factor analysis
(EFA) was conducted in case the CFA showed a poor fit.
Based on previous research, we hypothesized a six-factor
structure. In addition, we extracted factors with eigen-
values of more than 1.0, following the Kaiser–Guttman
“Eigenvalues greater than one” criterion [40–42], using
robust maximum likelihood estimation. In the two EFAs,
the promax rotation method was adopted to calculate
factor loadings for the items. As a hypothesis test for
convergent validity, Pearson’s correlation coefficients (rs)
were calculated between each score of the PWBS and
life satisfaction, positive and negative affect/adjectives,
and perceived stress, which was considered to have
moderate-to-strong associations with psychological well-
being. Positive and moderate correlations would be ex-
pected with life satisfaction, positive affect/adjectives,
and self-esteem. Negative and moderate correlations
would be expected with negative affect/adjectives and
perceived stress. Although these measures consisted of
distinct components of well-being, prior research re-
vealed relations among evaluative, hedonic and eudai-
monic well-being [43]. In addition, a one-way factorial
ANOVA was performed as another hypothesis test for
known-group validity to compare the scores of the six
subscales of the Japanese PWBS when stratified based on
demographic and occupational variables (sex, age, marital
status and working status). For these demographic and oc-
cupational variables, we observed significant differences
from the PWB scores in previous studies (e.g., high per-
sonal growth and purpose in life in the elderly, high posi-
tive relationship with others in women) [25].

Results
Characteristics of participants
We received responses from 1027 members (56.2%) of
the target sample. The proportion of males was 49.2%,
and average age was 54.4 years old. The demographic
characteristics of the participants are shown in Table 1.
Many of the participants were married (69.1%) and had
a paid job (71.6%).

Internal consistency
Table 2 shows mean scores and Cronbach’s alphas (α)
for the PWBS-42 subscales. The Cronbach’s α coeffi-
cients ranged from 0.70 to 0.78, except for that for Pur-
pose in life (α = 0.57).

a All items showed significant factor loading

and no item loaded on the sixth factor (data available
upon request). Then, we tried conducting another EFA
that hypothesized a 5-factor structure with the promax
rotation method, which allows factors to correlate with
each other, using a robust maximum likelihood estima-
tion. Table 4 shows that
the EFA then successfully
yielded five factors. The first two factors consisted of
negative and positive items mostly from environmental
mastery, purpose in life, and self-acceptance. The third,
fourth, and fifth factors consisted mostly of items for
positive relations with others, autonomy, and personal
growth, respectively. EFA according to the Kaiser–Gutt-
man’s criterion indicated an eight-factor structure (data
available upon request). Authors did not adopt
the
model because it was difficult to interpret the meaning-
fulness of the eight factors and there were few items
loaded on the subordinate factors.

Table 5 shows correlations between the scores of the
theoretical subscales that originally assumed on the
PWBS-42 and scores of the five factors extracted from
the previous EFA. Each factor score was sum of items.
There were significant and exclusive correlation between
the five factors and the six subscales of the PWBS-42;
Factor 2 and Self-acceptance, Factor 3 and Positive

relationship with others, Factor 4 and Autonomy, and
Factor 5 and Personal growth. Factor 1 showed moder-
ate association with all theoretical six subscales.

Hypothesis testing

1. Convergent validity

Table 6 shows correlations between the scores of the
six subscales of the PWBS-42 and life satisfaction, posi-
tive and negative affect/adjectives, self-esteem, and per-
ceived stress. Although the EFA showed a five-factor
structure, we presented average scores and correlations
of the original six subscales because it was planned as
part of validation and for keeping the international com-
parability. In addition, we cannot conclude that the ori-
ginal six-factor structure and the observed five-factor
structure are definitely different as shown in Table 5. All
scales were significantly correlated with all domains of
PWB. Scales related to negative feelings (i.e., negative
affect, adjective, PSS) were correlated negatively with all
domains (− 0.55 < r < − 0.13). Positive scales (i.e., life sat-
isfaction, positive affect, adjectives, self-esteem) were
correlated positively with all domains (0.24 < r < 0.71).

2. Known-group validity

Table 7 shows the results of ANOVAs to examine the
differences between each category for the demographic
characteristics (sex, age, marital and working status).
One-way ANOVA revealed some significant differences
among variables (e.g., high autonomy in males, high per-
sonal growth in workers).

Discussion
The results showed an acceptable level of
internal
consistency reliability of the newly translated Japanese
version of the PWBS-42, although careful consideration
of the results was need given that factor analysis showed
a five-factor structure. Cronbach’s alpha coefficient was
lower for the scales for purpose in life, possibly because
one item of “Done all there is to do in life” (the item P7)
behaved differently than the other items. The results of
CFA did not show a good model fit for the previously
proposed six-factor structure model. The correlation
analysis showed theoretically high correlation with other
scales, supporting convergent validity. The ANOVA
confirmed the hypothesized differences according to
demographic characteristics between known independ-
ent groups (population in U.S. [25] vs. Japan), suggesting
good known-group validity, as described in detail below.
We found that the original six-factor model [5] did not
fit well with the present data in the CFA. Rather, the EFA
suggested a five-factor structure. The first two factors

consisted of negatively and positively worded items mostly
from environmental mastery, purpose in life, and self-
acceptance, as well as some items from the other sub-
scales. The result for the correlation analysis also showed
that Factor 1 and 2 was highly related (r > 0.8) with envir-
onmental mastery and self-acceptance. Factor 1 had high
correlation (r > 0.7) with most of PWB subscales instead
of autonomy and purpose in life. The highest correlation
among them was with environmental mastery, identifying
the EFA result that the top three items of high loading
score in Factor 1 were all about environmental mastery.
The correlation of Factor 2 and self-acceptance may pos-
sibly be due to relatively high loading scores of S7 and S2.
Although purpose in life did not show high correlation
with any factors,
it might be due to its low internal
consistency. We discuss two aspects of the possible rea-
sons the factor analysis yielded these results.

First, it seems that respondents in this sample of Japa-
nese community residents perceived three constructs
measured by these subscales (i.e., environmental mas-
tery, purpose in life, and self-acceptance) quite similar to
each other. The findings contract to previous observa-
tions in Western countries that these constructs are sep-
arate in factor analyses
[25, 44]. Among Eastern
cultures, the self is viewed as interdependent, rather than
independent as it is in Western culture. Experiencing
interdependence entails seeing oneself as part of a net-
work of social relationships and recognizing that one’s
behavior is determined by the others’ perspectives or
expectations. The fundamental connectedness of the hu-
man community with the surrounding context “self-in-
relation-to-other” is focal
in individual experiences in
Eastern cultures [45]. With the interdependent self, well-
being is realized in one’s relationship with surrounding

realities, both social and non-social [46]. Thus, environ-
mental mastery, being able to take adaptive and situ-
ationally bound actions in the social context, might be
closely linked with self-acceptance in a country with an
Eastern culture, such as Japan. In addition, also in line
with the construal of interdependent cultures, the self
becomes most meaningful (i.e., high purpose in life)
when it is cast in the appropriate social settings [45].
Japanese people are motivated to find a way to fit in with

relevant surroundings by fulfilling obligations to become
part of various interpersonal relationships [45]. Purpose
in life may be also closely related to environmental mas-
tery and self-acceptance in Japanese culture. In Japanese
culture, these three components of PWB may come to-
gether and be hard to distinguish.

Second, negative and positive items were divided into
two different factors in this sample. The same pattern
was shown in a previous study with a UK cohort [47].

Sasaki et al. BMC Psychology            (2020) 8:75 

Page 9 of 11

There are two reasons that the PWB scale includes nega-
tive/positive distinction of wordings; (1) assessing con-
structs with items framed positively and negatively is
needed as a check on acquiescence response bias (i.e., the
tendency to agree with everything, perhaps due to not even
reading the items); (2) items for the PWB scales were gen-
erated based on the theoretical definitions of each construct
which included a definition of both high and low scorers
for each dimension (i.e., items intended to capture both
having and not having the various aspects of well-being)
[48]. The use of both negatively and positively worded
items is expected to increase the validity of what is meant
by having a high score on any dimension of well-being be-
cause to get a high score, a person has to both agree with
positively worded items and disagree with negatively
worded items. The pattern that negatively and positively
worded items load on different factors in a factor analysis
has been observed for several mental health and psycho-
logical well-being scales in Japan [49–52], which is inter-
preted as differential response styles to negatively and
positively worded items in the Japanese population. Thus,
the finding for the two factors may not necessarily imply
that there are two distinct unique constructs of psycho-
logical well-being in the Japanese population. The two fac-
tors observed in the exploratory factor analysis may be just
due to a reporting style, but still reflect the same construct.
Most items for the remaining three subscales (i.e., posi-
tive relations with others, autonomy, and personal growth)
loaded on separate factors that seem to reflect the corre-
sponding dimensions of the PWB. The results for the cor-
relation analysis also suggested that Factor 3, 4, and 5 had
high to moderate correlation with positive relationship
with others, autonomy, and personal growth respectively.
The observed five factor-structure in this study seem com-
patible with the original six-factor model [19] to some ex-
tent, while the three subscales (i.e, environmental mastery,
purpose in life, and self-acceptance) were collapsed to rep-
resent a single combined dimension in this sample. It is
possible that the factor structure is affected by the charac-
teristics (e.g., gender, age groups, and urban/rural differ-
ence) of the population and the cultural context. The
authors could not conclude from this study that the five-
factor structure fit to the Japanese PWBS-42 rather than
the original six-factor model [19]. Further research is
needed to re-examine the factor structure of the Japanese
PWBS-42 in a sample with a broader age range and from
non-urban settings to know if the pattern could be gener-
alized to the whole Japanese population.

The results for the correlation analysis indicated that
all the PWBS-42 correlated highly with other psycho-
metrics variables measured by other scales in the theor-
etically expected direction, supporting its convergent
validity. As shown by ANOVA, there were some signifi-
cant demographic differences in scores on the Japanese

version of the PWBS-42. Specifically, some differences,
such as decremental age profiles (with scores for the
older people significantly lower than those for younger
people) for personal growth and purpose in life, sex pro-
file (with women scoring higher than men) of positive
relationship with others, were coincident with previous
research in the U.S. [25]. Otherwise, high autonomy in
men seems peculiar to Japanese men. Marriage had an
advantage over being divorced or single in many sub-
scales, except for autonomy. Previous studies suggested
that marriage is a powerful predictor of high well-being
[53, 54]. Having paid work was related to high scores for
personal growth and purpose in life. These two subscales
were found to contribute to work and career related out-
comes [55]. The findings supported the view that using
six subscales for the Japanese population was appropri-
ate, suggesting known-group validity compared with
other population. Regarding interpretability of this scale,
the result showed relatively low PWB scores among Jap-
anese sample (30.6 < mean < 33.8) compared with the

Limitations
This study has some limitations. First, the MIDJA popula-
tion consisted of people over 30, so young population
under 29 cannot be considered. Second, the translation
process is not partially appropriate. Third is that our Japa-
nese participants treated item P7 (see Table 4) as positive
even though it is negative phrased (and reversed-scored).
We kept this item and its original scoring in the Japanese
version of
study to maintain
consistency with the original PWBS; however, that practice
should be reconsidered in future research. Fourth, some
scales which were used in convergent/known-class validity
analysis are biased due to insufficient consideration of reli-
ability and validity. Finally, some important properties of
the scale were not investigated in the study due to the lack
of repeated measurement: test-retest reliability, measure-
ment error, predictive validity and responsiveness.

Conclusion
The Japanese version of the PWBS-42 showed accept-
able reliability and convergent validity when applying
the original scoring method for the six subscales. How-
ever, the factorial validity based on the original six-factor
model was not well supported in this study, while most
factors observed in this study seem compatible with the
original
factors. A further examination is needed to
know if the factor structure of the PWBS-42 is different
for the Japanese population.
