Multilayered approaches to suicide prevention combine universal, selective, and
indicated prevention interventions. These approaches may be more successful
in
reducing suicide rates among older adults if they link these layers more systematically:
that is, if the programs are designed so that interventions at a lower level facilitate
involvement at a higher level when appropriate. This study aimed to examine the effect
on suicide rates of the structure of multilayered approaches, and in particular the types of
interventions and the connections or linkages between them. We also wished to consider
any different effects by sex. A literature search used PubMed and PsycINFO to identify
systematic reviews of interventions in this age group. From the reference lists of these
articles, we identiﬁed controlled studies assessing the impact of a multilayered program
on suicide incidence among older adults. We were particularly interested in initiatives
linking different kinds of prevention interventions. We found three relevant systematic
reviews, and from these, we identiﬁed nine eligible studies. These included seven
non-randomized controlled studies from rural areas in Japan (average eligible population:
3,087, 59% women, average duration: 8 years). We also found two cohort studies. The
ﬁrst was from a semi-urban area in Padua, Italy (18,600 service users, 84% women,
duration: 11 years). The second was from urban Hong Kong, with 351 participants (57%
women) over a 2-year follow-up period. We used a narrative synthesis of these studies to
identify ﬁve different multilayered programs with different forms of connections or linkages
between layers. Two studies/programs (Italy and Hong Kong) involved selective and
indicated prevention interventions. One study/program (Yuri, Japan) included universal
and selective prevention interventions, and the ﬁnal six studies (two programs in northern
Japan) involved linkages between all three layers. We also found that these linkages
could be either formal or informal. Formal linkages were professional referrals between
levels. Informal linkages included advice from professionals and self-referrals. Several of
the studies noted that during the program, the service users developed relationships
with services or providers, which may have facilitated movements between levels. All
ﬁve programs were associated with reduced suicide incidence among women in the
target groups or communities. Two programs were also associated with a reduction
among men. The study authors speculated that women were more likely to accept
services than men, and that the care provided in some studies did less to address issues

that it is important to build relationships between levels, especially between selective
and indicated prevention interventions, but that these can be both formal and informal.
Additionally, to reach older men, it may be important to create systematic methods to
involve mental health professionals in the indicated prevention intervention. Universal
interventions, especially in conjunction with systematically linked indicated and selective
interventions, can help to disseminate the beneﬁts across the community.

INTRODUCTION

Suicide is an important public health issue around the world,
particularly among older people (those aged over 60 years) (1).
Both suicide rates (2, 3) and the lethality of suicidal behavior (4, 5)
are higher in this age group.

A framework has previously been created to identify eﬀective
interventions, align them with risk level for suicide and size
in the target population, and classify them into three kinds
of prevention interventions, universal, selective, and indicated
(6, 7). Universal prevention strategies are applied to an entire
population or subgroups that have not been identiﬁed based
on individual risk of suicide. Selective prevention strategies are
aimed at groups at risk of suicide, but not necessarily showing
suicidal behavior. Indicated prevention strategies focus on high-
risk individuals, such as those displaying early signs of suicide
potential or who have previously attempted suicide (2).

Suicide risk at individual level ﬂuctuates over time (8, 9), so
eﬀorts to reduce mortality from suicide among older adults living
in the community need to work with those at various levels of
risk. The use of combinations of two or three levels of prevention
interventions, known as a “multilayered” approach (6, 10, 11),
can both address the level of risk and consider target populations
(12). Research suggests that suicide incidence in older adults
could be reduced through the use of multilayered approaches
(10, 13). Recent community-based multilevel programs involving
intervention components of
the three kinds of prevention
strategies (14–16), for example, used this approach, although
there was no reported outcome of a relationship between these
components. However, the results of applying this approach to
suicide incidence in adults of all ages showed subtle (15, 17)
or no visible ﬁndings (18). They have also been inconsistent
among sites in a study (19) and with a replication study (20).
The discrepancy in these results cannot be explained solely by age
diﬀerences in the target groups or diﬀerences in the acceptability
and feasibility of large-scale implementation. However, they
might be inﬂuenced by the structure of the program, and
particularly whether it used a multilayered approach to choose
and link intervention components. The original framework
simply deﬁned the three kinds of prevention interventions by risk
level and size in the target population (6, 7). It did not mention
linkages between layers. Research about multilayered approaches
for suicide prevention has therefore focused on combinations of
types of prevention interventions, but paid very little attention to
the linkages between these interventions.

A previous review has proposed a schematic diagram showing
the relationship between the suicide process and prevention
strategies, combined with initiatives for linking from universal to
selective and from selective to indicated prevention interventions
(21). Another review has suggested that some interventions may
be successful in reducing suicide rates in older adults because
they link universal, selective, and indicated interventions in
a structured way (Figure 1), even where each intervention in
isolation may not be successful (22). However, it is also clear
that some single interventions can be successful without these
linkages (2, 23–25). Linking interventions and levels may mean
that preventive action can follow individual trajectories toward
suicide more closely than separate interventions, and therefore
alter these trajectories more eﬀectively.

A multilayered approach to suicide prevention means
that
there are links between diﬀerent kinds of prevention
interventions, and that these links facilitate movement between
interventions. Those who were exposed to a universal or selective
prevention intervention, and who are considered to be at higher
risk of suicide, can therefore subsequently be involved more
easily in a selective or indicated prevention intervention. It
is important to ensure that any participants in universal or
selective prevention interventions can be seamlessly supported
toward a higher level of prevention intervention if their risk of
suicide increases. We suggest that making better, more systematic
linkages between diﬀerent kinds of prevention interventions may
help with this, by creating a structured way to connect prevention
interventions to reduce dropout. However, the coexistence of
diﬀerent kinds of prevention interventions and linkages in
multilayered approaches may have diﬀerent eﬀects from the
existence of these interventions without linkages (21, 22). The
eﬀects may also vary in diﬀerent population groups, or by age,
sex, and type of suicide outcomes (suicidal ideation, attempted
suicide, and death by suicide) (13, 26, 27).

This paper therefore describes a review of studies assessing
the impact of multilayered suicide prevention programs on death
by suicide among older adults (those aged 60 years and over). It
aimed to answer the research questions:

• How are universal, selective, and indicated interventions
linked with each other in the multilayered programs reviewed?
• Is there a relationship between program structure, and
particularly the type of interventions and the linkages between
them, and impact on death by suicide among older adults?
• Does sex have any moderating eﬀects on this relationship?

Suicide Prevention Interventions and Linkages

FIGURE 1 | Schematic diagram of suicide process and prevention strategies (22). Interventions highlighted in gray are supported by evidence of their efﬁcacy in
reducing suicide risk. A black arrow indicates a clear link to another intervention. A black circle indicates no known link to other interventions. The interventions at each
point in the suicide process are expected to involve people at stages closer to suicide.

This review therefore builds on previous work by increasing
intervention type, and more
the focus on the eﬀect of
importantly, linkages between interventions, on suicide in older
adults. It sets this within the conceptual framework of earlier
work setting out a model linking interventions across levels of
intervention with steps in the suicide process (22). This review
adds information about the type and role of linkages between
interventions. It also aimed to contribute evidence on sex
diﬀerences in treatment responses. However, it also recognizes
that gender expectations and experiences play a signiﬁcant role
in suicide rates, and that these experiences may vary with culture
and location.

METHODS

We wanted to know whether using multilayered approaches to
suicide prevention, with an organized structure characterized
by speciﬁc intervention components and linkages, was related
to impact on suicide incidence. We used a literature search
to identify systematic reviews as reliable sources of articles on
intervention types and linkages (see Appendix 1). We included
studies assessing the impact of suicide prevention interventions
on suicide incidence in older adults, particularly initiatives
linking diﬀerent kinds of prevention interventions. Figure 2
shows the process of article selection for the review.

We used narrative synthesis because this approach to
literature reviews explicitly allows the presentation of statistical
outcome data alongside a textual description. This provides
opportunities to answer a wider range of research questions. In
this case, it allowed us to explore the structure of the intervention
program as well as the outcomes and eﬀects of the intervention.
We examined programs evaluated in previous studies to
identify all the potential components that served as stand-alone
interventions and involved targeted individuals. We used the
framework (6, 7) to categorize the intervention components

into universal, selective, and indicated prevention strategies. We
then reread the studies to identify whether there were linkages
between interventions at diﬀerent levels of prevention and if
so, how the intervention components were connected. This
enabled us to expand the perspective to program structures
characterized by both intervention components and linkages,
and examine eﬀectiveness of
the
program structure.

interventions in light of

The review focused on the intervention components
identiﬁed, the type of prevention strategy, and linkages between
levels. We also extracted information from all publications on
design, target population, levels of intervention and outcomes
(see Table 1). The ﬁnal step of the review was to consider (a)
the components in speciﬁc prevention strategies and their
linkages within the program structure, (b) any evidence about
the eﬀectiveness of the program, individual components and
linkages on suicide incidence,
if possible, stratiﬁed by sex,
and (c) any relationship between the program structure and
the outcomes.

RESULTS

We identiﬁed 61 review articles and excluded 58 because they
did not meet the criteria (Appendix 1). This left three systematic
reviews (13, 37, 38) for further examination, and their reference
lists gave nine suitable studies to examine the eﬀect of program
structures on death by suicide rate (see Figure 2).

These nine studies described ﬁve diﬀerent multilayered

approaches meeting our criteria:

1. Tele-Help/Tele-Check in Italy, a system of crisis helplines and

telephone counseling by trained staﬀ (28);

2. The Elderly Suicide Prevention Program (ESPP) in Hong
Kong, with community support provided by primary care
gatekeepers and psychogeriatric care management for suicide
attempters (29);

3. Group activities in Yuri, in Japan, based in the community and

run by health professionals (30);

4. Three suicide prevention programs in Sanpachi, Joboji and
Matsunoyama, in Japan, which all consisted of community-
based depression screening (CDS), followed by subsequent
support from mental health professionals (31–33); and

5. Three suicide prevention programs in Yasuzuka, Matsudai
and Nagawa in Japan, involving community-based depression
screening (CDS) and subsequent support from primary care
professionals (34–36).

All nine studies provided an intervention program for older
adults living in the community and evaluated it in a community
setting. Table 1 shows an overview of the multilayered prevention
approach in each, plus the source, design, target population,
intervention type and linkage, and eﬀect on suicide death among
older adults. Table 2 provides more detailed information about
the study areas, including the suicide rates nationally and in those
areas, and the population that was eligible for the study. Finally,

Appendix 2 provides detailed outcomes, including by age group
and sex where available.

One of

the nine studies (28) was a large prospective
cohort study comparing the target population with the general
population, one was a medium-sized cohort study with a
historical control (29), and seven were quasi-experimental
studies with matched concurrent controls (30–36). The next
few sections describe each approach in turn, setting out
the content of each program,
its impact, and the type of
interventions and linkages between them. We then integrated the
ﬁndings to explore the relationship between program structure,
characterized by the intervention components and linkages, and
the outcome.

Tele-Help/Tele-Check Program in Italy
A pioneering Tele-Help/Tele-Check program was established in
1988 to overcome older people’s unwillingness to use phone-
based services, in the Veneto region of Italy (28). Suicide rates
among older people in that region at the time were much higher

than the national average (Table 2). The service was delivered for
11 years, and involving service users living in the community. No
ethnic information was provided about the study participants.
However, the study gave information by sex about the marital
status and living situation of the participants (Appendix 2).

Content of Program
General practitioners (GPs) or social workers from local health
services typically initiated referrals to the Tele-Help/Tele-Check
service. Following referral, clients were placed on a waiting
list and subsequently contacted following regional government
authorization. Service users received an alarm device that
could remotely trigger a pre-established response network.
This provided a rapid response in medical and psychological
emergencies (Tele-Help). Users also received welfare monitoring
and emotional support from trained and paid staﬀ, via short and
informal twice-weekly telephone interviews (Tele-Check). Users
were able to initiate calls at any time.

Impact of Program
Over the 11 years during which the service was delivered, there
were fewer deaths by suicide than expected among 18,600 users
aged ≥ 65 years (mean age 80 years; 84% women) compared
with the general population (2 vs. 11.98 in women, and 4
vs. 8.88 in men). However, the diﬀerence for men was not
statistically signiﬁcant. This may have been because of the low
levels of suicide in men overall, particularly with the relatively
low proportion of men among the service users, meaning that
the study had low statistical power.

Tele-Check was the most inﬂuential type of support for the
20,000 users of this service. Those using the service for at least
6 months showed reductions in requests for home visits by GPs,
hospital admissions, and levels of depressive symptoms.

Types of Interventions and Linkages in Program
This program included two main components. The ﬁrst was a
regular phone call by trained staﬀ, which provided assessment
and emotional
support. This was a selective prevention
intervention because the target population was older adults
who were socially isolated and functionally impaired. The
emergency response and assistance was an indicated prevention
intervention, because the target population was older adults who
had called for help in a crisis.

There was no formal connection or linkage between the two
separate interventions in the structure of the program, except that
the participants of the two were the same. However, a case history
of an old disabled man recovering from a suicide attempt (39)
suggests that the emotional support provided through regular
phone contact and the pre-established relationship with the
people who would be providing emergency management was
an important factor in that case. We speculate that this might
foster people’s feelings of connectedness to support services, and
therefore increase their willingness to use crisis services. This
study found an eﬀective structural network in the connection,
and this formed a de facto systematic linkage between the
two prevention interventions. In this study, therefore, users
themselves were the connection between the selective and

indicated prevention strategies, manifest in an emergency alarm
from a user in crisis. No exact data are available, but the
implication in the paper is that this connection was used by a
substantial proportion of the target population.

Elderly Suicide Prevention Program in
Hong Kong
The Elderly Suicide Prevention Program (ESPP) was launched
in 2002 to serve all areas in Hong Kong through seven regional
services. The program was directly funded and managed by
the Hospital Authority, the only government-funded health
management organization in Hong Kong (29). No ethnic
information was included about the study participants, although
living
information was provided about their marital status,
situation and educational level (Appendix 2).

Content of Program
The ESPP is a multifaceted program including treatment of
depression, gatekeeper training, aftercare for suicide attempters,
and care management. It operated at two levels: primary and
psychogeriatric care services. A typical referral pathway and
aftercare would be for a gatekeeper in primary care to identify
an at-risk individual displaying clinical depression or suicidal
ideation/plans/attempts, and make an urgent referral. Each client
was then assigned a care manager, a psychogeriatric nurse who
arranged an urgent psychogeriatric appointment within 1 week.
At the psychogeriatric clinic, designated psychogeriatricians
provided the assessment and any follow-up care that was
clinically indicated. The care manager provided frequent phone
contacts, regular home visits, and ad hoc home visits in response
to crises. These were used to monitor clients’ mental and social
situations, promote compliance with treatment, and provide
psychoeducation in the ﬁrst 6 months. The care manager also
liaised with other caregivers. ESPP clients were given emergency
contact details for their care managers. A multidisciplinary team
including psychogeriatricians and care managers at tertiary care
level held regular case conferences to review the care plan and
clinical progress.

Impact of Program
This was a relatively small observational cohort study. The 351
participants were selected from older adults (aged ≥ 65 years)
who had made a suicide attempt and completed a 6-month ESPP.
If clinically indicated, they had also received aftercare from a
psychogeriatrician (29). The dropout rate from outpatient care
after the ESPP was 17.7% during the 2-year follow-up period.
The 2-year fatal suicide rate was lower in the study participants
than in a historical cohort group, but this diﬀerence was not
statistically signiﬁcant among women. Re-attempt rates were
similar for the participants and the historical control group. At
a population level, suicide rate only dropped signiﬁcantly in
women aged ≥ 85 years from baseline.

The ESPP was therefore associated with a non-signiﬁcant
reduction in the rate of fatal suicide attempts in older adults
with a past suicide attempt. It may also have contributed to
in the population suicide rate in women aged ≥ 85
a fall
years. The authors speculated that the gatekeeper activity in the

intervention program (ESPP) resulted in better recognition of
depressive illness and enhanced access of the service to at-risk
older women (aged ≥ 85 years). However, the non-signiﬁcance
of the results could have been related to both the low number
of people in the sample and external environmental issues. For
example, the epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome
(SARS) in the area had resulted in fewer people being able to
access mental health services in the region in 2003, and also
increased pessimism among the general population. This was
thought to have contributed to higher suicide rates in 2003 and
2004, which were included in the intervention period.

Types of Interventions and Linkages in Program
This program included four main components. The gatekeeper
training for primary care workers and the regular contact with a
care manager were both selective prevention interventions. The
target population was older adults who had made a past suicide
attempt but were not necessarily always at a higher risk level than
baseline. Treatment by a psychogeriatrician was an indicated
prevention intervention because the target population was people
who had been assessed as needing this type of follow-up support.
The emergency contact by the care manager was also an indicated
prevention intervention because the target population was older
adults in a crisis.

The urgent referral to the care manager or psychogeriatric
nurse was the connection between the gatekeeper activities of
the primary care workers (selective prevention intervention), and
the assessment and treatment by a psychogeriatrician (indicated
prevention intervention). The care managers eﬀectively provided
the linkages between levels throughout
the program, both
at initial referral, and during any crisis, building on their
relationships with the service users. In this study, again, users
therefore developed familiarity and an emotional connection
with the service. This may have made it easier for them to seek
additional support when necessary.

There are no exact data available, but this connection seems
to have been used in a substantial proportion of the target
population. This may be partly because the participants in the
ESPP had a relatively low dropout rate. The ability to access
higher level services when the need was urgent, coupled with
multidisciplinary activities led by the assigned care manager,
enhance the idea that this connection was both structural and
pre-planned. Building connections with service users as a way to
reduce dropouts could also form a systematic linkage between the
two kinds of prevention interventions.

Group Activities for Older People in Yuri,
Japan
This was a community-based program designed to build social
relationships among older people. Lack of these relationships
is the most common risk factor for late-life suicide. The
program was launched in 1995 in a rural area of norther Japan
with a high suicide rate. It was funded and managed by the
local government (30). The only socio-economic information
provided in the paper related to the unemployment rate and
average yearly income, both of which were lower than the
prefectural average (Appendix 2).

Suicide Prevention Interventions and Linkages

Content of Program
This program included group activities and low-threshold
campaigns. The group activity was designed to help the
participants to develop closer relationships with neighbors and
create a more fulﬁlling social life. It provided opportunities for
a target population aged ≥ 65 years, particularly those who
were identiﬁed as having poor social relationships (e.g., living
alone and feeling isolated from their family), to participate
in social, voluntary, and recreational activities and to exercise
together. Sessions were held once every 2–4 months in the
community center in each district within the town, run by
municipal public health nurses (PHNs). The PHNs speciﬁcally
identiﬁed people with poor social relationships and encouraged
them to join the group activities, and especially to enhance their
social relationships. There was also an educational campaign for
the general public, involving psychoeducational workshops (run
once or twice yearly) and local newsletters to provide information
about factors that were protective (e.g., social relationships and
activities) and associated with higher risk (e.g., depression) of
late-life suicide.

Impact of Program
This was a quasi-experimental study to assess the impact of
the intervention program on suicide incidence over an 8-year
implementation period. All participants were geographically
deﬁned, population-based dynamic cohorts of older adults aged
≥ 65 years. The study used a pre–post design with a primary
outcome of change in the incidence of death by suicide (suicide
rates) between the 8-year baseline and 8-year implementation
period, including a non-randomized matched control (average
annual population aged ≥ 65 years: 1,601 [59% women] in
intervention; 1,933 in control) and the regional prefecture. A
greater reduction in suicide rates was observed among women in
the intervention area than in the control area and wider region.
However, there was no change in suicide rates in men (30).
The annual total number of participants in the group activity
sessions increased from 232 to 3,051 rapidly during the 8-year
implementation period. No data are available on the sex of the
participants. At least half of the target population seemed to
participate in at least some sessions although no exact data were
available. At least one-third or more of the target population
seemed to participate in the workshops at least once during the
same period.

Types of Interventions and Linkages in Program
This program included two components identiﬁed as stand-alone
interventions. The educational campaign run through workshops
and other local media was a universal prevention intervention,
because the target population was all older people living in a
particular area. The workshops appeared to have a relatively
high participation rate. The group activity component was both
universal and selective, because it was open to any older people
living in the area, but the nurses also speciﬁcally encouraged
attendance of those at increased risk of suicide because of their
poor social relationships.

There were two types of group activity, and the PHNs
recommended one or other to participants, depending on the

quality of their social relationships. There was therefore both a
link between the universal and selective aspects of the program,
and a connection between the two types of group activities. This
connection seems to have been used by a substantial proportion
of the target population, because the group activity had a high
participation rate. The connection was not necessarily either
structural or pre-planned, but the two types of group activities
were in the same setting, so it was not hard for people to move
between them. This connection is therefore not likely to be a
systematic linkage, but again based on service user familiarity
with both location and the people running the session. Both the
campaign and group activity components had high participation
rates, and it seems likely that some participants would have been
involved in both. The educational campaign may therefore have
contributed to the rapid increase in the number of participants in
the group activities, although no direct connection was reported
between the two.

Community Depression Screening and
Follow-Up Support Among Older People in
Northern Japan
Six of the nine studies included in the review assessed the impact
of community-based depression screening (CDS) interventions
on suicide incidence among older adults, in a quasi-experimental
design. Participants were geographically deﬁned, population-
based dynamic cohorts of older adults. The studies used a
pre–post design with a primary outcome of change in the
incidence of death by suicide (suicide rates) between the baseline
and implementation period, and ﬁve of the six included non-
randomized matched controls.

The six municipal projects autonomously ran a CDS program
in northern Japan from the 1980’s through to the 2000’s in rural
areas with high suicide rates among older people. Screening was
carried out by PHNs and there were two follow-up methods:
support from psychiatrists (CDS with psychiatric care support)
in three municipalities (31–33) and support from GPs (CDS with
primary care support) in three municipalities (34–36).

Three studies included no demographic or socio-economic
information (32, 33, 36). The others provided unemployment
rates (31), or both unemployment and average income (34, 35)
compared with the regional average (Appendix 2).

Content of Program
All six studies included a municipality-based screening process.
All target older adults living in the community were invited
to participate in a two-step screening program for depression,
with the oﬀer of subsequent support. In the ﬁrst-stage, universal
screening, a self-report questionnaire for depression screening
was delivered to all target residents aged ≥ 60 or 65 years.
The adults who agreed to participate returned the completed
questionnaire. In the second stage, adults who were screened as
positive for depression from the self-report questionnaire were
advised to take part in semi-structured face-to-face and telephone
interviews with a public health nurse or psychiatric social worker.
This provided an assessment using diagnostic criteria. After
these interviews, a tentative diagnosis was made with input
from psychiatrists or GPs, and the participants were referred to

Suicide Prevention Interventions and Linkages

psychiatric or primary care support services, which then provided
support and care. The participants were unable to choose their
care support pathway. If a formal assessment led to the diagnosis
of a depressive episode, a clinical decision was made to encourage
visits and regular telephone contact with a public health nurse
or psychiatric social worker for 2 months, or to refer the
individual for further treatment with a psychiatrist or a GP. The
psychiatrists might prescribe antidepressants, benzodiazepines,
and/or brief supportive psychotherapy, depending on what they
felt was required. The GPs only prescribed benzodiazepines
and psychiatric consultations, and not antidepressants or
psychotherapy. All interventions were supplemented by health
education for the general public conducted via local newsletters
and workshops. These were designed to increase awareness about
depression and minimize the associated stigma.

Impact of Program
The screening was oﬀered to the entire eligible older population
aged ≥ 65 years in the ﬁve small studies (average of annual
populations aged ≥ 65 years: 439–1,333, 57–61% women) and
one-third of those in the large study (the population: 11,920,
59% women). The results suggested good uptake of ﬁrst-
stage screening, with maximum annual participation rates of
almost 80% during the 6–10-year implementation periods in
the ﬁve small studies, and an uptake of 52% during the 2-year
implementation period in the largest study. The participation
rates in screening were only available by sex in two studies. In
Sanpachi (31), they were similar for men and women (53 and
51%). In Nagawa (36), the annual uptake of screening ranged
from 80 to 95% in women and 60 to 89% in men. In the
second stage of screening, maximum annual participation rates
were almost 80% in three of the small studies as well as in the
large study and were ∼60% in the remaining two small studies.
The performance of the two-step depression screening process
seemed to vary with both the care pathway followed and the size
of the target population. The maximum annual detection rate of
depressive episodes via psychiatric care support was around 4%
of the total screened population in two of the smaller studies
and 0.7% in the large study. When using primary care support
for detection, the rate was 1.2–2.9% in the three small studies.
No data are available by sex for depression detection rates. In all
the studies, the total participation rate for workshops during the
implementation period was <5% of the total population of the
target area.

All three quasi-experimental studies examining CDS with
primary care support (34–36) found a decrease in suicide
rates among older women in the target areas compared with
the control areas (64, 70 and 74%). However, no statistically
signiﬁcant change in suicide rates was observed in older men.
The studies examining CDS with psychiatric care support (31–
33) found a decrease in suicide rates in both men and women
in the target areas compared with the control [51% (not
signiﬁcant), 76% and 60% among women and 61, 73 and 88%
in men]. The areas covered by the two sets of studies are
very similar. These results therefore suggested the presence of
sex diﬀerences in the treatment responses for the two types of
support pathways.

Types of Interventions and Linkages in Program
Both types of CDS programs included four main components.
The universal screening through a self-reported questionnaire
and the public education campaigns were universal prevention
interventions because the target population was all older adults
living in the area. The universal screening component achieved
high participation rates, but the rates were much lower for
the educational component. The second stage screening using
a semi-structured interview by a health professional was a
selective prevention intervention, because the target population
was older adults who were screened as showing depression.
The robust screening component also had high participation
rates. Subsequent care was an indicated prevention intervention
because the target population was older adults who were
experiencing a depressive episode and showing signs that they
needed additional support or care.

There was a formal link between the universal and selective
interventions in the form of invitations to individuals to attend
a more robust screening. This invitation was structured to
avoid dropouts and resulted in high participation in the robust
screening. This can therefore be considered a systematic linkage
between them. Information dissemination through the public
education work had no direct or indirect connections to other
interventions. The education sessions did not appear to facilitate
participation in any kind of selective interventions. The formal
link from selective to indicated interventions was the referral
to subsequent care for individuals with a depressive episode.
This referral was again structured to avoid dropouts and resulted
in high participation in subsequent care. It can therefore be
considered to be a systematic linkage between levels.

DISCUSSION

Previous studies have found that programs that combine
interventions from two or more prevention levels (universal,
selective, and indicated) can reduce suicide among older adults.
However, it is also possible to achieve reductions in suicide
rates from a single prevention strategy without any linkage with
other levels, for example, responsible media reporting, restricting
access to means, and follow-up care after attempted suicide
(2, 23–25). This review therefore sought to examine the reasons
why multilayered programs might be eﬀective by looking at the
nature of the linkages between levels.

addressed risk predictors

We found nine suitable studies from previous systematic
reviews, covering ﬁve diﬀerent multilayered programs. These
programs
such as depression,
social
isolation, and crisis. All ﬁve multilayered programs
included linkages between diﬀerent kinds of prevention
interventions. Two involved selective and indicated prevention
interventions (28, 29), one involved universal and selective
prevention interventions (30), and six studies (two programs)
involved linkages between universal and selective prevention
interventions, and between selective and indicated prevention
interventions (31–36). All ﬁve programs were associated with
reduced incidence of suicide among older women in the target
groups or communities and two programs, ESPP (29) and CDS

Suicide Prevention Interventions and Linkages

with psychiatric care support (31–33) were associated with a
reduction among both women and men.

Our review suggests that the types of linkages varied between
the programs. The linkage in the six CDS studies was a
formal referral between levels, which was also possible in
ESPP. However, the other programs involved a more informal
move between levels, relying on the actions of service users or
staﬀ running the programs. This was also possible in ESPP.
Figure 3 summarizes these linkages in visual form. The next few
sections examine the impact of program structure and the nature
of linkages.

Impact of Program Structure
Linkages in the Form of Professional Referrals
Several programs contained formal linkages between levels in
the form of professional referrals. For example, ESPP (29) linked
selective and indicated interventions through a formal referral by
either a primary care practitioner to the formal program (and to
a care manager/psychogeriatric nurse) or from the care manager
to a psychogeriatrician. This program had an additional element
in that it involved people who had previously attempted suicide.
Follow-up care among recently discharged patients has been
found to be eﬀective in reducing suicide attempts and deaths in
all age groups (40), especially at-risk individuals discharged from
emergency departments (41). However, this follow-up care has
often not been designed to be integrated with other prevention
strategies (40, 42), which might limit its beneﬁts. ESPP was
therefore interesting in its systematic linkages between selective
and indicated prevention interventions for those with a previous
history of attempting suicide.

The six studies in northern Japan had formal links across
all three levels through referrals. Screening participants whose
results suggested depression were invited for a more in-depth
assessment. Those assessed as experiencing a depressive episode
were referred for follow-up care. In the six studies, these
prevention components achieved high participation, and resulted
in a lower suicide rate among older adults, conﬁrmed by a recent
meta-analysis (21). This is also supported by a longitudinal study
that found an association between exposure to screening and
lower suicide incidence (43).

The precise reasons why formal referrals between levels are
eﬀective is not clear. We speculate that perhaps a referral from
a universal screening program overcomes the recognized barrier
of having to ask for help. For example, a previous study suggested
that mental health screening and feedback improved recognition
and encouraged service use (38). However, the eﬀect of universal
screening may also be related to the form of contact. Other
studies (42, 44) have found that brief contact interventions
such as letters, postcards, and telephone calls, could reduce
suicide rates. Future research may wish to examine this issue in
more depth.

Informal Linkages Involving Professional Advice or
Self-Referrals
There were two main types of informal linkages seen in the
studies in the review. The ﬁrst involved professional advice, and
the second self-referrals.

Some of

the studies in our review involved healthcare
professionals targeting particular groups or individuals to
encourage them to use particular services. For example, in the
study involving group activities in Yuri (30), the group activities
were open to anyone (a universal intervention). However, when
nurses identiﬁed people who would beneﬁt from group activities,
or even a particular type of group activities, they encouraged
them to participate. Social disconnectedness is associated with
a greater risk of late-life suicide (45, 46). However, we were
able to ﬁnd only one study that had used increased community
participation to minimize social isolation (47), and these results
need to be replicated in other intervention studies.

Several of the studies in our review allowed or required service
users to self-refer for additional help. Tele-Help/Tele-Check in
Italy (28), for example, had a selective intervention of regular
telephone calls to service users. However, users were also given a
device to use if they had a crisis and needed emergency care. ESPP
(29) also enabled service users to refer themselves for additional
help in a crisis, as well as having a formal health professional
referral route.

Impact of Number of Layers in a Multilayered
Approach
Conwell and colleagues have pointed out that a multilayered
approach that combines three kinds of prevention interventions
is probably most eﬀective (48). Our review suggests that there
is some truth in this, but that the nature of the linkages also
matters. In the study in Yuri (30), there was little linkage between
the education component of the study and the more selective
interventions. In the CDS studies, the robust screening for
depression and subsequent care support by medical professionals
probably improved identiﬁcation and treatment of depression.
Gatekeeper training for physicians may have a similar eﬀect
(23, 24, 49, 50) in supporting more robust identiﬁcation of
those in need of referral. The strength of the CDS studies was
the systematic linkage of selective and indicated prevention
components back to a universal element that was seen as useful
in the population, resulting in higher participation rates.

Other Factors That May Affect Impact
The review also identiﬁed some other factors that may be
signiﬁcant, beyond the structure of the program. In particular, we
identiﬁed a common feature of building relationships between
service users and healthcare professionals. For example,
in
ESPP (29) and Tele-Help/Tele-Check (28), clients shared their
preferred communication channel for regular and emergency
contacts with their support staﬀ. We speculate that using
clients’ preferred communication channels may help to build
relationships and make service users more comfortable with
communicating with healthcare professionals. This may help to
address the ﬂuctuating nature of suicide risk at individual level
and make the linkage more eﬀective over time.

It is also possible that building a relationship with Tele-
Help/Tele-Check staﬀ helped to make users more comfortable
with asking for additional help in a crisis. However, simply
reaching out for help may be insuﬃcient. Another study found
that crisis helplines without subsequent support, a selective

prevention intervention, can often reduce suicide risk among
callers only during the call itself, or for a few weeks at most (51).
Appropriate support after a crisis call, as seen with ESPP (29) and
Tele-Help/Tele-Check (28), may be necessary to reduce suicide
rate in the target group.

Sex Differences in Treatment Response
Few studies examined sex-speciﬁc distinctions in the impact
of interventions on suicide incidence. However, those that did
suggest that most programs beneﬁted older women more than
men (13). Interestingly, those that showed beneﬁts to both men
and women were generally those that involved psychiatric or
psychogeriatric support, rather than support from nurses or
care managers.

For example, ESPP (29) involved identiﬁcation and treatment
of mental illnesses by psychogeriatric professionals. The two
groups of three studies examining each type of CDS were
also combined in two separate meta-analyses in a study (21).
The meta-analyses found an association between both types of
CDS and reduction in suicide incidence among older women.
However, only CDS with psychiatric care support was also
associated with a reduction among older men. A combined
analysis across all six studies also suggested the presence of
sex diﬀerences in the treatment responses for the two types
of support pathways (21). These results indicate that involving
psychiatric care support after screening or initial identiﬁcation of
those at risk may be beneﬁcial in preventing suicide among men.
Both ESPP and the CDS studies took place in Asian cultures
(Hong Kong and Japan), and the ﬁndings may therefore

not be more widely generalizable. However, a community-
based multilevel program to improve early detection and
treatment of depression in all age group was conducted in
German, using a combination of GP education focusing on
low-threshold campaigns, and psychiatric
male depression,
consultations. This therefore combined selective and indicated
prevention interventions with systematic linkages through
GPs’ management of depression, and a universal prevention
intervention in the form of a campaign for the general public
(17). This resulted in a lower suicide rate among men of
all ages, which we speculate may be related to the combined
selective and indicated prevention interventions
involving
psychiatric consultations.

We suggest that the eﬀect of psychiatric care on men may be
because of sex diﬀerences in suicide behaviors, and the type of
support provided by primary and secondary care. Men appear to
be more vulnerable to impulsivity in the suicide process (52, 53).
Secondary (i.e., psychiatric and psychogeriatric) care support
rather than primary care support provides treatment (e.g.,
prescribing antidepressants, or hospitalizing people for their own
protection) that can ameliorate this impulsivity. Secondary rather
than primary care support may therefore be more eﬀective in
reducing suicide risk in men (21), although this ﬁnding would
need to be tested in more cultural settings.

Taken together, these ﬁndings suggest that reducing suicide in
older men may beneﬁt from including several diﬀerent elements.
First, it may be helpful to involve management of mental illness
with suicidal behaviors in the indicated prevention intervention.
Second, this may beneﬁt from systematic links from a selective
prevention intervention by mental health professionals. This

Suicide Prevention Interventions and Linkages

is consistent with the ﬁndings of a recent systematic review
investigating risk factors for suicide deaths compared with
attempts (27). However, future studies will be necessary to
conﬁrm these ideas and suggestions.

Limitations and Suggestions for Future
Research
The main weakness of this review was that it used a very small
number of studies to examine the issue. Using literature reviews
to identify studies was convenient and ensured that only validated
studies were examined. However, it may have limited the number
of studies available, and particularly excluded very recent studies.
Future researchers may wish to use a wider search strategy and
include more studies.

There are also very few longitudinal data on the relationship
between exposure to particular interventions and program
structures, including linkages between interventions, and suicide
outcomes, except for one study (31, 43). Future research should
address this issue, in a bid to increase the eﬀectiveness of suicide
prevention, including through multilayered interventions.

It is also diﬃcult to determine the eﬀective elements when
evaluating complex interventions with multiple components. We
attempted to address this in this review by considering program
structure and the nature of linkages between components. Future
studies may wish to examine aspects such as the impact of the
number of layers in a multilevel study, and the nature of linkages
between levels, including whether they are formal or informal.
It would also be interesting to examine the role of relationships
and familiarity with services in determining willingness to use
services and seek help. Other studies might examine why formal
referrals are eﬀective in overcoming barriers to seeking help, and
also consider the eﬀect of increased community participation on
suicide rates.

Finally, it is diﬃcult to draw ﬁrm conclusions about the
sex eﬀects of particular approaches. This is partly because of
limitations in study design, small sample size, limited number
of studies, and heterogeneity of study populations. The studies
all included more women than men, especially Tele-Help/Tele-
Check in Italy (28), which included over 80% women. This makes
it much more diﬃcult to draw conclusions about the eﬀects of the
intervention on men, because of the low statistical power of the
study for this group.

The likelihood of suicidal behavior will also vary with gender
meanings of suicide, and the lifetime experiences of men and
women. This means that both gender and sex may aﬀect the
likelihood of suicidal behavior. None of the studies in this review
distinguished suﬃciently between sex and gender to enable
these diﬀerences to be identiﬁed. We suggest that future studies
on suicidal behavior should clearly set their ﬁndings into the
context of gender expectations and meanings related to suicide,
and the diﬀerent experiences of men and women within the
cultural settings.

However, our ﬁndings also suggest some avenues for future
research, especially in preventing suicide in older men. These
include examining the importance of involving mental health
professionals in indicated prevention interventions for this

group, and the eﬀect of linking suicide prevention with managing
mental health conditions.

CONCLUSION

to identify eﬀective elements of

Studies suggest that community interventions are important in
reducing suicide in older adults, and that integrating universal,
selective, and indicated prevention interventions may be crucial
in this process. Both formal and informal
linkages may be
eﬀective, including building user familiarity with services. The
most important relationship and linkages are probably between
selective and indicated prevention interventions. Universal
prevention interventions added to combined selective and
indicated prevention interventions with systematic linkages
may help to disseminate the beneﬁts across the community.
The use of sex-speciﬁc indicators of treatment response is

interventions. To
increase the eﬀectiveness of suicide prevention programs for
to include the management of
men,
mental
illnesses in the indicated prevention interventions.
The program structure, characterized by the interventions and
linkages, may therefore be a key parameter in determining
the eﬀect of multilayered approaches for suicide prevention.
Beyond measuring the impact of such strategies on suicide
incidence, future studies of multilayered programs are needed
to assess their eﬀects on intermediate outcomes related to
their structure. To address the potential for prevention, the
program structure should be considered in a model
that
contemplates which intervention can reach individuals at various
levels of risk and how each intervention can link formally
and informally with other prevention interventions at diﬀerent
risk levels.
