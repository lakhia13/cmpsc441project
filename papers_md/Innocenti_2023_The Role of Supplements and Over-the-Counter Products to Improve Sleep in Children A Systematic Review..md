Abstract: The sleep–wake cycle is a complex multifactorial process involving several neurotransmit-
ters, including acetylcholine, norepinephrine, serotonin, histamine, dopamine, orexin and GABA,
that can be, in turn, regulated by different nutrients involved in their metabolic pathways. Although
good sleep quality in children has been proven to be a key factor for optimal cognitive, physical and
psychological development, a signiﬁcant and ever-increasing percentage of the pediatric popula-
tion suffers from sleep disorders. In children, behavioral interventions along with supplements are
recommended as the ﬁrst line treatment. This systematic review was conducted, according to the
PRISMA guidelines, with the purpose of assessing the principal nutrients involved in the pathways
of sleep-regulating neurotransmitters in children and adolescents. Our focus was the utilization of
over the counter (OTC) products, speciﬁcally iron, hydroxytryptophan, theanine and antihistamines
in the management of different pediatric sleep disorders with the intention of providing a practical
guide for the clinician.

1. Introduction

It has been widely demonstrated that sleep is essential for proper development of
cognitive functions, particularly in the ﬁrst years of life. Several studies have concurred that
good sleep is positively correlated with better health overall; it is associated with improved
memory, attention, learning, mood and, in general, with better well-being, both at the
mental and physical levels [1]. Conversely, inappropriate sleep, either in quality or quantity,
is correlated with impaired daytime functioning due to sleepiness, attention deﬁcit, memory
dysfunction, both in the short and long term [1,2]. Additionally, inadequate sleep correlates
with an increased risk of developing hypertension, obesity, diabetes, depression but also
accidents and injuries, and in teenagers, it has been proven to be associated with increased
risk of self-harm, suicidal thoughts and suicide attempts [1].

Approximately 25–30% of children suffer from some sort of sleep disorder throughout
their childhood with a higher prevalence in children affected by neurological, neurodevel-
opmental or psychiatric conditions [3–7].

The most common sleep disturbances in infants and toddlers are night-time awaken-
ings, with an incidence of 25–50%, bedtime resistance (10–15%) and difﬁculty in falling
asleep (15–30%) [7]. In older children, sleep onset difﬁculty is the most frequently reported
insomnia symptom (15%) together with sleep-related anxiety (11%) [7].

Sleep is a complex process, regulated by many neurotransmitters and neuromodulators

The main neurotransmitters involved in the sleep–wake cycle modulation include acetyl-
choline (ACh), monoamines (such as norepinephrine (NE), serotonin (5-hydroxy-tryptamine,
5-HT), histamine (His), dopamine (DA)), orexin and GABA (g-amino-butyric acid) [8]

Nutrients involved in the pathways of such neurotransmitters have been shown to
play a role in sleep state regulation. Although several studies have been published on the
role of nutrients in the treatment of pediatric sleep disorders, no systematic review has
been conducted on this topic. Our aim was to assess the available evidence on over the
counter (OTC) treatments of sleep disorders in children in order to implement their use in
clinical practice. Therefore, for the purpose of this study, we focused on nutrients and OTC
products and on the role of iron, hydroxytryptophan, theanine and antihistamines in the
management of pediatric sleep disorders.

Regarding theanine, no age restriction was applied due to the scarce availability of

publications on the subject.

The ﬁlters applied were articles published after the year 2000, only humans and in
English. According to the PRISMA method, we screened the articles by means of keywords,
titles and abstracts ﬁrst and, subsequently, a full text evaluation was done on selected
articles to include the most relevant.

Reviews were excluded while retrospective-cohort, cohort, prospective, observational
cross-sectional, case-control, prospective and comparative, multi-center cross-sectional and
longitudinal studies were included in the present systematic review.

Exclusion criteria were studies that did not have a clinical implication, not conducted
on the pediatric population or that did not evaluate sleep parameters and treatment efﬁcacy.

3.1. Iron

Iron is an essential nutrient necessary for producing hemoglobin and a co-factor of
tyrosine hydroxylase, which converts tyrosine to dopamine and then, to noradrenaline. It
is transported in blood bound to transferrin and, through ferritin, it is stored in monocytic-
macrophage cells; hence, ferritin is used as an index of iron peripheral storage. Due to
the iron involvement in the synthesis of certain neurotransmitters, the hypothesis has
been recently been put forward that it is implicated in the pathogenesis of sleep disorders
correlated to restless legs syndrome (RLS) and periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD)
and, consequently, iron supplementation has been indicted as a possible treatment [9]

Table 1 summarizes the information on the selected articles dealing with

iron supplementation.

3.1.1. Iron and Sleep

Peirano et al. [10] investigated the possible effects of iron deﬁcient anemia (IDA)
in infancy and subsequent alterations in sleep organization. They enrolled 55 healthy
4-year-old children; 27 with IDA and 28 nonanemic controls, born full term, and with IDA
assessed at 6, 12 and 18 months of age. Both control and experimental groups underwent
iron therapy; children diagnosed with IDA at 6 months were administered oral ferrous
sulphate 15 mg/day for one year, whereas those diagnosed at 12 or 18 months were
supplemented with oral iron 30 mg/day for at least 6 months. A higher percentage of REM
sleep was noted in the IDA group, due to both an increase in the number of the single REM
stages and of their duration. Furthermore, in the experimental group, within the ﬁrst sleep
cycle, there was a tendency for a shorter ﬁrst REM latency and for a briefer NREM sleep
stage 2 and slow-wave sleep (SWS) duration. The study showed that the occurrence of
IDA in early infancy is associated with long-term changes in the temporal organization of
sleep stages.

Kordas et al. [13] carried out two similar randomized control trials, in Nepal and
Zanzibar, to assess the impact of iron supplementation on sleep in infants by means of
maternal reports. The study included 877 infants (age 12.5 ± 4.0 months) from Pemba
Island, Zanzibar, and 567 children (aged 10.8 ± 4.0 months) from Nepal who were random-
ized to receive either iron–folic acid or placebo once a day for 12 months. Sleep quality
was evaluated via parental reports on napping frequency and duration, nighttime sleep
duration and number of night awakenings. Pemban supplemented children showed longer
nighttime sleep duration (1 h) vs. placebo. Nepali iron-integrated infants showed a longer
sleep duration vs. placebo but only by 0.3 h at night and 0.4 h in total.

Therefore, it is evident that iron levels have a strong impact on sleep organization
even from the ﬁrst months of life and that it can be safely and effectively used in infants
with iron deﬁciency or with a short sleep duration.

3.1.2. Iron and RLS/PLMD

In 2003, Simakajornboon et al. [11] conducted a prospective study on 39 children
(20 males, 19 females, mean age of 7.5 ± 3.1 years) with PLMD. Of the 39 children,
28 had serum ferritin concentration <50 µg/L and were administered iron sulphate at
3 mg/kg/day for 3 months. Among the treated group, 76% of patients showed an improve-
ment in periodic leg movements (PLM) index after 3 months of iron supplementation with
a corresponding increase in serum ferritin levels.

An improvement of RLS in 22 children following iron supplementation was reported
in 2013 by Tilma et al. [15]. All the participants underwent clinical evaluation and blood

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 7821

6 of 15

tests for serum iron and ferritin levels. The authors noted that RLS symptoms appeared
precociously in the ﬁrst year of life with a corresponding decrease in serum ferritin levels.
The main symptoms associated with low ferritin were early awakenings. The children
with a ferritin level below 50 ng/mL were administered 5.6 mg iron/kg/day oral iron
supplementation with improvement in awakenings and RLS symptoms. Iron treatment
positively correlated with a ferritin-concentration-dependent clinical effect.

A retrospective case series evaluated the long-lasting effects of oral iron supplementa-
tion in patients with RLS, PLMD or both [16]. Out of 105 patients, aged 10.2 ± 5.3 years,
64 were diagnosed with PLMD, 7 with RLS and 35 with RLS and PLMD in comorbidity.
Iron determined a signiﬁcant improvement in PLMS index (at 3–6 months, 1–2 years and
>2 years) and adequate ferritin levels, more than 2 years after iron supplementation.

Another retrospective study [14] analyzed safety, tolerability and efﬁcacy of intra-
venous (IV) iron sucrose supplementation, as a possible alternative treatment, in pediatric
RLS and PLMD patients who had failed to respond or had contraindications to oral sup-
plementation. After a single-dose intravenous iron sucrose (3.6 mg/kg), ferritin serum
levels increased from a mean baseline value of 15.3 ± 6.3 ng/mL to 45.7 ± 22.4 ng/mL post
treatment. Furthermore, sleep quality improved in 75% of children and only minor adverse
events took place in 25% of patients, mainly related to gastrointestinal disturbances or IV
catheter placement.

Based on the assumption that the comorbidity between NREM sleep parasomnias and
RLS/PLMD in children is rather frequent, and that their association worsens the disease’s
burden, Gurbani et al. [17] performed a retrospective study to assess whether treatment
of RLS/PLMD with oral iron supplementation determined an improvement also in para-
somnia symptomatology. Among 226 children with a diagnosis of RLS/PLMD, 30 patients
experienced parasomnia episodes and underwent iron treatment. After iron treatment, 50%
of the patients reported an improvement of RLS symptoms and 40% a resolution of the
parasomnias. Furthermore, 21 out of the 30 participants underwent polysomnographic
evaluation showing a reduction in PLM index and PLMS-related arousals.

A group of researchers evaluated the effect of oral iron in 77 two-to-18-year-old
children, with RLS, PLMS/D, OSAS or another sleep disorder: 42 patients were classiﬁed
as responders with an increase in ferritin values of at least 10 micrograms; 35 were non-
responders. The increase in ferritin levels correlated with a decrease in PLMS [20]. Similarly,
the IV ferric carboxymaltose (FCM) in 39 patients, 29 with RLS and 10 with PLMD, who
either did not tolerate or respond to oral iron supplementation determined an increase in
ferritin (from 14.6 ± 7.01 µg/L to 112.4 ± 65.86 µg/L) and in serum iron levels, total iron
binding capacity and transferrin levels. Only 14.3% of patients reported adverse effects
that were described as mild, mainly gastrointestinal disturbances [24]. The same group [21]
conducted an additional retrospective study to compare oral ferrous sulphate (FS) and
IV FCM efﬁcacy in pediatric restless sleep disorder (RSD): 15 children received 325 mg
as tablets or 3 mg/kg/day as solution of oral iron, and 15 received 15 mg/kg (750 mg
maximum) of IV FCM as a single infusion. Despite a statistically signiﬁcant increase in
ferritin levels was noted in both groups, it was higher in the intravenous group.

Finally, an interesting recent case report by Al-Shawwa et al. [23] analyzed the effec-
tiveness of iron infusion therapy in a 2-year-old patient with bedtime resistance, difﬁculty
to settle down, restless sleep and recurrent awakenings that impacted the children’s day-
time functioning. The patient was diagnosed with an iron deﬁcient anemia and IV iron
treatment resulted in an immediate improvement of the associated sleep disorders.

All these studies concur both on the strict correlation between iron deﬁciency, RLS and
PLMD and on the profound and disturbing effects they have on children’s sleep. Hence,
it is evident the importance of assessing iron deﬁcient infants for sleep difﬁculties and
conversely, to screen for iron deﬁciency children who present with an agitated sleep and
multiple night awakenings. Due to the signiﬁcant beneﬁcial effects of iron therapy on these
patients’ symptoms and quality of life, iron oral supplementation should be the ﬁrst line

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 7821

7 of 15

treatment for RLS and PLMD in the pediatric population and, in the more severe cases or
intolerant to oral iron, IV iron therapy can be safely and effectively implemented.

3.1.3. Iron and Autism Spectrum Disorders

Autistic children may also beneﬁt of iron administration: sleep disturbances were
noted in 77% of children with insufﬁcient dietary iron intake. After 8 weeks of iron
supplementation, the ferritin level increased and sleep quality signiﬁcantly improved [12].
In 2020, Reynolds et al. [18] carried out a controlled clinical trial in children with autism
spectrum disorder, insomnia and low ferritin levels. Twenty patients aged 2 to 10 years
were randomly assigned to either 3 mg/kg/day of ferrous sulphate supplementation (n = 9)
or placebo (n = 11) for 3 months. The experimental group showed a decrease in sleep onset
latency and awakenings that, however, was not correlated with the increase in iron levels.
This evidence conﬁrms that the correlation between iron proﬁle and sleep disturbances
is strong also in children with autism spectrum disorder and support iron supplementation
in these group of patients when low ferritin/iron levels and sleep disturbances are noted.

3.1.4. Iron and Psychological Symptoms

Psychological status, as well, may be positively affected by iron administration, as
reported in 19 children (aged 6–15 years) with serum ferritin levels < 30 ng/mL and
psychological symptoms such as decreased energy, fatigue, insomnia and mood alter-
ations treated with 25–100 mg of oral iron for 12 weeks, alongside psychotherapy. At the
12 week follow up after iron supplementation, an improvement in sleep, general health
and psychological status was found [22].

3.1.5. Iron in Sleep Disorder in the Angelman Syndrome

About 20% to 80% of patients with Angelman syndrome are estimated to have sleep
disturbances, such as shorter sleep, increased sleep onset latency, and abnormal sleep
behaviors. In 15 children with Angelman syndrome affected by insomnia and with serum
ferritin level <24 mg/L, iron administration determined improvements in sleep quality [19].
Because of the high frequency of sleep disorder in these patients, it is important to assess
them for iron deﬁciency and to supplement them when needed.

3.2. Antihistamines

Histamine is a neurotransmitter that promotes wakefulness. The activity of the his-
taminergic system is maximal during alert wakefulness, is decreased during quiet wakeful-
ness, and completely suppressed during somnolence, NREM and REM sleep. Histaminergic
neurons are in the posterior hypothalamus (within the tuberomammillary nucleus) and
project primarily to H1 and H3 receptors in the perifornical hypothalamus (orexin-rich) and
cholinergic neurons. First-generation H1 antihistamines are the most used agents for pedi-
atric insomnia, as they reduce sleep latency and nocturnal awakenings and have minimal
effects on sleep architecture. They include ethanolamines (such as diphenhydramine) and
piperazine derivatives (such as hydroxyzine), as well as trimeprazine and niaprazine [25].
The summary of articles dealing with antihistamines is reported in Table 2.

3.2.1. Antihistamine (Diphenhydramine) and Nighttime Awakenings

“The Trial of Infant Response to Diphenhydramine” (TIRED) is a double-blind, ran-
domized, controlled clinical trial to evaluate the efﬁcacy of diphenhydramine hydrochloride
therapy (1 mg/kg) in children aged 6 to 15 months with frequent nocturnal awakenings
reported by parents. According to an initial parental report, by day 14, there was an im-
provement in the number of nocturnal awakenings requiring parental assistance, without
adverse effects. However, the study was later stopped due to lack of efﬁcacy of diphenhy-
dramine versus placebo [26].

3.2.2. Use of Antihistamines as Medications for Children with Sleep Difﬁculties

Wesselhoeft and colleagues [28] conducted a study to describe the use of hypnotic
drugs (melatonin, z-drugs, and sedating antihistamines) among 5-to24-year-old subjects in
Sweden (2,372,337), Norway (1,295,114) and Denmark (1,397,324). Sedating antihistamines
(H1-receptor antagonists including alimemazine, promethazine, and promethazine) were
used as hypnotic drugs in children and adolescents. The annual prevalence of sedating
antihistamine use was highest in Sweden, 13/1000 in 2018; 7.5/1000 in Norway; and
2.5/1000 in Denmark.

3.2.3. Antihistamine (Hydroxyzine) and Bruxism

Hydroxyzine has been reported to be more effective than placebo in 30 children with
bruxism [27]. During a 4-week trial, subjects took hydroxyzine 25–50 mg/day or placebo,
orally, at bedtime. No serious side effects were reported. Some explanations for the
effectiveness of hydroxyzine are the increase in sleep depth, the reduction of anxiety and
the induction of muscle relaxation [27].

3.3. Tryptophan

Tryptophan (TRP) is an essential amino acid that can only be acquired through diet
and is converted into L-5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) by tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH)
that is then decarboxylated to serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) which is further
processed into melatonin (N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine). Therefore, it can be deducible
how tryptophan may play a role in sleep regulation. Table 3 provides a summary of the
articles dealing with tryptophan supplementation.

3.3.1. Tryptophan in Diet and Sleep

Several studies evaluated the effect of tryptophan enriched diet or milk formulas

reporting a moderate but still signiﬁcant improvement in sleep of infants and children.

Aparicio et al. [29] showed that, after administering TRP-enriched milk at night, the
infants slept more, had better sleep efﬁciency, more immobility time and fewer night
movements and awakenings. Furthermore, an increase in 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid
(5-HIAA) and 5-HTP urinary levels were also found, suggesting that the improvements in
sleep time and quality were correlated to an augmented synthesis of both serotonin and
melatonin, in turn correlated with higher TRP levels administered at night-time.

A clinical trial enrolled 30 infants aged between 8 and 16 months with at least three
awakenings during the night in whom cereals were administered with a progressive
increase in TRP content, with the standard formula milk, reporting an improvement in
sleep onset latency and a decrease of the night awakenings [30].

raphy; TRP = tryptophan.

A positive correlation between the index of TRP taken at breakfast (TRP-Index) and
the chronotype evaluated with the Morningness–Eveningness (M–E) questionnaire was
found in Japanese infants and children aged 0–8 years. Furthermore, the less the breakfast
TRP-Indices were, the more frequent it was for children to have difﬁculty in both falling
asleep and in waking up in the morning and the more frequently they manifested anger
and depression [32].

Similarly, another study of 744 children (aged 2–6 years) showed that TRP intake at
breakfast promoted morning-type circadian typology and better sleep and less anger and
depression. Conversely, evening-type children had an increased rate of depression and
anger. The effect of protein intake on shifting the circadian typology to morning-type was
augmented if the children were exposed to sunlight for 30–60 min in the morning, indicating
that sunlight exposure in the morning might accelerate TRP conversion to serotonin during
daytime, which in turn could affect melatonin levels at night [33].

In support of the hypothesis that a higher TRP intake at breakfast may promote
serotonin synthesis via light stimulation in the morning and have a natural sleep-inducing
effect when converted to melatonin at night, Nakade et al. [34] assessed the association
of TRP and vitamin B6 intake, and the following exposure to sunlight on the circadian
typology and sleep quality in young Japanese children. Both TRP and Vitamin-B6 intake
showed a similar correlation with M–E score for children aged 3 to 5 years, but only by
children who were exposed to sunlight for longer than 10 min after breakfast.

These results corroborate the evidence from the previous studies of the importance of
TRP intake at breakfast for children to be morning-typed, to have higher sleep quality and
indirectly, a good health state.

3.3.2. Tryptophan as Sleep Disorder Treatment

Bruni et al. [31] in 2004 were among the ﬁrst to carry out an open pharmacological trial
to verify the efﬁcacy of L-5-hydroxyTRP (L-5-HTP) in 45 children (aged 3.2–10.6 years) with
sleep terrors divided in two groups, one taking 2 mg/kg per day of L-5-HTP at bedtime for
20 consecutive days and the control group in the watchful waiting without any treatment.
Patients taking L-5-HTP decreased the number of episodes in 93.5% (29 out of 31) vs. 28.6%
of the control group; the improvement was maintained after 6 months follow-up.

Similarly, in a retrospective analysis of medical records, children aged 3 to 18 years
with primary parasomnia that received L-TRP (daily dose range: 500–4500 mg, mean
dose 2400 mg) experienced improvements in their parasomnia symptoms in 84% of cases,
compared to only 47% of the non-treated group [35].

3.4. Theanine

L-theanine (γ-glutamylethylamide) is a unique non-protein amino acid that can be
found in green tea leaves. It has been suggested that, through a mechanism mediated by
glutamate receptors, it induces a noteworthy beneﬁcial effect on stress levels and sleep
quality in humans. Unfortunately, only few studies have been implemented, and even less
evidence on the effect in children is available. Nonetheless, the results published so far
seem promising and suggest that the use of L-theanine might be implemented in the clinical
practice. The articles dealing with theanine supplementation are reported in Table 4.

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 7821

3.4.1. Theanine in Children

Only one randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the effect
of 200 mg of L-theanine twice a day for six weeks on sleep quality of 98 children (aged
8–12 years), with a diagnosis of attention-deﬁcit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), has been
published [36]. In the group taking L-theanine, actigraphic sleep and sleep efﬁciency scores
improved with respect to the placebo group. No adverse events were reported, suggesting
that a daily dosage of 400 mg of L-theanine can safely and effectively improve sleep quality
in children with ADHD.

3.4.2. Theanine in Adults

A double-blind crossover study tested the effects of green tea with lowered caffeine
content (LCGT) on stress and quality of sleep of middle-aged individuals. A signiﬁcant
improvement was reported in participants consuming LCGT because of theanine [37]. In
parallel, improved sleep quality and reduced stress levels with lowered caffeine content
green tea (LCGT) were also demonstrated in the elderly population [38].

Similarly, a crossover and double-blind trial with 200 mg/day L-theanine in 30 healthy
adults with stress-related symptoms improved depression, anxiety and sleep onset latency,
as well as sleep disturbances, and decreased the use of sleep medication [39].

Different studies were conducted with theanine in association with other compounds;

therefore, it is difﬁcult to evaluate the effects of the single compounds on sleep.

Halson et al. in 2020 [40] carried out a double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover ex-
perimental study to investigate the effects of an optimized drink containing six ingredients
(tart cherry juice, high GI CHO, α-lactalbumin, adenosine-5-monophosphate (5-AMP), vale-
rian and theanine) on sleep quality, reporting a signiﬁcant reduction in sleep onset latency.
Thiagarajah et al. [44], in a randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover and double-blind
study, investigated the effects of alpha-s1-casein tryptic hydrolysate containing RLX2™
and L-theanine in 39 adults with poor sleep quality showing improvement in sleep latency,
sleep duration (increased by 45 min), habitual sleep efﬁciency and daytime dysfunction.
No adverse events were reported. A combination of TRP, glycine, magnesium, tart cherry
powder and L-theanine was administered in a double-blind cross-over trial in 16 par-
ticipants with decrease of sleep onset latency and increase of total sleep time and sleep
efﬁciency [43]. Furthermore, a combination of magnesium, vitamins B6, B9, B12, rhodiola
and green tea/L-theanine administered to 100 chronically stressed otherwise healthy adults
showed a good effect on depression and stress, but no differences in sleep quality [42].

A mixture including 500 mg of TRP and 200 mg of L-theanine with L-glutamine,
D-phenylalanine, tyrosine, multivitamin/mineral, magnesium citrate, zinc and gamma-
linoleic acid improved anxiety, depression and sleep disturbances in a 26-year-old female
with post-traumatic stress disorder [41].

Despite the evidence suggesting a potential beneﬁcial effect of L-theanine on sleep,
most studies used mixtures of it with several other compounds and therefore, disentangling
the speciﬁc effect of L-theanine is difﬁcult.

4. Discussion

This review highlights that there have been relatively few published reports of ran-
domized placebo-controlled studies evaluating the efﬁcacy and safety of OTC agents in
infants and children with sleep disturbances, despite their widespread and frequent use,
often without input from a health care provider. Notwithstanding this, our systematic
review emphasizes that multiple OTC treatments can be used effectively in children with
sleep disorders. Such disorders, as mentioned above, have a high incidence in the pediatric
population and a strong impact on daytime functioning. While the ﬁrst line treatments

Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 7821

13 of 15

remain the behavioral interventions, if these fail, or in addition in the more severe cases,
OTC agents can be safely prescribed.

Our systematic review of this partial OTC literature should be interpreted in light
of speciﬁc limitations. We did not include some agents and especially melatonin, as well
as other herbal agents, for which there is very limited literature data and that were not
commonly used in Italy, such as valerian, passionﬂower, St John’s wort, kava kava, etc. The
exclusion of these agents should be considered when interpreting the evidence summarized
in the present study. Finally, we focused on the treatment of sleep disorders or insomnia in
otherwise healthy children (although we considered iron in autism based on the literature).
What emerges from this review is that, depending on the prevailing sleep disorder
and associated comorbidities, there are indications to use different compounds. Particularly
regarding sleep disorders related to RLS, PLMD and in children, IDA, the treatment of
choice, supported by convincing evidence, is oral iron supplementation and, in the most
severe cases, IV iron supplementation can be used with sufﬁcient safety and effectiveness.
As for children with an anamnesis of allergies, it is known that histamine is a “wake-
promoting” agent [45] and increased levels can be the main pathogenic factor of sleep
disturbance in these patients, hence the role of antihistamines in treating such disorders.
However, we must take into account that tolerance to the sedative effects of antihistamines
can develop quickly.

Regarding TRP, there is solid evidence on its signiﬁcant role in the sleep cycle regula-
tion and efﬁciency. It represents the ﬁrst line in the treatment of awakenings and especially
of parasomnias, both in terms of effectiveness and safety. Since L-TRP (not L-5-HTP) in 1989
determined eosinophilia myalgia syndrome, 5-HTP has been under vigilance by consumers,
industry, academia and government for its safety. However, no deﬁnite cases of toxicity
have emerged despite the worldwide usage of 5-HTP for several years and there is no
evidence of 5-HTP intake as a cause of any illness, especially the eosinophilia myalgia
syndrome or its related disorders [46].

Moreover, although there is a scarce literature on theanine in the pediatric popula-
tion, what emerges from adult studies is that it has a safe and tolerable proﬁle and an
effectiveness both in terms of amelioration of quality and quantity of sleep. Neverthe-
less, further studies are needed to elucidate its mechanism of action and therefore, its
clinical applications.

In conclusion, since OTC without a prescription can be used to treat insomnia and
other sleep issues in children, there is a need to have clear indications about risk factors,
side effects and other potential concerns. It is also important to know that supplements
are not regulated by the Food and Drug Administration as strictly as other medications.
However, it has been demonstrated that OTC treatments represent, in the majority of
pediatric sleep disorders, the safest therapeutic option and their conscientious employment
in clinical practice is suggested and sufﬁciently supported by the literature.
