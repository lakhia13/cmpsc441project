Abstract: Decentering has received more attention in sports literature as a self-regulating skill capable
of signiﬁcantly limiting episodes of mental block in competitive situations. This contribution depicts
a comparative study conducted with 375 Italian national and international athletes. The objective was
to evaluate athletes’ decentralization skills across different sports and levels of competition and test
a mediation model of decentering in sports with coping and emotional balance variables. Pearson
bivariate correlations, linear hierarchical regression, and simple mediation analysis were conducted
for all main measures (The Decentering Sport Scale, The Emotion Regulation Questionnaire, and
The Coping Orientations to Problems Experienced). Outputs reported signiﬁcant associations with
emotional regulation and coping styles. Mediation analysis conﬁrmed the central mediating role
of decentering capacity which has indirect effects on both the coping ability of problem solving
(z-value = 2.986; p = 0.003) and cognitive reappraisal (z-value = 2.779; p = 0.005). Decentering acts
as a mediator between an athlete’s positive attitude, problem-orientation ability, and management
of emotions in competition through cognitive reappraisal. The study highlights the signiﬁcance of
evaluating and enhancing decentralization skills in order to establish speciﬁc action mechanisms,
which are crucial for both peak performance and the athlete’s health.

1. Introduction

The traditional focus of interventions for improving athlete performance and health
has been on the physical aspects. With new research suggesting that athlete well-being has
a signiﬁcant impact on injury risk and athletic performance, there has been an increased
focus in recent years on the mental aspects of athlete health. Meditation practices based on
mindfulness have been shown to improve both mental and physical health in a number of
clinical populations. Additionally, studies have investigated how mindfulness can improve
athletic performance, reduce injury risk, and possibly even increase the speed of injury
recovery [1]. Researchers discovered that practicing mindfulness can enhance one’s capacity
to control emotions, address emotional dysfunction, enhance thought patterns, lessen
negative thinking, as well as enhance physical function and interpersonal relationships [2].
The acceptance of one’s situation is a general clinical beneﬁt of mindfulness, and this can
reduce the internal conﬂict that can occur when the expectations of how life should be are
different from how life actually is.

One of the main aspects of mindfulness is the concept of “decentering”, which is
deﬁned as the ability to view thoughts, feelings, and physical sensations as transient mental
events rather than as self-referential truths or facts. It is the capacity of the individual to
not get caught up in (often negative) thoughts and to let them go. In sports psychology,
this approach can aid athletes in controlling perceived pressure, performance anxiety, and
even preventing a performance downturn [3].

Decentering, or the ability to step outside of one’s immediate experience and observing
one’s self in the process of constructing the experience, has been described as a central

process of change in cognitive therapies that aim to help clients become experientially
aware of the role that their minds plays in the construction of their reality [4].

The concepts of mindfulness, decentering, cognitive defusion, and self-compassion
are often used interchangeably, but in reality, they can be distinguished effectively; this is
the result of several studies that have investigated these construct differences by separating
the factors [5,6].

Athletes who can step back from their emotions and thoughts and view stressful
situations as opportunities rather than threats are more likely to perform well under
pressure [7]. For example, when faced with pre-race anxiety, decentering athletes may
beneﬁt from rephrasing their anxiety as “I think I’m feeling nervous right now” rather than
“I’m nervous”, as this may reduce the negative effects of the latter statement.

In sport psychology, athletes are taught mental strategies to help them deal with a num-
ber of difﬁcult challenges related to how their minds work [8,9]. Decreases in rumination
also have been linked to improvements in well-being and decreased psychological distress,
suggesting that mindfulness at the dispositional level may be a crucial component [10,11].
People may be able to relate to events more objectively, which could help them avoid
becoming overly mentally and emotionally involved [12], and thus help them recognize
unpleasant emotions that need to be controlled more quickly [13]. Other research has
shown that positive cognitive reappraisal increases the feelings of positive emotions in
archery athletes and enhances performance in experimental tasks [14,15], while expression
suppression does not increase motor performance in table tennis [16]. Arousal reappraisal
also helps golfers avoid “choking”, and to some extent, it ensures performance in putting
tasks, similarly to cognitive reappraisal [17].

Some studies have conceptualised decentering and related constructs as traits [6,18–20],
while other scholars have deﬁned them as states [21–23]. However, it is also hypothe-
sised that if activated repeatedly over time and in various contexts, the expression of this
metacognitive process may become more stable or trait-like [24]. Evidence points to a
continuum in the distribution of one’s ability to decenter from commonplace negative inner
events [6,19,25]. People at the lower end of this spectrum are more inclined to concentrate
on the themes of unpleasant inner events and to rely on this knowledge to inﬂuence their
behavior and decision-making.

The Experiences Questionnaire was the ﬁrst psychometric tool that was used to mea-
sure decentering [26]; it originally consisted of fourteen items to measure the decentering
factor and an additional six rumination items designed to control for response bias. In
previous studies on the development of decentering scales, initial ﬁndings indicated that de-
centering is positively related to mindfulness, cognitive reappraisal, positive affect, and life
satisfaction, and negatively related to experiential avoidance, rumination, negative affect,
depression, anxiety, stress, expressive suppression, brooding, and cognitive fusion [26,27].
In various studies with mediation analyses, it has been found that decentering can me-
diate the effect of mindfulness and cognitive reappraisal on anxiety symptoms [28,29], the
effect of mindfulness on depressive symptoms [29,30], the effect of self-focus on negative
thoughts in depression [31], and the effect of rumination on depression [11,12]. Further-
more, studies have shown that the mindfulness ring can be a mediator between mindful-
ness interventions and the Positive Mindset [32] and between meditation and personal
values [33].

In consideration of these studies, we decided to conduct a study focusing on the
decentering capacity of professional athletes in different disciplines. The research was
guided by four main hypotheses:

(1) decentering ability may exhibit signiﬁcant differences, attributable to individual

characteristics such as age, gender, and competitive experience;

(2) decentering ability may show signiﬁcant differences in relation to the type of sports

discipline practiced;
higher competitive levels correspond to higher decentering ability in athletes;

(3)

(4) decentering may be a positive mediating factor between coping skills and emotion

regulation in the athletes.

2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Participants

In order to test the hypotheses of this study, a statistical power analysis was performed
for sample size estimation. The effect size (ES) was set to 0.30, considered to be medium,
using Cohen’s criteria. Using the G*Power 3.1 software (Heinrich Heine Universität Düs-
seldorf, Düsseldorf, Germany), with consideration of the effect size and what is considered
appropriate for performing an intergroup comparison while taking into account the ath-
letes’ gender and level of competition (regional, national, international), the minimum
number of participants was preliminarily set at 281. In view of mediation testing, we took
into account the following: the minimum number of participants for conducting linear
multiple regressions including eight prediction variables, indicated to be 106 participants
by G*Power; in the absence of a speciﬁc sampling calculator for mediation analysis, the
optimal guideline number indicated in the literature, which is a sample size of 405 required
for 0.8 power; the median sample size number of 341 derived from literature surveys
about the methods used to test for mediation [34,35]. The sample was recruited in a non-
probabilistic way through an open invitation. For the study, 375 professional athletes were
involved, including 222 males (59.2%) and 153 (40.8%) females, with an average age of
26.3 (SD = 11.65). They were asked to join the study for free through the collaboration of
various professional federations and teams. An email of involvement in the study was sent
to the presidency of the various sports federations with a description of the research and a
request to allow the technical group and coaches to forward it to their respective athletes.
The athletes were invited to participate by clicking on a link provided for ﬁlling out a
questionnaire which covered both the collection of general information of a biographical
type and the athlete’s level of sports activity, and the self-report psychometric instruments
that were chosen for the study. The inclusion criteria of the subjects in the study included
being active competitive athletes at the time the study was conducted. No particular criteria
regarding training years and athletic level were set. The research was carried out on three
levels of competition: regional (n = 175; 46.7%), national (n = 139; 37.1%), and international
(n = 61; 16.3%). The sports disciplines included in the study, as reported in Table 1, were
football (n = 106; 28.3%) archery (n = 67; 17.9%), volleyball (n = 45; 12%), swimming (n = 45;
12%), martial arts (n = 32; 8.5%), ﬁtness (n = 31; 8.3%), basketball (n = 25; 6.7%), and rowing
(n = 24; 6.4%). Participants in the study voluntarily gave their consent to the conﬁdential
treatment of their data in aggregate form for scientiﬁc purposes only. In June and July 2022,
a questionnaire with a general information section and a psychometric section was given
out. By using a speciﬁc link, the tool allowed users to ﬁll out forms online and collect data
on the Questbase platform. The subjects were informed that the questionnaire would only
be used for research and that it was anonymous. In accordance with the Declaration of
Helsinki, each approached athlete provided written informed consent. The Institutional
Review Board of the Department of Human Sciences, Society and Health, University of
Cassino and Southern Lazio, has given its approval to the protocol.

2.2. Tools

The Decentering Sport Scale [36] consists of 12 items and a 5-point lickert scale (never
true to always true) and assesses the one-dimensional construct of decentering in a sport
context. The DSS was developed in accordance with the decentering construct used for
the Experience Questionnaire [26], a questionnaire already validated and used in many
contexts. Decentering in the validation work of the DSS scale was considered from both
a behavioural and a cognitive perspective, i.e., individuals (a) cognitively differentiate
their thoughts from the true self and truth and (b) cease the habitual reaction to their
experiences through behaviour. DSS can be applied for the evaluation of decentering in
sports contexts in order to explore the effectiveness of various mental training programmes

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2023, 20, 3324

and to test processes of change. The application of DSS for different types of interventions
(e.g., CBT, relaxation, and mindfulness interventions) can also serve as a tool to elucidate the
similarities and differences in the use of these programmes in athletes’ mental training [7].
The Italian translation of the original instrument was used, obtained through the back
translation method and the support of two language experts. The veriﬁcation of full
comprehensibility of the items was carried out through confrontation with a group of
20 college students enrolled in the university sports center (CUS) of the local university.
No translated item revealed problems related to its full comprehension. The measurement
validity of the scale was assessed through a Conﬁrmatory Factor Analysis (CFA), which
conﬁrmed the single-factor structure of the instrument and reported good ﬁt indices:
X2(49) = 87.076; CFI = 0.966; TLI = 0.954; RMSEA = 0.049; RMSEA 90% C.I. [0.032; 0.065];
p-value = 0.522. The scale also showed good overall internal consistency: Cronbach’s
α = 0.83 [CIs 95% 0.795; 0.851]; McDonald’s ω = 0.83; [CIs 95% 0.805; 0.858].

The Emotion Regulation Questionnaire [37] is a 10-item self-report questionnaire com-
prised of two scales representing two distinct emotion regulation strategies: cognitive
reappraisal (six items) and expressive suppression (four items). The instructions ask the
subject questions about his or her emotional life, speciﬁcally how he or she controls (that is,
regulates and manages) emotions. The ten items are rated from strongly disagree to strongly
agree on a 7-point Likert scale. The Italian validation of the scale was used [38]. The scale
showed good overall internal consistency in this study with respect to the two component
subscales. Cognitive reappraisal: Cronbach’s α = 0.85 [CIs 95% 0.818; 0.870]; McDonald’s
ω = 0.85; [CIs 95% 0.823; 0.874]; Expressive suppression: Cronbach’s α = 0.72 [CIs 95%
0.680; 0.761]; McDonald’s ω = 0.73; [CIs 95% 0.679; 0.774].

The Coping Orientations to Problems Experienced [39] is a 60-item questionnaire assessing
15 different coping strategies. The items are rated on a 4-point Likert scale ranging from “I
usually don’t do it” to “I almost always do it”. In the Italian validation of the COPE-NVI

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2023, 20, 3324

tool [40], ﬁve main factors were deﬁned: Social support, Avoidance strategies, Positive
attitude, Problem solving, and Turning to Religion. The scale for this study showed good
overall internal consistency with respect to the ﬁve subscales. Social support: Cronbach’s
α = 0.90 [CIs 95% 0.884; 0.916]; McDonald’s ω = 0.91; [CIs 95% 0.891; 0.921]; Avoidance
strategies: Cronbach’s α = 0.87 [CIs 95% 0.853; 0.893]; McDonald’s ω = 0.87; [CIs 95%
0.848; 0.890]; Positive attitude: Cronbach’s α = 0.77 [CIs 95% 0.727; 0.802]; McDonald’s
ω = 0.87; [CIs 95% 0.726; 0.803]; Problem solving: Cronbach’s α = 0.83 [CIs 95% 0.804;
0.857]; McDonald’s ω = 0.84; [CIs 95% 0.813; 0.865]; and Turning to Religion: Cronbach’s
α = 0.75 [CIs 95% 0.703; 0.749]; McDonald’s ω = 0.76; [CIs 95% 0.716; 0.799].

2.3. Data Analysis

Statistical analyses were performed using the package SPSS (IBM, Chicago, IL, USA)
version 26 and JASP (JASP Team 2023 computer software) version 0.17, while the free
software G*Power version 3.1.9.4 (RRID:SCR_013726) was used for sample calculation.
The main analyses performed were: descriptive statistics about gender, age, and sport
disciplines; Conﬁrmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) to test the single-factor structure of DSS
and relative main ﬁt indices (CFI, TLI, and RMSEA); Pearson bivariate correlations for
all main measures (The Decentering Sport Scale, The Emotion Regulation Questionnaire,
and The Coping Orientations to Problems Experienced) signiﬁcant at p < 0.005 and at
p < 0.001, 2-tailed; Cronbach’s alpha and McDonald’s omega as scale reliability coefﬁ-
cients; independent-samples t-test to explore differences in decentering between males
and females; Welch Anova one-way with post-hoc Games-Howell and p < 0.05 to explore
signiﬁcant differences within the eight sport disciplines. Linear hierarchical regression was
used to identify the predictors of decentering. A simple mediation analysis was conducted
to test the role of decentering capacity as a mediator between the coping and the emotional
management skills of the athletes.

A one-way Welch ANOVA was conducted to determine if the ability to decenter
(DSS score) was different for groups with different professionalism levels. Participants
were classiﬁed into three groups: regional athletes (n = 175), national athletes (n = 139),
and international athletes (n = 61). There were no outliers, and the data was normally
distributed for each group, as assessed by boxplot and the Shapiro-Wilk test (p > 0.05),
respectively. Homogeneity of variances was violated, as assessed by Levene’s Test of
Homogeneity of Variance (p = 0.003). The DSS score was statistically signiﬁcantly different
between different professionalism groups; Welch’s (2, 166.508) = 42.058, p < 0.001. The
DSS score increased from the regional (M = 3.26, SD = 0.54) to the national (M = 3.50,
SD = 0.70) and international (M = 3.99, SD = 0.54) group, in that order. Games-Howell post
hoc analysis revealed that the mean increase from regional group to national group (0.25,
95% CI [0.08, 0.42]) was statistically signiﬁcant (p = 0.002), as well as the increase from
national to the international group (0.49, 95% CI [0.27, 0.70], p = 0.000). As the competitive
level increases (see Figure 1), the athlete’s capacity to decenter increases.

Figure 1. Mean of DSS in relation to the level of professionalism.

An independent-samples t-test was run to determine if there were differences in
decentering capacity between males and females. There were no outliers in the data, as
assessed by inspection of a boxplot. DSS scores for each level of gender were normally
distributed, as assessed by Shapiro-Wilk’s test (p > 0.05), and there was homogeneity of
variances, as assessed by Levene’s test for equality of variances (p = 0.289). Decentering was
higher in male athletes (M = 3.55, SD = 0.63) than in female athletes (M = 3.35, SD = 0.67),
with a statistically signiﬁcant difference, M = 0.20, 95% CI [0.06, 0.33], t(373) = 2.883,
p = 0.004. Taking only the international competition level into consideration, the difference
between males (M = 4.09, SD = 0.48) and females (M = 3.85, SD = 0.59) loses statistic
signiﬁcance: M = 0.24, 95% CI [−0.03, 0.51], t(59) = 1.752, p = 0.085; Levene’s test: p = 0.517.
In addition, no signiﬁcant differences were found for decentering ability in relation to age,
sport discipline, and years of competitive experience (p > 0.05).

Table 3 below reports bivariate correlations between the variables used in the study.
As seen in Table 3, the decentering measure strongly correlated (p ≤ 0.001) with the
coping variables Positive Attitude and Problem Solving. Moreover, the decentering variable
was positively correlated with the Cognitive Reappraisal variable with regard to emotion
regulation. Decentering, on the other hand, was negatively correlated with the Turning to
Religion variable.

As indicated above, a hypothesis of the study included assessing the mediating role
of decentering within the athlete’s coping and emotional regulation strategies. Given that
in the performed study the correlations recorded with the decentering variable showed a
signiﬁcant magnitude (>0.30) with Positive Attitude, Problem Orientation and Cognitive

athletes in remaining motivated while avoiding anxiety and becoming overwhelmed [41,42],
we set this as the main reference variable in the model and considered that decentering
could signiﬁcantly and positively mediate the effects of positive attitude on the ability to
stay focused on the addressing the problem situation and on the functional control of the
emotional sphere.

A simple mediation model was tested in which decentering acted as a mediator
between the athlete’s positive attitude, problem-orientation ability, and the management of
emotions in competition through cognitive reappraisal (see Figure 2).

The mediation analysis conﬁrmed the central mediating role of decentering capacity,
which acts with indirect effect on both the coping ability of problem solving (z-value = 2.986;
p = 0.003) and the cognitive reappraisal (z-value = 2.779; p = 0.005). The direct effect and the

4. Discussion

The study highlighted the role of decentering capacity in sport. In all sport disci-
plines considered in this study, decentering capacity was shown to be signiﬁcantly related
to the level of competition. In particular, international level athletes showed a greater
ability to decenter. Presumably, this capacity allows athletes to avoid being inﬂuenced
by thoughts during competition and to be more oriented and focused on the action to
be performed [43–45]. These results are in line with what has been observed in previous

studies [46] which found that athletes’ ﬂow state scores were higher when they were more
mindful, had a clear goal, focused their attention, and felt in control. In our study, decen-
tering has been shown to be an important factor in coping with the athlete’s difﬁculties in
competition. Correlation analyses, showed important relationships between decentering
skills and the coping subscales of Problem solving and Positive Attitude. Furthermore,
decentering could play a role in emotional management in that during the performance,
those who managed to decenter more were also those who managed their emotions better
through cognitive reappraisal. There are many different strategies for controlling emotions,
but cognitive reappraisal is a signiﬁcant and useful one [37,47,48]. According to studies,
suppression of expression is not positively correlated with motor performance, whereas
positive cognitive reappraisal is [14]; this boosts athletes’ feelings of fulﬁllment and en-
hances their performance on experimental tasks [15]. In addition, the cognitive reappraisal
of emotions is often associated with positive aspects of the athlete’s well-being [49,50]. A
recent contribution on archery athletes highlighted that development of sport conﬁdence
and attentiveness is crucial to the results to be achieved [51]. A mediation analysis revealed
a complexity in the relationship between cognitive reappraisal and archers’ performance,
but it should be emphasised that athletes who directed attentional resources to cognitive
reappraisal were found to have higher levels of sports conﬁdence.

In the mediation model presented, it was found that an athlete who prepares for the
competition with a positive attitude can manage his or her emotions better and can also be
more oriented towards problem solving during the competition. Interestingly, decentering
does not promote a reaction of suppression of emotions but rather helps athletes to activate
a reinterpretation of them, improving their impact towards positive aspects.

The concept of positive attitude can be compared to that of self-conﬁdence and self-
efﬁcacy in sport. Many studies and reviews have emphasised the importance of these
factors for improving performance [52–54]. Athletes with more self-conﬁdence are more
likely to see anxiety as a functional sign and use it to improve their performance [55–58].
The action of positive attitude can be mediated by good decentering work on the part
of the athlete. The ability to detach oneself from thoughts, whether positive or negative,
combined with the athlete’s positive and winning attitude, can improve concentration
and action orientation. These characteristics could be used together to deﬁne a model of
intervention and/or coaching for professional athletes to help improve performance and
concentration in competition. In the past few years, a number of studies have found that
mindfulness and acceptance and commitment therapy can be used to improve the ﬂow and
performance of athletes. Clinical psychology has demonstrated the value of mindfulness
training. College students’ levels of anxiety and depression can be reduced by mindfulness
practice, which is widely used to control emotions and relieve stress [59–61]. Additionally,
acceptance-based intervention techniques are used to raise athletes’ performance levels,
demonstrating the value of improving athletes’ ﬂow state experiences in the context of
sports [57,62–64]. Furthermore, mindfulness training might enhance athletes’ sporting
experiences while also providing psychological beneﬁts [65,66].

This work should of course be seen in the light of some limitations. One limitation of
the study concerns the fact that the selected athletes were not asked beforehand whether or
not they had previously conducted courses or training on decentering or mindfulness skills.
Furthermore, the sample was recruited in a non-propabilistic way by an open invitation
to the athletes; the ﬁnal number of participants was somewhat lower than the optimal
number of 405 indicated for similar mediation analyses, but nevertheless, higher than the
median sample size used in other studies reported in the literature. It should be also taken
into account that the psychological measures used are obtained from participants’ self-
report assessments. Future studies should therefore include the use of objective detection
instruments for mental states associated with defocusing and emotional control under
competitive pressure conditions.

5. Conclusions

In relation to the four hypotheses that guided the research, for the ﬁrst, the results
conﬁrmed that the athletes’ gender is associated with different decentering ability which is
signiﬁcantly greater in males. However, this difference was not found to be attributable to
age or years of competitive experience. As for the second hypothesis, no inﬂuence related
to the type of discipline practiced was recorded. The results supported the third hypothesis,
namely that as the competitive level increases, the ability to decentralize increases. For the
international level, the gender difference shown in the overall sample loses signiﬁcance.
The model of positive mediation between coping skills and emotion regulation, which
was the subject of the fourth hypothesis, also found clear conﬁrmation in the analyses
conducted. Overall, the present study shows the role of decentering as a characteristic
to bring further attention on for the development of speciﬁc training with the support of
experimental studies. These trainings may enable athletes to improve their ability to detach
themselves from thoughts and be more concentrated during the match. Data indicate
that more emphasis should be placed on decentralization capacity enhancement in female
athletes, especially at the regional and national levels. Trainings to improve decentering
ability in athletes could also be effective in assisting better management of pain states both
during competition and in the period of recovery from injury [67–70]. In a larger direction,
mindfulness can become a signiﬁcant element in integrating and enhancing the athlete’s
situational awareness, improving not only performance but helping to preserve his/her
mental well-being through a positive, goal-oriented approach.
