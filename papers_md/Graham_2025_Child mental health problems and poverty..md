Waiting lists for children and young people with mental health problems are at an all-
time high. Almost the only policies proposed to deal with this situation involve
increasing the number of mental health professionals. Little attention is given to
dealing with the underlying causative stresses, of which poverty is easily the most
pervasive. It is suggested that unless levels of poverty are reduced, the rates of
psychiatric disorders will not change. As psychiatrists, we need to become much
more active in pressing for action over child poverty.

let alone treated,

The extent of child mental health problems that have not
even been professionally assessed,
is
perhaps the single most troubling feature of our society
today. There are over a quarter of a million children waiting
for assessment and treatment, with waiting times of up to 2
years.1 The response of government, professional and
voluntary organisations is unanimous: the number of mental
health professionals must be greatly increased. The need to
reduce poverty, the most pervasive stress underlying mental
disorders, is barely mentioned. Although, in recent years, the
Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health has pinpointed
poverty as a significant stress, none of the other professional
or voluntary organisations have followed suit.

that staff

To champion an increase in the number of mental health
professionals is unexceptionable; the problem is that it is
quite unrealistic to suggest
levels will rise
sufficiently to abolish waiting lists. Worse, provision of early
intervention might well result in higher prevalence figures
and even longer waiting lists. A focus on early identification
is likely to result mainly in the recognition of mild problems,
many of which would, if left alone, dissipate with time.
Further, it is just not rational to intervene therapeutically
when the stresses that have produced a mental health
problem continue to operate after an intervention has been
applied, successfully or unsuccessfully.

Stresses and adverse events in the young: the
role of poverty

So, what are the stresses that result in child and adolescent
mental health disorders? The most common adverse
influences affecting children are maltreatment of all types,
disharmonious family relationships (especially parental
conflict and breakdown), academic failure, parental mental
illness, brain dysfunction and lack of community support
arising from weak neighbourhood cohesion. These are more
likely to produce mental health disorders if they are present
in combination; most children showing mental health
disorders are subject to multiple stresses. However, there
is one common factor underlying these stresses and
indirectly, child and adolescent mental health
therefore,
problems – poverty.

The links between poverty and different types
of child mental health problems

From a population perspective, the influence of both absolute
and relative poverty varies depending on the type of mental
health problem in question. For some conditions, especially
eating disorders and autism, poverty is relatively unimpor-
tant in the development of the problem. This does not mean
that socially disadvantaged families with children with these

427

AGAINST THE STREAM
Graham & Maughan Child mental health and poverty

conditions are not additionally burdened by their low
income. For example, low-income parents of children with
autism will have greater problems accessing appropriate
services than those with adequate incomes, but poverty in
itself does not act as a cause of autism.

Then there are those mental health problems where
poverty is sometimes a major contributing factor and, at
other times, a relatively unimportant
influence. Most
depressive and anxiety disorders fall into this category. For
example, the child of a single mother living in cramped
accommodation, harassed by debt repayments and finding it
difficult or impossible to buy enough food to stave off hunger,
will have a high risk of poverty-influenced depression. On the
other hand, income is not a stress for children with wealthy
parents who have separated acrimoniously with little
concern for their wishes or needs, yet such children may
well become depressed. Similarly, a child’s anxiety state may
relate to fear of being sexually abused even in a high-income
family. There is one type of anxiety, emotionally based school
avoidance, which does seem to be particularly strongly linked
to low income. This occurs when children are just too anxious
to attend school and parents are unable to get them there.
Currently, in the UK, at one time or another, three in ten
schoolchildren are missing school for this reason, and the
problem is far more common in children from families with a
low income.

Finally, there are two psychiatric disorders that are
particularly strongly associated with psychosocial disadvan-
tage – conduct disorder and attention-deficit hyperactivity
disorder (ADHD) – which, together, account for about half of
the total number of mental health disorders in children and
young people. Population studies show strong links between
low social status and the prevalence of oppositional and
conduct disorders.2 Children from disadvantaged back-
grounds are also far more likely to show ADHD than those
from more affluent backgrounds. Thus, in one UK population
study,3 15.8% of children from economically inactive families
showed ADHD-relevant symptoms compared with 4.3% in
managerial and professional families. Poverty affects the
most important stresses leading to emotional and behaviour
disorders of childhood: child maltreatment, marital dishar-
mony, educational failure and brain dysfunction.4,5

Policies to reduce poverty

We live in a wealthy country, and the decision of whether to
lift children out of poverty is a political one. The main
justification for alleviating poverty in high-income countries
like the UK lies in the fact that it is neither fair nor just that
any section of society should go without the basic necessities
of life,6 but the likely effect on reducing rates of behaviour
and emotional problems in childhood is an important
additional reason for tackling poverty. There are various
ways in which this might be achieved. In theory, the benefit
systems should allow parents who are out of work or with low
income from employment to receive sufficient funds from
the state to keep them out of poverty, however defined.
However, in recent years, benefits have simply not kept up
with the cost of living.

Aside from the existing system, which relies heavily on
the capacity of individuals to access the benefits to which

they are clearly entitled, there are two other approaches to
reduce levels of poverty. The first, the provision of universal
basic services, would require a modification of the present
system, involving a much greater attempt to ensure all basic
services,
food and adequate
housing, are, like healthcare and education, freely available.
The second is for a universal basic income. This would
involve all citizens, or sometimes just those who have less
than a minimum level of income, regularly receiving an
income in the form of an unconditional transfer payment, i.e.
without a means test or need to work. This proposal is
gradually receiving more support and is being trialled in
England, with a monthly payment of £1600.7

Effects of reducing poverty on rates of mental
health problems

The effects of alleviating poverty using direct financial
assistance on mental health outcomes have been poorly
researched in adults and hardly at all in children, but there
are a number of encouraging pointers.8,9 Particularly
encouraging evidence based on sound methodology also
comes from Copeland et al,10 who found continuing effects
on rates of conduct disorder 20 years after a randomly
selected group of families had received a significant cash
payment.

If poverty is a powerful
contribute to the development of mental health problems,
then mental health professionals need to give attention to its
alleviation. They will not be able to relieve poverty
themselves, but they need to bring pressure on policy
makers who have it in their power to do so. They should not
hesitate to bring pressure on local authorities to provide the
necessities of life for the children they see. Further, they need
to ensure that such families are in receipt of all the benefits
to which they are entitled. Their clinical interventions should
take into account the social disadvantages that these families
are experiencing; for example, by recognising difficulties in
accessing services. MRCPsych training programmes should
include material relevant to the importance of poverty and
poverty reduction. Finally, psychiatrists should support
