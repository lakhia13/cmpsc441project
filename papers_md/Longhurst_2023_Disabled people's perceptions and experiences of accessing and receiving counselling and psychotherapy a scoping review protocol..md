Disabled people’s perceptions and 
experiences of accessing and receiving 
counselling and psychotherapy: a 
scoping review protocol

Phaedra Longhurst,1,2 Wayne Full      2,3

ABSTRACT
Introduction  Evidence indicates that, compared with 
their non- disabled counterparts, disabled people are 
likely to face greater mental health challenges as well 
as significant inequalities in accessing appropriate 
therapeutic support. Currently, little is known about how 
disabled people perceive and experience counselling 
and psychotherapy, what barriers/facilitators to therapy 
delivery and/or therapy participation exist for disabled 
clients and whether clinicians sufficiently adapt their 
practice to meet the needs of this diverse but marginalised 
population. In this paper, we outline a proposal for 
undertaking a scoping review that aims to identify 
and synthesise current research relating to disabled 
individuals’ perceptions of accessibility and experiences of 
counselling and psychotherapy. The review aims to identify 
current gaps in the evidence base and inform how future 
research, practice and policy may develop and foster 
inclusive strategies and approaches which will support 
the psychological well- being of disabled clients accessing 
counselling and psychotherapy.
Methods and analysis  The undertaking and reporting 
of the proposed scoping review will be guided by the 
framework outlined by Arksey and O’Malley and the 
Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and 
Meta- Analysis Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA- 
ScR) guidelines. Systematic searches of the PsycINFO, 
CINAHL, EMBASE, EBSCO and Cochrane Library electronic 
databases will be conducted. Reference lists of relevant 
studies will be reviewed to identify additional studies. 
Eligible studies will be limited to those published from 
1 January 2010 to 31 December 2022 and in the 
English language. Empirical studies involving disabled 
individuals receiving and/or who have received a form 
of therapeutic intervention will be included. Data will be 
extracted, collated and charted, and will be summarised 
quantitatively through descriptive numerical analysis and 
qualitatively through a narrative synthesis.
Ethics and dissemination  The proposed scoping review 
of published research will not require ethical approval. 
Results will be disseminated through publication in a peer- 
reviewed journal.

STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS OF THIS STUDY
 ⇒ To  our  knowledge,  there  is  no  systematic  scoping 
review that has explored disabled individuals’ per-
ceptions  and  experiences  of  counselling  and  psy-
chotherapy, including issues of accessibility.

 ⇒ The proposed review will ensure transparency and 
rigour  by  following  Arksey  and  O’Malley’s  meth-
odological  framework  for  scoping  reviews  and  the 
Preferred  Reporting  Items  for  Systematic  Reviews 
and  Meta- Analysis  Extension  for  Scoping  Reviews 
(PRISMA- ScR) guidelines for synthesising evidence 
and assessing the scope of literature on a subject.
 ⇒ The proposed review will be coproduced with a dis-
abled researcher and academic, as well as involve 
consultation with four disabled people, all of whom 
have  lived  or  personal  experience  of  participating 
in  and  delivering  counselling,  psychotherapy  or 
mental  health  services  and/or  of  living  with/caring 
for someone else using similar services. These col-
laborators  were  involved  in  shaping  the  design  of 
this current protocol and their perspectives will be 
central  to  ensuring  that  the  findings  and  potential 
recommendations  emerging  from  the  full  scoping 
review resonate and reflect the lived experience of 
disabled people.

 ⇒ Non- English  electronic  databases  will  not  be 
searched. This limitation may lead to language bias.
 ⇒ The  review  will  not  assess  the  quality  of  existing 
research  on  this  topic  as  scoping  reviews  do  not 
typically involve methodological appraisal of the in-
cluded studies.

considered to be disabled if they ‘have a phys-
ical or mental impairment that has a ‘substan-
tial’ and ‘long- term’ negative effect on (their) 
ability  to  do  normal  daily  activities.1  The 
Equality  Act  goes  on  to  define  ‘substantial’ 
as  ‘more  than  minor  or  trivial,  for  example, 
it  takes  much  longer  than  it  usually  would 
to complete a daily task like getting dressed’ 
and  ‘long  term’  as  ‘12  months  or  more,  for 
example, a breathing condition that develops 
as  a  result  of  a  lung  infection.1  Given  that 
the  focus  of  this  paper  is  disability  and

counselling/psychotherapy,  we  have  opted  for  a  defini-
tion proposed by the British Association for Counselling 
and Psychotherapy (BACP) and we understand disability 
as encompassing:

Individuals  who  have  an  impairment  or  identify  as 
disabled, whether due to a physical or mental impair-
ment.  Some  neurodivergent  people  (with  or  with-
out  an  impairment)  may  also  consider  themselves 
disabled. Impairments may be visible, invisible, con-
genital  (born  with)  or  acquired;  someone  may  be 
simultaneously  visibly  and  invisibly  disabled.  Many 
people  who  are  classed  by  others  as  disabled  may 
not  consider  themselves  so.  The  words  impairment 
and  disability  are  used  interchangeably  in  everyday 
language  with  people  preferring  one  word  over  the 
other, or neither.2

This  definition  covers  progressive  disabilities,  those 
conditions  which  get  worse  over  time  such  as  motor 
neuron  disease,  muscular  dystrophy  and  forms  of 
dementia.

Approximately 1 billion people in the world are consid-
ered  to  have  a  disability  or  impairment,  and  we  are  all 
likely  to  experience  some  form  of  disability  during  our 
lifetimes  whether  on  a  temporary  or  permanent  basis.3 
Disability often attracts negative attitudes based on preju-
dice or stereotype, and these attitudes are shaped from an 
early age.4 As Watermeyer reflects:5, p5

We all have feelings about disability, which tend to be 
strong, diverse and at least partially hidden. Cultural 
and  political  forces  leave  us  extremely  uneasy  with 
most of these feelings […] as humans, difference is 
something we find hard.

Despite  disability  being  commonplace  and  part  of 
human diversity, it is a highly contested concept. Disability 
is difficult to define,3 6 and there are competing models 
for  conceptualising  and  thinking  about  it.  Historically, 
the three most common models have been the medical, 
charity  and  moral  models.2  The  medical  perspective 
posits that disability is an individual’s problem, pathology 
or deficit, which requires medical care, treatment, reha-
bilitation  or  fixing  in  some  way.7  8  Under  this  model, 
disability  is  perceived  as  a  limiter  and  as  reducing  disa-
bled people’s capacities to engage in normal daily activ-
ities, including tasks relative to daily living (eg, bathing, 
dressing),  communication  (eg,  seeing  words,  hearing 
conversations) and mobility (eg, walking, climbing stairs, 
lifting/carrying).9  This  model  works  on  the  assumption 
that  disabled  people  are  less  able  and  less  capable  than 
non- disabled  people  and  require  extra  support.  The 
charity  model  positions  disabled  individuals  as  passive 
victims who are dependent on the community, and society 
more generally, to provide services, care and support for 
them.10 The moral model views disabled people as being 
responsible in some way for their own disability because 
of  past  sins  or  deeds.  All  three  models  are  increasingly 
criticised, particularly for minimising environmental and 

2

social  considerations,  and  for  disempowering  disabled 
people.  More  recently,  a  social  model  of  disability  has 
emerged,  which  situates  disability  not  in  the  individual, 
but  in  a  society  which  is  designed  with  non- disabled 
people in mind. All previous models were imposed onto 
disabled people, whereas the social model was developed 
by  disabled  people  and  marked  a  turning  point  in  disa-
bled people becoming political and gaining more agency. 
The social model of disability emerged in 1976 with the 
publication of The Fundamental Principles of Disability 
by the Union of the Physically Impaired Against Segrega-
tion.11 As Halacre outlines2, p8 the social model:

…  focuses  on  the  disadvantages  or  barriers  experi-
enced  in  the  physical  and  social  environment.  How 
society  is  structured,  services  organised  and  deliv-
ered; institutions, language, culture and attitudes all 
have influence.7 Disability is a barrier preventing full 
societal participation and is experienced in addition 
to, not because of, impairment. Many disabled peo-
ple state it is society, not their impairment, that dis-
ables them.12

The social model has opened up a space for some bold 
and  innovative  thinking,  exemplified  by  Carol  Thomas 
who coined the term ‘disablism’, as a replacement for the 
term ‘disability’, to foreground and emphasise the oppres-
sion and barriers faced by people with impairments:

Disablism is a form of social oppression involving 
the  social  imposition  of  restrictions  of  activity  on 
people  with  impairments  and  the  socially  engen-
dered  undermining  of  their  psycho- emotional 
well- being.13, p73

Although  the  social  model  is  a  more  empowering 
framework  for  disabled  people,  it  has  received  criticism 
for  downplaying  the  personal  and  psychological  impact 
of  disability  and  for  its  emphasis  on  individual  empow-
erment,  which  is  a  Eurocentric,  Western  concept  and 
which  may  not  be  compatible  with  the  collective  norms 
of  many  low- income  and  middle- income  countries.10  14 
The  limitations  inherent  in  the  social  model  has  led  to 
the  development  of  a  more  holistic  perspective  called 
the  expanded  social  model.  This  perspective  provides  a 
more balanced position where disability is neither purely 
medical  nor  purely  social.  Instead,  disability  is  under-
stood as being shaped and influenced by multiple factors 
(ie, physical, psychological, emotional) and as interacting 
with wider structural and environmental barriers (eg, atti-
tudinal, social, political, institutional).15 All these factors 
combined  can  potentially  inhibit  disabled  people  from 
fully  and  equally  participating  in  society,  and,  in  some 
cases, adversely affect their well- being and psychological 
health.

Although therapists are increasingly using an expanded 
social  model  when  working  with  disabled  clients  and 
moving  away  from  medicalised  models,2  the  evidence 
cannot  be  ignored  that  points  to  disabled  people  expe-
riencing  greater  mental  and  physical  health  challenges 

Longhurst P, Full W. BMJ Open 2023;13:e069204. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2022-069204than the rest of the population, across all age groups.16 17 
Specifically, disabled people have been found to present 
the  poorest  rating  for  well- being  and  quality  of  life 
across  the  wider  population,  leading  to  greater  rates  of 
anxiety and depression.18 19 This disparity is attributable 
to several factors, including psychosocial and biophysical 
factors,  as  well  as  limited  social  networks  and  structural 
discrimination.20–22 This situation is further compounded 
by  disabled  individuals  reporting  unmet  mental  health 
needs.2  While  some  research  has  examined  the  use  of 
psychological therapies among disabled people, findings 
appear to be limited to certain disabled groups, particu-
larly those with physical and intellectual disabilities.23–27

Compared with other protected characteristics, there is 
a comparative dearth in the literature and research when 
it comes to disability/disabled populations and counsel-
ling/psychotherapy.  More  generally,  the  historical  focus 
on  medicalised  models  within  counselling  and  health-
care  has  meant  that  disabled  people  have  often  been 
viewed  through  an  ableist  lens,28  29  which,  in  turn,  has 
influenced how services for the disabled population are 
organised and delivered.7 8 It is not surprising, therefore, 
that  disabled  people  are  reported  to  experience  inade-
quate  access  to  support,  aggravated  by  systemic  barriers 
such  as  inappropriate  delivery  of  services,  poor  referral 
processes,  lack  of  specialist  knowledge  and  inadequate 
social support.27 Research exploring issues of accessibility 
for  disabled  individuals  has  also  mostly  been  limited  to 
a  focus  on  primary  care  services.30  31  Smith32  has  shone 
a  particular  spotlight  on  the  lack  of  research  on  the 
mental health experiences of disabled women accessing 
therapy or mental health support, resulting in an inade-
quate knowledge base and support system for this client 
group.32

Some research has identified factors which potentially 
facilitate disabled individuals’ access to and use of thera-
peutic services, including specialist knowledge and prac-
titioner  confidence  in  working  with  this  population.33 
Artman and Daniels emphasise the importance of under-
standing  the  conceptual  models  of  disability  (covered 
above)  as  well  as  developing  cultural  competence  when 
working with this client group.34 Cultural competency for 
therapists could, for example, include developing a deeper 
understanding both of the complexity of lived experience 
of disability35 and of the high prevalence of ‘internalised 
oppression/ableism’  among  disabled  people  who  often 
take on and identify with some of the negative messages 
an ableist society projects onto disabled people.36 Halacre 
describes  several  key  issues  that  therapists  should  be 
familiar  with  and  comfortable  exploring  when  treating 
disabled  clients,  including  but  not  limited  to:  (1)  inter-
sectional  understanding  and  recognising  that  disabled 
people may belong to other marginalised groups such as 
the LGBTQIA+ and/or racially minoritised communities; 
(2) acknowledging and working with isolation in the lives 
of  disabled  people  (eg,  not  able  to  leave  home  due  to 
mobility or psychological isolation from inability to share 
inner thoughts with others); (3) navigating some disabled

people’s reliance on third parties/dual relationships (eg, 
family members, carers, advocate for needs) and how this 
might  impact  on  the  delivery  of  therapy  if  third  parties 
may  have  to  be  present  in  sessions;  and  (4)  discussing 
issues  linked  to  bodies,  sex,  intimacy  and  relationships, 
issues  often  ignored  or  minimised  when  it  comes  to 
treating disabled clients.2 Olkin has proposed a nine- point 
disability- affirmative therapy model, covering many of the 
above  issues  as  well  as  disabled  people’s  experiences  of 
micro aggressions, how disability affects a disabled client’s 
interactions with others (including family members) and 
a disabled client’s engagement (or lack of engagement) 
with wider disability culture and communities.37

Counsellors  and  psychotherapists  are,  however, 
becoming  aware  of  potential  practice  adaptations  and 
training  needs  when  working  with  disabled  individ-
uals.2 38 The British Psychological Society (BPS) has made 
recommendations  on  how  to  adapt  therapeutic  prac-
tice  for  disabled  clients  (eg,  the  use  of  simple  language 
and  visual  material,  where  relevant).39  Issues  around 
access  for  disabled  people  are  gaining  more  attention 
including  wheelchair  access,  but  also  wider  recognition 
that missed sessions or cancellations for disabled clients 
could be linked to illness, fatigue and reliance on carers/
public  transport.40  More  considered  attention  must  be 
paid to ethical issues when working with disabled people, 
including  clinical  competence,  guardianship/third 
parties,  and  appropriate  assessment  practices.41  Davies 
highlights  ethical  issues  particularly  in  relation  to  those 
clients with learning difficulties, such as power dynamics 
in  the  therapy  relationship,  capacity  to  give  informed 
consent  and,  if  relevant,  exploring  the  effects  of  past 
abuse/trauma.42

Study aims and rationale
The main aim of the proposed scoping review is to system-
atically  explore  how  disabled  individuals  perceive  and 
experience counselling and psychotherapy, and to iden-
tify what barriers and facilitators they face when accessing 
therapeutic support. We define ‘barriers’ as any factor that 
has been shown to prevent or discourage disabled individ-
uals from accessing interventions for their mental health 
challenges  (eg,  lack  of  resources,  stigma,  communica-
tion barriers, internalised prejudice, attitudinal barriers, 
institutional barriers, limited knowledge/training among 
therapists).43  ‘Facilitators’  refers  to  factors  which  are 
shown to support or promote positive outcomes and/or 
improve mental health (eg, specialist practitioner knowl-
edge  and/or  experience  of  disability,  using  respectful 
language,  supporting  autonomous  client  choice).2  We 
opted for a scoping review as it is a methodology which 
suits  broad  and  exploratory  research  questions.44  The 
review will aim to provide an evidence base on the issues 
facing  disabled  individuals  accessing  counselling  and 
psychotherapy  and  will  aim  to  highlight  some  practice 
implications  for  clinicians  and  make  recommendations 
on  how  therapeutic  practice  can  be  adapted  to  meet 
the  needs  of  this  diverse  but  marginalised  population,

and how therapists can ensure they do not discriminate 
against disabled clients wanting to access their services.

METHODS AND ANALYSIS
The  proposed  review  will  be  guided  by  the  method-
ological  framework  proposed  by  Arksey  and  O’Malley,45 
which  consists  of  six  steps:  (1)  identifying  the  research 
question,  (2)  identifying  relevant  studies,  (3)  selection 
of  eligible  studies,  (4)  charting  the  data,  (5)  collating 
and  summarising  the  results  and  (6)  consultation  and 
the inclusion of disabled people with lived experience. It 
should be noted that stage 6 will not be a discrete stage 
but will overlap with and inform stages 1–5.

Stage 1: identifying the research question
For  this  systematic  scoping  review,  the  overarching 
research  question  is:  what  barriers  and  enablers  do 
disabled individuals perceive and experience when trying 
to access counselling and psychotherapy as well as during 
the therapeutic work itself? The review will aim to iden-
tify  existing  evidence  on  the  barriers  and  facilitators  to 
accessing  counselling  and  psychotherapy  for  disabled 
people, and on what adaptations to therapeutic practice 
are needed to better support the mental health needs of 
disabled clients.

Stage 2: identifying relevant studies
Identification  of  studies  relevant  to  this  review  will 
be  achieved  by  searching  electronic  databases  of  the 
published  literature,  which  will  include:  PsycINFO, 
CINAHL, EMBASE, EBSCO and Cochrane Library. Title, 
abstract and keyword fields will be searched using a combi-
nation of the following MeSH terms (audit* OR physic* 
OR cognit* OR intellect* OR visual OR neurodiver* OR 
pain OR autis*) AND (disab* OR impair* OR illness OR 
life  limiting  OR  chronic)  AND  (therap*  OR  counsel* 
OR psychotherapy* OR psychological therap* OR treat-
ment*  OR  evidence- based  treatment*)  AND  (barrier* 
OR experienc* OR facilitat* OR percep* OR access*OR 
discriminat* OR distress). The reference lists of included 
studies  will  also  be  reviewed  to  identify  additional  rele-
vant studies. Additional searches may be incorporated as 
the  review  progresses  and  any  additions  or  changes  will 
be documented. Some preliminary searches have already 
been conducted. The search strategy and the full search 
string we will use to search each database (with keywords 
and operators) can be found in online supplemental file 
1.

Stage 3: study selection
Inclusion criteria
The selection process will follow the Preferred Reporting 
Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta- Analyses Extension 
for  Scoping  Reviews  (PRISMA- ScR)  guidelines  and  will 
be mapped using the PRISMA flow chart.46 Articles with 
extractable  research  data  will  be  eligible  for  inclusion. 
All  study  designs—quantitative,  qualitative  and  mixed 

4

method—will be considered. The review will only include 
papers written and/or published in the English language 
and published between 1 January 2010 and 31 December 
2022. All papers must refer to counselling, psychotherapy 
or  any  other  form  of  therapeutic  intervention,  include 
disabled  individuals  and/or  individuals  with  an  impair-
ment, report disabled individuals’ perceptions and expe-
riences of therapy, and/or report on factors that enable 
or  inhibit  therapy  among  disabled  individuals.  Where 
they  exist,  papers  exploring  practitioners’  perceptions 
and experiences of working with the disabled population 
might also be useful. Grey literature, book reviews and/or 
commentaries and book publications will be excluded as 
a means of keeping the scope of the search manageable.

Screening
The results of the literature searches will be exported and 
managed  in  Zotero,  a  reference  management  software. 
Duplicate references will be removed. All identified cita-
tions will be assessed by two reviewers using a predefined 
relevance  criteria  form  (see  Inclusion  Criteria).  The 
review process will consist of two levels of screening: (1) 
a title and abstract review and (2) full- text review. For the 
first level of screening, two researchers will screen article 
titles  and  abstracts  and  exclude  those  that  do  not  meet 
the eligibility criteria. For those which fulfil the eligibility 
criteria, the full article will be retrieved. A third member 
of  the  team  will  screen  retrieved  articles  to  ensure  a 
consistent application of the eligibility criteria for inclu-
sion in the review. Titles and abstracts of the articles for 
which  the  two  reviewers  could  not  determine  eligibility 
for inclusion will also be reviewed. Disagreements about 
study  eligibility  of  the  article  will  be  discussed  between 
the three reviewers until consensus is reached or by arbi-
tration of a fourth reviewer. The authors will consolidate 
the  results  of  the  searches  and  will  upload  all  eligible 
articles to Zotero. The process of study selection and the 
number of studies at each stage of the selection process 
will be reported using the PRISMA flow chart.

Stage 4: charting the data
For each of the included papers, study characteristics will 
be extracted and recorded in a summary table. For empir-
ical  research,  this  will  include:  (1)  study  characteristics, 
including  year  of  study,  study  design,  methodology  and 
measures; (2) participant characteristics, including popu-
lation  type  (ie,  disability/impairment  type)  and  other 
personal  demographics  (eg,  gender,  age);  (3)  therapy 
characteristics, such as therapeutic approach (eg, human-
istic,  psychodynamic),  session  duration  etc;  (4)  findings 
relating to factors which act as barriers or facilitate access 
to  therapy  and  (5)  identified  gaps  in  the  literature.  We 
will  also  extract  relevant  implications  for  practice,  key 
issues and recommendations.

Stage 5: data summary and synthesis of results
The  PRISMA- ScR  checklist  for  scoping  reviews  will  be 
used to guide the collating, summarising and reporting of 

Longhurst P, Full W. BMJ Open 2023;13:e069204. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2022-069204results. A descriptive numerical summary of the scoping 
review  will  be  presented  in  the  PRISMA  flow  diagram, 
including the number of papers screened, included and 
excluded at each stage. Data will be summarised quanti-
tatively through descriptive numerical analysis and qual-
itatively through a narrative synthesis. As the aim of this 
review is to provide an overview of the main sources and 
types  of  evidence  available  and  to  identify  key  concepts 
and issues relevant to the research questions, we will not 
be  conducting  an  assessment  on  the  methodological 
quality of the included empirical studies.

Stage 6: consultation
We  will  coproduce  this  scoping  review  with  a  disabled 
counsellor  and  researcher  whose  current  research 
involves  exploring  clients’  experience  of  working  with 
disabled counsellors in chronic pain and seeks to inves-
tigate  the  impact  disability  has  on  both  the  therapeutic 
relationship  and  the  counselling  process.  We  will  also 
continue  to  consult  with  the  four  disabled  therapists/
clients we consulted to develop this protocol (see below 
under the sections Patient and public involvement). We 
will ask them to comment on our processes in stages 1–5 to 
ensure that these are robust, and we will seek their advice 
and guidance on the eligibility of the final papers we will 
include  in  the  scoping  review.  We  will  also  ask  them  to 
review initial drafts for the scoping review paper, and in 
particular, gather their views on the findings and poten-
tial  recommendations  emerging  from  the  full  scoping 
review  and  whether  these  resonate  and  reflect  the  lived 
experience  of  disabled  people.  We  will  also  reach  out 
to  several  disability  organisations  such  as:  Scope,  the 
disability equality charity in England and Wales; Disability 
Rights  UK,  which  challenges  policy- makers,  institu-
tions  and  individuals  to  remove  the  barriers  that  exist 
for  disabled  people;  and  other  specialist  third  sector/
community organisations such as the Royal National Insti-
tute  for  Deaf  People  or  the  Royal  National  Institute  for 
Blind  People.  We  hope  through  this  wider  consultation 
to access and consult with a broader, more representative 
range of people with disabilities.

Reflexivity statement
One  of  the  authors  (PL)  involved  in  developing  and 
writing this protocol identifies as a neurodivergent women 
diagnosed  with  autism  spectrum  condition.  She  received 
her  diagnosis  initially  at  approximately  age  4  and  again 
at  age  19  under  the  Diagnostic  and  Statistical  Manual  of 
Mental  Disorders,  4th  Edition  (DSM- IV).  She  predom-
inantly  received  mainstream  schooling,  however,  with 
assistance  from  trained  professionals.  Phaedra  has  been 
receiving counselling/therapeutic/mental health support 
for  15  years,  both  privately  and  within  National  Health 
Service  services  (eg,  outpatient  community  services) 
across  varying  modalities/approaches  (eg,  integrative, 
cognitive  behavioural).  She  is  currently  a  PhD  student 
who  is  conducting  autism  research,  and  therefore,  has 
experience  conducting  research  among  marginalised,

and  advocate  for  disabled  people  and  has  cared  for  an 
older sibling with autistic spectrum condition and learning 
difficulties. Wayne’s involvement in this project forms part 
of  his  role  as  lead  researcher  on  Equality,  diversity  and 
Inclusion at the BACP. As an openly gay man, he has expe-
rienced barriers in accessing LGBTQIA+ sensitive therapy 
and supports reducing barriers to accessing culturally sensi-
tive therapy for other marginalised and minority groups.

Patient and public involvement
In the development of this protocol, we collaborated with 
four disabled people, all of whom have lived or personal 
experience of participating in and delivering counselling, 
psychotherapy or mental health services and/or of living 
with/caring for someone else using similar services. These 
collaborators  reviewed  an  initial  draft  of  the  protocol 
and  provided  feedback  on  the  following  questions:  (1) 
Is the rationale behind wanting to do this scoping work 
clear  and  robust?  (2)  Have  we  cited  the  most  relevant 
and  appropriate  literature/evidence  in  the  introduc-
tion? (3) What are we missing in terms of our proposed 
search terms for the scoping review? (4) Can the research 
question(s)  be  tightened  up/refined?  (5)  Is  the  use  of 
language  and  terminology  appropriate  throughout  the 
protocol?  and  (6)  Is  there  anything  else  important  you 
would like to comment on? All feedback has been incor-
porated into this protocol paper.

Although  we  have  tried  to  encourage  a  participatory 
approach  to  the  design  and  development  of  this  protocol, 
we recognise that the disabled community is as diverse and 
heterogeneous as wider society, and that it is impossible for 
us  to  fully  capture  the  breadth  of  experience  and  opinion 
within  this  client  group.  We  recognise  that  impairments 
differ  hugely  between  individuals  and  affect  the  lives  of 
disabled people in specific and unique ways. We hope that 
the inclusion and involvement of Scope, Disability Rights UK 
and other specialist disability organisations in the next stages 
will lead to more representative feedback and input from the 
disabled community on the full scoping review.

ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION
As  this  scoping  review  is  intended  to  synthesise  existing 
data, ethical approval is not required. The results of this 
scoping review will be disseminated through publication 
in a peer- reviewed journal.
