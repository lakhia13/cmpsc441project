Abstract

Childhood trauma (CT) is associated with suicidal ideation and behaviors (SI/SB) in people with 
psychosis. The Interpersonal Psychological Theory of Suicide (IPTS) suggests that there are 
four factors that increase suicide risk: thwarted belonginess, perceived burdensomeness, acquired 
capacity for suicide, and hopelessness. The IPTS constructs and social cognitive biases are 
associated with SI/SB in psychotic disorders. However; the role of CT in IPTS constructs and 
social cognitive biases has not been examined in psychosis. In an outpatient community sample of 
persons with psychotic disorders (N=96) assessed with the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire, the 
aims of this study were to (1) evaluate rates of CT in this sample, (2) determine the relationship 
between CT types and lifetime SI/SB, and (3) explore the relationship between CT types, IPTS 
constructs, and social cognitive biases. All participants reported experiencing CT. Emotional abuse 
was associated with greater SI severity and higher rates of lifetime suicide attempts (SAs), as 
well as with greater perceived burdensomeness and more severe negative social cognitive biases. 
Other CT types were minimally associated with SI/SB or IPST constructs; hopelessness was not

Introduction

Suicide is common in people with schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders (Cassidy 
et al., 2018; Osby et al., 2000). Additionally, an estimated 43–79% of individuals with 
psychotic disorders experience suicidal ideation (SI) at least once in their lifetime (Cassidy 
et al., 2018; Duko & Ayano, 2018; Hawton et al., 2005; Skodlar et al., 2008). Much 
of the focus of suicide risk factor research in psychosis has been on the influence of 
psychotic symptoms (e.g., positive and negative symptoms) and cognition (Comparelli et 
al., 2018; Depp et al., 2016; Villa et al., 2018). However, the unique relationship between 
childhood trauma and risk for suicidal thoughts and behaviors in individuals diagnosed with 
a psychotic disorder has demonstrated importance (e.g., Cui et al., 2019; Roy, 2005).

Childhood trauma has been established as a risk factor for the development of and various 
impacts of psychosis (Baumeister et al., 2014; Carr et al., 2013; Lardinois et al., 2011; 
Mondelli et al., 2015; Read et al., 2005; Stanton et al., 2020; Varese et al., 2012); however, 
the literature is mixed on what types of trauma increase suicidal risk. Studies utilizing the 
Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ; Bernstein et al., 1997; Bernstein et al., 2003) – a 
standard in the field – show differential findings between the association of trauma subtypes 
(emotional abuse, emotional neglect, physical abuse, physical neglect, and sexual abuse) and 
increased risk for SI (Cui et al., 2019; Grattan et al., 2019; Xie et al., 2018), suicide attempts 
(SAs; Mohammadzadeh et al., 2019; Hassan et al., 2016; Roy, 2005; Tasmin et al., 2020), 
and the lethality of SAs (Alli et al., 2019). Turning to well-studied theories of suicide, such 
as the Interpersonal Psychological Theory of Suicide (IPTS), and well-studied constructs in 
suicide may help bridge the gap to explain the mixed literature on trauma type and their 
corresponding association with suicidal thoughts and behaviors in this population.

The IPTS is a commonly cited psychological theories which posits that perceived 
burdensomeness, thwarted belongingness, acquired capability for suicide, and hopelessness 
converge to foster a lethal SA (Van Orden et al., 2010; Chu et al., 2017). The IPTS 
posits that the desire for suicide stems from feeling like a burden to others (i.e., perceived 
burdensomeness) and not belonging (i.e., thwarted belongingness; Van Orden et al., 2010). 
The authors go on to highlight that since most individuals who have a desire to kill 
themselves do not attempt suicide, there must be a high fearlessness about death and 
the “acquired capability” for suicide to result in a person making a lethal SA. Moreover, 
hopelessness is an established risk factor for suicidal ideation and behavior and has 
subsequently been found to moderate the interaction between perceived burdensomeness 
and thwarted belongingness, providing further support of the importance of the combination 
of these constructs (Hagan, et al., 2015). However, this moderation has not been supported in

a sample of psychotic disorders (Schimanski et al., 2017) and more information is needed to 
understand all four constructs of the IPTS in psychosis.

Among persons with psychosis, the psychological risk factors of the IPTS have been 
studied in a limited fashion, though there is emerging research suggesting perceived 
burdensomeness, thwarted belongingness, and the acquired capability for suicide may 
be important to understanding suicide in psychosis. Among individuals in their first 
episode of psychosis, Heelis et al. (2016) reported perceived burdensomeness and thwarted 
belongingness related to psychotic experiences, while Wastler et al. (2020) found those 
constructs to have higher in those with recent SI. Further, Villa et al. (2018) found 
that perceived burdensomeness and thwarted belongingness were associated with SI and 
a history of SAs in a sample with schizophrenia. Acquired capability has been less 
studied; but, Silva et al. (2015) found positive associations among adult outpatients with 
schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders for acquired capability for suicide, in addition to 
perceived burdensomeness and thwarted belongingness. Thus, understanding these potential 
social cognitive constructs relationship to childhood trauma could help to uncover the 
mechanisms of suicide in psychosis.

Converging these literatures, it may be that childhood trauma increases negative 
interpersonal beliefs (Smith et al., 2018), but this is not clear in psychotic disorders. 
Additionally, although the IPTS has not received substantial study in psychosis, impairments 
in social cognition are well documented in psychosis (e.g., Mancuso et al., 2011) and a 
handful of recent studies have evaluated social cognitive biases and SI using ecological 
momentary assessment (EMA; Comparelli et al., 2018, Depp et al., 2018). In a prior 
study, we found that biased interpretations, specifically greater attribution of blame 
in ambiguous social situations, were associated with baseline SI, SI two weeks later, 
and that those individuals reporting SI across those time points had the most biased 
interpretations (Depp et al., 2018). There is evidence to suggest that the presence of 
childhood trauma may negatively impact emotion recognition, a measure of social cognition, 
in schizophrenia (Rokita et al., 2021), but the relationship to suicidal thoughts and behaviors 
and interpersonal risk factors for suicide is unknown.

In a sample of adults with psychotic disorders, this study aimed to (1) evaluate rates 
of childhood trauma, (2) determine the relationship between types of childhood trauma 
and lifetime suicidal ideation and behaviors, and (3) explore the relationship between 
childhood trauma types, the IPTS constructs factors (i.e., thwarted belongingness, perceived 
burdensomeness, acquired capability for suicide, and hopelessness), and social cognitive 
biases. There were two corresponding hypotheses: (1) Participants with childhood trauma 
experiences will be more likely to have a lifetime history of SI and SA as well as have 
more lifetime SAs, and (2) participants with childhood trauma experiences will report more 
severe thwarted belongingness and perceived burdensomeness, higher acquired capability 
for suicide and hopelessness, and more extreme social cognitive biases.

In an ongoing multi-site study evaluating the relationship between social cognition and 
suicide in serious mental illness across three university settings (Dallas n=37, Miami n=24, 
San Diego n=35) in the United States, data from the current study are derived from a 
subsample of participants (N=96) enrolled between July 2019 and March 2020 (for more 
information about the parent study, see Depp et al., 2021). The target sample size for the 
parent study is 300 and this subsample encompassed the first third of the full sample who 
completed their full in-person baseline evaluation and the first EMA period of the study.

The participants included in this subsample all had a DSM-5 diagnosis of Schizophrenia, 
Schizoaffective Disorder, Bipolar Disorder or Major Depressive Disorder and presented with 
lifetime or current psychotic symptoms, as defined by the Structured Clinical Interview 
for the DSM-5 (First et al., 2015; Table 1). Inclusion criteria required all participants be 
proficient in English, between the ages of 18 and 65, and not currently part of an inpatient 
program. Participants were in treatment in outpatient, partial hospitalization, or residential 
care. Participants could not have any hospitalizations or dose changes within the last 6 
weeks. Additionally, individuals with history of head trauma with loss of consciousness 
of >15 minutes, a diagnosis of a neurological or neurodegenerative disorder, or a current 
substance use disorder were excluded.

The Childhood trauma questionnaire (CTQ).—The CTQ is a 28-item self-report 
questionnaire that retrospectively assesses childhood trauma experiences among adolescents 
and adults. The CTQ includes five subscales of maltreatment: emotional abuse, emotional 
neglect, physical abuse, physical neglect, and sexual abuse (Bernstein et al., 1997; Bernstein 
et al., 2003). Each subscale includes recommended threshold cutoff scores, the first being 
“none or minimal” childhood trauma experiences (Bernstein & Fink, 1998); this threshold 
was used to dichotomize each subscale based on data distribution (see Statistical Analysis 
section). Three additional items assess participants’ tendencies to minimize or deny abuse 
tendencies; scores range from 3 to 15 with higher scores reflecting greater minimization or 
denial. The CTQ total score (a sum of all items) was not utilized based on the literature and 
aims of this study.

Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS).—The C-SSRS is an 
interviewer-administered suicidality severity instrument that assesses lifetime SI as well 
as current (i.e., last month) SI (Posner et al., 2011). SI severity is based on the highest rated 
category of SI (i.e., wish to be dead, passive SI, active SI with a method but without plan and 
intent, active SI with some intent to act but no specific plan, and active SI with specific plan 
and intent). The C-SSRS also assesses lifetime and recent suicide behavior patterns (Note. 
SAs are collected as aborted, interrupted, and actual attempts). “Actual” SAs were used to 
determine the presence of at least one lifetime SA and the total count of SAs in the present 
study. A lethality score is used to assess actual attempts’ level of medical damage on 6-point

ordinal scale, ranging from 0 (“no physical damage”) to 5 (“death”); lethality scores in the 
current sample ranged from 0 to 4 (“severe physical damage”). As available, medical chart 
data were used to confirm SI/SA recall.

Interpersonal Needs Questionnaire (INQ-15).—The INQ is a 15‐item self‐report 
measure assessing interpersonal beliefs (i.e., thwarted belongingness and perceived 
burdensomeness) underlying the desire for suicide as part of the IPTS (Van Orden et al., 
2012). The Thwarted Belongingness Subscale consists of nine items measuring participants’ 
sense of not belonging and the Perceived Burdensomeness Subscale consists of six items 
measuring participants’ view of themselves as burden to others. Higher scores indicate 
greater thwarted belongingness or perceived burdensomeness.

The Acquired Capability for Suicide Scale (ACSS).—The ACSS is a 7-item measure 
of self-reported acquired capability for suicide and fearlessness of death as part of the IPTS 
(Ribeiro et al., 2014; Van Orden et al., 2008). Total scores range from 0 to 28, with higher 
scores indicating greater levels of fearlessness about death and greater capability for suicide.

Beck Hopelessness Scale (BHS).—The BHS is a 20-item self-report measure that 
assesses three aspects of hopelessness: feelings about the future, loss of motivation, and 
future expectations (Beck et al., 1974). The possible range of scores is from 0 to 20 and 
higher scores indicate higher levels of hopelessness.

Ambiguous Intentions and Hostility Questionnaire (AIHQ).—The AIHQ was 
utilized to measure attribution style and hostile social cognitive biases by measuring blame, 
hostility, and aggression (Combs et al., 2007). Participants were asked to read and imagine 
five short vignettes as if they were happening to them and respond using a Likert scale on 
various items to indicate social attributions (e.g., blame, hostility, aggression). To calculate 
the Blame subscale, participants were asked how much they would blame the other person(s) 
in the vignettes and a sum of three Likert scale rated items are averaged over the five 
vignettes (range 3–16). For the current study, only the Blame Subscale was utilized due to 
previous literature demonstrating association between the Blame Subscale and SI (Depp et 
al., 2018).

Symptom Severity Covariate Measures.—The Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale 
(PANSS) is a brief interview that was used to assess psychosis related experiences. The 
PANSS is the gold standard for assessing schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders’ 
symptom severity (Kay et al., 1987). For the current study, the PANSS Positive Symptom 
Severity subscale and Negative Symptoms Severity subscale were utilized as covariates to 
account for current positive and negative psychotic experiences. The Montgomery-Åsberg 
Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score utilized to determine the severity of current 
depression. The MADRS is a ten-item self-report questionnaire (Montgomery & Åsberg, 
1979) and has been found to be equivalent to other commonly used self-report depression 
questionnaires (e.g., the Beck Depression Inventory (Svanborg & Åsberg, 2001)).

Statistical Analysis

Page 6

In these cross-sectional analyses, there were no missing data. We first calculated the 
frequencies of meeting criteria for the various CTQ subscales. CTQ subscales have 
previously been examined as continuous scales. However, given the nonnormal distribution 
of three CTQ subscales (physical abuse, physical neglect, sexual abuse), these scales 
were dichotomized based on the scoring cut off criteria of “none to minimal” and “low 
to extreme.” The remaining CTQ subscales (emotional abuse, emotional neglect) were 
explored as dichotomous predictors for continuity. We then evaluated the relationship of 
each CTQ subscale and any lifetime SI and any lifetime SA with separate logistic regression 
analyses, while SI Severity and SA Lethality utilized separate linear regression analyses. 
Each CTQ subscale was further used as a unique predictor in separate negative binomial 
count regressions for the SA count outcome. We then contrasted psychological suicide 
risk factors and social cognitive biases across each of CTQ subscales also using separate 
linear regression analyses. If demographic (i.e., gender, ethnicity, race, age) and clinical 
(i.e., primary diagnosis, symptom severity) variables were significantly associated with a 
given outcome, they were included as covariates in the relevant model in a stepwise fashion. 
Unless otherwise noted, these variables were did not significantly predict outcome variables. 
P value was set at .05 for all analyses.

Results

Descriptive Statistics of Childhood Trauma

All (100.0%, N=96) participants reported experiencing some degree of childhood trauma. 
The rate of each subscale above a “none to minimal” level is as follows: 68.7% (n=66) 
reported emotional abuse, 66.7% (n=64) reported emotional neglect, 63.5% (n=61) reported 
physical abuse, 66.7% (n=64) reported physical neglect, and 62.5% (n=60) reported 
sexual abuse. On average, emotional abuse (M=12.8, SD=5.8), emotional neglect (M=12.8, 
SD=5.4), and physical neglect (M=9.7, SD=4.1) were endorsed at a low to moderate rate. 
Physical abuse (M=11.0, SD=6.0) and sexual abuse (M=11.4, SD=7.2) were endorsed as 
moderate to severe. The Minimization/Denial Subscale had a range of 12 (M=7.5, SD=3.2).

Childhood Trauma and Lifetime Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors

Childhood trauma experiences and the presence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors are 
reported in Table 2. A total of 84% of participants endorsed SI in their lifetime (Table 1). 
No childhood trauma scale significantly predicted the presence of lifetime SI; although, 
there was a trend for participants reporting emotional abuse (Table 2). There was a 
significant effect of the Emotional Abuse Subscale on greater SI Severity (t=2.02, p=.046), 
F(1,94)=4.08, p=.046, R2=.04), and no other childhood trauma scale significantly predicted 
SI Severity (Table 2).

In terms of suicidal behavior, 64.6% of participants endorsed at least one SA in their 
lifetime (Table 1). Participants reporting emotional abuse were more likely to have reported 
a lifetime SA (RR=0.40, 95% CI=0.17, 0.99, p=.047), but no other childhood trauma scale 
significantly predicted the occurrence of a lifetime SA (Table 2). Participants reported an 
average of 3.4 (SD=5.5) SAs in their lifetime. A negative binomial regression revealed

women reported a statistically significant higher number of lifetime SAs (RR=0.57, 95% 
CI=0.36, 0.91, p=.019) as compared to men. Adjusting for gender, the Emotional Abuse 
Subscale significantly predicted the number of lifetime SAs (RR=2.65, 95% CI=1.45, 4.85, 
p=.001). No other childhood trauma scale significantly predicted the number of lifetime 
SAs (Table 2). There was also a significant effect of the Sexual Abuse Subscale (t=3.55, 
p=.001) on SA Lethality, F(1,60)=12.59, p=.001, R2=.16, and no other childhood trauma 
scale significantly predicted SA Lethality (Table 2).

Childhood Trauma, IPTS Constructs, and Social Cognitive Biases

For the IPTS risk factors, first, a simple linear regression revealed the Perceived 
Burdensomeness Subscale decreased by 0.19 points for each increased year of age 
(F(1,94)=4.45, p=.037, R2=.05). A separate linear regression also revealed the Perceived 
Burdensomeness Subscale increased by 0.03 points for each increase point on the MADRS 
total score (F(1,93)=12.80, p=.001, R2=.12). There was a significant effect of the Emotional 
Abuse Subscale on Perceived Burdensomeness after adjusting for age and MADRS score, 
F(3,91)=7.62, p<.001, R2=.20, with emotional abuse (t=2.07, p=.041), age (t=−2.31, 
p=.023), and MADRS score (t=3.03, p=.003) being significant. Next, separate simple linear 
regressions revealed the Thwarted Belongingness Subscale increased by 0.88 points and 
increased by 0.40 points for each increased point on the PANSS Negative Symptom Scale 
(F(1,94)=8.31, p=.005, R2=.08) and on the MADRS total score (F(1,93)=16.21, p<.001, 
R2=.15), respectively. There was a significant effect of the Emotional Neglect Subscale 
on Thwarted Belongingness after adjusting for the PANSS Negative Symptom Scale 
and the MADRS score, F(3,91)=12.66, p>.001, R2=.29, with emotional neglect (t=3.04, 
p=.003), the PANSS Negative Symptom Scale (t=2.95, p=.004), and MADRS score (t=4.10, 
p<.001) being significant. Then, there was also a significant effect of the Physical Neglect 
Subscale (t=2.05, p=.043) on the ACSS Score, F(1,94)=4.21, p=.043, R2=.03. No other 
childhood trauma scale significantly predicted the Perceived Burdensomeness, Thwarted 
Belongingness, or ACSS scores (Table 3). Finally, while separate simple linear regressions 
revealed the Hopelessness Score to increase by 0.14 points and 0.04 points for each 
increased score on the PANSS Negative Symptom Score (F(1,94)=5.35, p=.023, R2=.05) and 
the MADRS total score (F(1,93)=4.50, p=.037, R2=.05), respectively, no childhood trauma 
scale predicted the Hopelessness Score (Table 3).

As for social cognitive biases, there was a significant effect of the Emotional Abuse 
Subscale, F(1,94)=7.56, p=.007, R2=.07 (t=2.75, p=.007) and the Physical Abuse Subscale, 
F(1,94)=5.71, p=.019, R2=.06 (t=2.39, p=.019) on the Blame Subscale of the AIHQ. No 
other childhood trauma scale significantly predicted the Blame Subscale (Table 3).

Discussion

The current study aimed to understand the association between various forms of childhood 
trauma on suicidal thoughts and behaviors as well as suicide risk factors and social 
cognitive biases in people with psychotic disorders. With the entire sample reporting at 
least some degree of childhood trauma and around two-thirds of the sample endorsing each 
trauma type, these results underscore the high frequency of childhood trauma in psychosis.

Consistent with prior studies, childhood trauma is a risk factor for suicidality (Baumeister 
et al., 2014; Carr et al., 2013; Lardinois et al., 2011; Mondelli et al., 2015; Read et al., 
2005; Stanton et al., 2020; Varese et al., 2012) and that risk applies in people with psychosis. 
Within types of previous trauma, emotional abuse and neglect were associated with higher 
rates of SI severity and suicidal behavior. Novel findings in this study were that associations 
between emotional trauma were associated with interpersonal constructs of greater perceived 
burdensomeness and thwarted belongingness as well as higher blame scores on a test 
of negative social cognitive biases. In contrast, physical neglect was associated with the 
acquired capability for suicide and CTQ scores were not associated with hopelessness; 
the latter has previously been reported to mediate suicide risk in psychosis (Schimanski 
et al., 2017). While preliminary and not prospective, childhood traumatic events occurred 
earlier in life while perceived burdensomeness and thwarted belongingness were examined 
contemporaneously. Thus, prior experiences of trauma precede current experiences of 
perceived burdensomeness and thwarted belongingness.

Endorsement of emotional trauma, versus other forms of abuse, in the current sample 
was a prominent predictor for SI severity and SAs as well as perceived burdensomeness 
and thwarted belongingness. Additionally, the presence of childhood physical neglect was 
related to an increased acquired capability for suicide. As such, different forms of childhood 
trauma may exert unique influences on interpersonal constructs related to suicidal ideation 
and behaviors. Studies exploring childhood trauma and the IPTS in samples that did 
not include individuals with psychotic disorders found similar results for the relationship 
between emotional trauma and the interpersonal elements of the IPTS (Puzia et al., 2014; 
Schönfelder et al., 2019; Smith et al., 2018) as well as the relationship between physical 
trauma and acquired capability for suicide (Schönfelder et al., 2019; Smith et al., 2018). 
This comparison between psychotic and non-psychotic samples highlight the importance of 
emotional trauma and the possibility of emotional trauma existing as a mediator between 
IPTS constructs and suicidal thoughts and behaviors.

Moreover, emotional abuse has been consistently supported as a major factor in SI and 
depression as well as low self-esteem (e.g., Mullen et al., 1996) possibly creating multiple 
pathways for feeling disconnected as an adult. These findings are very consistent with 
studies of the prospective development of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) after a 
new trauma (Gould et al., 2021), in that childhood traumatic experiences predicted the 
severity of emotional reactions at the time of the new trauma which in turn predicted the 
development of PTSD. In that circumstance as well as the current study, childhood trauma 
could be viewed as a risk factor for subsequent reactions (e.g., more severe immediate 
trauma reaction; development of feelings of burdensomeness) which in turn increase risk of 
other adverse outcomes such as PTSD or SAs.

The negative finding relating to hopelessness is particularly notable given the IPTS focus on 
perceived burdensomeness and thwarted belongingness converging to create hopelessness, 
which then leads to the desire for suicide (Van Orden et al., 2010). But, a previous study 
examining the IPTS have questioned whether hopelessness is a moderator risk factor in 
psychosis (Schimanski et al., 2017). The distinction of types of trauma relating to the unique

parts of the IPTS warrant further exploration to help illuminate the link between childhood 
trauma and suicidality in persons experiencing psychosis.

Recent literature has suggested the connection of social cognitive biases and suicidal 
thoughts and behaviors in persons with psychosis (Depp et al., 2018; Villa et al., 2018). 
This is the first study to our knowledge to link childhood trauma with social cognitive 
biases in this fashion. Histories of childhood emotional and physical abuse were separately 
associated with increased blame of others in social settings. It is unclear if childhood trauma 
leads directly social cognitive biases, or if childhood trauma impacts social behavior (e.g., 
isolation; reduction of social supports), which may lead to maladaptive interpersonal beliefs. 
Research to date has also examined theory of mind, emotion recognition, and other social 
cognitive abilities in schizophrenia as a function of childhood trauma (e.g., Rokita et al., 
2020, Rokita et al., 2021; Vaskinn et al., 2020), and therefore understanding the role of 
suicide among these constructs is vital.

Given that childhood trauma is a significant suicide risk factor, clinical assessments of 
suicide risk in psychosis should likely include evaluation of childhood trauma as a modifier 
of risk as included in current practice guidelines (Sall et al., 2019). In particular, the ongoing 
finding that types of trauma impact different samples uniquely may be worth considering 
during clinical assessment and treatment. Further investigations may seek to explore whether 
interventions that reduce social cognitive biases (e.g., social cognition training) or social 
recovery services that may counteract biases, may be useful as components of suicide 
prevention in psychosis, as they have been shown to affect directed violence (Jones & 
Harvey, 2020). It is noteworthy to highlight that this sample was recruited as part of a larger 
study evaluating the relationship between social cognition and suicide in serious mental 
illness. Given the high rates of childhood trauma and suicidal thoughts and behaviors, 
particular attention is warranted in clinical settings for individuals with psychosis who are 
presenting with either childhood trauma or suicidality.

This study had a number of limitations. This is a small sample comparatively and people 
with suicidal ideation and behaviors were over-represented, therefore the rates of childhood 
trauma were and would be expected to be higher than that in the general population. 
Moreover, the possibility of recall bias of childhood trauma is possible due to psychiatric 
diagnosis and mood state; we did control for psychiatric diagnosis, depression state, and 
current positive and negative psychosis symptom severity among the IPTS constructs 
and social cognitive biases. Additionally, this study was not powered to examine site 
differences and there are likely public health, societal, stigma, and resource differences 
across participants based on their locations. This is a cross-sectional study and by no 
means addresses prospective risk for suicidal ideation or behavior other than by the fact 
that childhood abuse occurred earlier in time compared to the contemporaneous assessment 
of the IPTS and social cognitive biases. All participants were outpatients, and a modest 
sample size may have masked differences. Further, due to the modest sample size we did 
not control for multiple comparisons nor were we able to explore the inter-relationships of 
these variables, or possible mediators or moderators. These findings need to be replicated. 
In spite of these limitations, this study suggests a need for further investigation into how 
childhood emotional trauma, interpersonal suicide risk constructs, and social cognitive
