Background:  The  twin  earthquakes  that  struck  Kahramanmaraş,  Türkiye,  on 
February  6,  2023,  caused  widespread  devastation  and  loss  of  life.  Beyond 
the  physical  destruction,  such  large-scale  disasters  often  result  in  significant 
psychological  trauma.  This  study  systematically  reviewed  and  meta-analyzed 
the prevalence and severity of probable post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), 
depression, and anxiety among adult Turkish survivors during the first 18 months 
post-disaster.
Methods:  Following  PRISMA  2020  guidelines,  a  systematic  search  of  Web  of 
Science, PubMed, and Scopus was conducted for peer-reviewed studies published 
between February 6, 2023, and May 30, 2025. Eligible studies included quantitative 
assessments  of  PTSD,  depression,  or  anxiety  using  validated  Turkish-language 
scales, with general adult population samples (N ≥ 370). Eight studies (N = 5,965) 
met inclusion criteria. A random-effects meta-analysis was conducted for studies 
reporting  prevalence  of  probable  PTSD,  while  depression  and  anxiety  outcomes 
were synthesized descriptively due to limited and heterogeneous data. Risk factors 
for  psychological  morbidity  were  also  extracted  and  analyzed.  This  review  was 
registered with PROSPERO (CRD42025644127).
Results: The pooled prevalence of probable PTSD was 41% (95% CI: 32–52%). 
Reported PTSD rates ranged from 29 to 54%, and symptom severity remained high 
throughout the first year. Depression and anxiety were also widespread, with up 
to 40% screening positive for depression and 40–50% reporting moderate-to-
severe anxiety symptoms. Comorbidity between PTSD, depression, and anxiety 
was  common.  Significant  risk  factors  included  female  gender,  bereavement, 
home  destruction,  displacement,  job  loss,  and  low  social  support.  Resilience 
was protective in some studies, though findings were inconsistent.
Conclusion:  Eighteen  months  after  the  2023  Kahramanmaraş  earthquakes, 
Turkish adult survivors continued to experience high levels of probable PTSD, 
depression,  and  anxiety.  These  findings  highlight  a  prolonged  mental  health 
crisis  and  underscore  the  urgent  need  for  sustained,  targeted  psychosocial 
interventions. Integrating mental health support into disaster preparedness and 
long-term  recovery  efforts  is  essential  for  mitigating  psychiatric  morbidity  in 
future disasters.

KEYWORDS

Kahramanmaraş earthquakes, Türkiye, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), 
depression, anxiety, earthquake survivors, disaster mental health

1 Introduction

The twin earthquakes of February 6, 2023 in Kahramanmaraş, 
Türkiye – of magnitudes 7.7 and 7.6 – constituted one of the most 
devastating natural disasters in the country’s history, causing over 
50,000  deaths  and  massive  destruction  across  11  provinces  (1). 
Beyond the immense physical toll, such large-scale earthquakes are 
known to precipitate severe and long-term psychological effects in 
survivors (2). Prior research on major earthquakes worldwide has 
documented elevated rates of PTSD (3), depression, and anxiety in 
affected populations (4). For instance, a meta-analysis of 46 studies 
reported an average PTSD prevalence of ~23.7% among earthquake 
survivors, with higher combined incidence (~28.8%) when assessed 
within 9 months post-disaster (5). However, PTSD rates vary widely 
across  events  (ranging  from  ~1  to  >80%  in  individual  studies) 
depending on disaster severity and sample characteristics (6–8). Other 
disorders such as depression and generalized anxiety also commonly 
increase after earthquakes (9, 10) – e.g. one post-earthquake survey in 
Peru found 52% with anxiety and 52% with depression symptoms 
1 month after the event (11, 12).

Past Turkish earthquakes provide relevant context. Following the 
1999 Marmara earthquake, estimated PTSD prevalence in survivors 
was about 25–43% at 1 year and ~23% at 14 months (13, 14). These 
figures,  while  substantial,  may  be  eclipsed  by  the  psychological 
impact  of  the  2023  Kahramanmaraş  earthquakes  given  their 
unprecedented scale. Early reports predicted that the trauma from 
the 2023 quakes would be profound and potentially long-lasting (15, 
16). Indeed, preliminary studies shortly after the disaster indicated 
extremely high acute stress levels – one survey 50 days post-quake 
found that roughly 69% of adult survivors scored above the clinical 
cutoff for PTSD symptoms (17). This raises urgent questions about 
the prevalence of PTSD and other mental health problems as the 
affected communities progress through the first year of recovery. 
Rigorous synthesis of emerging evidence is needed to quantify the 
psychological 
factors  associated  with 
identify 
worse outcomes.

toll  and 

We  hypothesize  that  the  psychiatric  impact  of  the  2023 
Kahramanmaraş  earthquakes  may  exceed  that  observed  in  prior 
Turkish and international disasters for several interrelated reasons. 
First, the magnitude and scope of destruction—with twin quakes, 
widespread infrastructure collapse, and over 50,000 fatalities—was 
unprecedented  in  recent  Turkish  history.  Second,  the  scale  of 
displacement and prolonged housing instability, with hundreds of 
thousands still in temporary shelters more than a year later, may have 
exacerbated chronic stress. Third, the disaster occurred in a context of 
ongoing socioeconomic challenges, including inflation and limited 
mental health infrastructure in the affected provinces. Finally, the 
cumulative  trauma  experienced  by  survivors  (e.g.,  bereavement, 
injury,  entrapment,  repeated  aftershocks)  likely  contributed  to 
elevated  psychiatric  comorbidity.  These  factors,  individually  and 

collectively,  may  have  intensified  the  severity  and  persistence  of 
psychological distress in the aftermath of the 2023 earthquakes.

2 Methods

2.1 Study design

This study is a systematic review and meta-analysis designed to 
evaluate  the  psychological  impact  of  the  2023  Kahramanmaraş 
earthquakes  on  Turkish  adult  survivors.  It  was  developed  in 
accordance  with  the  PRISMA  2020  guidelines.  The  protocol  was 
International  Prospective  Register 
registered  with 
of  Systematic  Reviews  (PROSPERO)  under  the  registration 
number CRD42025644127.

the 

The aim of the study was to synthesize and quantify the prevalence 
and severity of PTSD, depression, and anxiety in the general adult 
population directly affected by the earthquakes. The review focused 
exclusively on peer-reviewed quantitative studies using standardized 
and culturally validated Turkish versions of internationally recognized 
psychological assessment tools. Only studies examining the general 
adult population were considered; those targeting specific subgroups 
(e.g.,  children,  students,  refugees,  or  occupational  groups)  were 
excluded to ensure sample homogeneity and generalizability.

The  review  focused  exclusively  on  peer-reviewed  quantitative 
studies using standardized and culturally validated Turkish versions 
of  internationally  recognized  psychological  assessment  tools. 
Psychological outcomes in the included studies were assessed using 
Turkish-validated  versions  of  established  instruments.  PTSD 
symptoms  were  measured  using  the  PTSD  Checklist  for  DSM-5 
(PCL-5; Cronbach’s α = 0.94), the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale 
for  DSM-5  (CAPS-5;  α > 0.90),  and  the  International  Trauma 
Questionnaire  (ITQ;  PTSD  scale  α = 0.91,  DSO  scale  α = 0.87). 
Depression  was  assessed  using  the  Beck  Depression  Inventory-II 
(BDI-II;  α = 0.90  non-clinical,  α = 0.89  clinical),  and  anxiety  was 
assessed with the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI; α = 0.93), which also 
showed high internal consistency in Turkish populations.

2.2 Search strategy

A  comprehensive  and  systematic  search  of  the  literature  was 
undertaken to identify relevant studies examining the psychological 
effects  of  the  2023  Kahramanmaraş  earthquakes  on  Turkish  adult 
populations. The strategy was developed in alignment with PRISMA 
2020  guidelines  to  ensure  transparency,  reproducibility,  and 
methodological rigor.

Three academic databases—WOS, PubMed, and Scopus—were 
systematically searched for peer-reviewed journal articles published 
between February 6, 2023, and May 30, 2025. This time window was 

Frontiers in Public Health

Çınaroğlu et al. 

10.3389/fpubh.2025.1664212

selected to capture studies conducted and disseminated within the 
acute  and  subacute  aftermath  of  the  earthquakes.  In  addition  to 
database searches, reference lists of included studies were manually 
reviewed to identify any further eligible publications.

The search terms were developed through an iterative process and 
included combinations of keywords and subject terms related to the 
disaster event (such as “Kahramanmaraş earthquake,” “2023 Turkey 
earthquake,”  “Türkiye  earthquake  survivors”),  the  population  of 
interest  (“earthquake  survivors,”  “disaster-affected  adults”),  and 
psychological outcomes (“PTSD,” “post-traumatic stress,” “depression,” 
“anxiety,” “mental health”). Boolean operators were used to structure 
the queries and refine the results. Filters were applied to limit retrieval 
to studies published in English, conducted with human participants, 
and  published  in  peer-reviewed  outlets  (for  more  details,  see 
Supplementary material).

The initial search strategy was drafted by E. Y. and E. N. A., with 
revisions and refinement provided by S. V.Ü. And M.Ç. supervised the 
development of the final version, and the full database search was 
independently executed by G. H. S. in May 2025. All retrieved records 
were exported into a reference management system, and duplicates 
were removed through both automated and manual screening prior 
to the study selection phase.

2.3 Study selection

Following  the  database  search  and  deduplication  process,  all 
records were screened for eligibility in two stages: title/abstract review 
and  full-text  assessment.  Eligibility  was  determined  based  on 
predefined  inclusion  and  exclusion  criteria,  as  outlined  in  the 
PROSPERO-registered protocol.

In the first stage, two reviewers (E. Y. and E. N. A.) independently 
screened the titles and abstracts of all retrieved records to identify 
potentially relevant studies. Articles that clearly did not meet inclusion 
criteria—such  as  those  focusing  on  non-Turkish  populations, 
qualitative studies, published none WOS, Scopus or Pubmed indexed 
journals,  editorials,  published  not 
in  English,  or  unrelated 
psychological  topics—were  excluded  at  this  stage.  Studies  that 
appeared potentially eligible were advanced to full-text review.

In the second stage, full-text articles were retrieved and assessed 
in detail for eligibility by S. V.Ü. and M.Ç. Discrepancies between 
reviewers were resolved through discussion, and where necessary, 
consultation with G. H. S. served as the final arbiter. Inclusion was 
restricted to peer-reviewed quantitative studies that assessed PTSD, 
depression,  or  anxiety  in  adult  Turkish  survivors  of  the  2023 
Kahramanmaraş  earthquakes,  using  standardized  and  validated 
Turkish-language instruments. Studies focusing on special populations 
(e.g., children, students, healthcare workers, refugees) or those with 
sample  sizes  under  370  were  excluded.  To  ensure  robust  and 
generalizable estimates, we included only studies with a minimum 
sample  size  of  N ≥ 370,  which  approximates  the  required  size  to 
estimate prevalence with 95% confidence and ±5% precision under 
conservative assumptions (p ≈ 0.50).

Out of an initial pool of 980 records, 215 articles were evaluated 
at full text. Eight studies met all inclusion criteria (18–25) and were 
retained  for  data  extraction  and  synthesis.  Reasons  for  full-text 
exclusion  were  recorded  and  are  presented  in  the  PRISMA  flow 
diagram (Figure 1).

2.4 Data extraction

A structured data extraction process was implemented to collect 
the  relevant  variables  needed  for  synthesis  and  meta-analysis. 
Extraction focused on methodological characteristics, sample details, 
and  psychological  outcome  data  related  to  PTSD,  depression, 
and anxiety.

Two  authors  (E.  Y.  and  E.  N.  A.)  independently  extracted 
information from the final set of included studies using a standardized 
form.  Extracted  variables 
included  sample  size,  population 
demographics, geographic location, timing of assessment, and study 
setting. Measurement instruments for psychological outcomes were 
recorded along with scoring methods, clinical cutoffs (if reported), 
and reporting format (e.g., prevalence rates, mean scores). Where 
applicable,  data  on  subgroup  comparisons  and  correlates  such  as 
gender, trauma exposure, or displacement were also noted.

All extracted data were reviewed for consistency and accuracy by 
S. V.Ü. and M.Ç. Disagreements were resolved by discussion, and 
G. H. S. provided oversight for methodological alignment. Finalized 
data were compiled into structured spreadsheets to support both the 
narrative synthesis and statistical analyses.

2.5 Quality and bias assessment

The methodological quality and potential sources of bias in the 
included  studies  were  assessed  using  a  structured,  domain-based 
approach  appropriate  for  observational  designs.  The  assessment 
focused on factors such as sample representativeness, use of validated 
outcome  measures,  clarity  in  reporting,  and  the  completeness  of 
outcome data.

Each study was independently evaluated by E. Y., E. N. A. and 
M.Ç.  using  a  standardized  checklist  adapted  from  the  National 
Institutes of Health (NIH) Quality Assessment Tool for Observational 
Cohort and Cross-Sectional Studies. Criteria included adequacy of 
sample size, transparency of inclusion criteria, appropriateness of the 
measurement tools for PTSD, depression, and anxiety, and whether 
statistical analyses addressed potential confounders.

Studies  were  not  excluded  based  on  quality  scores;  rather, 
assessments were used to contextualize findings and inform sensitivity 
considerations  during  synthesis.  Disagreements  in  ratings  were 
resolved through discussion, with arbitration by GHS when necessary. 
The overall quality of included studies was rated as moderate to high. 
Most  used  well-validated  instruments  and  sampled  from  relevant 
earthquake-affected regions, although several relied on convenience 
sampling, which may limit generalizability.

Risk of reporting bias across studies (e.g., publication bias) was 
considered in the interpretation of pooled results but was not formally 
tested  due  to  the  limited  number  of  studies  included  in  the 
meta-analysis.

A detailed summary of quality ratings for each included study is 
presented in Supplementary material. Each study was evaluated across 
the NIH tool’s criteria for observational cohort and cross-sectional 
designs, including sample representativeness, measurement validity, 
outcome completeness, and confounding control. Overall, five studies 
were rated as moderate quality (meeting 6–7 of 9 criteria), and three 
were  rated  as  high  quality  (meeting  8–9  of  9  criteria).  Common 
limitations included reliance on convenience sampling and limited

reporting on non-responders. These quality assessments informed the 
interpretation of results but did not lead to exclusion of any studies.

2.6 Statistical analyses

Quantitative synthesis was performed for PTSD outcomes, which 
were consistently reported across the included studies. Meta-analytic 
procedures were conducted using a random-effects model to account 
for expected heterogeneity across study populations, instruments, and 
settings. Prevalence estimates of probable PTSD were extracted and 
pooled using the DerSimonian–Laird method. To stabilize variance 
and  accommodate  proportional  data,  prevalence  rates  were 
transformed using the Freeman–Tukey double arcsine transformation 

prior to aggregation and were back-transformed for interpretability. 
Mean  PTSD  scores  were  also  descriptively  summarized  when 
prevalence data were not available. Due to variability in reporting and 
limited  comparable  data,  depression  and  anxiety  outcomes  were 
synthesized narratively and via descriptive statistics.

Statistical heterogeneity was assessed using the Q statistic and the 
I2  index.  High  heterogeneity  (I2 > 75%)  was  anticipated  given 
differences in sampling frames, assessment timepoints, and geographic 
exposure levels. Where feasible, subgroup analyses were conducted to 
explore the effects of timing of assessment (early vs. late post-disaster) 
and study setting (e.g., displaced vs. community-based survivors). 
Sensitivity analyses were planned to test the influence of individual 
studies  on  pooled  estimates  but  were  constrained  by  the  limited 
number of eligible studies.

All statistical procedures were performed using SPSS (version 30) 
and  Python  (version  13.3.1),  with  meta-analytic  coding  and 
visualizations prepared by S. V.Ü., E. N. A. and reviewed by M.Ç. and 
E. Y. A two-tailed p-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant 
for all analyses.

3 Results

3.1 Study characteristics

Table 1 summarizes the key characteristics of the eight included 
studies. In total, the studies comprised 5,965 earthquake survivors 
(individual study sample sizes ranged from 383 to 2,034). All studies 
were  conducted  in  Türkiye  and  published  between  mid-2023  and 
mid-2025,  reflecting  data  collected  within  18  months  after  the 
February  2023  earthquakes.  Six  of  the  eight  studies  [focused  on 
survivors drawn from the hardest-hit provinces (e.g., Kahramanmaraş, 
Hatay, Adıyaman, Malatya)] or large clusters of displaced survivors, 
while  two  studies  surveyed  survivors  who  had  relocated  to  other 
regions (e.g., to Mersin). The timing of assessments varied: two studies 
collected data within ~2–3 months post-earthquake, three studies at 
~6–9 months post-disaster, and three studies around the 12–18 month 
mark.  All  studies  employed  cross-sectional  survey  designs  using 
validated self-report measures.

3.1.1 PTSD measures

Each  study  assessed  PTSD  symptoms  using  a  standardized 
instrument.  Four  studies  used  the  PTSD  Checklist  (PCL)  or  its 
variants: two employed the DSM-5 version (PCL-5), one used the 
DSM-IV civilian version (PCL-C/PCL-S, 17-item), and one used the 
International Trauma Questionnaire (ITQ) for ICD-11 PTSD criteria. 
Another study applied the Primary Care PTSD Screen (PC-PTSD-5) 
as a screening tool, and one study used the Post-Traumatic Diagnostic 
Scale (PDS). All PTSD scales were validated Turkish versions; for 
instance, the ITQ was used to determine ICD-11 PTSD diagnosis in 
one  study,  and  the  clinician-administered  CAPS-5  (Turkish)  was 
referenced as the PTSD measure in another (though effectively used 
as  a  self-report  analog  in  analysis).  PTSD  symptom  severity  was 
typically  reported  either  as  mean  total  scores  or  as  prevalence  of 
probable PTSD based on established cutoff scores (e.g., PCL-5 cutoff 
~31–33 for probable PTSD, PCL-C cutoff ~44, PC-PTSD threshold of 
3 “yes” responses).

3.1.2 Depression and anxiety measures

Fewer studies evaluated depression or anxiety explicitly. Three 
studies administered the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and two 
of these also administered the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI). One 
large-scale study used the Adult Anxiety and Depression Short Forms 
(7-item  and  8-item  scales,  respectively)  from  Patient-Reported 
Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS), each scored 
1–5, to quantify anxiety and depression levels in the sample. Another 
study utilized the General Health Questionnaire-12 (GHQ-12) as a 
broad measure of psychological distress, though this instrument does 
not separate depression/anxiety by subscale. All instruments were 
previously validated in Turkish populations.

Across the studies, participants were adults ages ~18 to 70+ 
(with mean ages in the 30s or 40s in most samples) and included 

somewhat more women than men overall (ranging from ~49 to 
75% female in different studies; in the combined sample roughly 
55% were female). All participants were directly exposed to the 
earthquakes – e.g., being present in the earthquake zone during or 
immediately  after  the  events  –  and  many  endured  significant 
trauma  such  as  loss  of  family  members,  physical  injuries, 
entrapment under rubble, destruction of homes, and displacement 
to temporary accommodations. Indeed, in the studies that reported 
exposure details, a majority of survivors had experienced multiple 
trauma types due to the earthquake. For example, Alpay et al. (25) 
noted that 99.2% of their sample experienced at least one quake-
related  traumatic  event  and  80.7%  experienced  four  or  more 
such events.

All included studies were rated as moderate-to-high quality in 
terms  of  using  standard  measures  and  clearly  defining  PTSD 
outcomes. A notable limitation in several was the use of convenience 
sampling (e.g., surveying those in camps or those presenting to an 
emergency department), which might skew prevalence estimates if, 
for instance, those with the most severe symptoms are more or less 
likely  to  participate.  Despite  this,  the  large  sample  sizes  and 
consistency of findings across different settings lend confidence in the 
overall trends identified.

As shown in Table 1, five studies reported PTSD prevalence (as a 
percentage meeting a criteria threshold), while the others provided 
continuous PTSD severity scores. Fewer studies provided prevalence 
figures for depression or anxiety, though several reported mean scores. 
Despite methodological differences, a consistent picture emerges of a 
very high psychological burden in the surveyed survivor populations, 
as detailed below.

3.2 PTSD prevalence and severity

All eight studies found substantial levels of PTSD symptoms 
among  survivors,  with  many  individuals  exceeding  clinical 
screening thresholds for probable PTSD. Reported PTSD prevalence 
rates  ranged  from  approximately  29–54%  of  participants  across 
studies.  The  lowest  PTSD  prevalence  was  29.0%,  observed  in  a 
population-based survey of survivors in Hatay at 4 months post-
quake (using PCL-5). In contrast, the highest PTSD prevalence was 
54.1%, reported by Alpay et al. (25) in a sample of adults surveyed 
~2 months  post-quake  in  Mersin  (using  ICD-11  criteria  via  the 
ITQ).  Several  other  studies  found  intermediate  prevalence:  for 
example,  İlhan  et  al.  (22)  reported  51.4%  of  their  sample  had 
probable PTSD about 3 months after the disaster (using PCL-5), and 
Kaya et al. (24) found 36.2% of camp residents met criteria for at 
least  moderate-to-severe  PTSD  ~1 year  post-disaster  (using  the 
PDS). Despite some variability, these figures all indicate that roughly 
one-third to one-half of exposed adults were experiencing clinically 
significant  PTSD 
following 
the earthquakes.

We  pooled  the  PTSD  prevalence  data  using  a  random-effects 
model.  The  pooled  prevalence  of  PTSD  among  survivors  was 
approximately 41% (95% confidence interval [CI] ≈ 32–52%). This 
meta-analytic estimate implies that about two out of every five directly 
exposed adults met symptom criteria for PTSD in the aftermath of the 
2023  earthquakes.  Statistical  heterogeneity  was  very  high  (Q-test 
p < 0.001, I2 ~ 95%), reflecting the range of estimates and differences

in  study  methods/samples.  We  explored  potential  reasons  for 
heterogeneity through subgroup analyses:

3.2.1 By assessment timing

Studies  conducted  within  the  first  3 months  tended  to  report 
higher  PTSD  rates  (around  50%  or  more),  whereas  one  study  at 
4 months found a lower rate (29%). However, by 12–18 months post-
quake, PTSD prevalence remained markedly elevated: Taskın et al. 
(23) did not report a percentage, but noted a mean PTSD score of 57.9 
(SD 14.9) on the PCL (out of 85) 1 year later, a level consistent with a 
high PTSD rate (in fact, higher than the ~40% at 1 year observed after 
the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake) (25). Similarly, Kaya et al. (24) at 
12 months  found  36%  with  moderate/severe  PTSD,  indicating  no 
dramatic drop-off in PTSD prevalence between 4 months and 1 year 
in that hard-hit camp sample. In summary, PTSD prevalence did not 
uniformly  decline  over  the  first  year;  if  anything,  substantial 
proportions  of  survivors  continued  to  report  PTSD  symptoms  at 
9–12 months comparable to the acute phase. Immediate post-disaster 
studies  (within  ~6 weeks)  were  limited,  but  an  initial  small  study 
(~50 days  post-quake)  found  69%  above  the  PTSD  cutoff  (17), 
suggesting  an  extremely  acute  spike  which  may  have  modestly 
tempered by 4–6 months (to ~30–50%), but then plateaued at high 
levels through 1 year.

3.2.2 By sample setting

There  was  a  suggestion  that  survivors  living  in  temporary 
housing or those who experienced displacement and bereavement 
had particularly severe outcomes. For instance, the study focusing 
on Hatay (Antakya) tent-camp residents with close personal losses 
reported uniformly high PTSD symptom levels (mean PCL-5 score 
~55 out of 80, with 75% of that sample exceeding even stringent 
cutoffs,  according  to  authors’  notes).  In  contrast,  a  study  that 
sampled the general population in Hatay via cluster sampling yielded 
the lowest PTSD prevalence (29%) – possibly reflecting inclusion of 
some  survivors  with  less  direct  trauma  exposure  or  better  post-
disaster  support.  Nonetheless,  differences  by  setting  were  not 
entirely  consistent:  even  community  samples  (not  exclusively  in 
camps)  often  showed  PTSD  rates  in  the  45–54%  range  when 
surveyed  early  (e.g.,  Mersin  sample  at  2 months:  54%;  multi-
province  emergency  department  sample  at  3 months:  51%).  The 
common  thread  is  that  severity  of  exposure  and  ongoing  stressors 
(displacement, lack of housing) likely drive PTSD rates more than 
simply the survey setting.

TABLE 2  PTSD outcome reporting across included studies.

To illustrate PTSD symptom severity beyond binary prevalence, 
several studies provided mean scores on PTSD scales. In the largest 
survey [Akçay et al. (18), N > 2,000], the average trauma symptom 
score  was  64.57  on  their  scale,  exceeding  the  established 
“traumatization” threshold (approx. 52 on that scale) – indicating the 
average  participant  had  clinically  high  PTSD  symptoms.  In  studies 
using the PCL (0–4 Likert per item), mean item scores were around 
3.2  (SD ~ 0.9)  –  i.e.  on  average  “3 = Quite  a  bit”  for  each  PTSD 
symptom, again a high level. For example, Kıymış and Fakiroğlu (20) 
reported a mean PTSD item score of 3.18 (SD 0.89) on a 0–4 scale, 
which corresponds to a total score of ~64/80 – well above conventional 
cutoffs. At 1 year post-event, Taskın et al.’s (23) sample still had a mean 
PCL  score  of  57.90  (SD  14.91)  out  of  85.  By  comparison,  past 
earthquakes like Wenchuan (2008) saw around 40% with PTSD at 
1 year; the authors noted that “the PCL score [57.9] in this study is 
higher than reported in the literature” (26), likely due to the greater 
unmet needs and trauma severity in the Kahramanmaraş disaster. In 
short, not only were PTSD diagnoses prevalent, but symptom severity 
was, on average, in the moderate-to-severe range among survivors 
(Table 2).

In Figure 2A presents a forest plot of reported PTSD prevalence 
estimates with 95% confidence intervals from four studies that used 
clinical  cutoff  scores.  The  pooled  estimate  is  approximately  41%, 
indicated  by  the  dashed  red  line.  Figure  2B  displays  mean  PTSD 
symptom severity scores from the remaining four studies, illustrating 
consistently elevated PTSD levels across samples. Most mean scores 
fall within or above the moderate-to-severe clinical range, reflecting a 
substantial  psychological  burden  even  in  the  absence  of  formal 
prevalence figures (Table 3).

3.3 Depression outcomes

Symptoms of depression were also highly prevalent in the survivor 
population, though fewer studies quantified depression as an outcome 
distinct  from  PTSD.  Two  studies  provided  a  point  prevalence  for 
probable  depression.  Yılmaz  and  Erdem  (19)  found  that  38.8%  of 
participants screened positive for depression (BDI score above the 
cut-off) about 4 months post-earthquake. This indicates that more 
than  one-third  of  survivors  were  experiencing  at  least  moderate 
depressive symptomatology in that sample. In comparison, studies 
after some prior quakes reported somewhat lower depression rates 
(e.g., ~11% 3 years after 1999 earthquakes, though those were much

later follow-ups) (27). Another included study [Kaya et al. (24)] did 
not directly measure depression prevalence but did measure resilience 
and found many survivors lacking in resilience resources 1 year on; a 
strong  negative  correlation  between  resilience  and  PTSD  in  their 
findings implies that those with lower resilience likely had higher 
distress, potentially including depressive symptoms.

Several studies reported mean depression scores that underscore 
the  severity  of  depressive  symptoms  among  survivors.  The  most 
striking finding comes from Filazoğlu Çokluk et al.’s (21) study of 
displaced survivors with losses: the mean BDI-II score in that sample 
was 53.3 (SD 5.3) on a scale of 0–63. This average falls in the severe 
depression  range  (typically  BDI ≥ 29  indicates  severe  depression), 
meaning  virtually  the  entire  sample  was  experiencing  significant 
depressive symptoms 9 months after the disaster. In fact, the lowest 
BDI score observed in that sample was 7, and the maximum was 58, 
with most respondents clustering at very high scores – a testament to 
the profound psychological impact on those who lost loved ones and 
homes and were still living in temporary shelters. Another study (20) 
using a 5-point Likert depression scale reported a mean score of 2.92 
(SD 0.97) out of 5. In context, this suggests that on average survivors 
endorsed depression symptoms at least “occasionally to frequently” 
(since  a  3  on  that  scale  might  correspond  to  “often”),  which  is 
indicative of moderate depression levels across the sample.

While  a  meta-analytic  prevalence  for  depression  cannot 
be precisely calculated from the limited data, the available evidence 
points  to  a  widespread  burden  of  depressive  symptoms  in  the 
aftermath of the earthquakes. The high co-occurrence of depression 
with PTSD is notable: individuals who screened positive for PTSD 
were much more likely to also report high depression scores. For 
example, Yılmaz and Erdem (19) found that participants with PTSD 
had a mean BDI score of 23.7 (SD 9.8) versus 11.7 (SD 7.5) in those 
without  PTSD  –  a  significant  difference.  Similarly,  Kıymış  and 
Fakiroğlu (20) found PTSD severity to be strongly correlated with 
depression  level  (standardized  β ≈ 0.64  in  their  SEM  model, 
p < 0.001).  These  findings  underscore  that  comorbid  depression 
affected a large subset of survivors, compounding the mental health 

challenges  in  the  population.  Qualitatively,  field  observations 
reported by Akçay et al. (18) noted pervasive feelings of hopelessness, 
sadness,  and  loss  of  interest  among  survivors,  consistent  with 
depressive  symptomatology  (though  they  did  not  administer  a 
separate depression scale).

In  summary,  up  to  40%  of  directly  affected  adults  likely 
experienced clinically significant depression in the months following 
the  earthquakes,  with  certain  high-trauma  groups  showing  even 
greater levels of depressive symptoms. The severity of depression in 
many cases was considerable – a finding that has critical implications 
for mental health services, as depression can hinder recovery and is 
associated with elevated suicide risk if left unaddressed.

3.4 Anxiety outcomes

Likewise,  anxiety  symptoms  were  prevalent  and  often  severe 
among earthquake survivors, although only a few studies formally 
measured anxiety separate from PTSD. No study reported an exact 
prevalence  percentage  for  anxiety  disorders  (such  as  generalized 
anxiety or panic disorder). However, available anxiety scale scores 
suggest that a large proportion of survivors suffered from clinically 
elevated anxiety. For example, in the early post-disaster period, Bilge 
et  al.  (62)  found  that  44.2%  of  survivors  had  moderate  to  severe 
anxiety levels (BAI score ≥22) in a sample assessed ~50 days post-
quake. This indicates nearly half were experiencing frequent anxiety 
symptoms  (restlessness,  fear,  autonomic  symptoms  etc.)  in  the 
immediate aftermath. Another study [Akçay et al. (18)] noted that 
“more  than  two  thirds  of  the  population  experienced  mental 
consequences” and highlighted anxiety as a common issue, although 
they did not quantify it separately.

By  the  mid-to-late  post-disaster  phase,  anxiety  remained  high 
especially in those living in stressful conditions. Filazoğlu Çokluk et al. 
(21) reported a mean BAI score of 45.6 (SD 4.5) out of 63 in their 
sample  of  displaced  survivors  9 months  post-event.  To  put  this  in 
perspective, a BAI score > 25 is often considered severe anxiety – here

the average was well into the severe range. This suggests pervasive and 
intense anxiety symptoms (e.g., constant nervousness, panic attacks, 
insomnia) among those survivors, likely reflecting ongoing insecurity 
(living  in  temporary  shelters,  aftershocks,  uncertainty  about  the 
future). Kıymış and Fakiroğlu (20) similarly found a high mean anxiety 
level (mean 3.21 on a 1–5 scale, SD 1.07) in their broad sample, which 
again corresponds to frequent anxiety symptoms. It is noteworthy that 
95.7% of participants in Filazoğlu’s study reported experiencing intense 
fear  during  the  earthquake  and  many  continued  to  fear  recurring 
quakes. This persistent hyperarousal and worry about aftershocks likely 
maintained  high  anxiety  months  later.  Indeed,  Kızılhan  et  al.  (63) 
found 63.5% of their respondents were in fear of aftershocks “most or 
all of the time” even at 4 months post-quake, highlighting how chronic 
fear and anxiety pervaded the survivor community.

As with depression, anxiety was strongly correlated with PTSD 
symptoms.  Survivors  with  probable  PTSD  consistently  showed 
higher anxiety scores than those without. In Yılmaz and Erdem (19), 
for instance, those with PTSD had significantly elevated co-morbid 
anxiety (though not measured by a separate scale, PTSD-positive 
individuals  reported  more  frequent  panic-like  symptoms  in 
qualitative  terms).  Kıymış  and  Fakiroğlu  (20)  found  an  almost 
one-to-one coupling between PTSD and anxiety in their structural 
model:  PTSD  severity  had  a  β = 0.936  effect  on  anxiety  level 
(p < 0.001), essentially indicating that higher PTSD symptoms nearly 
always  co-occurred  with  high  anxiety  symptoms  in  that  data. 
Filazoğlu  Çokluk  et  al.  (21)  also  reported  significant  positive 
correlations between PTSD scores and BAI anxiety scores (though 
exact  r  not  given,  it  was  part  of  a  regression  where  anxiety  and 
depression together explained 41% of PTSD variance).

In practical terms, many survivors exhibited symptoms consistent 
with  generalized  anxiety  or  panic  (e.g.,  constant  tension,  startle 
reactions, nightmares contributing to insomnia, health anxieties). 
Field reports described displaced families feeling continuously on 
edge,  with  any  loud  sound  or  tremor  triggering  acute  anxiety 
responses months after the initial quakes. One study noted that 95% 
of survivors felt that either their own life or a loved one’s life was in 

danger  during  the  earthquakes,  an  experience  that  can  imprint 
lasting anxiety. Combined with ongoing stressors (living in tents/
containers,  uncertainty),  it  is  unsurprising  that  pathological 
anxiety persisted.

In summary, while exact rates are not enumerated, it is clear that 
a  majority  of  survivors  experienced  elevated  anxiety,  with 
approximately 40–50% having at least moderate anxiety symptoms in 
the early months and severe anxiety being common in heavily affected 
groups even at 9–12 months. Alongside PTSD and depression, anxiety 
represents a crucial component of the post-disaster mental health 
burden that aid efforts must address (Table 4).

3.5 Subgroup analyses and risk factors

A consistent finding across studies is that certain subgroups of 
survivors were at heightened risk for PTSD and related psychological 
morbidity. We synthesized the risk factors identified in multivariate 
analyses and subgroup comparisons.

3.5.1 Gender

Female survivors consistently exhibited higher PTSD prevalence 
and severity than males. In Yılmaz and Erdem (19) study, 34.4% of 
women met PTSD criteria compared to 23.1% of men. İlhan et al. (22) 
quantified gender differences: being female was associated with 4.5 
times higher odds of probable PTSD (OR = 4.54, 95% CI 2.39–8.61). 
Alpay et al. (25) similarly found female gender to be a significant 
correlate of PTSD, with women endorsing PTSD symptom clusters at 
higher rates than men (consistent with global disaster research) (28, 
29). The greater vulnerability of women may relate to compounding 
stressors (caretaking roles, higher likelihood of lost family members 
as reported in some samples, or less access to resources) as well as 
possible  pre-existing  gender  disparities  in  mental  health.  Notably, 
none of the studies focused exclusively on women or men, but the 
convergence  of  evidence 
suffered 
disproportionately high PTSD and distress levels after the earthquakes.

3.5.2 Age

Several studies suggested that younger adults were more affected 
than older adults. İlhan et al. (22) found each additional year of age 
was associated with a slight reduction in PTSD risk (OR for age = 0.96 
per year), meaning younger respondents had higher PTSD likelihood. 
Akçay  et  al.  (18)  reported  a  negative  correlation  between  age  and 
trauma  scores  (r = −0.13,  p < 0.01),  indicating  that  younger 
participants had higher post-earthquake trauma levels. This could 
reflect  greater  disruption  in  younger  people’s  lives  (loss  of  young 
children, jobs, etc.), or that older individuals, having survived previous 
adversities, had more coping resilience (30). However, not all studies 
explicitly examined age effects; in some, the age range was narrower 
or skewed (e.g., Taskın et al.’s (23) sample was mostly middle-aged 
with mean ~45). Overall, there is some evidence that being younger 
(e.g., 18–30) was a risk factor for higher PTSD symptoms, although 
this trend might not be as strong as gender or exposure-related factors.

3.5.3 Exposure severity and trauma losses

By far the most potent predictors of psychological impact were 
those related to the severity of disaster exposure. Virtually all studies 
reported  that  participants  who  experienced  loss  of  loved  ones, 
personal  injury,  or  property  destruction  had  significantly  worse 
mental health outcomes:

 •  Bereavement:  Losing  family  members  or  close  friends  in  the 
earthquake was linked to higher PTSD. İlhan et al. (22) found 
that having lost a loved one carried an OR = 3.15 (95% CI 1.67–
5.92) for PTSD. Taskın et al. (23) similarly noted that the mean 
PTSD score was significantly higher (μ ~ 64.8) for those who lost 
relatives compared to those who did not. In Kızılhan et al.’s (63)
sample, those who lost close family had higher trauma scores and 
were over-represented among the PTSD-positive group (though 
specific OR not given).

 •  Physical injury (self or loved ones): Suffering an injury during the 
quake, or having family injured, also elevated risk. Alpay et al. 
(25)  identified  personal  injury  and  having  an  injured  family 

member  as  significant  correlates  of  PTSD  (these  variables 
increased odds of PTSD in logistic regression). İlhan et al. (22) 
likewise found that receiving emergency medical care (a proxy 
for injury) was associated with higher PTSD (OR = 6.67, though 
with wide CI).

 •  Home destruction and displacement: Survivors whose homes 
were completely destroyed had notably higher PTSD symptoms. 
Taskın et al. (23) reported a mean PCL score of 67.5 for those 
whose homes were razed, versus much lower scores for those 
with intact or minimally damaged homes (p < 0.001). Similarly, 
those living in temporary shelters (reflecting homelessness) had 
greater trauma. Akçay et al. (18) found trauma scores were higher 
in  participants  staying  in  tents/temporary  housing  after  the 
quake  compared  to  those  who  found  stable  housing.  Many 
survivors who had to migrate to a different city (often due to 
home loss) experienced a sense of alienation that correlated with 
higher PTSD levels.

 •  Economic loss and job loss: Earthquake-related financial strain 
was another contributor. Taskın et al. (23) noted PTSD scores 
were elevated in those who lost their jobs or income due to the 
disaster. For example, being unemployed post-quake had an odds 
ratio (OR) ~ 2.59 for PTSD in Yılmaz and Erdem (19) (p = 0.004). 
Kızılhan  et  al.  (63)  reported  53.6%  of  survivors  were  facing 
financial  difficulties  and  this  was  entwined  with  mental 
health outcomes.
Collectively, these findings highlight a dose–response pattern: the 
greater the trauma exposure and subsequent losses, the higher the risk 
of PTSD and other psychological problems. This aligns with trauma 
literature,  but  here  the  effect  sizes  are  pronounced.  For  instance, 
multiple trauma exposures had a cumulative impact – in Alpay et al.’s 
(25) sample, people exposed to ≥4 trauma types had much higher 
PTSD rates than those with 1–2 exposures. In Kızılhan et al., (63) 
those  trapped  under  rubble  (even  if  survived  physically)  showed 
significantly higher trauma levels than those not trapped.

 •  Low social support: Low perceived social support emerged as a 
significant risk factor in at least one study. İlhan et al. (22) found 

Frontiers in Public Health

10

frontiersin.org

Çınaroğlu et al. 

10.3389/fpubh.2025.1664212

low social support was associated with higher PTSD (OR = 1.80). 
Kızılhan et al. (63) also noted that those who felt unsupported or 
isolated had worse PTSD outcomes. Social support often buffers 
trauma impact; its relative lack in the chaotic aftermath (when 
normal community networks were disrupted) likely exacerbated 
distress. Conversely, survivors who had family or community 
support showed somewhat lower symptom levels on average, as 
some qualitative accounts suggested (e.g., seeking support from 
family was a commonly used coping method, per Akçay et al.).
 •  Pre-disaster psychiatric history: A prior history of mental illness 
was a predictor of post-quake PTSD in at least one study. Kaya 
et al. (24) reported that having any pre-earthquake psychiatric 
diagnosis  significantly  predicted  higher  PTSD  severity  1 year 
later  (β ≈ 0.10,  p < 0.01).  This  is  intuitive  as  individuals  with 
pre-existing vulnerabilities may have fewer reserves when facing 
a new trauma. However, relatively few survivors in these samples 
had known pre-quake diagnoses (e.g., 6.8% in Filazoğlu’s sample 
reported a prior mental illness), so while important, this factor 
applies to a smaller subset.

 •  Resilience and coping: The role of protective factors like resilience 
was examined in two studies with interestingly divergent results. 
Kaya et al. (24) found that resilience (as measured by the Brief 
Resilience Scale) had a strong protective effect – higher resilience 
scores were associated with significantly lower PTSD severity 
(β = −0.378, p < 0.001). In other words, survivors who reported 
greater ability to bounce back from adversity were much less 
likely  to  develop  severe  PTSD,  even  accounting  for  trauma 
exposure. By contrast, Kıymış and Fakiroğlu (20) did not find 
resilience  to  be  protective  in  their  model:  resilience  had  no 
significant  effect  on  PTSD  (β = −0.04,  p > 0.05).  The  authors 
found this surprising and posited that the sheer magnitude of the 
trauma may have overwhelmed typical resilience mechanisms. 
It’s possible that differences in how resilience was measured or 
sample composition explain this discrepancy. Regardless, both 
studies (and others qualitatively) emphasized the importance of 

coping strategies. Akçay et al. (18) noted that religious coping 
(praying)  and  family/social  support  seeking  were  the  most 
common coping behaviors among survivors, which might have 
offered some emotional relief even if not directly measured as 
resilience.  A  minority  of  survivors  turned  to  potentially 
maladaptive coping (e.g., increased substance use), with Kızılhan 
et al. (63) observing an uptick in smoking and one report of self-
medicating with alcohol, but widespread negative coping was not 
apparent.  This  suggests  that  enhancing  positive  coping  and 
resilience (through community and mental health interventions) 
is  a  key  consideration 
long-term  PTSD 
and depression.

for  reducing 

In summary, the subgroup analysis indicates that women, younger 
adults, and those who experienced intense trauma exposure (loss of 
loved ones, serious injury, home loss, displacement, financial strain) 
have borne the highest psychological burdens. For example, a married 
young mother who lost her home and a family member in the quake, and 
is  now  living  in  a  tent  with  scant  support,  would  represent  a 
convergence of risk factors and indeed would be expected to have very 
elevated PTSD/depression according to these data. On the other hand, 
individuals who were older, did not lose family or property, and had 
strong  support  networks  showed  relatively  lower  (though  still 
non-trivial) symptom levels. These insights are important for targeting 
psychosocial support: survivors with multiple risk factors may need 
proactive outreach (as they are most likely to develop chronic PTSD), 
whereas bolstering social support and resilience in communities could 
mitigate some risk (Figure 3).

3.6 Comorbidity and overall mental health 
burden

It is important to emphasize the overlap of PTSD, depression, and 
anxiety in this context. Rather than distinct groups, many survivors

were affected by all three symptom domains simultaneously. Several 
studies effectively illustrate this comorbidity. Filazoğlu Çokluk et al. 
(21) found significant correlations between PTSD symptoms and both 
depression and anxiety scores (all p < 0.001), and these constructs 
together formed a network of post-traumatic distress. Kıymış and 
Fakiroğlu’s (20) SEM analysis provides a clear depiction: higher PTSD 
directly led to higher concurrent anxiety (β ~ 0.94) and depression 
(β ~ 0.64).  This  means  that  individuals  who  re-experienced  the 
earthquake in nightmares or intrusive thoughts, avoided reminders, 
and felt hypervigilant (core PTSD symptoms) were very often the 
same individuals feeling hopeless, withdrawn (depression) and jittery 
or constantly fearful (anxiety).

From a clinical standpoint, this points toward possible diagnoses 
of comorbid PTSD and depression/anxiety (or adjustment disorders) 
in a significant subset of survivors. Indeed, one study [Alpay et al. 
(25)] focused on ICD-11 PTSD specifically, but it is likely that some 
who  did  not  meet  full  PTSD  criteria  still  had  other  psychiatric 
conditions like adjustment disorder with anxiety/depression. Kızılhan 
et al. (63) highlighted that 82.2% of their sample scored above the 
GHQ-12 cutoff for general psychiatric morbidity (even using a stricter 
threshold), suggesting that aside from PTSD per se, the vast majority 
were suffering some form of psychological distress requiring attention. 
Moreover,  a  phenomenon  of  complex  grief  was  noted:  survivors 
mourning deceased relatives often exhibited depression and PTSD 
concurrently, necessitating integrated therapeutic approaches.

Finally,  it  should  be  noted  that  none  of  the  included  studies 
explicitly  evaluated  post-traumatic  growth  (PTG)  or  positive 
psychological  changes,  except  Bilge  et  al.,  (62)  who  did  measure 
PTG.  In  their  small  sample,  they  found  some  evidence  of  post-
traumatic growth co-occurring with high PTSD (perhaps as a coping 
mechanism). However, for the scope of this review, the focus was on 
negative psychological outcomes. The overall picture is unequivocal: 
the  2023  earthquakes  precipitated  a  mental  health  crisis  among 
survivors, with extremely high rates of PTSD often accompanied by 
depression and anxiety symptoms. Virtually two-thirds or more of 
survivors  were  psychologically  affected  to  a  clinically  significant 
degree – whether via PTSD, depression/anxiety, or general trauma-
related distress. This far exceeds general population baseline rates and 
underscores  an  urgent  need  for  mental  health  services  in  the 
affected regions.

4 Discussion

This 

systematic 

review  and  meta-analysis  provides  a 
comprehensive assessment of the psychological impact of the 2023 
Kahramanmaraş earthquakes on adult survivors in Türkiye during the 
first 18 months post-disaster. The findings paint a sobering picture of 
widespread mental health problems. We estimated that approximately 
40–45% of directly exposed adults developed probable PTSD within 
the first year, a prevalence that is substantially higher than average 
rates reported after other large earthquakes (which tend to cluster 
around 20–30%) (31–34). Similarly, very high proportions of survivors 
experienced  clinically  significant  depression  and  anxiety,  often 
comorbid with PTSD. By any comparison, these earthquakes – often 
termed the “disaster of the century” – have resulted in an extraordinary 
level of psychological trauma in the affected population. While the 
PTSD, depression, and anxiety rates reported here appear higher than 
those  following  previous  disasters  such  as  the  1999  Marmara 

earthquake, these comparisons should be interpreted with caution due 
to methodological differences across studies—including variation in 
assessment  timing,  diagnostic  criteria  (DSM-IV  vs.  DSM-5), 
instruments used (e.g., PCL vs. CAPS), and sampling methods (e.g., 
random  community  samples  vs.  convenience  or  clinical  samples). 
Several aspects of our results merit further discussion:

(20). 

In  contrast, 

Persistence  of  PTSD  over  time:  One  might  expect  PTSD 
prevalence to peak in the acute aftermath and then decline as recovery 
progresses (35). Our synthesis suggests that while there may have been 
some  attenuation  after  the  initial  shock,  PTSD  rates  remained 
alarmingly elevated through 1.5 years post-quake. For example, the 
~36–50% PTSD rates at 12–18 months [observed in Taskın et al. (23) 
and  Kaya  et  al.  (24)]  are  actually  on  par  with  or  higher  than  the 
~29–51%  seen  at  4 months  in  other  samples.  This  lack  of  a  clear 
downward trend could be due to the ongoing adversities faced by 
survivors: 1.5 year later, tens of thousands of people were still living in 
temporary  shelters  or  struggling  to  rebuild  their  lives,  which  can 
perpetuate trauma and stress. This finding diverges somewhat from 
prior  disasters;  for  instance,  longitudinal  studies  after  the  1999 
Marmara quake noted PTSD declining to ~25% by 1 year (36) and 
the 
~12–17%  by  3–4 years  post-event 
Kahramanmaraş earthquakes’ impact appears more sustained, likely 
reflecting the greater disaster severity and possibly insufficiencies in 
early mental health intervention coverage. Our data thus highlight 
that the need for psychological support in this population did not 
diminish substantially after the initial months. It reinforces arguments 
by  authorities  and  researchers  that  mental  health  services  must 
be maintained long-term, not just in the immediate aftermath (37–40).
Comparison to prior earthquakes: The PTSD prevalence we found 
(pooled ~41%) is one of the highest averages documented for any 
earthquake-affected population. For comparison, a meta-analysis by 
Dai et al. (5) found a pooled PTSD incidence of 23.6% across many 
earthquakes, and even for high-impact events like Wenchuan (2008) 
the 1-year PTSD prevalence was about 40% (41). Only a few historical 
disasters (e.g., the 1988 Armenian earthquake) reported PTSD rates 
in the range of 70–80%, often in specific severely affected groups (42). 
The  2023  Turkish  earthquakes,  given  their  massive  death  toll  and 
destruction,  seem  to  be  on  the  extreme  end  of  the  spectrum  for 
psychological fallout. In particular, our included study by Alpay et al. 
(25)  using  ICD-11  criteria  found  54%  PTSD  –  and  ICD-11  is 
somewhat more conservative than DSM-IV/5 in diagnosis (focusing 
on core symptoms), underscoring how high the distress was. These 
results confirm projections made early on that the Kahramanmaraş 
disaster would have “lingering mental health effects for many years.” 
They also align with the United Nations (43) and NGO reports (44, 
45) after the quake, which warned of a looming mental health crisis 
among the 1.5+ million displaced and millions more affected (though 
those  reports  lacked  quantitative  estimates).  Our  review  provides 
concrete numbers that can help quantify that crisis.

Depression and anxiety comorbidity: A key finding of this review 
is  that  focusing  on  PTSD  alone  would  underestimate  the  mental 
health burden; depression and anxiety were equally pervasive. Many 
survivors meet criteria for multiple disorders (e.g., PTSD and major 
depression). High comorbidity is expected after trauma (46), but the 
degree here is remarkable – for instance, in one study over 80% had 
significant general psychiatric morbidity by GHQ. This suggests many 
survivors might benefit from broad mental health screening rather 
than PTSD-specific screening alone. Programs providing integrated 
treatment for PTSD and depression/anxiety [such as trauma-focused

cognitive-behavioral therapies that also address mood and fear (47), 
or pharmacotherapy like SSRIs which can target all three conditions 
(48)] could be appropriate. It’s noteworthy that some prior research 
(14, on the 1999 quakes) found that survivors often had subsyndromal 
PTSD or depressive symptoms that still impaired functioning (49). 
Our findings reinforce that sub-threshold cases likely abound and 
need support, not just those meeting full PTSD criteria. Additionally, 
given the extremely high anxiety levels, issues like sleep disturbances 
(50),  substance  use  (51),  and  suicidal  ideation  (52)  may  arise 
secondary  to  anxiety/PTSD  (as  literature  suggests).  Indeed,  some 
included studies noted concerns about suicidal thoughts or self-harm 
in survivors. Although not a focus of our review, it underlines the 
complexity of the post-disaster mental health profile.

Risk factors and vulnerable groups: The consistency of certain risk 
factors across studies (female gender, trauma severity, losses, etc.) is 
both expected and important for directing interventions. Women’s 
higher  risk  might  be  due  to  a  combination  of  sociocultural  and 
biological  factors  [e.g.,  women  report  more  fear  and  helplessness 
during quakes and often carry the burden of caring for family under 
duress (53, 54)]. This suggests that outreach programs should ensure 
women have access to counseling, and perhaps women-only group 
therapies  could  be  beneficial  in  some  conservative  communities. 
Younger  adults’  higher  risk  may  reflect  concern  for  children  and 
disruption of life trajectory (losing a home early in adulthood, etc.); 
they  might  benefit  from  programs  that  address  grief  for  lost 
opportunities (e.g., students who lost schooling time, young adults 
who lost jobs).

The findings on exposure-related factors essentially confirm a dose–
response relationship: those “hit hardest” (literally and figuratively) are 
suffering the worst psychologically. This aligns with trauma theory – the 
Conservation of Resources theory (55), for example, would predict that 
loss of resources (material, personal, and social) leads to greater stress 
and  PTSD.  Our  review  found  exactly  that:  resource  losses  (house, 
livelihood, and loved ones) are strongly tied to mental health outcomes. 
Encouragingly, some of these are modifiable risk factors in the sense that 
restoring  housing  and  economic  stability  should  help  reduce 
psychological distress over time. Taskın et al.’s (23) finding that people 
whose  neighborhoods  were  being  actively  reconstructed  had  lower 
PTSD scores is a hopeful indicator that recovery efforts can translate into 
mental health gains. It underscores the need for rapid rehousing, job 
programs, and community rebuilding – not only for physical recovery 
but as a form of psychosocial intervention.

Resilience and cultural factors: The mixed results on resilience 
invite  discussion.  It’s  plausible  that  in  the  immediate  aftermath, 
traditional  resilience  (as  measured  by  trait  scales)  may  not  shield 
against an overwhelming disaster – Kıymış and Fakiroğlu’s (20) null 
finding could be interpreted that no one was truly resilient to an event 
of this magnitude in the short term. However, Kaya et al. (24) showed 
that by 1 year, those with higher resilience were faring better. It could 
be a matter of timing and measurement: perhaps at 1–28 months, 
personal resilience (optimism, coping flexibility) starts differentiating 
who recovers vs. who remains symptomatic, whereas at 2–3 months 
post-quake,  even  resilient  individuals  were  still  struggling.  This 
suggests  that  resilience-building  interventions  (like  skills  training, 
strengthening social networks, meaning-making exercises) could play 
a role in the longer-term recovery phase. Culturally, many Turkish 
survivors leaned on familial and religious coping [as noted in Akçay 
et al. (18) and others]. These coping mechanisms may not directly 

reduce PTSD symptoms, but they provide emotional solace. From a 
public health perspective, partnering with community leaders and 
religious figures to disseminate mental health education and normalize 
seeking help could leverage these cultural coping avenues.

4.1 Limitations of the evidence

While our review is comprehensive, it is important to acknowledge 
limitations in the available studies. All data were cross-sectional – 
there is a dearth of longitudinal tracking in this first 1.5 year. Thus, 
individual  recovery  trajectories  are  unknown  (we  only  compared 
different samples at different times). Also, most studies relied on self-
report questionnaires rather than clinical diagnostic interviews, which 
means  prevalence  of  “probable  PTSD”  might  not  equal  formally 
diagnosed PTSD. Self-report scales can overestimate or sometimes 
underestimate  true  disorder  prevalence  due  to  response  biases. 
However, many of the scales used [PCL-5 (56), PC-PTSD-5 (57), PDS 
(58)]  have  good  validity,  and  the  consistency  of  high  rates  across 
different  tools  gives  confidence  that  the  problem  is  real  and 
widespread,  even  if  the  exact  percentage  might  fluctuate  with  the 
diagnostic  method.  Another  limitation  is  the  exclusion  of  certain 
subpopulations  from  both  the  studies  and  our  review  –  notably, 
children and adolescents are not covered here, nor are Syrian refugees 
who were also affected in the region. Children often have different 
psychological reactions (e.g., more behavioral issues or different PTSD 
symptom expression). Given the extreme nature of this disaster, it is 
likely that children and teens also have very high PTSD rates (some 
reports from earlier quakes show child PTSD as high or higher than 
adults (59, 60)). Thus, our findings cannot be generalized to minors, 
and separate investigations are needed for that group. The same goes 
for rescue workers or healthcare workers in the quake zone – they 
might have unique trauma exposures (sometimes called secondary 
trauma). We focused on general population survivors, which was a 
strength  for  homogeneity,  but  future  reviews  might  include  those 
groups to complete the picture.

4.2 Implications for public health

This review highlights a prolonged and widespread psychological 
impact among earthquake survivors, signaling a critical need for long-
term mental health strategies within disaster recovery efforts. Public 
health systems must integrate psychosocial support into emergency 
response plans, ensuring continuity of care well beyond the initial 
crisis period. Targeted outreach is especially vital for high-risk groups 
such  as  women,  displaced  individuals,  and  those  with  cumulative 
trauma. Strengthening local service capacity, training providers in 
trauma-informed care, and engaging communities through culturally 
sensitive  programs  will  be  key  to  reducing  long-term  psychiatric 
burden. Mental well-being should be treated as a core pillar of disaster 
resilience  and  national  preparedness  policy.  The  persistence  of 
clinically  significant  PTSD,  depression,  and  anxiety  among  large 
segments of the population is likely to place a substantial long-term 
burden on Türkiye’s healthcare system, including increased demand 
for psychiatric services, primary care utilization, and psychosomatic 
care,  as  well  as  indirect  costs  associated  with  disability,  reduced 
productivity, and caregiver strain.

4.3 Implications for practice

Despite  these  limitations,  the  evidence  base  leads  to  clear 
implications. First, there is a critical need for large-scale mental health 
interventions in the affected regions – a point emphasized by several 
study authors. Yılmaz and Erdem (19) explicitly call for “large-scale 
psychosocial support and intervention programs in the post-disaster 
period,” and our review strongly supports that recommendation. Such 
programs could include deploying more mental health professionals 
to  the  region,  establishing  community-based  trauma  counseling 
centers, and training primary care providers in psychological first aid 
and  PTSD  management.  Group-based  interventions  (like  trauma 
support  groups  or  narrative  exposure  therapy  workshops)  could 
efficiently reach many survivors. Given the comorbidity, interventions 
should be comprehensive, addressing not just PTSD flashbacks but 
also depressive thoughts and anxiety management (e.g., via cognitive-
techniques).  Culturally  sensitive  approaches  will 
behavioral 
be essential – for instance, integrating religious coping (imams or 
spiritual counselors working alongside psychologists) might increase 
acceptability. Secondly, our identified risk factors can help prioritize 
who gets help first: outreach teams should particularly engage with 
women, those still in temporary housing, families of the deceased, and 
individuals exhibiting withdrawal or substance use (as those could 
be  signs  of  depression/PTSD).  Screening  efforts  at  tent  cities  or 
community centers can use brief tools like the PC-PTSD or GHQ to 
identify high-risk individuals for referral.

Another  implication  is  the  importance  of  monitoring  and 
follow-up.  As  the  reconstruction  continues,  authorities  should 
monitor  mental  health  outcomes  over  the  next  several  years.  It  is 
possible  that  without  intervention,  some  survivors  will  develop 
chronic  PTSD  or  depression  that  persists  for  years  (as  seen  in  a 
minority  after  Marmara  1999,  where  ~23%  still  had  PTSD  at 
14 months and some even years later). On the other hand, if living 
conditions improve (permanent housing, restored livelihoods), some 
spontaneous recovery could occur in others. It would be valuable to 
conduct follow-up studies at 2 years and 5 years post-disaster to see 
how these prevalences change, and whether early intervention now (in 
year 1.5) leads to better outcomes down the line.

4.4 Implications for research

The current research, while rapid and informative, also has gaps. 
Notably,  more  research  is  needed  on  interventions  –  virtually  all 
studies  we  reviewed  were  observational.  There  is  a  need  for 
randomized controlled trials or implementation studies of mental 
health  programs  in  the  post-quake  context  (e.g.,  testing  trauma-
focused  therapy  vs.  general  supportive  counseling,  or  evaluating 
school-based interventions for youth). Additionally, future research 
should examine children/adolescents and older adults specifically, as 
their needs might differ. The role of culture and religion in coping with 
disaster trauma is another fruitful area (some evidence in our review 
suggests high reliance on community/religious coping, which could 
be harnessed in treatment). Another research implication is exploring 
CPTSD (CPTSD) – which ICD-11 distinguishes from PTSD. Some 
survivors with prolonged trauma and loss might fit CPTSD (which 
includes disturbances in self-organization like emotion dysregulation). 
Alpay et al. (25) hinted at investigating CPTSD correlates but focused 
on PTSD. Understanding how many CPTSD vs. PTSD have might 

refine treatment, as CPTSD often needs longer therapy addressing 
interpersonal issues (61).

Finally,  our  review  underscores  that  mental  health  must  be  a 
central  component  of  disaster  response.  In  large-scale  disasters, 
tending  to  survivors’  psychological  well-being  is  as  important  as 
addressing  physical  health  and 
infrastructure.  The  Turkish 
government and national/international aid organizations did deploy 
psychosocial  support  teams  after  the  quake,  but  given  the  high 
prevalence found, it’s likely that those resources were still insufficient 
or did not reach everyone in need. The findings can advocate for 
bolstering such services and ensuring they are integrated into disaster 
recovery plans.

5 Conclusion

In conclusion, the 2023 Kahramanmaraş earthquakes have had a 
devastating psychological impact on adult survivors in Türkiye. Our 
systematic review finds that roughly 40–50% of survivors experienced 
PTSD in the first 1.5 year, and a similarly large fraction suffered from 
depression and anxiety symptoms. Many are dealing with multiple 
overlapping mental health issues as they cope with the aftermath. 
These prevalence rates are among the highest observed in disaster-
affected populations, reflecting the enormous scale and trauma of this 
catastrophe. Importantly, these problems have not quickly remitted; 
significant proportions of survivors continue to struggle up to a year 
later,  especially  those  who  lost  homes  and  loved  ones  and 
remain displaced.

Predictably, those with the greatest trauma exposure and losses are 
the most psychologically affected, and female and younger survivors 
appear at elevated risk. On the positive side, strong social support and 
individual resilience seem to buffer some survivors, suggesting avenues 
for intervention. There is an urgent need for ongoing mental health 
support  services,  including  trauma-focused  counseling,  community 
outreach, and social support strengthening, to prevent chronic PTSD, 
depression, and anxiety in this population. As reconstruction of buildings 
and  infrastructure  progresses,  an  equal  investment  is  needed  in 
“reconstructing” the mental health of the affected communities. Early 
identification of high-risk individuals and providing accessible, culturally 
attuned care can mitigate long-term psychiatric morbidity. The lessons 
learned from this disaster – that psychological recovery can lag behind 
physical  recovery  and  requires  sustained  attention  –  should  inform 
disaster response planning in Türkiye and globally.

Ultimately, healing from an earthquake is not only about rebuilding 
cities, but also about helping people rebuild their lives and mental well-
being. The findings of this review demand that mental health be at the 
forefront  of  disaster  recovery  efforts.  By  addressing  the  PTSD, 
depression, and anxiety rampant among survivors, we can support the 
resilience  and  recovery  of  individuals,  families,  and  communities 
devastated by the Kahramanmaraş earthquakes. Continued research 
and intervention will be critical to ensure that the “invisible wounds” of 
this disaster are not forgotten even as the visible rubble is cleared.
