How to measure mental illness 
stigma at work: development and 
validation of the workplace mental 
illness stigma scale

Introduction:  The  study  objective  was  to  design  a  new  theoretically  driven 
multidimensional scale for the use in the empirical measurement of stigmatizing 
attitudes towards persons with mental illness within the return-to-work process 
as  this  integral  part  of  vocational  reintegration  has  been  widely  neglected  by 
scholars so far.

Methods:  Therefore,  we  developed  and  validated  a  21-item  instrument  to 
comprehensively measure the three-factorial structure of stigmatizing attitudes 
(affect, cognition, behavior) across two studies (overall N = 251).

Results: In both studies the new scale proved to be highly internally consistent, and 
its proposed three-factor structure was equally supported across the two studies. 
Convergent and discriminant validity were demonstrated by moderate and high 
correlations or zero correlations with pertinent measures. Furthermore, construct 
validity of the new scale was supported by significant positive associations with 
relevant personality characteristics within stigma research.

Discussion: The WMISS is the first instrument to measure mental health stigma 
specifically  within  the  return-to-work-process  and  demonstrates  strong 
psychometric  properties.  Inclusion  of  this  scale  in  future  research  can  help 
facilitate understanding of mental illness stigma within the occupational sector 
and assist with targeted intervention development.

Mental illness stigma in the workplace

One  of  the  most  challenged  societal  sectors  with  respect  to  mental  disorders  and  its 
stigmatization is the professional and working life. Specifically, the average level of sick leave due 
to a mental health problem amounts to 30 days per year in Germany, whereas diseases of the 
muscular-skeletal system entail about 18 days of incapacity to work (1). Moreover, since the 
1990s the days of sick leave due to a physical illness have declined, while sickness absence and 
early retirements as a result of mental ill-health have continuously grown in Germany, a trend, 
which is also globally observable (2–4). These figures are especially worrisome since work plays 
an integral part in our lives. Gainful employment provides a daily routine, meaningful tasks and 
boosts self-confidence and enhances quality of life. Thus, work conveys a sense of self-worth and 
fosters societal integration and support (5). It contributes to economic prosperity, but also to 
personal and social fulfillment. Besides, work itself functions as a major source of mental health 
and is a socially integrating determinant which is highly valued. In addition, maintaining or 
returning to employment can be a key stepping-stone in the recovery process of employees who

have suffered from poor mental health [e.g., (6–8)]. Precisely in such 
cases, it is of preeminent importance to ensure a safe and conducive 
working  environment  for  people  with  mental  health  issues  which 
promotes  a  considerate  reintegration  into  the  workforce.  But 
unfortunately,  mental  health  consumers  still  face  a  wide  range  of 
employment  barriers  and  stigmatization  as  well  as  potential 
harassment within the workplace (9, 10). Past research has shown that 
unemployment rates among severely mentally ill individuals remain 
inordinately  high,  typically  between  80  and  90%  [e.g.,  (11–14)]. 
Concerns about the employability of individuals with mental illness 
were  shown  among  the  general  population,  as  well  as  on  the 
managerial and employee level (15).

In fact, a decent body of research on recruitment and employment 
of mental health consumers already exists: In a mixed methods design, 
Biggs  et  al.  (16)  reported,  that  while  employment  agencies  would 
consider putting forward individuals with a mental health condition 
to employers, managers had reservations about hiring them due to 
mistrust  and  need  of  supervision.  Surveys  of  US  employers 
demonstrated that half of them were hesitant to hire someone with 
past  psychiatric  history  or  currently  undergoing  treatment  for 
depression, with rates of reluctance to hire someone being even higher 
when the employee was said to have a history of substance abuse (17). 
In  a  nationwide  interview-based  assessment  of  mental  health 
consumers  in  the  United  States  concerning  their  experiences  of 
stigmatization, Wahl (18) revealed that approximately one in three 
consumers  had  been  turned  down  for  a  job  for  which  they  were 
qualified after their mental illness diagnosis was disclosed. This is 
concordant with recent results yielded from a field experiment, in 
which  fictious  applicants  indicating  a  history  of  mental  disorder 
received fewer callbacks than candidates with a history of physical 
injury (19). Compared to applicants with a physical condition, (20) 
showed  that  aspirants  with  a  label  of  a  depression  disorder,  had 
significantly less prospects of employment. Human resource managers 
responded notably biased for executive positions, 58% stating they 
would never employ someone with a diagnosis of depression for an 
executive job, compared to only 3% for a similar job candidate with 
diabetes.  This  stigmatization  was  grounded  on  the  assumption  of 
potential impaired work performance, rather than expectations of 
future absenteeism (20). Similar findings emanated from focus group 
interviews with 16 individuals with varying mental illnesses, showing 
that nearly all the participants concluded that their mental health 
condition  had  cost  them  previous  job  opportunities  (21).  Thus, 
disclosure of a mental illness in the labor market seems to cause direct 
detriment  to  the  career  possibilities  of  mental  health  patients, 
undermining 
jeopardizing  career 
advancement (22, 23). Mental health consumers often prefer keeping 
their  condition  a  secret,  justifying  long  absences  from  work  with 
fictional or fake diagnoses (24). Accordingly, they cannot then request 
rightful workplace accommodations which would ease their transition 
into the labor market and grant effective treatment.

their  employability  and 

But what happens when employees return to their workplace after 
a mental health diagnosis? Little attention has been paid to the return-
to-work process of employees with mental disorders compared to 
people with physical disabilities (25). Yet, it seems that it is as difficult 
staying in the workforce as it is entering the labor pool, since mentally 
ill workers are confronted with a wide range of challenges and stigma, 
underemployment  as  being  among  the  most  pervasive  obstacles. 
Underemployment refers to a situation in which individuals are forced 
to  work  in  jobs  inferior  to  their  skills  and  qualifications  or  below 

adequate wages. Statistics indicate that 68% of workers with a mental 
health problem return to positions with reduced responsibility, work 
fewer hours and are paid less than before (26, 27). The annual income 
of  employees  with  a  depressive  disorder  is  even  decreased  by 
approximately  10%  compared  to  unaffected  individuals  (28). 
Additionally,  mentally  ill  employees  encounter  interpersonal  and 
social difficulties and discrimination, both at collegial and at executive 
level.  They  report  about  little  or  no  psychosocial  support  and 
enhanced supervision (18, 24). Often, workers with a mental health 
condition become marginalized and targets for critical or negative 
remarks  from  workmates  who  had  been  previously  helpful  and 
accommodating (18, 24, 29).

Stereotypic beliefs about co-workers with mental health issues 
also  influence  attitudes  about  their  performance  capabilities  and 
personality traits. Employees with depression and bipolar disorder 
were perceived to be low in warmth and competence, whereas workers 
with  anxiety  disorder  were  perceived  as  low  in  competence  (30). 
Concerns about safety, incompetence and social compatibility with 
other co-workers were similarly identified as barriers to hiring and 
working with people with a mental health condition in a more recent 
interview-based study with employers and co-workers (31). These 
findings,  too,  dovetail  well  with  qualitative  research  in  the 
manifestations of stigma in the labor force. To that end, Russinova 
et  al.  (32)  compiled  an  extensive  taxonomy  of  prejudicial  and 
discriminatory practices at the workplace gathered from a national 
sample  of  individuals  with  serious  mental  illnesses.  Qualitative 
analyzes generated a continuum of more subtle to more blatant, but 
also  anticipated,  forms  of  psychiatric 
illness  stigmatization 
experienced by mental health consumers that could be divided into 
two contextual domains: work performance and collegial interactions. 
Stigmatizing actions toward individuals with psychiatric conditions 
which do not aim at their work performance or job duties, but rather 
are enacted on an interactional-collegial level, appearing as similar to 
incivility, are especially toxic, since they erode one’s sense of identity 
and  impede  the  integration  into  the  social  fabric  of  the  working 
environment (33).

Further, stereotypic conceptions also affect how co-workers and 
employers feel about employees with mental illnesses. In a vignette-
based study, participants who viewed the employee as responsible for 
his mental health condition, reacted to him in an angry way resulting 
in lesser approval of supported employment (34). Oftentimes, negative 
cognitions  and  feelings  toward  employees  with  a  mental  health 
condition precipitate discriminatory action. For example, feelings of 
fear  toward  individuals  with  mental  illness  predicted  avoidance 
behaviors and stereotypic assumptions predicted work-related social 
distancing intentions (30, 34). These findings are consonant with data 
maintained from the United States Equal Employment Opportunity 
Commission (EEOC), supporting instances of formal and informal 
discrimination toward this employment population.

A review of charges filed under the Americans with Disabilities 
Act (ADA) found that the percentage of charges citing a psychiatric 
disability has increased over the period of 2005–2014 (10). Among 
these cases, harassment is cited more often on charges mentioning a 
psychiatric disability (22% of charges) as compared to ADA charges 
overall during this period (15%), highlighting that one of the most 
prominent  conflict  areas,  which  employees  with  a  mental  health 
condition  encounter,  are  interpersonal-related  stress  factors  with 
colleagues. Case studies of ADA charges revealed disability-specific 
mistreatment, such as being mandated to share information about a

disability  status  beyond  what  is  required  for  an  accommodation 
request as well as enduring attempts of marginalization and isolation 
by taking away clients or setting meetings when the individual was 
unable to attend as well as references to their psychiatric disability in 
a disparaging and ridiculing manner (10). Also, job accommodations 
supporting employees with mental ill-health can be met by negative 
affective reactions from co-workers, perceiving the situation as unfair 
to themselves (35). Equally an expert study consulting mental illness-
related labor and advocacy groups revealed that only 26.2% of experts 
indicated that employees could speak openly about mental health 
issues, and 81.5% of experts agreed that a large or medium unmet 
need for support for employees with mental health issues exists (36).
Taken together, it shows that employer and coworker attitudes are 
vital for beneficial workplace experiences for these employees and the 
success of reintegration programs, both the extent to which mentally 
ill employees are accepted into the occupational life as well as the 
extent to which equitable workplace accommodations are provided. 
Also,  because  mental  health  issues  are  one  of  the  most  common 
disabilities,  it  is  essential  to  create  a  welcoming  and  inclusive 
workplace culture that may positively impact all employees, not just 
the  ones  with  disabilities.  Addressing  negative  attitudes  and 
misconceptions about mental illnesses in the working environment 
would  be  the  first  step  to  foster  successful  mental  illness  literacy 
among the work force and establish an encouraging climate. In that 
respect,  Corbiere  et  al.  (37)  classified  presence  of  supportive 
colleagues, peer support networks, increased communication between 
the union and employees, and regular contact between employees and 
their company during sick leave as imperative elements for building 
an organizational culture supportive of successful return to work.

In light of the personal and economical costs to both organizations 
and  individuals  as  well  as  the  high  prevalence  of  mental  diseases 
globally, it is important that employees who are sick listed with mental 
health problems are facilitated in their return to work. In order to 
design valuable and tailor-made interventions, it is necessary to gather 
a better understanding of the reintegration process of people with 
mental health issues. Work-related stress factors such as mental illness 
stigmatization in the workplace might be especially deleterious within 
this crucial transitional process. To our knowledge, no instruments 
are available that capture mental illness stigma regarding the return-
to-work process of employees with mental health problems. However, 
a measure that addresses and highlights stigmatizing attitudes toward 
people with mental health problems upon returning to work is not 
only  relevant  for  empirical  research  but  also  of  great  use  for  the 
evaluation of the effects of workplace intervention programs.

Mechanisms of stigma and assessment 
of stigma

The process of stigmatization itself is closely intertwined with the 
tripartite view of attitudinal research. In that sense attitude structures 
contain  cognitive,  affective,  and  behavioral  components  (38,  39). 
Stigmatizing attitudes are likewise in line with this affective-cognitive-
behavioral 
from  social-psychological 
conceptualizations and therefore encompass stereotypes, prejudices, 
and  discrimination.  Stereotypes  are  global  cognitive  knowledge 
representations,  which  consist  of  unfavorable  and  adverse 
assumptions, evaluations and opinions about a certain social group 

framework  originating 

and are collectively applied to individuals of that group of people (40). 
These  cognitive  correlates  of  stigmatization  usually 
involve 
characterizations  of  incompetence,  dangerousness  and  weakness 
concerning one group compared to another. Prejudices, however, are 
defined  as  the  negative  emotional  reactions  toward  certain  social 
groups and their members resulting from stigmatizing attitudes. The 
negative  affective  responses  can  range  from  pity  to  fear  up  to 
annoyance and anger regarding the stigmatized group. They, in turn, 
can lead to patronizing, hostile and avoidant behavior toward this 
group of people, which is the discriminatory aspect of stigmatizing 
processes. Discriminatory practices comprise a broad spectrum of 
disadvantaging behavioral actions, such as differential treatment of 
one group relative to another by withholding assistance and support 
toward the stigmatized group and, in the worst case, restricting them 
from life opportunities and rights. Further, the existence of power 
imbalance  plays  a  paramount  role  in  situations,  in  which 
stigmatization occurs. Thus, social, economic, and political power is 
necessary to stigmatize putative deviant members of a society (41). 
Stigmatization, hence, involves the confluence of different interrelated 
dimensions - stereotype, prejudice, and discrimination–but also the 
occurrence of power inequality which allows stigmatizing attitudes to 
be applied and acted upon. It is important to identify and understand 
these  different  core  features  of  public  stigma  to  effectively  design 
targeted empirical research and plan specific interventions for stigma 
reduction campaigns.

However, assessment of mental illness stigma is heterogenous in 
measurements  as  well  as  in  theoretical  underpinnings  and  has 
mostly centered around attitudes of the general population toward 
individuals with mental health issues in general. One of the first 
scales  was  the  Opinions  about  Mental  Illness  (OMI)  scale  (42), 
developed  further  by  Taylor  and  Dear  (43),  resulting  in  the 
Community  Attitudes  to  Mental  Illness  Inventory  (CAMI).  The 
CAMI measures attitudes in the general public and encompasses 40 
items covering four sub-scales on authoritarianism, benevolence, 
social  restrictiveness  and  community  mental  health  ideology. 
Psychometric analyzes yielded adequate results in various samples 
in the United States and Canada. The inventory has been widely 
employed and translated into several languages, including Spanish, 
Italian, and German (44–46). Most of the questionnaires in stigma 
research incorporate common cognitive statements and opinions 
about mental illnesses in general, either gaged through personal or 
perceived stigma in society [e.g. (47–49),]. As a result, emotional and 
affective responses of the stigmatizer toward individuals with mental 
health issues are currently underassessed in stigma research (50). 
The  Emotional  Reaction  to  Mental  Illness  Scale  developed  by 
Angermeyer  and  Matschinger  (51)  is  one  of  few  scales  which 
explicitly assesses affective reactions toward persons with mental 
illnesses,  utilizing  two  vignette  descriptions,  one  depicting 
schizophrenia  and  the  other  major  depression.  The  final  version 
contains four items of the three dimensions aggressive emotions 
(e.g., anger, irritation), prosocial reactions (desire to help, sympathy) 
and feelings of anxiety (uneasiness, fear). Link (52) constructed a 
12-items  questionnaire  which  determines 
the  respondent’s 
perceptions of what most other people believe regarding devaluation 
and  discrimination  of  people  with  mental  illnesses  in  job, 
friendships, and romantic relationships. The scale has been mainly 
administered among people with mental health issues but can also 
be applied in other populations. The 9-item short form of the AQ-27,

the Attribution Questionnaire (AQ-27), was created by Corrigan 
et al. (53) by extracting 9 items from the AQ-27 with the highest 
factor loadings measuring the domains of blame, anger, pity, help, 
dangerousness, fear, avoidance, segregation, and coercion. In a series 
of studies Griffiths and her colleagues generated measurements for 
stigma  concerning  depression  and  general  anxiety  disorders, 
identifying statements specific to stigmatizing beliefs about these 
illnesses (54, 55). The Prejudice toward People with Mental Illness 
Scale (PPMI), in turn, focuses on the concept of prejudice as an 
antecedent of discriminatory behavior and pinpoints four underlying 
factors: 
fear/avoidance,  malevolence,  authoritarianism,  and 
unpredictability  (56).  As  the  only  instrument  to  date  to  assess 
microaggressions perpetrated toward persons with mental illness, 
the mental illness microaggressions scale (MIMS-P) comprises 17 
items  resulting  in  three  sub-scales,  referring  to  Assumption  of 
Inferiority, Patronization and Fear of Mental Illness (57). Behavioral 
inclinations toward people with mental illness have most commonly 
been determined by using measures of social distance, which assess 
a respondent’s desire to interact with a target person in different 
forms of relationships [e.g., (30, 58); Link et al., 1999 (59)]. The vast 
majority of measures assessing mental health stigma represent global 
opinions about mental illnesses and do not cover specific life areas 
or social situations, such as the professional and occupational sector. 
An instrument to assess attitudes toward individuals with disabilities 
in the workplace was developed by Popovich et al. (60) consisting of 
scales regarding beliefs about what constitutes a disability, affective 
reactions to working with individuals with disabilities and opinions 
about the reasonableness of common workplace accommodations. 
The Workplace Inclusion Questionnaire (WIQ) specifically addresses 
attitudes regarding workplace inclusion which vary across different 
case 
individuals  with 
musculoskeletal and mental disorders (61). Taken together, most 
stigma  measures  focus  on  a  general  stigmatization  context, 
underrepresent specific mental disorders and lack of the affective 
component underlying the attitudinal framework.

The present study

This research focuses on the multifaceted and multidimensional 
elements  of  mental  illness  stigma  in  the  workplace.  We  want  to 
provide a comprehensive examination of the various components that 
comprise  stigma  by  creating  a  targeted  multidimensional  mental 
illness stigma scale in the workplace. To eliminate disadvantages and 
social misconceptions about individuals with mental ill-health in the 
vocational reintegration process, we must first have a clear picture of 
the structure and substance of stigmatizing attitudes toward people 
with mental health issues. Thus, the aim of this study was to close the 
aforementioned gap in workplace stigmatization research concerning 
the  return-to-work  process  as  well  as  to  develop  and  validate  a 
measure referring to mental illness stigma in the workplace within the 
cognitive-affective-behavioral scheme, assessing emotional reactions, 
cognitive  structures  and  behavioral  consequences,  all  resulting  in 
stigmatizing attitudes. To that end, two studies were conducted: Study 
1 focused on the measurement development including item generation 
and analyzes as well as exploratory factor and validity analyzes, Study 
2  utilized  confirmatory  factor  analysis  to  evaluate  the  fit  of  the 
measures and expand the knowledge on validity of the new scale.

Study 1: item generation and content 
validation

Based  on  the  three-pronged  approach  within  the  attitudinal 
framework and aiming to meet the requirement of multidimensionality 
as recommended by Antonak and Livneh (2000)  (62) as well as in 
concordance with the multidimensional attitudes scale toward persons 
with disabilities (63), we represented each of the three dimensions of 
stigmatizing attitudes separately. Furthermore, in the development of 
our  questionnaire,  we  incorporated  items  from  established  scales 
measuring different aspects of workplace attitudes toward various 
employment populations as well as items employed within mental 
health stigma research in order to generate an exhaustive image of 
workplace attitudes regarding mentally ill employees. This resulted in 
an initial item pool of 83 items.

Methods

Participants

Data of N = 104 could be collected. Respondents ranged in age 
between 18 and 61, with an average age of 24.44 years (SD = 7.09). 
Over 60% of the participants were female and 55.7% had completed 
general qualification for university entrance. One participant did not 
state their age, and two respondents did not state their exposure to 
mental  illness.  Exclusion  of  these  data  was  refrained  from,  as  a 
systematic bias was not to be expected. With over 62%, the majority 
of the participants were college students. Overall, 72% reported they 
had experiences with mental illness.

Vignettes

The  three  subscales  were  preceded  by  a  vignette  depicting  a 
scenario in the working environment to have participants project their 
own feelings, thoughts, and behavioral intentions onto the indicated 
situation.  Vignette-design  studies  are  one  of  the  most  common 
methodological techniques in stigma research and show wide-ranging 
applicability (50). Using this approach, we intended to provide an 
elaborate stimulus to the respondents by painting a concrete real-life 
scenario at work which could evoke different responses. The vignette 
described the mental health condition of a female co-worker, who was 
either suffering from a major depression disorder or a general anxiety 
disorder. Symptoms were outlined, which met the criteria of a general 
anxiety disorder or major depression disorder and could be observed 
in the workplace setting prior to the absence of the co-worker due to 
her mental illness. At the end of the vignette, the female co-worker 
returns to work after her eight-week sickness leave and discloses her 
mental illness to a colleague (see Appendix A). The decision fell on 
these  two  disorders,  as  they  show  the  highest  prevalence  in  the 
working population as well as lead to long periods of illness with 
subsequent reintegration to employment (2, 64). The portrayal of a 
female  co-worker  in  the  vignette  was  designed  to  control 
stigmatization due to gender and is in accordance with data indicating 
an overrepresentation of the female population regarding the elected 
mental health conditions (1).

Affects subscale

As there is a paucity of measures assessing emotional responses 
within mental illness stigma research, we conducted a comprehensive 

Frontiers in Psychiatry

04

Matousian and Otto 

10.3389/fpsyt.2023.1225838

literature search in order to depict the affective component of our scale 
as  thoroughly  and  broadly  as  possible.  As  a  result,  39  items  were 
originally framed for the affective subscale, encapsulating positive and 
negative prejudicial attitudes. The items originated mainly from the 
circumplex model of affect (65) as well as the Positive and Negative 
Affect Schedule (66) and were additionally complemented by affective 
adverbs deemed relevant to the workplace setting by an expert group 
consisting of three other researchers in the field of IO psychology. The 
choice fell on these two questionnaires since they map prototypical 
emotions  and  affective  states  and  are  both  reliable  and  validated 
measures  as  well  as  have  been  widely  employed.  The  circumplex 
model  (65)  pictures  the  structure  of  affective  experience  on  two 
bipolar axes, one ranging from pleasure to unpleasure, characterized 
as valency, and the other from activation to deactivation, defined as 
arousal, which together describe each elementary affective condition. 
Emotions derived from the circumplex model of affect included, inter 
alia, anger, irritability, tension, fatigue, and calmness. The PANAS (66) 
encompasses  a  two-factorial  structure  resulting  in  positive  and 
negative  affectivity.  Further  items  taken  from  the  PANAS  scale 
delineated  hostility,  determination, 
excitement. 
Supplementary  items  considered  to  be  important  to  the  study  of 
stigmatizing attitudes toward individuals with mental illness in the 
workplace were discussed and assessed within the expert panel and 
finally added to the subscale. All affective items chosen were selected 
to be uniformly distributed around the dimensions of valency and 
arousal, referring to the circumplex model. German versions of the 
questionnaires were used (67). Following the vignette, the respondents 
were presented with the open sentence “In such a situation, I feel… 
(e.g., disturbed).” Afterwards they were asked to gage the likelihood of 
each emotion they experiencing in a situation as described in the 
vignette on a five-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (very unlikely) to 
5 (very likely). To obtain a spontaneous and intuitive response from 
the participants, we decided to present the emotional items as adverbs 
and not as nouns.

fear,  and 

Cognitions subscale

Since attitudinal measurements of occupational aspects regarding 
mentally ill employees are sparse, the cognitive dimension of attitude 
was drawn primarily from five different questionnaires and studies 
assessing work-related attitudes toward various employment groups 
(e.g.,  toward  older  workers)  resulting  in  27  items,  forming  the 
cognitive component of our scale. Via an expert panel suitable items 
from each questionnaire used were thoroughly discussed and selected 
for our cognitive sub-scale. Other items were excluded due to their 
redundancy. If necessary, items were translated into German via back-
translation technique and rephrased to relate to our specific return-
to-work context of mentally ill employees. Correspondingly, 14 items 
from the “Attitudes toward older workers” scale by Kluge and Krings 
(68) were chosen, further six items were derived from a survey by 
Popovich et al. (60), which assessed attitudes toward individuals with 
physical and mental disabilities in the workplace and four items were 
drawn from a list of character traits and job skills regarding female and 
male applicants from a study by Steffens and Mehl (69). Cognitive 
statements extracted from these questionnaires and surveys determine 
opinions and beliefs toward specific employment populations about 
their performance abilities, adaptive capacities as well as social skills 
in the working environment which we regarded equally important 
when assessing work-related attitudes toward individuals with mental 

illness in the return-to-work process. Finally, two items originated 
from mental health surveys about general attitudes toward mentally 
ill people, which were transferred to the professional context of our 
scale (48, 70). The final sub-scale records work-related cognitions 
toward  mentally  ill  co-workers  concerning  their  professional  and 
social competence as well as performance. Following the emotions 
sub-scale, participants were presented with the open sentence “Mrs 
M.  …  (e.g.,  needs  more  assistance  than  other  colleagues)”  and  the 
subsequent  27  cognitive  statements  referring  to  the  mentally  ill 
co-worker described in the vignette. Respondents were asked to rate 
the likelihood of each cognition that might occur to themselves in a 
situation depicted in the vignette on a five-point Likert-scale ranging 
from 1 (very unlikely) to 5 (very likely).

Behaviors subscale

The  behavioral  subscale  follows  the  train  of  thought  of  social 
distance by Bogardus (71). The social distance approach assesses a 
respondent’s readiness to engage in various types of relationships with 
a target person with items differing in the closeness of the association 
a respondent is asked to self-disclose. This concept has been a staple 
in  social  science  research  and  has  been  adapted  to  different 
frameworks as well as target groups. Consequently, five items referred 
to the social distance conceptualization and were modified to fit the 
context  of  vocational  reintegration.  In  addition,  seven  items  were 
obtained from the aforementioned survey by Popovich et al. (60) as 
well as further two items from the questionnaire by Kluge and Krings 
(68). If necessary, items were back-translated and adjusted to suit our 
scale. Furthermore, three items were newly formulated to amplify the 
assessment  of  prosocial  and  approach  behavior  to  attain  a  more 
complete picture of the behavioral possibilities. Thus, the behaviors 
subscale comprised originally 17 items tapping into various social 
interactions  as  well  as  prosocial  intentions  within  the  workplace 
environment. Following the cognitions subscale, participants were 
presented with the open sentence “I would … (e.g., take a job where 
I  would  have  to  work  closely  with  her)”  and  the  subsequent  17 
behavioral options the respondents could choose to show or decline 
toward the mentally ill co-worker described in the vignette on a five-
point Likert-scale ranging from 1 (very unlikely) to 5 (very likely).

Procedure

The study received ethical approval of the ethics committee of the 
authors’ university. The questionnaire was developed as an online tool 
via SoSci Survey to reach as many people as possible (72). Participants 
were recruited by a mailing list of a German university and through 
the snowball technique. First participants read a short cover story 
stating that the study was about improving working conditions to get 
as many unbiased and authentic answers as possible. After respondents 
had  given  their  informed  consent  to  participate  and  had  read  the 
technical  explanation  of  the  procedure,  they  completed  the 
questionnaire.  Afterwards,  a  full  disclosure  of  the  true  research 
interest of the questionnaire was provided.

Other measures and their hypothesized 
relationships with the new scale

To evaluate the construct validity of a new measure, ideally its 
relationship with an already exiting measure of the construct should

be determined. In the absence of the latter, we explored the association 
between our new scale and a general stigma scale regarding mental 
illness to investigate the convergent validity of the new instrument. As 
to discriminant validity, it was expected that the new scale would not 
be correlated with socially desirable responding, a construct presumed 
to be unrelated to stigmatizing attitudes toward mental illnesses (57). 
Since experience with mental illness as well as self-esteem have been 
consistently linked to stigma related to mental illness, we analyzed the 
relationship between the new measure and exposure to mental illness 
and  the  respondent’s  reported  self-esteem  indicating  its  criterion/
concurrent validity (40, 51, 73). The measures are outlined below.

Measures

Community attitudes to mental illness inventory

Taylor and Dear (43) employed the Opinions about Mental Illness 
as a conceptual basis for the development of the CAMI scale and 
reported  satisfactory  internal  reliability  for  their  measure.  The 
instrument includes 40 five-point Likert scaled items, resulting in the 
four sub-scales authoritarianism, benevolence, social restrictiveness, 
and community mental health ideology (e.g., “One of the main causes 
of mental illness is a lack of self-discipline and will-power”). Its major 
strength lies in its assessment of a broad range of generic attitudes 
toward mentally ill people as well as the exploration of opinions about 
mental  health  treatment  facilities.  The  current  study  utilized  the 
German version of the scale, which showed close correspondence 
between the German version and the original inventory with regards 
to socio-demographic measures as well as factor dimensionality (44). 
A  higher  score  on  this  scale  represents  a  greater  level  of  negative 
attitudes  toward  mentally  ill  people.  It  was  anticipated  that  there 
would be a positive correlation between the new measure and the 
CAMI. A significant relationship between the CAMI and the new 
scale would equally provide support for the convergent validity of our 
new scale. In the present sample alpha reliability was high, with a 
Cronbach’s alpha value of 0.92.

Balanced inventory of desirable responding

Social  desirability  bias  has  been  shown  to  be  operative  in  the 
assessment of stigma and of less acceptable as well as less normative 
societal attitudes, which in turn may restrict potential findings (50). 
Thus, it should be examined whether less stigmatization toward the 
mentally ill is a result of authentic positive attitudes toward mentally 
ill  people  or  whether  it  is  merely  an  effect  of  socially  desirable 
responding. To that end the 3-item 7-point Likert scaled Impression 
Management subscale of the original Balanced Inventory of Desirable 
Responding (74) in German (75) was administered to the participants 
of  the  current  study  (e.g.,  “I  received  too  much  change  from  a 
salesperson without telling him or her”). Winkler and his colleagues 
reported acceptable internal reliability as well as external validity for 
the subscales of the short version (75). It was hypothesized that there 
would be no significant associations between the new measure and the 
BIDR-Impression Management subscale since social desirability is 
assumed to be unrelated to attitudes toward mental illnesses (57). 
Streiner (76) argued that inter-item correlations should be considered, 
especially for short scales, because alpha depends on the length of the 
scale and the breadth of the measure. Clark and Watson (77) suggest 
that for scales measuring broad traits, an average inter-item correlation 

of at least 0.15 should be achieved. Note that the mean inter-item 
correlation was 0.27 for impression management in our sample.

Revised self-esteem scale

This 10-item German measure, using a 4-point Likert scale, was 
partially revised by Von Collani and Herzberg (78) and is based on 
Rosenberg’s Self-Esteem Scale (79). It determines a person’s global 
evaluation of his or her worthiness as a human being [e.g., “On the 
whole, I am satisfied with myself ”] and shows satisfactory internal 
reliability. The theoretical reasoning underlying the selection of self-
esteem as an indicator for the criterion validity of the new scale are the 
six levels of origins resulting in stigmatization by Haghighat (2001)  
(80). Accordingly, on a psychological level the process of stigmatization 
is based on social comparisons, which constitute our concept of self 
and others. By degrading others, especially minorities and seemingly 
societal deviators, those with low self-esteem can boost their own self-
confidence  and  well-being.  Hence,  the  presence  of  a  stigmatized 
person or someone who is less fortunate provides psychological gains 
for the stigmatizer. Indeed, low self-esteem has been repeatedly found 
to be associated with negative evaluations of people with disabilities 
(81, 82). Thus, an inverse association between self-esteem and negative 
attitudes  toward  individuals  with  mental  illness  was  expected. 
Respondents with higher scores on the self-esteem scale will tend to 
hold fewer negative attitudes toward people with mental disorders 
described in the vignette. In the present sample alpha reliability was 
high, with a Cronbach’s alpha value of 0.89.

Contact/experience with mental illnesses

Previous experience or exposure to mental illnesses (either due to 
own mental disorder or contact with mental illness due to personal, 
professional, or general circumstances) was measured by a single yes/
no/not  specified  item.  Intervention  research  has  illustrated  that 
contact  and  personal  experience  with  mental  disorders  helps 
mitigating  stigmatizing  processes  (83,  84).  Therefore,  it  was 
hypothesized that there would be a negative correlation between past 
exposure  to  mental  illness  and  stigmatizing  attitudes  toward 
individuals with a mental disorder described in the vignette.

Demographic characteristics

After completing the previous instruments, self-reported gender, 
age, years of education and current work situation were recorded. To 
control for acquiescence, participants were asked which topic they 
thought the study was actually about with a single item in an open 
answer format. For each demographic variable, respondents had the 
option of refusing to provide information by choosing “unstated.”

Results

Item selection and factor structure

Firstly, item discrimination indices were calculated to determine 
the  degree  of  differentiation  of  each  item  within  the  group  of 
respondents.  Following  conventional  recommendations,  we  only 
retained items with discrimination indices between 0.4 and 0.7 (85). 
In  a  second  step,  we  performed  a  Principal  Component  Analysis 
(PCA) with the remaining 48 items to assess the pattern of factor 
loadings and variance explained. The oblique rotation by means of the 
Promax method was employed on the premise that the factors are

assumed to correlate and as Promax rotation is the method of choice 
for oblique proceedings (86). Bartlett’s Test of Sphericity [χ2 = 3235.74, 
(df = 1,128),  p < 0.001]  and  a  Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin  value  of  0.86 
confirmed the suitability of examining the factor structure of the data. 
A cutoff value of 0.5 was applied to meet strict standards for adequate 
factor  loadings  for  each  of  the  items  as  well  as  content-related 
considerations regarding comprehensibility and redundancy of the 
items (87, 88). As we wanted to ensure that only parsimonious and 
functional  items  were  ultimately  included,  each  final  subscale 
consisted of a maximum of 10 items. Thus, factor loadings with the 
smallest loadings on the corresponding dimension were eliminated. 
Following this two-step analysis, the final questionnaire was shortened 
to 22 items, resulting in 7 items for the affective component, 10 items 
for the cognitions dimension and 5 items for the behavioral component.
In consonance with our theoretical attitudinal framework, the 
PCA yielded three distinct factors with an eigenvalue greater than 1, 
explaining 57.9% of the total variance. As can be seen in Table 1, all of 
the items of the emotion’s subscale can be located in the region of 
unpleasant deactivation to unpleasant activation, illustrating negative 
affectivity toward the mentally ill person described in the vignette. The 
10 items of the cognitive factor embody a wide range of evaluations of 
professional skills and competences and the 5 items of the behavioral 
component reflect distancing or approaching behavioral possibilities. 
All items loaded exclusively on only one of the three factors, except for 
one item of the behavioral subscale which also loaded on the cognitive 
dimension. Due to theoretical conceptualizations, we still allocated 
this item to the behavioral subscale (see Table 1). As expected, all three 
subscales  correlated  significantly  with  each  other,  indicating  one 
superordinate  factor,  that  is  stigmatizing  attitude.  The  strongest 
association was found between cognitions and behavior [r (102) = 0.63, 
p < 0.001], followed by a moderate correlation between cognitions and 
emotions [r (102) = 0.34, p < 0.001] and a small association between 
behavior and emotions [r (102) = 0.21, p < 0.05]. Consequently, the 
three  factors  appear  to  share  a  similar  foundation,  yet  each 
representing  different  dimensions  of  the  overarching  component 
stigmatizing  attitude.  The  22-item  scale  was  found  to  be  highly 
internally consistent, with a Cronbach’s alpha value of 0.91. Equally, 
although varying in their number of items, the three subscales showed 
high internal consistency: The Cronbach’s alphas for the Emotions 
subscale, the Cognitions subscale and the Behavioral subscale were 
0.89, 0.90 and 0.83, respectively. Descriptive statistics for each subscale 
and their correlations with the overall stigma scale are presented in 
Table 2.

Convergent and discriminant validity

As  hypothesized,  results  revealed  that  the  new  scale  was 
significantly correlated with the CAMI [r (102) = 0.47, p < 0.001]. 
Since the CAMI inventory assesses global evaluations about mental 
illnesses  and  the  new  scale  measures  specific  attitudes  toward 
mental illnesses within the return-to-work process, the association 
between the two scales is expectedly not particularly high, indicating 
that  the  new  instrument  determines  disparate  attitudes  of  those 
gaged  in  the  CAMI.  Significant  associations  emerged  from  the 
correlations between the cognitive subscale and the CAMI scale, [r 
(102) = 0.50, p < 0.001], as well as between the behavioral subscale 
and  the  CAMI  measure  [r  (102) = 0.51,  p < 0.001].  The  affective 
subscale  and  the  CAMI  scale  showed  no  significant  correlation, 
since  the  CAMI  focuses  on  cognitive  and  behavioral  tendencies 

toward  mentally  ill  people  rather  than  emotional  responses  [r 
(102) = 0.11, p = 0.266]. As for discriminant validity, no significant 
correlation  was  found  between  the  new  scale  and  the  social 
desirability  measure  BIDR-Impression  Management 
[r 
(102) = −0.06, p = 0.565] as well as between each of the subscales and 
the  BIDR-Impression  Management,  equally  supporting  our 
assumptions (see Table 2).

Criterion validity

In order to investigate criterion validity of the new measure, 
we  referenced  self-esteem  as  a  relevant  external  criterion.  As 
predicted,  self-esteem  was  found  to  correlate  significantly  and 
inversely with the new scale [r (102) = −0.203, p < 0.05]. Hence, the 
higher the respondent’s self-esteem, the more positive his or her 
attitudes were toward the person with a mental illness. As for the 
subscales, only the correlation between the affective subscale and the 
self-esteem scale reached significance [r (102) = −0.22, p < 0.05]. This 
can  be  due  to  the  circumstance  that  self-esteem  taps  into  self-
evaluations  about  the  feelings  concerning  one’s  global  self-
worth (89).

Associations between exposure/experience with 
mental illness and the new scale

Contrary to our assumptions, there were no significant differences 
between exposure/contact to mental illness (yes/no) and the overall 
stigma score [t (100) = 1.47, p = 0.144]. Equally, a one-way MANOVA 
found no statistically significant differences between exposure/contact 
to mental illness on the combined subscales, F (3, 98) = 1.63, p = 0.187, 
partial η2 = 0.05, Wilk’s Λ = 0.95. However, analyzes on a descriptive 
level  show  that  the  mean  values  indicate  a  tendency  toward  a 
negative association.

Associations between the new scale and 
sociodemographic variables

We  examined  the  relationship  between  basic  demographic 
characteristics and our new scale by computing Pearson and Spearman 
correlations for the continuous and ordinal variables (age and level of 
education) and t-tests analyzes for the dichotomous variable (gender). 
No significant association was found between age and the new scale, 
neither for the overall stigma scale [r (102) = −0.033, p = 0.742], nor 
for the three subscales. The analyzes between level of education and 
the new measure also rendered no significant correlations, neither for 
the overall stigma score, Spearman’s ρ = −0.106, p = 0.284, nor for the 
three subscales. As to gender, no significant differences were found 
between  women  and  men  on  the  overall  stigmatizing  scale,  [t 
(102) = −0.662, p = 0.403]. However, subscale analyzes elicited gender 
differences on the emotional subscale. Post-hoc univariate ANOVAs 
were  conducted  for  every  dependent  variable  after  a  one-way 
MANOVA showed a statistically significant difference between the 
gender  on  the  combined  dependent  variables,  F  (3,  100) = 4.87, 
p < 0.05,  partial  η2 = 0.13.  Results  demonstrated  a  statistically 
significant  difference  between  the  scores  of  the  female  and  male 
participants for the affective subscale, F (1, 102) = 7.23, p < 0.05, partial 
η2 = 0.07,  indicating  that  female  participants  responded  higher  in 
negative affectivity toward the mentally ill person in the vignette than 
male participants, but not for the other two subscales, cognitions, F 
(1, 102) = 0.01, p = 0.924, partial η2 = 0.00 and behavior F (1, 102) = 3.29, 
p = 0.073, partial η2 = 0.03.

Discussion

In this first study, we developed a multidimensional mental 
illness  stigma  questionnaire  in  the  workplace  based  on  the 
emotional-cognitive-behavioral framework within the attitudinal 
research. By means of item- and reliability analyzes as well as PCA 
the  original  item  pool  of  83  items  could  be  reduced  to  a 
parsimonious final set of 22 items. Equally the originally proposed 
three factor model could be demonstrated via exploratory factor 
analysis. Small to moderate intercorrelations between the subscales 
underpin the notion of a superordinate factor stigmatization. As 
for  convergent  validity,  bivariate  correlations  with  the  CAMI 
measure  further  support  our  new  questionnaire  and  show  its 
incremental validity beyond the established inventory, since it is 
specifically  tailored  to  capture  attitudes  within  the  workplace 
regarding mentally ill co-workers on the emotional, cognitive, and 
behavioral  level.  In  support  of  our  assumptions  concerning 
discriminant validity, there was no significant correlation between 
our new measure and its subscales and the social desirability scale. 
Regarding the criterion validity of our new scale, results show a 
significant inverse correlation between self-esteem and the overall 
stigma scale as well as the affective subscale.

differences between male and female participants were only found on 
subscale  level,  indicating  that  female  participants  showed  more 
negative affectivity toward the mentally ill co-worker described in the 
vignette than their male counterparts.

Study 2: replicating construct validity 
and criterion validity

In Study 2, we aimed to examine the consistency of the factors 
identified  in  the  previous  study  by  collecting  a  new  sample  and 
conducting Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) to evaluate the fit of 
our  new  measure.  Additionally,  in  order  to  replicate  and  extend 
convergent and criterion validity, we examined the relations of the 
new  stigma  questionnaire  with  other  relevant  measures  and 
personality traits.

Methods

Contrary to our assumptions, there was no significant association 
between exposure to mental illness and the stigma scale. This could

completed a university degree, 52.4% were employed. Overall, 79.6% 
reported having had experiences with mental illness, 42.9% described 
this contact or experience as partly positive and partly negative.

Procedure

First participants read a short cover story stating that the study 
was about improving working conditions to get as many unbiased and 
authentic  answers  as  possible.  After  respondents  had  given  their 
informed consent to participate and had read the technical explanation 
of the procedure, they completed the questionnaire. At the end of the 
study, the participants were fully debriefed and thanked.

Measures

Workplace mental illness stigma scale

Based on the results of the previous study, the WMISS contained 
the revised final questionnaire of 22 items, 7 items in the affective 
subscale, 10 items in the cognitive subscale and finally 5 items in the 
behavioral subscale.

Mental illness microaggressions scale

After assessing convergent validity with the CAMI in the previous 
study, we were interested in examining the association between our new 
scale and microaggression behaviors perpetrated toward persons with 
mental  illness.  Microaggressions  are  classified  as  subtler  forms  of 
discrimination  which  tend  to  be  implicit  prejudicial  manners  of 
communication. As there is no German scale available, we translated the 
MIMS-P (57) into German using the forward-backward procedure (e.g., 
“If someone I’m close to told me that they had a mental illness diagnosis, 
I would be careful in case they ‘snap’”). The MIMS-P contains 17 items, 
shows good internal consistency, and encompasses microaggression 
behaviors by three subscales (Assumption of Inferiority, Patronization, 
Fear of Mental Illness). A positive correlation between the new stigma 
scale  and  the  MIMS-P  was  expected.  In  our  current  study  alpha 
reliability was satisfying, with a Cronbach’s alpha value of 0.86.

tending to eschew uncertainty. The desire to reduce confusing and 
ambiguous information usually results in effort minimizing cognitive 
strategies,  i.e.,  employing  quickly  accessible  and  stereotypical 
information in judgment formation (90). Indeed, NFC has been linked 
to a large scope of racial and gender prejudices (91). The inclination 
to  utilize  the  most  readily  available  information  even  hinders  the 
likelihood of perspective taking when reading about a person with 
whom one is not identified with, as one’s own viewpoint is likely to 
be the most rapidly present (92). Accordingly, we proposed a positive 
relationship between the need for cognitive closure and stigmatization 
on the affective, cognitive, and behavioral level. The 16-items German 
Short Scale for Need for Cognitive Closure (e.g., “I do not like it when 
a  person’s  statement  is  ambiguous.”)  with  an  acceptable  internal 
consistency was used in the Study 2 (93). In our current sample alpha 
reliability was satisfying, with a Cronbach’s alpha value of 0.85.

Social Dominance Orientation (German Short 
Scale)

Social dominance orientation (SDO) refers to a belief system 
with a preference for inequality among social groups and hence a 
favoring  of  a  hierarchical  society  (94).  This  tendency  has  been 
associated  with  biased  attitudes  against  a  range  of  stigmatized 
targets, including minorities (95) and higher-weight individuals 
(96).  Consequently,  a  positive  relationship  between  social 
dominance  orientation  and  the  WMISS  was  expected.  Social 
dominance orientation was assessed by the 3-items German short 
scale KSDO-3 (e.g., “Every society needs groups that are at the top 
and  others  that  are  at  the  bottom.”)  which  shows  acceptable 
reliability  (97).  In  the  present  sample  alpha  reliability  was 
acceptable, with a Cronbach’s alpha value of 0.61.

Balanced inventory of desirable responding

With the intention of replicating and corroborating our findings 
of Study 1, socially desirable responding behavior was measured with 
the same Impression Management subscale of the BIDR as in Study 1. 
No  significant  correlation  was  hypothesized  for  the  relationship 
between socially desirable responding and the WMISS. The mean 
inter-item correlation of the impression management subscale was 
0.22 in our second study.

Contact/experience with mental illnesses and 
quality of contact

Previous experience or exposure to mental illnesses (either due to 
own mental disorder or contact with mental illness due to personal, 
professional, or general circumstances) was measured by a single yes/
no/not  specified  item.  Equally  a  single  item  for  the  assessment  of 
quality  of  contact  was  used,  participants  should  classify  their 
experienced  contact  as  positive,  negative,  or  partly  positive/
partly negative.

Results

Several fit indices were examined, including standardized root 
mean  square  residual  (SRMR),  the  standard  fit  index  (NFI),  the 
comparative  fit  index  (CFI)  and  the  root-mean-square  error  of 
approximation (RMSEA). Values of 0.90 or higher are indicators of 
good fit for the NFI and CFI; values between 0.05 to 0.09 are generally 
thought to be reasonable for the RMSEA; while values lower than 0.05 
indicate an acceptable fit for the SRMR (98).

The indices of the original model did not reach the benchmarks 
for  acceptable  fit:  χ2  (206) = 432.92,  p < 0.001,  SRMR = 0.11, 
NFI = 0.75, CFI = 0.85, RMSEA = 0.08. After careful consideration 
and theoretical reasoning, we referred to the modification indices 
and  added  five  pairs  of  error  covariances  (KG01,  KG02,  KG03, 
DI18, DI20, DI21, DI22), as they were reversely coded and within 
the  same  subscale.  The  overall  fit  improved:  χ2  (201) = 334.35, 
p < 0.001, SRMR = 0.11, NFI = 0.81, CFI = 0.91, RMSEA =0.07 (see 
Table 3).

TABLE 3  Fit indices for the workplace mental illness stigma scale in study 2.

Additionally, the 3-factor subscale structure with a superordinate 
factor proved to be superior in fit to a model that estimated only a 
single  undifferentiated  stigma  factor:  Δχ2  (8,  N = 147) = 688.19, 
p < 0.001,  SRMR = 0.22,  NFI = 0.41,  CFI = 0.46,  RMSEA = 0.16  (see 
Table 3). Moreover, all items loaded significantly and moderately to 
strongly on their respective factors.

Similar  to  Study  1,  the  22-items  scale  was  found  to  be  highly 
internally consistent, with a Cronbach’s alpha value of 0.89. Equally, the 
three subscales demonstrated high internal consistency: The Cronbach’s 
alphas for the Emotions subscale, the Cognitions subscale and the 
Behavioral subscale were 0.91, 0.84 and 0.84, respectively (see Table 4).

Correspondingly  all  subscales  showed  moderate  to  strong 
correlations  with  the  MIMS-P  (see  Table  4).  For  discriminant 
validity the relationship between the WMISS and socially desirable 
responding behavior was reassessed. As hypothesized, the new 
scale and its subscales did not show any significant relationship 
with the BIDR-Impression Management subscale, [r (145) = −0.09, 
p = 0.292]. All subscale correlations are shown in Table 4.

Criterion validity

The new measure was correlated with a set of personality variables 
in  order  to  further  examine  its  criterion  validity.  As  expected,  the 
WMISS correlated positively and significantly with the need for cognitive 
closure, [r (145) = 0.33, p < 0.01] and social dominance orientation, [r 
(145) = 0.24, p < 0.01]. For all subscale correlations see Table 4.

Associations between the WMISS and contact 
with mental illness/ quality of contact

Contrary to our expectations, a one-way ANOVA and a one-way 
MANOVA, respectively revealed no significant difference between the 
different groups of experienced contact or exposure to mental illness on 
the overall stigma scores, F(2, 144) = 0.13, p = 0.881, nor on the subscale 
scores, F(6, 284) = 0.21, p = 0.973. Likewise, quality of contact, as assessed 
in three categories (positive, negative, and partly positive, partly negative) 
neither affected significantly the overall stigma scores, F(3, 113) = 1.54, 
p = 0.208, nor the subscale scores, F(2, 270.30) = 1.07, p = 0.387.

Associations between the WMISS and 
sociodemographic variables

Similar to Study 1, no significant correlations were found between 
level of education and overall stigma scores or subscale scores. Also 
results showed no significant association between age and overall stigma 
scores and its subscale scores, except for the behavioral subscale, with a 
small positive correlation, Spearman’s ρ =0.17, p < 0.05. No significant 
difference emerged from the analysis of female and male participants 
regarding their overall stigma scores, t(145) = −1.53, p = 0.129, nor their 
subscale scores, F(3, 143) = 1.92, p = 0.129. With regards to occupational 
status, results showed no significant differences between employed and 
non-working participants for their overall stigma scores, t(142) = 1.13, 
p = 0.262, and for their subscale scores, F(3, 140) = 1.09, p = 0.358.

Discussion

Study  2  provides  further  evidence  for  the  proposed  factor 
structure of the WMISS. The CFA results substantiated Study 1 and 
supported the three-factor model with stigma being the superordinate 
factor in comparison to an undifferentiated one-factor model.

Additionally,  Study  2  yielded  further  support  for  the  new 
measure’s convergent and discriminant validity. The WMISS and its 
subscales correlated significantly and moderately to strongly with the 
MIMS-P. As in Study 1, the new measure and its subscales did not 
show  any  significant  relationship  with  the  BIDR-Impression 
Management subscale, corroborating its discriminant validity. Besides, 
findings  in  Study  2  were  in  line  with  the  new  scale’s  suggested 
association with additional relevant personality variables, indicating 
criterion validity. The WMISS correlated moderately and significantly 
with the need for cognitive closure and social dominance orientation.
As  to  contact  with  mental  illness  and  quality  of  contact  with 
mental  illness,  analysis  showed  no  significant  difference  in  the 
tendency of stigmatization. This is surprising, since contact theory 
states that positive contact leads to tolerance and acceptance between 
groups (99). Nonetheless it could be that level of contact and intimacy 
is equally as important, for it makes a difference whether one comes 
into contact with mental illness by a relative or by a stranger. No age 
and education differences were found, replicating findings from the 
previous study. Similarly, analyzes rendered no differences between 
the occupational status and stigmatization. However, also no gender 
differences  were  found  on  overall  and  subscale  level,  which  is 
contradictory to Study 1. Yet, this goes to show that gender differences 
concerning  stigmatization  need  to  be  researched  further,  since 
findings are heterogenous and incoherent.

Taken  together,  our  second  study  provided  support  for  the 
proposed  three-factor  model  as  well  as  for  the  convergent  and 

discriminant validity of the newly developed measure by looking at 
their correlations with conceptually similar as well as theoretically 
unrelated concepts. Still further research is needed to explore the new 
questionnaire’s predictive and incremental validity.

General discussion

In our present research we sought to devise a new multidimensional 
workplace stigmatization measure with sound theoretical foundations 
and reasonable psychometric properties. Derived from the affective-
cognitive-behavioral framework of attitude (39), we created, a priori, 
an instrument consisting of three dimensions, representing the overall 
common core of stigmatizing attitude. After item selection, the initial 
item pool of 83 items was reduced to a parsimonious set of 22 items. 
Statistical analyzes yielded small to moderate and strong correlations 
between  the  subscales,  revealing,  on  the  one  hand,  disparate  and 
separate components, and on the other hand, illustrating a mutual 
overarching factor. In both studies the new WMISS proved to be highly 
internally  consistent,  and  its  proposed  three-factor  structure  was 
equally supported across the two studies. More precisely, the three-
factor model with a superordinate construct showed a significantly 
better fit to the data than alternative models with an undifferentiated 
factor. Convergent and discriminant validity were demonstrated by 
moderate  and  high  correlations  (e.g.,  CAMI)  or  zero  correlations 
(BIDR) with pertinent measures. Furthermore, construct validity of 
the new scale was supported by significant positive associations with 
two personality characteristics, namely need for cognitive closure and 
social  dominance  orientation,  which  is  also  in  line  with  previous 
research, linking these personality traits to biased and discriminatory 
behavior (95). Moreover, inverse correlations between self-esteem and 
the WMISS were found for the overall stigma score as well as for the 
affective subscale, supporting the notion, that individuals with a lower 
self-esteem tend to hold more stigmatizing attitudes toward seemingly 
deviant people than individuals with a higher self-esteem (81, 82).

Surprisingly, neither self-reported exposure to mental illness nor 
the  quality  of  this  exposure  or  experience  seemed  to  impact 
stigmatization. However, several studies support the social contact 
hypothesis in reducing stigma against individuals with mental health 
issues by facilitating inter-group relations [e.g., (100, 101)]. In our 
study contact and quality of contact was measured by using a single 
“yes/no” or “negative/positive/partly positive, partly negative” item. It 
could  be  that  exposure  to  mental  illness  requires  a  more  detailed 
assessment of its form of social contact and experience, since it makes 
all the difference whether one experienced mental illness himself/
herself, through a relative or colleague. The level of contact report 
which lists 12 situations in which intimacy of contact with mental 
illness is varied could be a useful tool to expand knowledge in that 
regard and should be considered for future research (102).

Theoretical and practical implications

To  our  knowledge,  this  is  the  first  multidimensional  mental 
illness stigma scale which centers around the occupational setting 
and the return of mentally ill employers to their workplace. The 
newly  developed  WMISS  not  only  closes  a  remarkable  gap  in 
research on stigmatizing attitudes toward the mentally ill but also

offers promising prospects for workplace reintegration programs. 
Thus far, instruments on stigmatizing attitudes have neglected the 
multidimensional aspect of attitudinal conceptualizations and have 
mostly  focused  on  the  cognitive  and  behavioral  part  of 
stigmatization,  while  overlooking  the  affective  component  of 
stigmatizing  attitudes  (50).  However,  the  consideration  of  a 
multidimensional  approach  is  especially  crucial  when  studying 
attitudes  toward  mentally  ill  people  since  any  measure  will 
inevitably not reflect a comprehensive picture of attitudes when 
assessing only one or two dimensions of the attitudinal framework 
(39). As pointed out by Findler et al. (63) with regards to people 
with disabilities, this might even lead to false conclusions being 
drawn, when, for instance, only concentrating on discriminating 
behavioral actions, which are generally less likely to be admitted, 
while at the same time disregarding negative affective responses 
concerning mentally ill people and thus depicting a more favorable 
attitude toward them. Statistical support for the multidimensional 
perspective is also demonstrated, when evaluating the correlational 
analyzes between the CAMI and the subscales of the WMISS: The 
CAMI  questionnaire  captures  mostly  cognitive  and  behavioral 
elements of stigmatizing attitudes perpetrated against mentally ill 
individuals, hence only the cognitive and behavioral subscales of 
our new scale were found to be strongly associated with the CAMI, 
while the affective subscale showed no significant correlation with 
the latter. Besides most mental illness stigma measures were framed 
within  a  more  general  context  of  stigmatization,  which  could 
potentially result in less valuable implications when its outcomes 
are to be applied to a specific setting. This is especially important 
when it comes to outlining intervention strategies. A questionnaire 
which assesses stigmatizing attitudes within a specific life area can 
provide 
into  understanding 
marginalization and discrimination regarding a distinct context but 
might  also  function  as  a  helpful  tool  for  targeted  and  effective 
intervention  programs  and  their  subsequent  evaluation.  For 
example, mental disorder de-stigmatization campaigns within the 
occupational sector require a different modus operandi than broad-
based  anti-discrimination  initiatives,  as  employees  with  mental 
health issues face particular workplace barriers which oftentimes 
revolve  around  their  abilities,  stamina  and  social  skills  (10). 
Specifically,  the  WMISS  could  be  a  beneficial  instrument  in 
accompanying and evaluating occupational re-integration programs 
within  the  HR  sector  of  companies  in  order  to  support  job 
accommodations  for  people  with  mental  illness,  but  also  as  an 
initial  assessment  tool  for  capturing  attitudes  of  colleagues 
regarding  mental  illnesses  and  analyzing  mental  illness  literacy 
within an organization. Furthermore, most research to date in the 
field of mental illness stigma has concentrated on severe mental 
disorders, e.g., schizophrenia, substance abuse disorders [e.g., (11, 
12, 83)]. Yet, comparatively little attention has been paid to stigma 
surrounding depression and generalized anxiety disorder. This is 
especially  alarming  given  that  both  depression  and  generalized 
anxiety disorder are highly prevalent in the public, crippling in their 
consequences for those affected and cause long periods of illness 
and  lengthy  sickness-related  absences  from  work  (64).  Our 
instrument spotlights these two disorders and helps to identify how 
employees  with  a  depression  disorder  or  generalized  anxiety 
disorder are perceived and treated by their co-workers. This is a 
crucial  step  in  improving  the  quality  of  work  experiences  of 

insights  not  only 

fruitful 

mentally ill employees and refining interventions to create a more 
supportive and inclusive working environment.

Strengths, limitations, and future research

The findings of the two studies in this paper provide evidence for 
the new scale’s factor structure, internal consistency, convergent and 
discriminant validity as well as criterion validity. One of the major 
strengths of the present research is the theory-driven adoption of the 
multi-dimensional  perspective  of  stigmatizing  attitudes  and  its 
implementation by constructing a vast and extensive initial item pool 
of 83 items. In this context, particular consideration was given to the 
comprehensive composition of the affective dimension of the new scale, 
as stigma-related feelings have long been a missing component in the 
assessment of stigma-associated processes (50). Yet another strong point 
of our research lies in the new instrument’s validation by means of two 
different samples, which increases generalization of the results.

However, still further research is needed to establish the new scale 
as a sound measure for the assessment of mental illness stigma within 
the occupational setting. One of the primary limitations of the current 
study  is  the  relatively  small  sample  size  and  its  homogenous 
composition. Notably the sample comprised more women than men, 
higher educated participants than lower educated respondents and 
more younger participants than middle-aged or older respondents. In 
addition, in both studies over 70% of the participants reported having 
had exposure to mental illness. Besides, we only validated the German 
set of items of the WMISS. Future research should therefore further 
investigate  the  new  scale’s  psychometric  properties  in  different 
populations and in international samples.

Another potential shortcoming of our studies might be that both 
of our samples were collected via online tools which can unavoidably 
lead to self-selection processes, so that only participants with certain 
personality traits or those who have access to online panels would take 
part  in  the  studies.  Hence,  in  future  studies  various  formats  of 
recruitment should be considered to expand the representativeness of 
the research.

Finally, our instrument solely depends on the respondent’s self-
reports, resulting in a potential underestimation of the individual’s 
level of stigmatizing attitudes. In addition, it is important to note that 
vignette-based studies only depict hypothetical and abstract real-life 
situations, neglecting non-verbal cues and unconscious information 
processing through observable signals. Future research could address 
this drawback by combing non-vignette experimental studies with 
self-report  measures.  Thus,  the  additional  assessment  of  implicit 
measures, such as behavioral or physiological outcomes in real-life 
scenarios, will shed further light on the incremental and predictive 
validity of the WMISS. In fact, previous research has illustrated the 
significant association between explicit attitudinal evaluations and 
physical proximity with regards to mental health stigma (103).

A  possible  extension  of  our  research  may  also  lie  in  the 
development of vignettes for other mental illnesses as well as in the 
depiction of male employees with a mental health status to expand the 
scope of the WMISS for the workplace setting and to examine labeling 
effects between the different mental disorders and genders. Additional 
value for the new inventory could certainly also be generated through 
the  comparison  of  perceptions  and  experiences  of  mentally  ill 
employees concerning workplace stigmatization with our new scale as

well  as  their  potential  tendencies  of  self-stigmatization  within  the 
occupational context.

Conclusion

Our  newly  developed  multidimensional  WMISS  allows 
researchers and professionals to assess stigma associated with mental 
disorders within the working environment reliably and thoroughly 
based on the profound theoretical foundation of attitudinal research. 
The  results  obtained  in  the  two  studies  are  indicative  of  the 
instrument’s  factor  structure,  reliability,  and  validity.  Hence,  the 
WMISS is a promising measure for use in future studies in further 
exploring mental illness stigma in the occupational sector as well as 
designing  targeted  and  tailored  intervention  programs  aimed  at 
modifying attitudes regarding mental illnesses.
