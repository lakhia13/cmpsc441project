Abstract

Background: the complex and progressive nature of Parkinson’s disease (PD) and cognitive impairment may necessitate a
care provider, a role which is frequently undertaken by a spouse. Providing and receiving care related to dementia impacts
on a couple’s partnership and may result in decreased intimacy and relationship satisfaction.
Objective: to explore the changes in long-term intimate relationships in Parkinson’s-related dementia, as perceived by
spouses providing care to their partners.
Methods: participants were identiﬁed using purposive sampling. Twelve female spouses whose partners had PD and mild
cognitive impairment (PD-MCI), PD dementia (PDD) or dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) completed semi-structured
face-to-face interviews. Transcribed data were analysed using inductive thematic analysis. The consolidated criteria for
reporting qualitative research (COREQ) were applied.
Results: couples’ relationship satisfaction, intimacy and communication had already reduced in the mild cognitive impairment
stage of PD, but the decline in these domains was markedly greater with the emergence of dementia. Increased spousal care
responsibilities resulted in partners spending more time together, but feeling emotionally more distanced. Several participants’
roles transitioned from spouse to caregiver and they reported feelings of frustration, resentment, anger, sadness and a worry for
the future. Cognitive impairment was signiﬁcantly harder to accept, manage and cope with than the motor symptoms of PD.
Spouses acknowledged their marital commitments and exhibited acceptance, adjustment, resilience and various coping strategies.
Conclusion: this is the ﬁrst study exploring relationship satisfaction in Parkinson’s-related dementia and has provided valu-
able insight into the changing patterns of intimate relationships.

Introduction

Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a complex neurodegenerative
disorder characterised by multiple motor and non-motor
features. Approximately, 20–50% of people develop mild cog-
nitive impairment (PD-MCI) [1] and nearly 80% develop
dementia (PDD) within ﬁrst two decades of their PD diagno-
sis [2]. Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB) is considered to
be the second most common type of dementia with a pre-
valence representing 10–20% of all dementia cases [3].
Evidence suggests that PD-MCI is a precursor to dementia
[4–7] and occurrence and severity of cognitive, neuropsychi-
atric and physical symptoms intensiﬁes with the emergence of
dementia in PD [8], highlighting the needs of this population.
Health and support care costs and frequency and length of
hospital admissions increases in PDD and DLB [3, 9–11],
compared to PD without cognitive impairment, but the costs
are largely saved by the care provided by family members and
spouses [12]. Thus, these care partnerships are vital to pre-
serve to limit the increasing costs of health care.

The progressive nature of PD raises the need for care. In
the majority of the cases, this role is fulﬁlled by a spouse or a
life partner (subsequently referred to as a spouse); however,
multiple studies have shown that this may have a profound
negative impact on the spouse’s quality of life [13, 14] and
mental, emotional and physical well-being [15], and conse-
quently increase burden and strain [16, 17]. In recent years, the
literature has referred to caregiving spouses as ‘hidden or invis-
ible patients’ [18]; their caregiving role and increased responsi-
bilities may lead to neglect of their own health and care needs.

Long-term intimate partnerships have been a topic of inter-
est in the neurodegenerative literature and ﬁndings suggest that
emergence of the neurodegenerative condition is associated
with signiﬁcant changes in couples’ intimate relationships [19–
21]. Premorbid relationship quality can be predictive of future
relationships for both the person with dementia and the part-
ner [22]. In particular, poor quality of the prior relationship can
lead to depression, lower quality of life, less satisfaction from
caregiving and higher burden in the caregiving spouse [23, 24].
To our knowledge, transitions in intimate relationships in the
context of one partner developing Parkinson’s-related dementia
have not yet been investigated qualitatively. The aim of this
study was to explore the changes in long-term intimate relation-
ships in PD-MCI, PDD and DLB through the perspective of
spouses. The research question for this study was: How have
intimate relationships change as a result of one partner devel-
oping PD-MCI, PDD or DLB?

Method

This cross-sectional qualitative study is part of the ‘INdiVidualised
cognitivE Stimulation Therapy’ project (INVEST), a pilot
feasibility study of a novel psychosocial therapy for people
with Parkinson’s-related dementia and their study partners [25]
for which ethical approval was granted (Yorkshire & The
Humber—Bradford Leeds REC 15/YH/0531). Participants
were recruited through memory or movement disorder clinics

Spouses’ experiences of intimate relationships

in Greater Manchester and through UK-based charity websites
(e.g. Parkinson’s UK, Join Dementia Research). Purposive
selection of participants, in particular criterion sampling, was
used to ensure diversity of partners’ diagnoses. The inclusion
criteria for the participants were the following: currently provid-
ing care to a partner who has a diagnosis of PD-MCI, PDD or
DLB (based on the standard clinical diagnostic criteria and veri-
ﬁed by the referring clinician and on screening visit), being in a
long-term relationship and living together with their spouse.
Participants who did not meet the inclusion criteria were not
invited to take part. All participants in the INVEST study
had provided written informed consent agreeing to be
approached for the interviews and participate in audio-
recorded interviews; therefore, for the purposes of this study
only verbal consent was sought from the participants. The
majority of spouses and partners in the INVEST study were
female participants; thus, all potential participants who were
invited to participate in the current study were also women. It
was estimated that 6–12 interviews were sufﬁcient to reach
saturation within the sample [26], therefore a maximum of 12
interviews was planned. Thirteen participants were contacted
by telephone and the study was explained in detail by the ﬁrst
author. Twelve participants agreed to take part in the inter-
views, and one participant refused due to personal reasons.

All in-depth one-to-one interviews were conducted once by
one white female PhD candidate (S.V.), who had three years of
qualitative research experience. Eleven interviews took place in
a participants’ home and one in a café. Rapport between the
interviewer and participants was easily formed as interviewees
were known to the ﬁrst author through their participation in
the INVEST study. Acquaintance with participants was deemed
beneﬁcial as it allowed the establishment of a safe and sup-
portive environment for the interview to take place. The
researcher had experience working within neurodegenerative
conditions and researching intimate relationships quantitatively.
Participants were informed about the purpose of the inter-
views. A semi-structured topic guide, used in all interviews,
was informed by the Personal Assessment of Intimacy in
Relationships (PAIR) [27] scale and reviewed by the Patient
and Public Involvement representatives of the INVEST study
(Supplementary data, Appendix 1, available online in Age and
Ageing). Following the ﬁrst ﬁve interviews, a researcher (K.R.
M.) suggested asking subsequent participants to rate their cur-
rent and premorbid relationship satisfaction quantitatively as it
appeared to be an important and clear indicator of change in
the relationship satisfaction. Thus, at the start of the interview,
seven participants were asked to rate their current and premor-
bid relationship satisfaction on a horizontal visual analogue scale
[28] ranging from zero (very dissatisﬁed) to ten (very satisﬁed).
Interviews were audio-recorded and lasted between 35 and
97 min. During the interviews ﬁeld-notes were made to record
observations and reﬂections of the interviews. Verbatim tran-
scripts were analysed by one researcher (S.V.) in MSOfﬁce
Word (Microsoft Corp.) using an inductive thematic analysis
approach, whereby the codes and themes were identiﬁed from
within the data [29]. The transcripts were read and re-read
multiple times to facilitate familiarisation with the text, which

605

S. Vatter et al.

was followed by initial code-searching and analysis. After cod-
ing each transcript the codes were merged into one ﬁle and
arranged into possible themes. To ascertain clarity and coher-
ence, the emerging themes were discussed with two other
researchers (K.R.M. and E.S.). Discussions continued until
consensus was reached within all themes and sub-themes. As
no new themes emerged after the tenth transcript analysis, it
was deemed that the data saturation had been reached within
the sample. To maximise the transparency of the methods and
results sections, the consolidated criteria for reporting qualita-
tive research (COREQ) were utilised [30].

Results

Participant characteristics

Twelve individual semi-structured interviews were carried out
with spouses between November 2016 and March 2017 by the
ﬁrst author. All participants were white British females with an
average age of 69.3 years (SD = 4.8). All but one interviewee
were married and all couples lived together. Four of the partici-
pants’ partners had PD-MCI, ﬁve had PDD and three had
DLB. The mean scores of the visual analogue scale [28] for
premorbid and current relationship satisfaction for spouses of
people with PD-MCI were 8.8 (SD = 1.04) and 5.5 (SD =
3.28), respectively, and for spouses of people with PDD/DLB
8.8 (SD = 0.96) and 2.1 (SD = 1.65), respectively. A summary
of participant characteristics is provided in Table 1.

Key ﬁndings
Three themes and ten sub-themes were identiﬁed from
the data analysis. The three key themes were the following:
(i) altered relationship; (ii) care partner challenges; and (iii)
acceptance and adjustment. The themes and sub-themes
are described and presented in Tables 2 and 3 with illustra-
tive data excerpts. Additionally, a table with frequency of quotes

is Supplementary data, Appendix 2, available in Age and
Ageing online.

Altered relationship
The sub-themes of ‘Altered relationship’ were emotional dis-
tance, role transition and communication. Ten participants
reported that
their satisfaction with the relationship had
decreased compared with the early stage of their partner’s ill-
ness but the decrease was larger in the dementia group, which
was also supported by the mean scores of the visual analogue
scale [28] between current and premorbid relationship satisfac-
tion. Overall intimacy remained largely unchanged for couples
in the mild cognitive impairment group but was either dimin-
ished or non-existent following the emergence of dementia.
Multiple intimacies, including emotional, physical, sexual, rec-
reational and intellectual, were signiﬁcantly reduced in com-
parison to the premorbid stage. The presence of Parkinson’s
disease and cognitive impairment resulted in a practical need
for couples to spend more time together to enable the spouses
to support their husbands in managing activities of daily living
and provide physical care but in contrast the spouses felt emo-
tionally more distanced, disconnected and separated from
their husbands and longed for closeness and mutual compan-
ionship. Eight spouses reported sleeping in separate bedrooms
to their husband due to motor and non-motor symptoms of
PD and noted that the level of physical closeness and intimacy
with their partner,
including hugs, holding hands, caresses,
cuddles and sex, had decreased. Spouses were divided in their
opinion as to how they viewed their current role: two partici-
pants felt that their role as a wife had not changed, six partici-
pants saw themselves as in both a marital and a caregiving
role and remaining four felt they only had a caregiving role.
Partners of husbands with mild cognitive impairment noted a
somewhat decreased level of communication and fewer conver-
sations. However, once dementia had developed, communication

(cid:129) He is sort of emotionless, you know, so where you could have a kiss and a cuddle he is not up for a kiss and a cuddle. […] There is

just no intimacy [in tears] and it’s difﬁcult. [P09, PD-MCI]

(cid:129) Um, I don’t think we have a relationship. Um, we live together as man and wife, but there is no sexual, there hasn’t been for… 13

years. […] And there’s no intimacy of any other sort. […] Um, he, he doesn’t even hold my hand, you know, if you’re walking, or put
his arm around, there is nothing… nothing at all. [P11, PD-MCI]

(cid:129) I wouldn’t say [the relationship] was any the less strong. I suppose you could say he relies on me more strongly now than ever he has

done but I haven’t got him to rely on, you know. [P02, PDD]

(cid:129) There cannot be closeness when he doesn’t know who you are. [P07, PDD]
(cid:129) I just see myself very much as on my own but within a relationship where I can’t do much because I’m not on my own. [P06, DLB]
(cid:129) Somebody has got to take care of him, I’m his only carer really. [P01, PDD]
(cid:129) I’ve just got this person that needs looking after, I haven’t got erm, a husband as such or a partner or a friend even, you know. […]

I remember explaining this to somebody as it’s like having somebody else’s elderly uncle to stay. [P06, DLB]

(cid:129) I miss the conversations, the natters, the chatters, the just saying, ‘Ooo did you enjoy that?’ and talking about summat [something]

you’ve watched, seen or done. […] We’ll talk, but it’s not a conversation. It’s sort of ‘yes, no’. [P11, PD-MCI]

(cid:129) You can’t have a proper conversation, you might be saying something to him and then he’ll answer you with something that’s nothing

to do with what you are talking about. [P10, PDD]

(cid:129) My children have commented that he’s very quiet, he is going quieter as time goes by. [P12, DLB]

in couples was predominantly absent leading to feelings of
loneliness in the spouses.

Care partner challenges

This theme consisted of four sub-themes: responsibilities, nega-
tive feelings, motor and non-motor manifestations and worry
for future. As a result of their husbands’ neurodegenerative
condition, wives felt a signiﬁcant increase in their responsibil-
ities. In addition to continuing their regular everyday tasks,
spouses also had to take over husbands’ previous obligations,
such as managing the household, ﬁnances, transport and
maintenance. In the mild cognitive impairment stage, hus-
bands’
independence and ability to do things was largely
preserved, as they were able to drive, self-care, administer
medication and deal with paperwork, but their spouses were
beginning to check medication adherence and accuracy of
completed paperwork. However, the husbands with dementia
had become more co-dependent and less able to do things
they were once capable of doing, meaning their partners had
to take over most of the activities of daily living, such as driv-
ing, dressing, washing, cooking, managing household and
ﬁnances and administering medication. Consequently, partici-
pants felt their time, freedom and ability to plan for the future
had become more restricted as they had to spend a large pro-
portion of their day providing care and surveillance, support-
ing with day-to-day tasks and maintaining security and safety
for their partners. Thus, spouses spoke of increased negative
feelings such as frustration, resentment, annoyance, anger,
sadness, disappointment, irritation, guilt, distress, fear as well
as worry about the future regarding what might happen to
their husbands if they were unable to provide care. Seven par-
ticipants whose husband had dementia noted their life had
changed to the point where they feel they have lost their own
life, freedom and independence as a result of providing con-
tinuous care for their loved one.

Furthermore, the analysis revealed that cognitive impair-
ment and neuropsychiatric disturbances, regardless of disease

severity and duration were signiﬁcantly more difﬁcult
to
accept, manage and cope with than the motor symptoms of
Parkinson’s disease. Many spouses also feared the inevitable
progression of dementia and recognised that their husbands
have become more self-absorbed as a result of their disease.
All participants commented that they were constantly involved
with the management of their partners’ motor and non-motor
symptoms, but challenges in dealing with cognitive and neuro-
psychiatric symptoms were more pronounced in spouses
whose husband had PDD and DLB.

Acceptance and adjustment
The ﬁnal emerging theme referred to spouses’ acceptance
of the current situation and adjustment to it. They acknowl-
edged their inability to change the situation and recognised
awareness, acceptance, coping and moving on as their strat-
egies for continuation. Several spouses reported speciﬁc
coping methods such as laughter, separating the illness
from the person and applying learnt coping techniques to
their lives, and most spouses displayed great resilience.
Many couples received informal social support from their
adult children, other family members and friends and many
husbands attended local voluntary sector group either alone
or with their partner which was supportive. Only a few par-
ticipants (N = 4) were receiving support from formal paid
carers or respite care.

Caring for one’s husband was perceived as a fundamental
part of the marital contract and commitment, which wives
embraced. Throughout the marriage, husbands had cared
for their spouses and women felt they ought to return the
favour. Despite the challenges of providing care, spouses
continued to support their husbands and several participants
exhibited feelings of love, commitment, empathy, sympathy
and altruism. Finally, most participants believed accepting
the situation and adjusting to each day was the only way for-
ward and without it they would ‘go down with it’ and ‘lose
the battle’.

couple of hours or so and then think oh well you know, I get on with it each day you know. [P02, PDD]

(cid:129) I am quite positive really with regards to the illness because to me you either ﬁght it or you go down with it
and both of us we’ll go down with it, so you’ve got no alternative but to ﬁght it. And to look at things we
can do, not things we can’t do, you can’t dwell on the past. [P12, DLB]

Discussion

To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst qualitative study investigat-
ing changes in long-term intimate relationships in Parkinson’s-
related dementia from the perspective of caregiving wives.
Analysis revealed three major themes illustrating changes in
the marital relationship, challenges in providing care as well as
accepting and adjusting to the situation. The ﬁndings indi-
cated that satisfaction with the intimate relationship had
decreased more at the advanced cognitive impairment stage
in comparison to the early stages of cognitive decline in PD.

By the time dementia had emerged, the role of spouses had
transitioned into that of caregiver accompanied by feelings
of frustration, anger, sadness, resentment, worry for the
future as well as loss of own freedom and independence.
Despite the fact that cognitive impairment and neuropsychiatric
symptoms were difﬁcult to manage, spouses did not renounce
their marital vows and exhibited acceptance and resilience
towards the situation they were in.

The results are consistent with earlier studies with spouses
of people with neurodegenerative conditions [19–21], highlighting

608

the losses of dyadic interaction,
intimacy, relationship and
loss of a partner, the challenges of providing care as well as
acceptance, adaptation and coping by the spouses. However,
qualitative studies with caregiving spouses of people with
dementia and people with PD have not collectively explored
the combination of motor, psychiatric and cognitive symp-
toms and compared different stages of the cognitive decline.
Current work demonstrates the contrast between mild and
advanced stages of cognitive impairment and illustrates that
dementia has a stronger impact on spouses’ lives and well-
being. This goes hand in hand with the length of the disease
as caregiving spouses of people with PDD and DLB have
often provided care for longer than those providing care to
partners with other types of dementia.

We acknowledge the limitations of the current study. Firstly,
the interviews were undertaken solely with female caregiving
spouses and did not include male spouses, which limits our
understanding of the role that the gender may play in long-
term intimate relationships. Secondly, the relatively low sam-
ple of each of the disease groups should not be disregarded
as increasing the number of spouses of people with PD-MCI,
PDD and DLB may grant a deeper understanding of the
experiences of spouses. Thirdly, the cross-sectional nature of
the study did not compare the current and premorbid rela-
tionship satisfaction nor observe relationships longitudinally.
Finally, the chosen analysis was driven by the data and arran-
ging data into themes but thematic analysis lacks the capacity
to interpret data beyond the quotations and analyse nuances
of language use which should be recognised. Notwithstanding
the limitations, the current study has provided valuable insight
into the changing patterns of long-term intimate relationships
in Parkinson’s-related dementia.

Key points

(cid:129) Relationship satisfaction,

intimacy and communication

decreased as a result of Parkinson’s-related dementia.

(cid:129) Providing and maintaining care for a loved one brought
couples physically closer but emotionally further apart.

(cid:129) Transitioning from spouse to care provider
decreased own health, independence and freedom.

led to

(cid:129) Motor symptoms of Parkinson’s disease were easier to

handle and tolerate than cognitive impairment.

(cid:129) The marital contract remained important, supporting feel-

ings of acceptance, resilience and coping.
