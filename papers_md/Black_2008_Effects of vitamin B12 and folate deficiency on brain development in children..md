Effects of vitamin B12 and folate deficiency on brain development
in children

Abstract

Folate deficiency in the periconceptional period contributes to neural tube defects; deficits in
vitamin B12 (cobalamin) have negative consequences on the developing brain during infancy; and
deficits of both vitamins are associated with a greater risk of depression during adulthood. This
review examines two mechanisms linking folate and vitamin B12 deficiency to abnormal behavior
and development in infants: disruptions to myelination and inflammatory processes. Future
investigations should focus on the relationship between the timing of deficient and marginal
vitamin B12 status and outcomes such as infant growth, cognition, social development, and
depressive symptoms, along with prevention of folate and vitamin B12 deficiency.

Introduction

The link between diet and brain development and function has attracted global attention as
evidence has emerged documenting the negative consequences of nutritional deficiencies on
infant cognitive and motor functioning [1]. For example, the recognition that ensuring
adequate folate intake during pregnancy reduces the risk of giving birth to an infant with a
neural tube defect (NTD) [2] has led to folic acid fortification programs. Recent debates
have centered on the optimal timing and amount of folate required, and fortification
strategies [3].

Although the mechanisms underlying the effect of maternal folate status on neural tube
development are not well understood, the shared metabolism between folate and vitamin B12
suggests that deficiencies in one vitamin may alter the metabolism of the other. This is
perhaps related to the roles that vitamin B12 plays in myelination, or in the synthesis of
methionine from homocysteine in combination with folic acid. This review was conducted
to examine the evidence linking deficiencies in maternal and infant folate and/or vitamin
B12 with infant cognitive and motor development.

Vitamin B12 deficiency

During pregnancy, vitamin B12 is concentrated in the fetus and stored in the liver [4, 5].
Infants born to vitamin B12-replete mothers have stores of vitamin B12 that are adequate to
sustain them for the first several months postpartum. Vitamin B12 deficiency rarely occurs

before about 4 months of age. Infants of vitamin B12-deficient breastfeeding mothers, or
infants receiving low amounts of animal-source foods, may be vulnerable to vitamin B12
deficiency between 6 and 12 months of age. Neurological symptoms appear to affect the
central nervous system [6] and, in severe cases, cause brain atrophy. In addition to
neurological symptoms, infants may experience other physical symptoms, including
abnormal pigmentation, hypotonia, enlarged liver and spleen, sparse hair, food refusal,
anorexia, failure to thrive, and diarrhea.

Most of the initial data regarding vitamin B12 deficiency in infancy are from case studies of
infants exclusively breastfed by mothers on vegan, vegetarian, or lacto-ovo vegetarian diets.
Several authors have described developmental retardation and “infant tremor syndrome” in
4- to 11-month-old infants of vegetarian mothers from India [7, 8]. Four case studies from
the United States described lethargy, irritability, and developmental delay among
exclusively breastfed infants (ages 6 to 10 months) of vegan or vegetarian mothers [9–12].
Restoration of developmental skills after therapy was variable, with at least two cases
reporting ongoing delays [9, 12], and one reporting developmental recovery [11]. Similar
cases have been reported from Europe [13–17]. Again, the infants displayed delayed motor
skills, along with lethargy, and were exclusively breastfed by mothers who were vegan or
lacto-ovo vegetarian. After therapy, recovery was variable, with some children remaining
moderately or severely retarded [13, 17–19].

Although infants who are deficient in vitamin B12 due to maternal and infant vegetarianism
may also be deficient in other nutrients derived from animal-source foods, such as iron and
zinc, it is unlikely that the developmental problems associated with vitamin B12 deficiency
could be explained by iron or zinc deficiency. Recent reviews have suggested associations
between iron deficiency and behavioral and developmental problems, mediated through
changes in the developing brain [20, 21]. In addition, the role of iron in myelination,
neurotransmitter function, and neuronal metabolism [22, 23] has been suggested as a
possible explanation for the associations with behavioral and developmental functioning
[24]. Associations between zinc deficiency and children’s behavior and development are
less conclusive [1], but there is evidence in animals that zinc deficiency influences long-
term growth and intellectual performance through changes in brain structure and function
[25]. However, evidence from the treatment of children with vitamin B12 deficiency
illustrates that administration of vitamin B12 for a short duration (e.g., even a few days)
often leads to major improvements in functioning [26], suggesting that deficits in other
micronutrients cannot explain the deficits associated with vitamin B12 deficiency.

Possible mechanisms of impaired development

Maternal pernicious anemia may serve as a model for the effects of vitamin B12 deficiency
[27–29]. Pernicious anemia is a disorder caused by the absence of intrinsic factor, a
substance from the gastrointestinal tract needed to absorb cobalamin. Symptoms among 9
infants of mothers with untreated pernicious anemia were remarkably similar to symptoms
among 10 infants of vegetarian mothers [30]. In both cases, the most common symptom was
anemia, which was present in 56% of the infants of mothers with pernicious anemia and
100% of the infants of vegetarian mothers. Lethargy and delayed developmental milestones
were also common symptoms shared by both groups of infants.

There are at least two possible mechanisms linking vitamin B12 deficiency and abnormal
behavior and development: 1) threats to early brain development, possibly through
demyelination; and 2) inflammation, possibly simulating an autoimmune process that blocks
intrinsic factor for cobalamin absorption, similar to pernicious anemia, an autoimmune
disease that blocks intrinsic factor.

Brain development and myelination in infants

Recent advances in behavioral neuroscience have shown the important roles that nutrition
plays in brain development [31, 32]. Brain development begins prenatally and continues
through school age. It begins with the formation of brain cells, followed by cell migration
and differentiation, and the development of synapses to enable cells to communicate with
one another (fig. 1) [33]. Myelin is the supportive tissue that surrounds and protects the
nerve cells and facilitates communication.

Nutrient deficiencies can interfere with early brain development and function, often by
restricting the myelination, dendritic arborization, and synaptic connectivity that occur early
in life [34]. The tissue levels of neurotransmitters (e.g., serotonin, dopamine,
norepinephrine, acetylcholine) may be altered, resulting in neuroanatomical, neurochemical,
or neurometabolic changes. The functional consequences of these alterations vary,
depending on the specific nutritional deficiency and the timing of the deficiency relative to
the developing neurological processes.

Brain growth is very rapid during the first 2 years of life, particularly in the cortex, which is
associated with higher-order thinking. In addition, myelination of the brain, which is
concentrated from mid-gestation through the second year of life, but continues through
puberty, may be vulnerable to vitamin B12 deficiency. In infants, vitamin B12 deficiency has
been associated with demyelination and brain atrophy [12, 34]. Although magnetic
resonance imaging [35] using a circularly polarized head coil is an optimal way to study
brain structure and function in infants, the requirement for sedation to ensure that infants do
not move limits the procedure to infants undergoing clinical diagnosis. Thus, little is known
about the consequences of mild vitamin B12 deficiency for early brain development and
function.

Disruptions in myelination can have significant effects on central nervous system
functioning by altering the speed of conduction in multiple systems. For example, slower
conduction in the auditory and visual systems can interfere with learning and social
interaction [32]. It is also likely that there are other intracerebral effects of vitamin B12
deficiency, given that so many brain systems are myelinating during the early developmental
period. The acquisition of cognitive skills coincides with the pattern of central nervous
system myelination. Therefore, retardation of myelination of the brain in infancy leads to
delayed acquisition of cognitive skills, and brain atrophy leads to regression of these skills.

Inflammation

Vitamin B12 deficiency has been associated with gastric diseases such as atrophic gastritis
(which sometimes progresses to pernicious anemia) and nonspecific gastritis (e.g., that
caused by Helicobacter pylori). In the case of H. pylori infection, even patients with
minimal or no gastric atrophy have presented with vitamin B12 deficiency [36].
Additionally, a case study from Poland described a 9-year-old girl who had undergone
resection of the end of her small bowel early in life and presented with apathy, tiredness, and
spastic paresis had inflammation of the esophagus and duodenum, low levels of vitamin B12
in her serum, impaired vitamin B12 absorption, and megaloblastic anemia [26]. Treatment
with vitamin B12 and folic acid improved her neurological condition and hematologic status,
illustrating a possible link with inflammation.

Prevalence of vitamin B12 deficiency

Studies in Guatemala among mothers and infants [37] and among school-age children [38]
reported a high prevalence of deficient and marginal plasma vitamin B12 concentrations,
possibly related to inadequate dietary intake, and for the mothers, the nutritional demands of

pregnancy and lactation. These findings suggest that vitamin B12 deficiency is likely to be
prevalent in other societies with low consumption of animal-source foods [39].

Vitamin B12 deficiency beyond infancy

Studies examining plasma vitamin B12 concentrations among preschool children and
adolescents have suggested that vitamin B12 deficiency early in life compromises children’s
subsequent growth and development. In a study in Boston, 42 preschoolers (median age, 3.9
years) who had been breastfed by vegetarian mothers and weaned to a macrobiotic diet were
weighed and measured [40]. Approximately one-third (32%, 11/34) of the children were
stunted (below the 5th percentile of height) and 15% (6/41) were wasted (below the 5th
percentile of weight). Over half the children (55%) had high urinary methylmalonic acid
concentrations, particularly those who had consumed a vegetarian diet throughout their
lives. In a study conducted among adolescents in the Netherlands, cognitive assessments
were conducted on 48 adolescents who had been raised on macrobiotic diets for the first 6
years of life followed by lacto-vegetarian or omnivorous diets, and 24 adolescents raised on
omnivorous diets [41]. The children raised on omnivorous diets from birth obtained better
scores on most cognitive assessments than children raised on macrobiotic diets, regardless of
their cobalamin status during adolescence. Many of the adolescents raised on a macrobiotic
diet early in life had poor cobalamin status during adolescence, even if they were consuming
an omnivorous diet later in life, illustrating the difficulty in restoring cobalamin status
following early vitamin B12 deficiency [42]. These studies are particularly important
because they suggest that early cobalamin deficiency can have lasting consequences for
children’s growth and cognitive development, and they raise questions about the possibility
of mild cobalamin deficiency among the millions of children in developing countries
breastfed by mothers who may be cobalamin-deficient due to low intake of animal-source
foods and the nutritional demands of pregnancy and lactation.

Benefits from treatment

Cobalamin treatment has been effective in reducing the negative consequences for infants
with vitamin B12-related neuropathy, but little is known about long-term effects of
treatment. Several case studies among infants reported hematological improvement after
vitamin B12 therapy, and rapid improvement of symptoms such as apathy and decreased
activity. However, many infants continued to experience developmental delays several
months after initiation of treatment [9, 12, 17]. There are few data on longer-term effects of
treatment during infancy.

Environment

Nutrient deficiencies, such as vitamin B12 and folate deficiency, are more likely to occur in
disadvantaged environments, which themselves have adverse effects on children [43]. In
addition to direct effects on central nervous system development, through changes in
neuroanatomy or neurotransmission, it is possible that behavior changes associated with
micronutrient deficiencies alter the caregiving that the child receives, thereby compromising
the child’s development even further [44]. For example, if a vitamin B12-deficient child is
unable to elicit or to benefit from nurturant interactions from a caregiver, that child may be
denied the enrichment that is known to promote early development. Animal studies have
shown that alterations in maternal caregiving may also result in structural changes to the
developing brain [45]. If these findings extend to humans, the result could be a child who
experiences neurological changes together with limited environmental opportunities for
enrichment. Over time, these combined influences may result in poor behavioral and
developmental outcomes (fig. 2), suggesting that the impact of nutritional deficiencies on
children’s behavior and development may be partially mediated through caregiving behavior

[46]. Future research should consider how the caregiving system is related to child
development and whether it mediates the effects of vitamin B12 deficiencies.

Depression among adults

Deficiencies in cobalamin and/or folic acid have also been related to symptoms of
depression in adults. For example, investigators have found inverse relationships between
symptoms of depression and plasma folate [47, 48] or plasma cobalamin [49]. One possible
mechanism linking these vitamin deficiencies to depressive symptoms may be through
elevated homocysteine and intracellular one-carbon metabolism. Plasma vitamin B12 and
folate are required for the synthesis of methionine from homocysteine. Methionine is the
precursor to S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM), a universal methyl donor active in metabolic
pathways related to the synthesis of hormones, neurotransmitters, nucleic acids, and
proteins, particularly in the brain. Elevated plasma homocysteine [50, 51] has been
associated with low concentrations of SAM in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid [52], and with
depressive symptoms. In addition, SAM has been used as an effective treatment for
depression [52].

The evidence linking cobalamin status to the response to treatment of depression is also
controversial. In a study among outpatients (mean age, 42 years) diagnosed with a major
depressive disorder and treated with fluoxetine, treatment resistance was associated with low
plasma folate, with no relationship to either cobalamin or homocysteine [53]. Yet, in a
sample of depressed adults from Finland (mean age, 44 years), treatment outcome was
positively associated with higher plasma cobalamin, but not folate [54]. In spite of the
absence of clear findings related to cobalamin and folate, both vitamins have been
recommended for the treatment of depression [55].

Although there is relatively clear evidence for the negative consequences of severe
deficiencies in folate and vitamin B12 on the developing brain during infancy, and on
depression during adulthood, neither the mechanisms, nor the impact of mild deficiencies,
have been clearly specified. Both cobalamin and folic acid play important roles in the
developing nervous system. Folic acid is necessary during early fetal development to
prevent NTD, and cobalamin deficiency may interfere with early development through
disruptions in myelination and dendritic formation or inflammation. Although treatment
with cobalamin may remedy some of the negative effects of severe cobalamin deficiency on
behavioral and developmental functioning, there is evidence suggesting that cobalamin
deficiency early in life may compromise psychoeducational functioning through
adolescence. The Institute of Medicine recommends continued research into the prevalence
of cobalamin deficiency, methods to reduce the risk of deficiency resulting from
malabsorption or a vegetarian diet, and the feasibility of fortification of grains [56]. Given
the high prevalence of vitamin B12 deficiency in developing countries, future investigations
should focus on the relationship between the timing of deficient and marginal vitamin B12
status and outcomes such as infant growth, cognition, social development, and depressive
symptoms, along with strategies to prevent vitamin B12 deficiency.
