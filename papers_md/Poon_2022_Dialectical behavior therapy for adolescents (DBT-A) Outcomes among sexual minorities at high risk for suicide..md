Abstract

The alarming rates and pervasiveness of suicidal and self-destructive behaviors (e.g., non-suicidal 
self-injury) among young sexual minorities represent a major public health concern. We set 
out to examine whether an empirically driven treatment for suicide and self-harm, dialectical 
behavior therapy for adolescents (DBT-A), provides benefits for adolescents who identify as 
gay, lesbian, bisexual, or questioning (LGBQ). LGBQ adolescents (n = 16) were compared with 
non-LGBQ peers (n = 23). Psychological measures were collected before and after participation 
in a comprehensive DBT-A program. LGBQ participants demonstrated significant improvements 
in emotion regulation, depression, borderline symptoms, and coping strategies; changes were 
comparable to their heterosexual peers.

INTRODUCTION

Despite ample research, policy, and clinical efforts focused on detection and prevention, 
suicide rates have increased by 28% over the past 20 years (CDC, 2016a, 2016b; Curtin et 
al., 2016). Adolescents are particularly vulnerable to suicidal ideation and behaviors; indeed, 
suicide is the 2nd leading cause of death among 10–24-year olds (CDC, 2015; Heron, 2016) 
and the number of hospital encounters for suicide-related events among youth has doubled 
in the past 10 years (Asarnow et al., 2011). Mounting evidence highlights the vulnerability 
of gay, lesbian, bisexual, or questioning (LGBQ) adolescents, who are disproportionally 
affected by suicide. Compared with their heterosexual peers, sexual minority adolescents are 
1.5–7× more likely to endorse suicidal ideation and are 2–4× more likely to have made a 
suicide attempt over the last year (Haas et al., 2011; King et al., 2008; Peters et al., 2020; 
Russell & Joyner, 2001). Furthermore, their suicide attempts tend to be more severe and are 
more likely to require medical treatment (CDC, 2016a, 2016b).

Sexual minority adolescents are also more likely to engage in non-suicidal self-injury 
(NSSI), or the intentional infliction of harm to one’s body in the absence of suicidal intent 
(Nock, 2009). Compared with their heterosexuals, LGBQ adolescents are 3–6x more likely 
to engage in NSSI (Batejan et al., 2015; Reisner et al., 2014; Liu et al., 2019; Liu & 
Mustanski, 2012). Importantly, suicidal thoughts and behavior often co-occur, and research 
consistently finds that NSSI effectively serves as a precursor to subsequent suicide attempts 
and completions and, as such, represents a well-documented risk factor (e.g., Hankin & 
Abela, 2011). In fact, NSSI may be an even stronger predictor of suicide attempts than prior 
attempt history (Asarnow et al., 2011; Ribeiro et al., 2016; Wilkinson et al., 2011). While 
suicide has increased among adolescents more broadly, overall rates of suicidal behaviors 
are increasing at a faster rate among sexual minorities in particular (Peter et al., 2017; 
Saewyc et al., 2008).

Over the past two decades, LGBQ suicide rates have received increasing attention, yet much 
of the research has focused on identifying risk factors and predictors. Notably, the disparity 
in suicide risk between LGBQ versus heterosexual youth has widened over this time. Thus, 
it remains unclear whether current evidence-based interventions for suicide are efficacious 
for this high-risk group. Several treatments have shown success in reducing suicidal ideation 
and NSSI behaviors among adolescents (Labelle et al., 2015; Mehlum et al., 2016; O’Brien 
et al., 2014), yet sexual orientation has not been reliably collected or reported on in these 
studies. It would be presumptuous to assume that successful outcomes from previous clinical 
trials, which did not operationalize sexual orientation, generalize to LGBQ youth. The first 
step in selecting appropriate and accessible treatment options for LGBQ adolescents is to 
test their response to existing, evidence-based, “gold standard” interventions.

Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT; Linehan, 1993)—initially developed to treat chronically 
suicidal adults diagnosed with borderline personality disorder (BPD)—has gained strong 
empirical support for improving outcomes beyond BPD symptomatology. DBT is 
categorized as a “well-established” treatment in reducing suicidal ideation, attempts, and 
NSSI among adults in numerous randomized controlled trials (Neacsiu et al., 2012; 
Robins & Chapman, 2004), which has led to the adaptation of the DBT model for

adolescents and their families (DBT-A; Rathus & Miller, 2002). Clinical trials of DBT-A 
have documented improvements in adolescent suicidal thoughts and behavior, emotion 
dysregulation, psychopathology, and general psychosocial functioning (Choate, 2012; 
Fleischhaker et al., 2011; Hollenbaugh & Lenz, 2018; James et al., 2008; McCauley et 
al., 2018; Mehlum et al., 2016; Miller et al., 2000; Woodberry & Popenoe, 2008). However, 
none of these studies reported on sexual orientation or whether or not LGBQ youth may 
differentially respond to DBT.

In addition to the robust empirical support for successfully treating suicidality among 
adolescents, a strong theoretical justification exists for applying DBT-A to high-risk 
sexual minorities. DBT is grounded in the Biosocial Model, which contends that 
emotion dysregulation manifests from the transaction of environmental invalidation and 
the individual’s biological temperament (Linehan, 1993). Difficulties in emotion regulation 
(ER) are implicated in virtually all forms of psychopathology (Aldao et al., 2016) and 
maladaptive behaviors, including suicide and NSSI (Anestis et al., 2011; Carpenter & Trull, 
2013). Disparities between sexual minorities and heterosexual peers in ER deficits were 
shown to emerge as early as middle school (Hatzenbuehler et al., 2008). Hatzenbuehler 
(2009) posited that LGBQ people are more prone to deficits in ER skills as a result of 
experiencing chronic stress and stigma related to their sexual orientation, referred to as 
minority stress (Meyer, 2003). This additional, identity-based stress burden is hypothesized 
to account for their disparities in negative mental health outcomes. In alignment with 
the Biosocial Model, sexual minorities likely evidence higher levels of emotion and 
behavioral dysregulation—even in the absence of a strong biological vulnerability—due 
to their exposure to persistent cultural, social, and intrapersonal experiences of invalidation, 
discrimination, and rejection (Meyer, 2003).

Consistent with Meyer’s minority stress theory (Meyer, 2003), sexual minority youth 
disproportionally experience invalidation, including devaluation by parents and peers. 
Compared with their heterosexual peers, sexual minorities are 2–4× more likely to be 
bullied on school property, cyber-bullied, threatened or injured with a weapon on school 
property, and injured in a physical fight and to experience dating violence (Johns et al., 
2020). A meta-analysis demonstrated that sexual minority youth were at increased risk for 
peer victimization as well as parental abuse (Friedman et al., 2011), both of which constitute 
extreme forms of invalidation. These identity-based experiences of invalidation continue into 
adulthood; 55% of sexual minority adults have been verbally harassed and/or threatened, 
28% have been physically assaulted, and nearly 10% have been spit on because of their 
sexual orientation (Katz-Wise & Hyde, 2012).

Importantly, several studies have linked identity-based minority stress experiences—from 
physical victimization to microaggressions—with higher rates of suicidal thoughts and 
behaviors (including attempts) and NSSI engagement among LGBQ adolescents and adults 
alike (Almeida et al., 2009; Bouris et al., 2016; Hamilton & Mahalik, 2009; Hill & Pettit, 
2012; Nadal et al., 2011; Smith & Perrin, 2017). While adolescence is associated with the 
increased salience of peer relationships, the family environment remains particularly vital 
for healthy socioemotional development (Repetti et al., 2002); therefore, familial acceptance 
(or lack thereof) may have a significant bearing on the deleterious mental health outcomes

observed among LGBQ youth compared with responses from others in adolescents’ social 
milieu. One study found that LGBQ young adults are 8x more likely to make a suicide 
attempt if they reported experiencing high levels of family rejection during adolescence 
due to their sexual minority status (Ryan et al., 2009). DBT-A provides a protocol for 
developing more adaptive ER strategies and for increasing validating interactions, with 
caregivers learning skills alongside their teens.

The current study

Efforts to develop treatments for LGBQ suicidal teens are already underway (Budge et al., 
2017; Diamond et al., 2012); however, the need for this population to access treatment 
presently is critical. DBT-A can likely meet the needs of this unique population due to its 
sensitivity to invalidation and high level of family education and involvement. However, the 
same factors that contribute to and maintain vulnerabilities to the alarming rates of death 
by suicide among LGBQ individuals (i.e., lack of family acceptance) could also potentially 
interfere with treatment effectiveness. Thus, it seems logical to investigate the efficacy of 
DBT-A for suicidal LGBQ youth to better inform clinicians in making suitable treatment 
decisions and recommendations. The overarching aim of the current study is to test whether 
LGBQ adolescents enrolled in a comprehensive DBT-A program demonstrate improvements 
in psychosocial risk factors associated with suicide and NSSI (e.g., emotion dysregulation; 
borderline, depressive, and anxiety symptoms) from baseline to posttreatment. We also 
evaluate how changes in LGBQ participants’ outcomes compare to heterosexual peers. 
Overall, we predict that both LGBQ and non-LGBQ participants will show significant 
reductions across all outcomes, including psychological symptoms and risk factors, after 
participating in DBT-A for 18 weeks.

METHODS

Participants and procedure

Mindful Teen is an 18-week comprehensive DBT-A outpatient program offered to 
adolescents between the ages of 13–18 within a children’s psychiatric hospital setting in 
the Northeast. Inclusion criteria included a documented history of suicidality, NSSI, and/or 
other self-destructive behaviors, placing them at risk for needing a higher than outpatient-
based level of care. DBT-A was delivered with fidelity to the standard model proposed 
by Miller et al. (2007), including a weekly multifamily skills training group, individual 
therapy, 24/7 phone coaching, and a therapist consultation team. Individual treatment was 
delivered by doctoral-level providers intensively trained in DBT and highly experienced 
with multiproblem youth. At least one guardian was required to participate alongside their 
adolescent in skills training. To ensure efficacy and promote commitment to the treatment, 
participants were required to not miss more than four groups or individual sessions.

Participants were recruited to complete an optional treatment effectiveness study after 
they enrolled in the Mindful Teen program, and routine informed parental consent and 
child assent procedures were followed. All adolescents receiving treatment were eligible to 
participate in this study; thus, inclusion criteria were broad and participants qualified if they 
met age restrictions, failed at lower levels of treatment, and were able to reliably attend

Measures

all treatment components. Those included in the study were asked to complete a battery of 
self and parent report questionnaires at pretreatment, posttreatment, and 6-month follow-up. 
To optimize sample size, current analyses focused on pre- and posttreatment self-report 
measures. Surveys were primarily delivered via REDCap, a secure online data collection 
application, with paper-and-pencil options offered if electronic means were not accessible 
(Harris et al., 2009).

The current study included 16 participants who self-identified as LGBQ and 23 who 
identified as heterosexual who completed baseline and posttreatment measures. Sexual 
orientation was assessed at baseline by prompting the selection of one of four options 
including straight, gay/lesbian, bisexual, or questioning/other. The final sample included 39 
adolescents (age M = 15.21 years, SD = 1.65), most of whom identified as female (86.8%). 
Race/ethnicity was representative of the community, with 71.1% non-Hispanic White, 
22.9% Hispanic, 13.1% bi- or multi-racial, and 7.9% Asian, African-American, or other. 
All participants completed the entire 18-week DBT-A program along with their guardian(s). 
There were no significant demographic differences between LGBQ and non-LGBQ groups.

Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS; Gratz & Roemer, 2004)—The 
DERS is a 36-item questionnaire used to measure an individual’s ability to regulate their 
emotions consisting of six subscales that reflect different dimensions and approaches to 
understand emotion regulation. Total scores range from 36 to 180, such that higher scores 
reflect greater difficulties with effective emotion regulation. The DERS has demonstrated 
high internal consistency, test–retest reliability, and adequate criterion-related validity in 
standardized (Gratz & Roemer, 2004) and clinical samples (Osbourne et al., 2017).

Beck Depression Inventory, 2nd edition (BDI-II; Beck et al., 1996)—The BDI-II 
is a widely used self-report inventory used to assess for general symptoms of depression. 
The 21 items are each rated using a 0 to 3 scale, with higher scores indicating more severe 
depressive symptoms.

Beck Anxiety Inventory (Beck & Steer, 1993)—The BAI consists of 21 items and was 
constructed to measure severity of anxiety symptoms. The items ask about common physical 
symptoms associated with anxiety, and higher scores represent greater anxiety severity.

The dialectical behavior therapy ways of coping checklist (DBT-WCCL; 
Neacsiu et al., 2010)—The DBT-WCCL was developed to assess acquisition and 
application of skills specific to DBT by using lay language. It contains 59 items and is 
represented by two factors: adaptive skill use and dysfunctional coping. Previous reports 
indicate good to excellent psychometric properties (Neacsiu et al., 2010).

Borderline symptoms list (BSL; Bohus et al., 2007)—The BSL measures 
borderline-typical symptomatology. The 35 items are based on the DSM symptoms for 
BPD, with higher scores indicating greater impairment. Psychometric properties include 
high internal consistency, test–retest reliability, and convergent validity (Bohus et al., 2007).

Data analysis

Page 6

First, repeated-measures bootstrapped t-tests were conducted to examine changes in pre- 
and posttreatment scores following 18 weeks of treatment for LGBQ participants only. Two-
tailed 0.05 p-values were applied for all analyses. In the event that one item was missing on 
a self-report scale, the mean score of the remaining items was used in place of that item. A 
2 × 2 mixed-model ANOVA was performed to compare treatment effects across LGBQ and 
non-LGBQ groups. Specifically, interactions were examined to test group (LGBQ and non-
LGBQ) by time (pre-and post-) effects on each of the six outcome measures. Considering 
the small sample size and exploratory nature of the analyses, partial eta squared was used to 
assess the size of the interaction effect (η2 = 0.01 small; η2 = 0.06 medium; and η2 = 0.14 
large). Cohen’s d was also reported for treatment effects (d = 0.20 small; d = 0.50 medium; 
and d = 0.80 large).

RESULTS

DBT-A resulted in significant posttreatment improvements in participants who identified as 
LGBQ on all outcomes assessed, with the exception of anxiety (Table 1). Specifically, 
LGBQ participants demonstrated significant reductions in ER problems as well as 
depressive and borderline symptoms. In terms of DBT skills, repeated-measures t-tests 
indicated that LGBQ adolescents successfully acquired healthy coping skills and decreased 
dysfunctional coping as measured by the DBT-WCCL. Effect sizes were all considered to be 
in the large range (Table 1).

Between-subjects main effects on the ANOVA showed that using both time points, LGBQ 
participants rated significantly higher on borderline symptom (F(1, 34) = 18.13, p < 0.01) 
measures. There were no significant differences between groups on the BDI-II, BAI, DERS, 
or DBT-WCCL. The mixed-model ANOVA did not produce significant group × time 
interaction effects on any of the outcomes, indicating that changes over time did not differ 
between LGBQ and non-LGBQ participants. In other words, DBT-A participation led to 
similar rates of improvement among LGBQ adolescents as their heterosexual peers. While 
statistically nonsignificant, interaction effect sizes on the DERS, BDI-II, and WCCL-Skill 
Use were small to medium, suggesting that sexual minorities may benefit slightly more with 
respect to ER, depression, and effective skill use compared with their heterosexual peers. 
Interactions are illustrated in Figure 1, and a complete report of the interaction statistics is in 
Table 2.

DISCUSSION

Suicide is a leading cause of death among adolescents, and rates of ideation and attempts 
are disproportionately high among adolescent sexual minority populations. This study 
was set up to preliminarily examine whether DBT-A would be specifically effective for 
youth who identify as LGB and/or who are actively questioning their sexuality. Results 
indicate that DBT-A had desirable effects on ER, depressive, and borderline symptoms, 
in addition to increases in skill acquisition and decreases in dysfunctional coping from 
pre- to posttreatment comparable to their heterosexual counterparts. These findings are 
consistent with the growing literature on DBT-A as an efficacious and reliable treatment for

adolescents (Choate, 2012; Hollenbaugh, & Lenz, 2018; McCauley et al., 2018; Mehlum 
et al., 2016) and has additional implications for clinicians working with this vulnerable 
population. Accordingly, it may be the case that LGBQ adolescents who demonstrate self-
destructive behaviors can benefit from DBT-A in its current form, although this requires 
further attention given the small sample of the current study.

The finding that LGBQ participants reported significantly elevated borderline symptoms 
compared with non-LGBQ individuals, when averaged across time, is consistent with prior 
research showing higher rates of psychopathology among sexual minorities (Bostwick et al., 
2010; King et al., 2008). Increased risk for suicide and NSSI may even be explained by these 
higher prevalence rates (Fergusson et al., 1999). However, recent research on psychiatric 
samples of adults indicates that sexual minorities are almost 2.5 times more likely to 
receive a diagnosis of borderline personality disorder even after taking into account robust 
clinical correlates of BPD (e.g., age, gender, PTSD, and maladaptive personality domains; 
Rodriguez-Seijas et al., 2020). This phenomenon has yet to be examined among adolescents, 
and it is unclear whether this diagnostic disparity reflects clinician bias and/or the conflation 
of BPD symptoms with normative exploration of identity concerns and experiences of 
minority stress. Nevertheless, our data suggest that affective symptoms are more pronounced 
among LGBQ adolescents at initial presentation; however, their higher levels of pathology 
do not impede their treatment gains. Therefore, it may be appropriate for clinicians to 
approach the specific needs of LGBQ adolescents by implementing the DBT model.

Presently, there is a large gap in empirically driven treatments geared toward suicidal and 
self-harming LGBQ individuals. While efforts to address this gap are already underway, 
capitalizing on extant gold standard, evidence-supported treatments that reduce suicide risk 
may increase accessibility more rapidly. Previously, we were unable to assume that what has 
worked for heteronormative populations would confer the same favorable benefits for sexual 
minorities. Our study showed clinically significant changes across a range of behavioral 
and symptom-based outcomes among LGBQ adolescents enrolled in a heterogeneous 
DBT-A program. Effect sizes suggest that DBT-A may benefit LGBQ participants in 
specific domains to a greater extent than their heterosexual peers. The results of this study 
provide preliminary—albeit promising—support for the use of DBT to decrease suffering 
among sexual minority youth. Future studies should seek to conduct more outcome and 
dissemination research on DBT-A within this and related minority populations. Clinical 
scientists should routinely and comprehensively assess both sexual orientation and gender 
identity; indeed, a wealth of research suggests that transgender and other gender-expansive 
minorities experience increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors across the lifespan 
(Janakiraman et al., 2020). New adaptations to address the unique experiences of sexual 
and/or gender minorities related to suicide could be developed and tested to see whether 
larger effects are feasible across multiple settings (Carmel et al., 2014; Dimeff et al., 2015). 
Our results speak to the possible benefits of incorporating DBT into traditional training 
methods and may be effective in preparing a myriad of mental health workers for high-risk, 
diverse cases.

While our results are encouraging that LGBQ youth may benefit from DBT-A, they 
should still be considered as preliminary. Due to our relatively low N, our analyses were

underpowered, resulting in a lower likelihood of detecting true effects and a greater risk 
of producing unreliable (or overestimated) effects. Therefore, the results of the present 
exploratory study should be interpreted with caution in light of this important issue. 
Furthermore, future studies with larger sample sizes should be designed in order to 
increase statistical power and allow for the examination of potential moderators (e.g., family 
acceptance and LGBQ community connectedness). Our large effect sizes certainly stand out 
when considering these limitations, and the fact that our participants had unsuccessfully 
utilized many higher levels of care.

To our knowledge, this is the first study to investigate whether DBT-A is an effective 
treatment for LGBQ adolescents with suicide and/or NSSI behaviors. Our results are 
promising, such that LGBQ participants significantly benefitted from treatment and 
demonstrated comparable changes to non-LGBQ participants. Thus, we urge clinicians and 
researchers alike to further investigate DBT-A within this high-risk population and help 
LGBQ youth build lives worth living.
