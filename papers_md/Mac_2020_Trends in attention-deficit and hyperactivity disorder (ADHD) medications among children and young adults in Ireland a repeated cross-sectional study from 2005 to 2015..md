Objective  This study examined the prescribing patterns of 
attention- deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) medications 
in Ireland between 2005 and 2015 in children, adolescents 
and young adults, and concomitant use of psychotropic 
medication.
Design  Repeated cross- sectional study.
Setting  Community setting using pharmacy claims data 
in Ireland.
Participants  Children and young adults aged 0–24 years.
Primary and secondary outcomes  Authorised 
medications used to treat ADHD during the study period, 
methylphenidate, dexamfetamine, lisdexamfetamine 
dimesylate and atomoxetine were extracted from 
a national pharmacy claims database. Dispensing 
of concomitant psychotropic medications including 
antipsychotics, anxiolytics, hypnotics/sedatives and 
antidepressants were examined.
results  The number on any ADHD medication ranged 
from 1913 in 2005 to 4853 in 2015, and the prevalence 
rate per 1000 eligible population aged <25 years 
increased significantly over time from 5.61 (95% CI 
5.36 to 5.86) in 2005 to 8.36 (95% CI 8.13 to 8.60) in 
2015 (p<0.0001). Negative binomial regression showed 
significant changes over time for ADHD prescribing 
(p<0.001), with significantly higher rates across the 
different age groups. The rates overall were three to five 
times higher in males. There was a significant increase in 
the percentage on concomitant antidepressants from 2% 
in 2005 to 6% in 2015 (p<0.001).
Conclusions  There were significantly higher rates of 
ADHD prescribing in children/adolescents and a significant 
increase in the coprescribing of antidepressants. The 
reasons for the increase are unclear but may reflect 
increasing awareness and diagnosis of the condition.

IntrODuCtIOn
Attention- deficit  and  hyperactivity  disorder 
(ADHD)  is  a  complex,  heterogeneous  and 
multifactorial disorder which is characterised 
by persistent symptoms of inattention, hyper-
activity and impulsivity.1 2 ADHD is the most 
common  childhood  neurodevelopmental 

Strengths and limitations of this study

 ► This study was based on a large national sample of 
children and young adults with accurate ascertain-
ment of medicines.

 ► This is the first Irish study looking at the prescrib-
ing of attention- deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) 
medications in young adults.

 ► This repeated cross- sectional study examined rates 
of prescribing of ADHD medications for children and 
young adults aged up to 24 years from 2005 to 2015 
in Ireland, using negative binomial regression.

 ► The limitations are that the participants come from a 

more socially deprived population.

 ► There  was  no  clinical  information  including  indi-
cations  for  the  prescribing  of  ADHD  medications 
available.

disorder,  and  it  is  now  recognised  that  the 
symptoms  and  impairments  associated  with 
ADHD may persist into adulthood.3 4 There is 
a huge variation in the prevalence of ADHD 
in studies conducted in children and adults5–9; 
this  variation  is  thought  to  reflect  method-
ological  issues.8  10  A  meta- analysis  of  studies 
which  estimated  the  prevalence  of  ADHD 
as  defined  by  the  Diagnostic  and  Statistical 
Manual  of  Mental  Disorders,  fourth  edition 
(DSM- IV)  reported  a  prevalence  of  ADHD 
in 5.9%–7.1% in children and 5% in adults.9 
There is a paucity of data on the prevalence 
of ADHD in the Irish population; however, a 
school- based sample of urban 12–15 year- old 
children estimated that 3.7% met the criteria 
for ADHD.7

Boys and men are more commonly affected 
than  girls  and  women;  epidemiological 
studies report male:female ratios of 3-4:1.1 4 11 
ADHD is also associated with comorbid psychi-
atric conditions such as oppositional defiant

disorder  (ODD)  or  conduct  disorders  (CD),  anxiety 
disorders and mood disorders.1 12–14

Guidelines from the UK state that ADHD management 
requires  multidisciplinary  involvement  that  includes 
psychological,  behavioural  and  educational  interven-
tions  as  well  as  pharmacological  treatment.13  15  Pharma-
cotherapy  should  only  be  initiated  by  an  appropriately 
qualified  physician  with  expertise  in  ADHD.15  16  Phar-
macological  management  of  ADHD  is  indicated  as  a 
first- line  treatment  option  for  children  (6+  years)  and 
adolescents  with  severe  ADHD,  and  for  children  (6+ 
years)  and  adolescents  with  moderate  ADHD  who  have 
refused non- drug interventions or whose symptoms have 
not responded sufficiently to non- pharmacological inter-
vention.15  Medications  authorised  for  ADHD  in  Ireland 
include  stimulants  methylphenidate,  dexamfetamine 
and  lisdexamfetamine  and  non- stimulants  atomoxetine 
and  guanfacine.13  15  Adverse  effects  associated  with  the 
use of medication for ADHD include growth retardation 
and  psychiatric  disorders  with  use  of  methylphenidate 
and hepatic abnormalities and psychiatric disorders with 
use of atomoxetine.17–19 Other psychotropic medication, 
including antipsychotics and antidepressants, may also be 
used in patients with ADHD to treat associated comorbid-
ities.14 In addition, studies have reported off- label use of 
psychotropics to treat ADHD.20

The  pharmacological  management  of  ADHD  has 
increased  over  the  recent  years  in  many  countries.21–26 
A recent study from the UK found that the use of medi-
cation for treating ADHD increased eightfold from 1995 
to  2015.26  The  rise  was  most  pronounced  in  younger 
males; however, there was an increase in every age group 
including  adults;  this  was  thought  to  be  due  to  both  an 
increase in the number of patients diagnosed with ADHD 
and a higher percentage of patients with ADHD receiving 
pharmacological  treatment.26  An  Irish  study  found  that 
the  prescribing  of  ADHD  medication  increased  in  the 
paediatric population (0–15 years) from 2002 to 2011.21 
However, there are no published data on the prescribing 
patterns of medications used for ADHD in young adults 
(16–24 years) in Ireland.

Since  ADHD  also  affects  adults  it  would  be  useful 
to  assess  the  prescribing  of  ADHD  medication  used 
in young adults in Ireland and to update the previous 
study.

This  study  aimed  to:  (1)  evaluate  the  prescribing 
patterns of medications authorised for ADHD in Ireland 
from 2005 to 2015 in children (0–11 years), adolescents 
(12–15 years) and young adults (16–24 years) according 
to  gender  and  (2)  to  examine  the  concomitant  use  of 
psychotropic medication in these groups.

Study design and setting
This was a repeated cross- sectional study based on phar-
macy  claims  data  in  the  community  setting  in  Ireland. 
Data  were  obtained  from  the  Irish  General  Medical 
Services (GMS) scheme pharmacy claims database from 
the  Health  Service  Executive  Primary  Care  Reimburse-
ment Services (HSE- PCRS). The GMS database contains 
basic demographic information (age and sex) and details 
on  monthly  dispensed  medications  coded  using  the 
WHO’s  Anatomical  Therapeutic  Chemical  classification 
system for each individual within the scheme.27

Participants
Children  and  young  adults  aged  0–24  years.  The  GMS 
scheme is means tested and provides free health services 
to those who are unable to afford them. Due to eligibility 
criteria  being  based  on  level  of  income,  the  population 
covered  by  the  GMS  scheme  tends  to  represent  those 
from  more  socially  deprived  background.  However, 
there  is  a  larger  proportion  of  the  younger  and  older 
aged  population  covered  by  the  scheme.  It  represented 
35.4% those aged ≤24 years old in 2015. No information 
on diagnosis or disease condition or outcomes of medica-
tions is available. Children and young adults (≤24 years) 
on the GMS pharmacy claims database between January 
2005  and  December  2015  were  included  in  the  study. 
The maximum length of any prescription is for 1 month, 
although  shorter  durations  are  possible,  and  repeat 
prescriptions can be dispensed for up to 3 months before 
a review with the primary care physician is required.

Variables
All  authorised  and  marketed  medications  used  to 
treat  ADHD  during  the  study  period  methylphenidate 
(N06BA04),  dexamfetamine  (N06BA02), 
lisdexam-
fetamine  dimesylate  (N06BA12)  and  atomoxetine 
(N06BA09)  were  extracted  from  the  GMS  database. 
Dispensing  of  concomitant  psychotropic  medications 
were also extracted from the database including antipsy-
chotics (N05A), anxiolytics (N05B), hypnotics and seda-
tives (N05C) and antidepressants (N06A).

bias
There  were  no  adjustments  made  to  account  for  any 
potential bias in the selection of participants for the study.

Statistical analysis
All available data were used, so formal sample size calcu-
lations  were  not  included.  The  prescribing  rates  for  all 
ADHD  medications  were  compared  across  years,  age 
groups  (0–4  years,  5–11  years,  12–15  years  and  16–24 
years)  and  gender.  Denominators  for  the  calculation  of 
rates  are  available  from  the  Health  Service  Executive 
annual  reports  providing  the  total  eligible  population 
by age and gender for each year. This source is complete 
for  all  the  years  included  in  the  study  (available  at

annual prescription rates of ADHD medications and are

interpreted  as  the  prevalence  of  children/young  adults 
receiving at least one medication prescription authorised 
for ADHD per 1000 eligible GMS population (aged 0–24 
years) as of December of each year. The prescribing rates 
per  1000  eligible  GMS  population  and  associated  95% 
CIs  were  calculated  across  years,  age  groups  (0–4  years, 
5–11  years,  12–15  years  and  16–24  years)  and  gender. 
The percentage of concomitant psychotropic medication 
within those in receipt of ADHD medications was calcu-
lated for each year with 95% CIs. Concomitant referred 
to  a  coprescription  of  the  medication  within  the  same 
month.  A  linear  test  for  trend  was  used  to  examine  the 
percentage over time.

Negative  binomial  regression  was  used  to  determine 
trends  in  prevalence  over  time  with  an  offset  term 
(log(GMS population)), and year, age group, gender were 
included in the model. The negative binomial regression 
can  be  used  to  analyse  the  prevalence  risk  ratios  with 
95% CIs.28 Significance at p<0.05 was assumed. Data anal-
ysis was performed using Stata V.11 (StataCorp, College 
Station, Texas, USA) and SAS V.9.3 (SAS Institute).

Population sample
During  the  study  period,  the  number  of  children  and 
young adults (0–24 years) on ADHD drugs as identified 
from the HSE- PCRS database ranged from 1913 in 2005 
to  4853  in  2015,  of  whom  82.7%  and  78.3%  were  male 
(2005 and 2015, respectively).

Prescribing trends
The rate of any ADHD medication per 1000 eligible GMS 
population  aged  <25  years  increased  significantly  over 
time  from  5.61  (95%  CI  5.36  to  5.86)  in  2005  to  8.36 
(95% CI 8.13 to 8.60) in 2015 (p<0.0001).

2015 (p<0.0001). The percentage of patients on antipsy-
chotics slightly increased from 6% in 2005 to 8% in 2015

DISCuSSIOn
This  study  found  that  the  prescribing  rates  for  ADHD 
medications  increased  significantly  from  2005  to  2015 
for both boys/men and girls/women based on data from 
the HSE- PCRS database. The results update the findings 
from a previous Irish study undertaken in children, which 
showed  a  similar  increase  in  the  prescribing  of  psycho-
stimulants  from  2002  to  2011  and  in  addition  provide 
data  on  adolescent  usage.21  The  results  also  showed  an 
increased  use  of  concomitant  antidepressants,  antipsy-
chotics  and  hypnotics  over  time.  These  findings  are  in 
keeping with results from other epidemiological studies 

which  showed  an  increase  in  prescribing  of  medication 
for  ADHD  over  time;  a  UK  study  reported  an  eight-
fold  increase  in  prescribing  rates  over  20  years,26  while 
increasing  prescribing  rates  have  also  been  reported  in 
other  countries  including  the  USA,  Israel,  Spain,  the 
Netherlands  and  Denmark,22–25  29  during  a  similar  time 
period.

The  prescribing  rate  was  three  to  five  times  higher 
in  boys/men  than  girls/women,  which  was  expected 
based  on  previous  studies  and  on  epidemiological 
studies.1 4 11 26 29 30 These findings may also reflect underdi-
agnosis of the condition in girls,31 since the disparity in 
treatment between males and females appears to narrow 
somewhat  with  increasing  age.  It  has  been  suggested 
that the higher treatment rates in boys may relate to the 
disruptive behaviour exhibited at school and social situ-
ations,  resulting  in  higher  referral  rates  for  boys.24  The 
highest prescribing rate for males in this study occurred 
in the 12–15- year- old age group, followed by the 5–11 and 
16–24- year- old  age  groups,  respectively;  similar  patterns 
were  reported  for  the  female  age  groups.  These  results

generalisability  of  the  study  findings.26  29  The  increase 
in prescribing rates in the 16–24- year- old age group is of 
particular  interest  as  ADHD  was  previously  considered 
to  resolve  during  adolescence  and  young  adulthood.1 
However,  it  is  now  recognised  that  up  to  two- thirds  of 
those  with  childhood  ADHD  have  symptomatic  features 
continuing  into  adulthood.3  The  increased  prescribing 
rate in the 16–24- year- old age group may be reflective of 
this, and it has been reported in other studies.26 It is of 
note that during the time period of this study, there was 
concern  regarding  the  lack  of  adult  ADHD  services  in 
Ireland,  and  it  was  recognised  that  there  was  an  urgent 
need to develop adult ADHD services.32 An adult ADHD 
National Clinical Programme (NCP) has now been intro-
duced in Ireland.33

In this study, methylphenidate was the most frequently 
prescribed ADHD medication, accounting for more than 
98% of all ADHD medications in 2005 and 80% in 2015, 
followed by atomoxetine. Methylphenidate has been used 
for  the  last  50  years,  while  the  other  stimulants  dexam-
phetamine  and  lisdexamphetamine  have  only  been 
authorised  in  Ireland  since  2014  and  2013,  respectively, 
reflected  in  the  very  low  prescribing  rates  noted  in  the 
study.  The  prescribing  of  the  non- stimulant  atomoxe-
tine, which was first authorised in 2006, appears to have 
plateaued in recent years. Methylphenidate was also the 
most frequently prescribed ADHD medication in studies 
from other European countries.24 26 30 The stimulants are 
recommended  as  first- line  pharmacological  treatment, 
while the non- stimulants are only recommended if there 
are  contraindications  to  use  of  the  stimulants.11  15  The 
USA  has  a  higher  prescribing  rate  of  medications  for 
ADHD  compared  with  many  European  countries  which 
may be due to the difference in application of diagnostic 
criteria  for  ADHD.1  In  addition,  in  many  European 
countries  guidelines  recommend  that  pharmacological 
management  should  only  be  initiated  by  an  appropri-
ately  qualified  physician  with  expertise  in  ADHD.15  29  30 
However, it has also been suggested that ADHD may be 
under- recognised  in  some  European  countries.26  29  The 
increase in prescribing of ADHD medicines seen in this 
and  other  recent  studies  may  be  due  to  increased  diag-
nosis and treatment of a previously unrecognised disease. 
In Ireland, the majority of children and adolescents with 
suspected  ADHD  are  referred  to  Child  and  Adolescent 
Mental  Health  Services  (CAMHS)  for  assessment,  while 
some  children  are  assessed  by  paediatricians.34  During 
the  study  period,  there  was  an  increase  in  the  number 
of CAMHS available in Ireland from 49 in 2008 to 63 in 
2015, which may have contributed to an increase in the 
prescribing of ADHD medications during the study due 
to increased diagnosis of the condition.35

The  increase  in  prescribing  of  ADHD  medications 
reported in many countries has led to some concern that 
this  may  represent  inappropriate  prescribing  of  these 
medications.23  25  36  At  the  time  of  the  study,  pharmaco-
therapy  was  not  recommended  for  preschool  children 

Open access

and  was  recommended  as  first- line  treatment  only  for 
severe  ADHD  in  all  school- aged  children  and  young 
people.  In  addition,  pharmacological  management 
should always form part of a multidisciplinary treatment 
plan,  with  regular  monitoring  while  on  treatment.15 
Although this study showed a statistically significant rise 
in  the  rate  of  prescribing  of  ADHD  medications  during 
the  study  period,  the  rates  recorded  at  the  end  of  the 
study period (2015) are still considerably less than those 
reported  within  a  similar  UK  population  for  the  same 
time  period.26  However,  it  is  not  possible  to  comment 
definitively on the appropriateness of the ADHD medica-
tion being prescribed as clinical information is not avail-
able due to the design of the study.

This  study  also  investigated  the  coprescribing  of 
psychotropic medicines in the study group, and it found 
a  significant  increase  in  the  prescribing  of  concomitant 
psychotropic  medicines  from  2005  to  2015.  In  partic-
ular,  there  was  a  significant  increase  in  the  concomi-
tant  prescribing  of  antidepressants  from  2%  to  6%  and 
a  non- significant  increase  in  antipsychotics  from  6%  to 
8%. These trends in concomitant medicines were mostly 
evident in the adolescents/young adult with an increase 
from  4.7%  to  15.1%  in  concomitant  use  of  antidepres-
sants  and  from  5.8%  to  13.7%  for  antipsychotics  from 
2005  to  2015;  there  was  little  or  no  change  in  concom-
itant  medicines  in  those  aged  <16  years  over  time.  This 
latter results consistent with a previous Irish study which 
showed no increase in similar coprescribing over time in 
children.21 That study, which looked at coadministration 
of  psycholeptics,  antipsychotics,  anxiolytics,  hypnotics 
and sedatives and antidepressants with psychostimulants 
from  2002  to  2011,  found  that  on  average  10%  of  their 
study  participants  received  concomitant  psychotropic 
medication;  however,  the  proportion  did  not  change 
significantly over the study period.21 A study of six Euro-
pean countries from 2013 found that 14% of children and 
adolescents receiving medication for ADHD were treated 
concomitantly  with  psychotropic  medication,  ranging 
from  4.1%  in  Germany  to  33%  in  Italy.20  In  that  study, 
atypical  antipsychotics  were  the  most  commonly  used 
psychotropic medication followed by anxiolytics. A study 
from the USA in 2009 found the prevalence of concom-
itant  use  of  psychotropic  use  in  children  ranging  from 
12.6%  for  non- comorbid  ADHD  to  42%  for  comorbid 
ADHD.37 It is known that ADHD is associated with psychi-
atric comorbidities such as depression, ODD and CD,38 39 
which may explain the concomitant psychotropic medica-
tion. However, it may also be due to off- label prescribing 
for children with severe ADHD who are not responding 
to first- line ADHD monotherapy.

This study has a number of strengths including the large 
study size and accurate ascertain of medicines. However, 
there are some limitations including the lack of any clin-
ical  information  on  participants,  inclusion  of  a  more 
socially deprived population and the fact that data refer 
to  medicines  dispensed  rather  than  taken.  As  discussed 
previously, the lack of clinical information on participants

precludes comment on the appropriateness of the medi-
cation being used in the study. The inclusion of a more 
socially deprived population may limit the generalisability 
of the study findings, as there is some evidence of an asso-
ciation between socioeconomic disadvantage and risk of 
ADHD.40 In addition, there may be bias introduced as a 
result  of  the  potential  off- label  use  of  ADHD  medicines 
in the treatment of other conditions such as autistic spec-
trum  disorder  and  other  psychiatric  disorders.29  There-
fore,  the  findings  of  this  study  may  be  an  overestimate 
of  the  use  of  these  drugs  for  ADHD.  In  addition,  some 
patients  with  severe  ADHD  not  responding  to  drugs 
authorised  for  ADHD  may  be  treated  with  off- label  use 
of other drugs such as bupropion, clonidine and antipsy-
chotics,20 which will not be captured in this study.

COnCluSIOnS
Our study found an increase in the overall prescribing rates 
of ADHD medications from 2005 to 2015, principally due 
to  increased  prescribing  of  methylphenidate.  This  may 
reflect increasing awareness and diagnosis of the condi-
tion,  possibly  due  to  increased  facilities  for  managing 
neuropsychiatric illness in children and adolescents over 
time. The study also found an increase in the concomitant 
prescribing of antipsychotics and antidepressants, which 
may reflect increasing levels of comorbidity in ADHD and 
increased  access  to  child  and  adolescent  mental  health 
services over time. The findings of the study support the 
introduction  of  the  NCP  for  adult  ADHD  services  and 
the need for additional resources to CAMHS, where the 
majority of children with ADHD are assessed. It would be 
beneficial  in  future  research  studies  if  linkage  between 
prescribing data and clinical data, such as diagnosis and 
outcomes data, were possible. This would enable research 
questions on the appropriateness of ADHD and concomi-
tant medicines and the likely impact these have on short- 
term, medium- term and long- term outcomes.
