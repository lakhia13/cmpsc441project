Abstract
In this literature overview, we share with the reader challenges faced by LGBTQ + individuals pursuing medical 
education, from undergraduate to postgraduate training. The LGBTQ + acronym has evolved to encompass the 
diverse spectrum of sexual orientation and gender identities. Recently, the term “Sexual and Gender Minority” 
(SGM) has emerged as an umbrella term to provide consistency in research advancing SGM health. The unique 
obstacles LGBTQ + trainees encounter are highlighted throughout this article, including external factors influencing 
career decisions, a lack of LGBTQ + healthcare curricula, discriminatory social interactions, limited mentorship 
opportunities, and a higher mental health burden. These challenges have the capacity to affect educational 
experiences, personal well-being, and professional growth. Additionally, we examine the impact of inclusive 
institutional climates on LGBTQ + trainees’ selection of medical schools and residency programs, as they may 
prioritize inclusiveness and diversity when making their choice. In postgraduate training, LGBTQ + trainees continue 
to face challenges, exemplified by disparities in placement rates and discriminatory experiences based on sexual 
orientation and gender identity. We describe the gap in current research and its long-term impact of these 
challenges on career paths. Hostile environments persist in certain specialties, and the lack of LGBTQ + mentorship 
and support can hinder academic pursuits. We shed light on the unique and pervasive challenges faced by 
LGBTQ + trainees throughout their medical education journey, while emphasizing the need for inclusive policies, 
support systems, and research to address these challenges. With increasing research and studies, we hope to create 
a medical workforce and community that better represents the diverse communities it serves.

Background
LGBTQ + is an acronym used to identify the broad com-
munity  of  individuals  inclusive  of  all  sexual  and  gender 
minorities,  as  illustrated  in  Fig.  1.  Over  decades,  this 
acronym has continuously evolved (LGB, LGBT, LGBTQ, 
LGBTQ+, LGBTQI+, LGBTQIA+) to fit better the spec-
trum of sexual orientation and gender identities that fall 
outside the cisgender, heterosexual, and endosex experi-
ence [1].

In  2015,  the  National  Institute  of  Health,  with  the 
establishment  of  the  Sexual  and  Gender  Minority 
Research  Office,  adopted  the  term  “Sexual  and  Gender 
Minority,” or SGM, as an umbrella term to encompass: (1) 
those who identify as LGBT, queer, Two-Spirit, Asexual, 
or intersex (2) those with same-sex or -gender attractions 
or  behaviors,  and  (3)  those  with  nonbinary  constructs 
of  sexual  orientation,  gender  identity  or  gender  expres-
sion, or sexual characteristics [2]. This umbrella term was 
coined to seek consistency in future research to advance 
SGM health [2].

There  is  a  continuous  conversation  in  the  scientific 
community  regarding  the  most  representative  terminol-
ogy.  SGM  differentiates  gender  and  sexual  orientation 
but  is  not  widely  used  outside  academic  and  research 
settings  and  is  less  explicit  about  the  specific  popula-
tions being  discussed [3]. More recently,  a  shift towards 
using SGD (Sexual and Gender Diversity) has been advo-
cated  due  to  possible  negative  connotations  of  the  term 
“minority.”

Methods
This  literature  overview  surveyed  published  articles 
accessing  the  MEDLINE  and  MedEDPORTAL  data-
bases. Two authors reviewed and appraised the literature 
focusing  on  three  distinctive  domains:  (1)  pre-medical 
education  of  the  LGBTQ + individual,  (2)  undergraduate 
medical  education  of  the  LGBTQ + medical  trainee,  and 
(3)  graduate  medical  education  of  the  LGBTQ + medi-
cal  trainee.  The  findings  were  synthesized  following  a 
thematic  analysis  and  reported  narratively.  We  used  the 
terms  SGM  and  the  acronym  LGBTQ + in  this  manu-
script in correlation with their use in the medical litera-
ture and the limitation of each terminology’s context. The 
aim  of  our  literature  overview  is  to  provide  our  readers 
with  a  deeper  understanding  of  LGBTQ + individuals’ 
challenges  through  medical  training  and  the  status  of 
LGBTQ + trainees in medical education.

Advocacy for LGBTQ + trainees in medical education

Although significant strides have been made in the advo-
cacy  of  the  LGBTQ + community,  discrimination,  and 
marginalization  continue  to  be  tangible  at  different  lev-
els of societal interaction. In healthcare, efforts are being 
made to create a medical workforce that more accurately 
mirrors  the  communities  they  serve.  The  shift  aims  to 
overcome  minority  underrepresentation  in  undergradu-
ate medical education (UME) and graduate medical edu-
cation (GME) training programs, to promote educational 
curricula  for  the  medical  care  of  the  LGBTQ + patient, 
to  call  for  institutional  reform  to  support  inclusive

recruitment and work environments, and for the equita-
ble professional advancement of all trainees in the medi-
cal field.

The LGBTQ + trainee faces unique challenges through-
out medical education that could lead to disadvantageous 
training experiences and an isolated environment for for-
mative learning. Among those: (1) external factors affect-
ing their decision to join a medical school, their selection 
of specialization field, and career path [4–11], (2) lack of 
LGBTQ + health  care  educational  curricula  perpetuating 
the sense of invisibility in medical education [12–15], (3) 
discriminatory  social  interactions  with  peers  and  super-
visors  in  training  environment  [4–6,  8,  16–19,  24−27], 
(4)  limited  professional  mentorship  opportunities  and 
depleted opportunities for professional advancement [4–
7, 10, 28–30, 31], (5) complex interactions with patients 
and  their  cultural  biases  [25,  26],  and  (6)  higher  mental 
health  burden  [5,  16,  18,  19,  25,  32,  33].  Understanding 
the  complex  journey  of  LGBTQ + trainees  will  provide 
medical  educators  with  the  skill  sets  to  propel  cultural 
change  in  their  training  that  starts  at  the  bedside  and 
ends  with  adopting  more  significant  institutional  and 
national reforms.

Despite the many difficulties LGBTQ + trainees experi-
ence during their UME and GME, evidence-based guid-
ance to identify and overcome said challenges is lacking. 
This  gap  is  accentuated  as  the  LGBTQ + trainee  moves 
further into GME.

The LGBTQ + trainee journey
LGTBQ + trainees  experience  challenges  related 
to 
their  sexuality/and  or  gender  identity  early  in  their  for-
mative  years,  long  before  applying  to  medical  school. 
LGBTQ + youth  are  more  likely  to  be  bullied  and  face 
sexual  violence  than  their  cisgender,  heterosexual  peers, 
resulting  in  higher  school  dropout  rates  and  limitation 
of educational opportunities [17]. Parental rejection can 
lead  to  homelessness  and  further  curtail  educational 
opportunities  [18].  Many  LGBTQ + individuals  start  col-
lege  with  unique  personal  challenges  related  to  identity 
development,  disclosure  (“coming  out”),  establishing 
same-sex  romantic  relationships,  and  overcoming  inter-
nalized  stigma  while  experiencing  harassment,  violence, 
and  discrimination  [19].  Therefore,  resilience  and  per-
sonal  survivorship  have  been  a  significant  facet  of  the 
LGTBQ + individual’s experience by the time they achieve 
a place in medical education.

“Coming  out”  describes  the  process  of  disclosing 
one’s  sexual  and  gender  identity  to  others  and  has  been 
described as one of the most stressful yet pivotal experi-
ences that an LGBTQ + person faces in their lifetime [20]. 
Contrary  to  common  belief,  “coming  out”  is  not  a  one-
time occurrence but rather a continuous event through-
out one’s life, such as when joining a medical school and 

Page 3 of 8

throughout  medical  training  and  practice.  The  stressors 
that  accompany  the  experience  of  coming  out  can  be 
attributed  to  enacted  and  anticipated  stigma.  Enacted 
stigma  relates  to  current  and  ongoing  discrimination 
and harassment from external sources, such as at home, 
in  the  workplace,  or  within  their  community.  Antici-
pated stigma includes the expectation of adverse events, 
such  as  a  lack  of  acceptance  and  ostracism  from  fam-
ily,  friends,  colleagues,  and  society  [21].  LGBTQ + stu-
dents  in  science,  technology,  engineering,  and  math 
(STEM) are more likely to experience career limitations, 
harassment,  and  professional  devaluation  than  their 
non-LGBTQ + peers  [3].  When  compounding  these  psy-
chosocial stressors with the remarkable intensity of med-
ical training, the potential for negative mental, emotional, 
and  physical  consequences  on  the  LGBTQ + student  is 
immense.

The professional development of the LGBTQ + individ-
ual  could  be  hindered  by  factors,  founded  on  discrimi-
nation,  that  challenge  human  need  fulfillment  [22,  23]. 
We have adapted prior published work [22] and propose 
a  specific  set  of  factors  that  directly  impact  the  profes-
sional success of the LGBTQ + medical trainee following 
the Maslow’s Hierarchy of human need fulfillment theo-
retical framework in Fig. 2 [23]. The persistence of often-
times hostile environments makes the adjustment to the 
increasing  rigor  of  healthcare  disproportionately  more 
difficult  for  those  in  the  LGBTQ + community.  It  leads 
to  poorer  outcomes,  such  as  higher  levels  of  burnout 
[24], less job satisfaction, and negative mental and physi-
cal consequences [25]. Lesbian, gay, or bisexual students 
mistreated  for  their  sexual  orientation  had  an  8-fold 
higher  predicted  probability  of  burnout  compared  with 
heterosexual  students  [24],  with  a  higher  mistreatment 
rate across multiple categories (humiliation, not specific 
to  identity,  specific  to  gender,  race/ethnicity,  and  sexual 
orientation).

Factors such as geography, finances, and lifestyle come 
into  play  when  considering  the  process  of  pursuing 
medical  school.  For  many  LGBTQ + trainees,  finding  a 
welcoming and diverse school is crucial to their applica-
tion. Demographic data collection of SGM students from 
medical  school  admission  and  enrollment  processes  is 
undervalued  [34].  Certain  institutional  climates  can  be 
perceived  as  non-inclusive  and  unwelcoming  to  minori-
ties.  Even  when  institutional  policies  are  considerate  of 
sexual orientation and gender diversity, institutions must 
play an active role in recruitment that emphasizes inclu-
sive practices during recruitment and equity during med-
ical training.

A  study  among  graduating  medical  students  reported 
SGM  students  having  a  higher  proportion  of  mis-
treatment  (43.5%  vs.  23.6%)  and  discrimination  based 
on  sexual  orientation  (32.1%  vs.  1.0%)  than  their

heterosexual  counterparts  [24].  The  study  did  not  sur-
vey  for  discrimination  rate  differences  between  cis-  and 
transgender students. Higher levels of depression, lower 
levels  of  perceived  social  support,  and  more  discom-
fort  with  disclosure  of  sexual  orientation  have  been 
reported  in  LGBTQ + medical  students  compared  to 
non-LGBTQ + students,  with  most  of  their  campuses 
described  as  non-inclusive  [16].  Another  study  showed 
higher  rates  of  bullying  by  other  students  (20.0%  vs. 
13.9%) and suicide contemplation (14.8% vs. 8.8%) com-
pared to non-LGBTQ + students. Moreover, surgical spe-
cialties were perceived as having the lowest acceptance of 
LGBTQ + trainees [5].

It is also important to consider intersectionality, i.e., the 
overlapping  and  interdependent  systems  of  oppression, 
that can impact LGBTQ + trainees and professionals who 
have  additional  marginalized  identities,  including  their 
race, ethnicity, ability, and immigrant status, among oth-
ers.  For  example,  a  trainee  who  is  an  African  American 
transgender  woman  may  experience  unique  challenges 
due  to  the  complex,  cumulative,  and  intersecting  effects 
of racism, transphobia, and misogyny. Although there is 
limited research on intersectionality and LGBTQ + train-
ees,  this  phenomenon  has  been  well  described  among 
other  individuals  holding  multiple  marginalized  identi-
ties, including African American women physicians who 
experience  isolation  and  self-doubt  because  of  gender- 
and race-based macro and microaggressions [35].

Due  to  such  conditions,  LGBTQ + trainees  may  be 
more limited in personal and professional growth oppor-
tunities.  Many  states  have  become  increasingly  outspo-
ken  in  supporting  anti-LGBTQ + laws  in  recent  years. 

Florida’s  “Don’t  Say  Gay’’  bill,  initially  applied  to  grades 
K-3,  has  since  been  extended  to  ban  classroom  discus-
sion  on  sexual  orientation  and  gender  identity  up  to 
the  12th  grade  [36]. This  expansion  has  raised  concerns 
due  to  its  implications  that  threaten  to  worsen  an  exist-
ing  hostile  school  climate  for  LGBTQ + youth.  Notably, 
52%  of  LGBTQ + students  have  considered  dropping 
out  of  school  due  to  hostility,  and  72%  report  having 
no  LGBTQ + topics  taught  in  any  classes  [37].  These 
restrictions  send  a  discriminatory  message  that  being 
LGBTQ + is  wrong  and  stigmatizes  both  LGBTQ + youth 
and the community at large.

This  critical  change  and  other  decisive  attacks  on  the 
LGBTQ + community, such as SB 1438 and its attempted 
“drag ban” and Supreme Court decisions limiting affirma-
tive action in higher education and LGBTQ + protections, 
may  play  a  role  in  the  medical  school  selection  process 
for impacted applicants. LGBTQ + students in states like 
Florida  may  choose  between  pursuing  medical  educa-
tion in a traditionally more “accepting” location and sav-
ing money with in-state tuition costs. Further research is 
needed  to  evaluate  the  long-term  impact  of  mentorship 
absenteeism,  unwelcoming  training,  and  communities’ 
environments  affecting  LGBTQ + medical  students  on 
their  career  path,  professional  achievements,  and  com-
munity service.

Postgraduate training experience for the LGBTQ + trainee
While most existing literature regarding LGBTQ + train-
ees relates to student accomplishments in UME, research 
in  GME  is  limited.  The  call  for  further  exploration  into 
the  impact  of  GME  on  the  LTBTQ + trainee  is  crucial, 

Danckers et al. BMC Medical Education           (2024) 24:67  
with  research  needs  spanning  all  residency  specialties 
and more accentuated during fellowship training. So far, 
studies in post-graduate training have suggested that the 
LGBTQ + trainee’s  challenges  may  be  more  prominent 
during residency [6]. A retrospective cohort of residency 
applicants found a significant disadvantage in underrep-
resented minorities, with the highest rate of unsuccessful 
GME  placement,  and  called  for  equity  metrics  in  resi-
dency  spot  allocation  [7].  Although  this  cohort  did  not 
differentiate minority groups, we suspect the findings for 
SGM trainees would be similar, if not more discouraging.
A  large  cohort  study  addressing  disparities  in  medi-
cal  students’  placement  rates  into  graduate  medical 
programs pointed out lower rates for female and under-
represented  minority  students  [7].  Although  inequali-
ties  in  the  residency  selection  process  continue  to  be 
encountered,  a  gender  binary  limiting  option  within  the 
survey did not allow for further assessment of the place-
ment  of  non-binary  and  non-conforming  gender  medi-
cal  students  and  their  inherent  challenges.  Consensus 
reports  call  for  inclusiveness  in  these  research  tools  to 
more thoroughly capture the spectrum of sexual and gen-
der-diverse groups to mitigate underreporting and avoid 
perpetuating  their  marginalization  in  medical  education 
research [3].
When 

the 
LGBTQ + trainee  often  prioritizes  the  inclusiveness  and 
diversity  of  the  community  in  which  the  training  pro-
gram  is  located.  In  a  study  of  emergency  medicine  resi-
dency  applicants,  LGBTQ + applicants  ranked  the  ability 
to live in a particular setting (urban, suburban, and rural), 
neighborhood  and  community,  and  patient  population 
as  having  greater  average  importance  when  compared 
with non-LGBTQ + applicants [8]. Transgender and non-
binary  residents  or  recent  graduates  of  a  US  residency 
program  were  surveyed  on  their  residency  interview 
process,  revealing  that  a  high  percentage  of  applicants 
felt  unsafe  to  disclose  or  discuss  their  gender  identity 
(69.2%),  were  misnamed  or  misgendered  through  incor-
rect pronouns during their interview (42.3%) and thought 
they  were  ranked  lower  than  their  qualifications  due  to 
their gender identity (26.9%) [9].

residency

a 

Residency training continues to be disadvantageous for 
educating LGBTQ + trainees, specifically transgender and 
non-binary  residents  [26].  Alarmingly,  85%  of  transgen-
der  and  non-binary  residents  self-reported  experiencing 
microaggressions, while nearly one-quarter of transfemi-
nine and non-binary trainees reported macroaggressions, 
mostly  from  program  faculty  [26].  A  survey  conducted 
among  gender  non-binary  and  transgender  physicians 
and  medical  students  revealed  that  most  respondents 
had not disclosed their identity with their medical school 
or  residency  program.  Respondents  also  reported  that 
barriers  based  on  gender  identity/expression  are  more 

Page 5 of 8

prevalent  in  residency  [6].  Most  individuals  reported 
censoring  speech  or  mannerisms  to  avoid  unintentional 
disclosure  of  their  gender  identity  and  detail  hearing 
derogatory terms referring to transgender and nonbinary 
individuals [6].

The often-hostile training environments reported dur-
ing GME are consistent with a perpetuation of practices 
seen in UME and recruitment seasons. These inequitable 
environments require a heightened amount of resilience 
and  grit  by  the  SGM  individual  to  attain  the  same  level 
of success. As a result, these efforts can be misplaced as 
tools that amplify structural inequity and injustice rather 
than to promote success more broadly [38].

In  a  large-scale  survey  looking  at  mistreatment  in  the 
workplace among emergency medicine residents, includ-
ing  483  residents  self-identified  as  LGBTQ + trainees, 
discrimination  based  on  sexual  orientation  or  gender 
identity  was  reported  in  3.1%  of  all  residents  and  26.9% 
of  LGBTQ + residents  [9,  27].  The  same  study  reported 
that  most  LGBTQ + trainees  who  reported  discrimina-
tion  identified  patients  and/or  their  families  as  the  pri-
mary source of discrimination (56.2%), followed by other 
residents  (13.8%)  and  attending  physicians  (11.5%)  [27]. 
An  adjusted  model  showed  that  LGBTQ + trainees  were 
two  times  more  likely  to  have  suicidal  thoughts  than 
their  non-LGBTQ + counterparts  [27].  A  quality  study 
with  significant  medical  trainee  representation  reported 
biases  ranging  from  patient  refusal  of  care,  to  explic-
itly  racist,  sexist,  or  homophobic  remarks  and  belittling 
compliments  or  jokes.  In  this  study,  targeted  physicians 
reported  emotional  responses  such  as  exhaustion,  self-
doubt,  and  cynicism,  while  non-targeted  bystanders 
expressed  moral  distress  and  uncertainty  about  how  to 
respond [28].

Social  factors  also  play  a  significant  role  in  the  choice 
of residency and fellowship for the LGBTQ + trainee, yet 
little is known about their selection process and determi-
nants.  AAMC  US  Physician  Workforce  data  from  2019 
showed that racial minorities are vastly underrepresented 
in  medicine,  with  surgery  failing  the  most  to  address 
this social disparity [39]. The surgical field has tradition-
ally  been  perceived  as  a  non-diverse  training  field  with 
a  predominantly  white  heterosexual  cis-male  trainee 
population  [5]  that  lacks  diversity.  This  environment, 
described  by  some  medical  trainees  as  a  “boys  club”  or 
“fraternity”  [5],  could  intentionally  or  not,  unwelcome 
LGBTQ + trainees.  A  2022  survey  completed  by  almost 
6,000  residents  showed  that  SGM  trainees,  specifically 
general  surgery,  represent  approximately  5%  of  the  total 
resident  body  but  report  a  statistically  significant  differ-
ence  in  harassment,  mistreatment,  bullying,  discrimina-
tion,  homophobic  remarks,  and  suicidality,  primarily 
from attending physicians [40]. These results are consis-
tent with previous studies and reviews [29, 39, 41].

Danckers et al. BMC Medical Education           (2024) 24:67 LGBTQ + trainees  might  shy  away  from  surgical  fields 
due  to  scarce  LGBTQ + faculty  and  mentoring.  Train-
ees may doubt fair academic promotion and support for 
research opportunities in LGBTQ + health. Trainees may 
also  experience  fear  of  reprisal,  worry  of  increased  ani-
mosity,  the  belief  that  nothing  would  be  done,  and  lack 
of safety of support [29, 40]. This could be substantial in 
specialties  and  subspecialties  that  do  not  challenge  the 
assumption  of  trainee  homogeneity  and  perpetuate  a 
trainee stereotype apt for professional success.

Other prestigious specialties, determined by an objec-
tive index that included the number of available positions 
and median income, have also been reported as less SGM 
inclusive  [10].  Studies  have  shown  that  SGM  trainees 
perceive certain specialties as more inclusive (psychiatry, 
family  medicine,  pediatrics,  preventative  medicine,  and 
internal medicine) and others as less inclusive (orthope-
dics, neurosurgery, thoracic surgery, general surgery, and 
colorectal surgery) [10]. Sex and gender identity strongly 
influence  LGBTQ + trainees’  specialty  of  choice,  along 
with  other  determinants  like  personality  fit,  specialty 
content, and work-life balance [10].

Internal  medicine  subspecialty  fellowship  pipelines, 
such as pulmonary and critical care medicine, have pla-
teaued in terms of gender diversity from 2009 to 2018 and 
have worsened for racial and ethnic groups trainee repre-
sentation  [11].  A  specific  pipeline  for  LGBTQ + trainees 
remains  unknown,  and  the  factors  impacting  its  course 
are understudied.

During 

interest 

fellowship 

training, 
their  residency  and 
LGBTQ + trainees  report  high 
in  pursuing 
careers  in  academia.  In  a  survey  of  54  LGBTQ + train-
ees  and  health  care  providers,  81.1%  of  trained  physi-
cians were interested in academia [4]. LGBTQ + trainees’ 
interests were positively impacted by their desire to help 
others  succeed,  teaching,  the  competitive  nature  of  the 
position, compatibility with personality and interest, and 
the  mentor/role  model  influence  [4].  The  poor  recogni-
tion of LGBTQ + scholarship, lack of LGBTQ + mentoring 
and  networking  opportunities,  and  hostile  institutional 
climates  were  barriers  to  pursuing  an  academic  career 
[4].  One  in  five  trainees  reported  that  their  academic 
health  centers  did  not  provide  a  supportive  environ-
ment  for  LGBTQ+-related  research  and  educational 
activities or engage in service or community activities in 
LGBTQ + care [4].

Highly  qualified  LGBTQ + providers  completing  their 
training  may  select  urban  over  rural  areas  to  seek  well-
established  LGBTQ + communities  in  cities  perceived  as 
friendly for personal and professional development. This 
geographic limitation may impair the LGBTQ + trainee in 
selecting a highly desirable job, as they seek positions not 
based on their qualifications but on social adaptation and 
future well-being.

Faculty  may  be  unaware  of  crucial  social  aspects 
and  fail  to  meet  the  needs  of  LGBTQ + patients  [42, 
43].  Furthermore,  there  is  a  high  likelihood  that  faculty 
and  training  peers  might  have  never  knowingly  inter-
acted  with  LGBTQ + individuals,  perpetuating  bias 
towards  LGBTQ + trainees.  The  amount  of  contact  with 
LGBTQ + faculty,  residents,  students,  and  patients,  and 
the perceived quality of that contact, has been associated 
with reduced explicit bias in medical training [44].

In the search for social change in GME, most training 
programs’  curricula  have  started  to  emphasize  binary 
gender equity and racial minority diversity and inclusion. 
The inclusion of SGM groups may carry less emphasis in 
these initiatives. Equality for the LGBTQ + community is 
expanding rapidly, and the healthcare system and medical 
education should serve as an example of that expansion.

To begin to address these inadequacies, evidence-based 
strategies  must  be  implemented.  Successful  higher-level 
interventions  aimed  to  target  LGBTQ + health  cur-
ricula  include  diverse  instructional  methods  such  as 
lecture-based  didactics,  online  modules,  and  simula-
tions.  Longitudinal  curricula,  like  the  LGBTQ  Health 
Pathway, have been effective within UME, incorporating 
preclinical and clinical components such as online mod-
ules,  didactic  courses,  longitudinal  community  service/
advocacy  work,  a  scholarly  project,  and  a  clinical  clerk-
ship in LGBTQ + health [45]. Pathways such as this could 
theoretically  be  molded  for  GME  and  specialty-specific 
training.

trainees’  confidence,  professional 

Furthermore,  at  the  individual  level,  mentorship  can 
play  a  crucial  role,  with  LGBTQ + mentors  positively 
influencing 
suc-
cess,  and  sense  of  belonging.  Mentorship  and  sponsor-
ship,  whether  through  established  processes  or  organic 
trainee-faculty interactions, can foster a sense of belong-
ing  while  cultivating  the  professional  development  of 
both  the  mentee  and  mentor  [46].  The  evidence-based 
strategies  presented  here  only  scratch  the  surface,  and 
comprehensive  changes  must  occur  at  multiple  levels 
(individual, program-level, institutional, societal, etc.)

Conclusion
In  conclusion,  LGBTQ + trainees  face  unique  medi-
cal  education  challenges  extending  from  undergraduate 
medical education to postgraduate training and beyond. 
The  SGM  trainee’s  journey  toward  acceptance  and  self-
discovery  requires  exceptional  resiliency  and  survi-
vorship.  Challenges  encountered  during  UME  include 
external factors, such as financial limitations, lack of rep-
resentative curriculum, inflammatory social interactions, 
inadequate  mentorship  opportunities,  discriminatory 
interactions with patients, and a significant mental health 
burden.  Furthermore,  harsh  training  environments  and 
discriminatory  practices  in  GME  tend  to  perpetuate

evidence-based  guidance  to  overcome  these  challenges 
is  still  lacking,  particularly  when  considering  GME. 
Medical educators and administrators must work toward 
understanding the complex journey of LGBTQ + trainees 
and provide them with the necessary skill sets to succeed 
and  propel  meaningful  cultural  change.  This  essential 
shift  toward  inclusivity  can  potentially  create  a  medical 
workforce that more accurately mirrors the colorful com-
munity it serves.
