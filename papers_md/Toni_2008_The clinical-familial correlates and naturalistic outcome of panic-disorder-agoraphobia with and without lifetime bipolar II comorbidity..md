Abstract
Background: Much of the literature on panic disorder (PD)-bipolar disorder (BP) cormorbidity concerns BP-I. This
literature emphasizes the difficulties encountered in pharmacologic treatment and outcome when such comorbidity is
present. The present report explores these issues with respect to BP-II.

Methods:  The  sample  comprised  326  outpatients  (aged  34.5  ±  11.5  years  old;  222  females)  with  Diagnostic  and
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 3rd edn, revised (DSM-III-R) PD-agoraphobia; among them 52 subjects (16%) were
affected by lifetime comorbidity with BP-II. Patients were evaluated by means of the Structured Clinical Interview for
DSM-IV (SCID), the Panic-Agoraphobia Interview, and the Longitudinal Interview Follow-up Examination (Life-Up) and
treated according to routine clinical practice at the University of Pisa, Italy, for a period of 3 years. Clinical and course
features  were  compared  between  subjects  with  and  without  BP-II.  All  patients  received  the  clinicians'  choice  of
antidepressants and, in the case of the subsample with BP-II, mood stabilizers (for example, valproate, lithium) were
among the mainstays of treatment.

Results:  In  comparison  to  patients  without  bipolar  comorbidity,  those  with  BP-II  showed  a  significantly  greater
frequency  of  social  phobia,  obsessive-compulsive  disorder,  alcohol-related  disorders,  and  separation  anxiety  during
childhood and adolescence. Regarding family history, a significantly greater frequency of PD and mood disorders was
present  among  the  BP-II.  No  significant  differences  were  observed  in  the  long-term  course  of  PD  or  agoraphobic
symptoms under pharmacological treatment or the likelihood of spontaneous pharmacological treatment interruptions.

Conclusion: Although the severity and outcome of panic-agoraphobic symptomatology appear to be similar in patients
with and without lifetime bipolar comorbidity, the higher number of concomitant disorders in our PD patients with BP-
II does indicate a greater complexity of the clinical picture in this naturalistic study. That such complexity does not seem
to translate into poorer response and outcome in those with comorbid soft bipolarity probably reflects the fact that we
had brought BP-II under control with mood stabilizers. We discuss the implications of our findings as further evidence
for the existence of a distinct anxious-bipolar diathesis.

Background
Frequent  comorbidity  between  panic  disorder  (PD)  and
mood disorders has been widely reported in clinical [1-6]
and  epidemiological  studies  [7-14].  Previously,  most  of
this research has been essentially limited to the co-occur-
rence of PD and unipolar disorders; recently, an increas-
ing  attention  has  been  paid  to  the  co-occurrence  of  PD
and bipolar disorders (BP) [1,4,15-20].

Analyzing data from the Epidemiological Catchment Area
(ECA) study, Chen and Dilsaver [8] reported that the life-
time prevalence of PD was 20.8% in individuals with BP,
compared with 10% in those with unipolar major depres-
sion, and 0.8% in the general population. In the National
Comorbidity Survey [11], the reported risk of comorbid
PD  is  higher  in  bipolar  than  in  unipolar  disorder  (odd
ratios  respectively  11.0  vs  7.0).  Similar  data,  including
high rates of PD-BP-II comorbidity, has emerged in epide-
miological  studies  conducted  in  European  populations
[14,21,22].

In  clinical  studies  13%  to  23%  of  adults  with  PD  were
found to have comorbid BP [19,23-25]. Conversely, in BP
patients, rates of comorbid PD range from 10% to 80%
[1,8,16,20,24].  The  majority  of  information  on  PD
comorbidity in patients with BP has been drawn from BP-
I samples [10,26-29]. Only a few studies focused on BP-II
disorder [18,30]. This relative neglect of PD-BP-II comor-
bidity is surprising, given the fact that BP-II seems to be
the most common bipolar phenotype in patients treated
for major depression and/or PD [18,31].

Several  studies  [32,33]  have  suggested  that  BP  and  PD
share common familial and genetic factors. In a follow-up
study, MacKinnon et al. [32] reported an unusually high
prevalence of PD in 57 families of probands with BP. A
linkage  to  markers  on  the  long  arm  of  chromosome  18
was observed only in families of BP probands with comor-
bid PD. In a recent study [33] on first-degree relatives (n =
966) of probands with bipolar I disorder (n = 192) and
schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type (n = 11), more than
90%  of  subjects  with  PD  also  had  an  affective  disorder,
and PD was present in 17% of the relatives with recurrent
affective disorder compared with 3% of the relatives with-
out recurrent major affective disorder. These findings are
consistent with the hypothesis that familial BP increases
the risk for PD and this latter may be an index of genetic
heterogeneity in BP.

The association between PD and BP also raises important
questions  from  clinical  and  therapeutic  points  of  view.
Most information in the literature is on patients with BP-
I and comorbid PD: they have more frequent mixed symp-
tomatology and suicidality, early onset panic attacks, and
significant increases in drug abuse and in physical mor-

bidity [1,17,20,34]. Moreover, history of panic attacks in
BP proved to be a significant correlate of non-remission;
type  I  BP  patients  with  comorbid  PD  often  require  a
greater number of medications, either sequentially or in
combination,  in  order  to  achieve  remission  [17].  Less
information is available on patients with PD and comor-
bid BP-II; open reports indicated that they are more diffi-
cult  to  treat  than  patients  without  such  comorbidity
[23,25,31].

In order  to explore the clinical and therapeutic implica-
tions of comorbid BP-II, we analyzed data concerning 326
consecutive patients who sought medical help for PD and
who  were  treated  according  to  routine  clinical  practice
and followed-up for a 3-year period.

Materials and methods
Study sample
The sample comprised 326 consecutive outpatients with
PD-agoraphobia evaluated and treated at the Psychiatric
Institute  of  the  University  of  Pisa,  Italy,  from  1991  to
1995, and followed for a period of 3 years. The major aim
of the study was to describe the course and the evolution
PD-agoraphobia  in  a  setting  of  routine  clinical  practice.
The study constitutes an offshoot from the Pisa-Memphis
(now  San  Diego)  collaboration  on  the  phenomenology
and outcome of affective and related disorders.

Inclusion criteria for the present protocol were (1) a prin-
cipal  diagnosis  of  PD  with  or  without  agoraphobia
according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
Disorders  3rd  edn,  revised  (DSM-III-R)  criteria,  (2)
absence  of  severe  physical  and  laboratory  abnormalities
and  (3)  absence  of  current  psychotic  disorders  (last  6
months).  Previous  psychotic  features  during  depressive
episodes  or  depressive  mixed  states  did  not  represent
exclusion criteria. All patients gave informed consent for
their participation in the study.

All patients were evaluated by the senior psychiatrists on
the project (GP and CT) to ensure that admission criteria
were met. Presence of a current or past history of mood or
other  anxiety  disorders  (lifetime  comorbidity)  was  not
considered as exclusion criteria to ensure the selection of
patients that covered the full range of the clinical universe
applying for treatment.

The mean age of our sample at the time of admission into
the study was 34.5 (SD = 11.5, range = 18–73) and 222
(68.1%) were female. Mean age at onset was 29.3 (SD =
10.7, range = 6–64) for PD and 30.1 (SD = 9.2, range =
14–58)  for  agoraphobia.  Agoraphobia  was  present  in
92.6% (n = 302) of the sample.

Methods
An intensive face-to-face interview that consisted of struc-
tured and semi-structured components was used to collect
data. The interview lasted approximately 1 h at baseline,
and 0.5 h for subsequent visits. The interviews were per-
formed by senior residents with extensive clinical experi-
ence in the diagnosis and treatment of anxiety disorders.
Each interviewer underwent a training program in the use
of the interview instruments that included direct observa-
tion of experienced interviewer, and inter-rater trials. The
interviewers  were  not  involved  in  treatment  decisions,
which were entrusted to an independent clinician.

At baseline patients were evaluated by means of the Struc-
tured  Clinical  Interview  for  Diagnosis  (SCID)  [35],  the
Panic  Disorder/Agoraphobia  Interview  [36,37]  and  the
Longitudinal Interview Follow-up Examination (Life-Up)
[38]. Life-Up has been designed to be administered every
6  months;  however,  as  accuracy  is  duly  enhanced  by
shorter intervals, it can be administered more frequently
according  to  the  specific  design  of  a given study. In  our
case, it was administered during the periodic visits at every
2  months  or  at  shorter  intervals,  as  dictated  by  clinical
necessity. Patients who interrupted follow-up assessment
were contacted at the end of the 3 years of follow-up and
evaluated by means of a semi-structured interview, widely
utilized in the World-Wide Upjohn Follow-up Study [39].
This particular  interview lasted 30–40 min and was car-
ried out face to face or by phone.

High reliability for both principal (k = 0.96) and comor-
bid (kappa from 0.80 to 0.93) diagnoses have been docu-
mented in a subsample (n = 15).

Panic Disorder/Agoraphobia Interview
This  instrument  is  subdivided  into  different  sections
exploring: (1) demographic characteristics, based on the
Adult Demographic and Personal Inventory [40]; (2) fam-
ily  history  of  anxiety,  mood  and  other  disorders  in  first
degree relatives, based on Winokur's approach as incorpo-
rated  into  the  Family  History  version  of  the  Research
Diagnostic  Criteria  [41];  (3)  personal  history  of  the
patient using the first panic attack as the primary anchor-
ing  point.  Once  the  period  of  the  first  panic  attack  was
described, the number of years preceding and following
this event was reviewed with particular focus on the symp-
tomatological characteristics of PD, the course of the ill-
ness  and  comorbidity  with  other  mental  disorders;  and
(4)  affective  temperaments  according  to  Akiskal  and
Mallya [42] criteria and avoidant and dependent person-
ality disorders according to DSM-III-R criteria, the former
now shown to have good reliability and internal consist-
ency  in  the  Temperament  Evaluation  of  Memphis,  Pisa,
Paris  and  San  Diego,  Interview  version  (TEMPS-I)  [43],

and the latter based on the corresponding sections of the
SCID [44].

Life-Up
This is a semi-structured interview and rating system for
assessing the longitudinal course of psychiatric disorders
in sufficient detail to enable researchers to date individual
episodes of any psychiatric disorder and thus to provide
the basis for precise calculation of time to recovery, length
of  ensuing  wellness  intervals,  and  time  to  subsequent
relapse or recurrence. The instrument [38] consists of dif-
ferent  sections  geared  to  assess  psychopathological  fea-
tures,  obtain  history  for  psychiatric  treatment  and
psychosocial functioning, as well as that for non-psychiat-
ric medical illness. Finally, the Life-Up provides a global
assessment  scale  according  to  which  the  overall  health
and functioning of the patients are indicated. PD and ago-
raphobia  severity  is  recorded  week  by  week  on  a  score
scale ranging from 1 to 6.

According to this  instrument,  'remission' is  defined as  a
period of 8 weeks during which patients with PD have no
attacks, though sometimes they may feel on the verge of
an  acute  attack.  'Recurrence'  is  defined as a  period  of  at
least  4  weeks  during  which  patients  have  one  or  more
panic attacks per day, or a persistent fear of them. For ago-
raphobia, 'remission' is defined as the absence of avoid-
ance for a period of 8 weeks, while 'recurrence' defines a
period  of  at  least  4  weeks,  during  which  avoidance  is
present.

Drop-out Interview
This instrument is specifically designed to explore symp-
toms,  disability,  help  seeking  and  medications  after  the
end of the study and in the last year [39]. After the regis-
tration of the reasons of interruption, such as remission,
inefficacy  of  the  treatment,  side  effects,  distance  to  the
clinic, onset of other medical diseases, etc., the course of
the  illness  was  investigated. In  this  way,  remissions and
recurrences throughout the period from the interruption
of  the  study  to  the  moment  of  the  interview  were
recorded.  Moreover,  drugs  that  had  been  taken  during
that period were registered.

Treatment management
Clinicians involved in the treatment decisions and man-
agement were independent from the raters. Patients were
treated according to routine clinical practice with antide-
pressants.  Most  of  them  received  imipramine  (n  =  127,
39%), clomipramine (n = 93, 28.5%) or paroxetine (n =
76,  23.3%).  Only  a  few  patients  (n  =  30,  9.2%)  were
assigned  to  other  medications,  such  as  fluvoxamine,
fluoxetine, citalopram or trimipramine, when, according
to the individual physician's judgment, it was not possible

to  treat  them  with  the  former  drugs,  either  because  of
hypersensitivity or previous negative experiences.

In  the  first  years  of  the  study,  tricyclic  antidepressants
(TCAs) represented the best known antipanic agents and
for  this  reason  they  have  been  widely  employed  in  our
patients.  Subsequently,  the  acquisition  of  the  antipanic
properties  of  paroxetine  [45]  has  prompted  the  use  of
these new compounds in the outpatients enrolled in the
follow-up study. Only since 1995 has paroxetine emerged
in our experience as a viable first line intervention drug for
PD-agoraphobia.  Initially,  paroxetine  was  prescribed  to
patients judged less severe. Subsequently, paroxetine was
also  prescribed  to  those  subjects  for  whom  TCAs  were
contraindicated, as well as in those who had shown a jit-
teriness  syndrome  or  supersensitivity  to  anticholinergic
side effects. The initial dose was for 10 mg of imipramine
or  clomipramine  and  10  mg  of  paroxetine.  Dosage  was
gradually increased (10 mg every 2 days for TCAs and 5
mg every 4 days for paroxetine) to a maximum of 300 mg
and  40–50  mg  respectively.  The  treating  clinician  could
raise  or  lower  the  dose,  depending  upon  the  individual
patient's clinical state or side effects. After the first 4 weeks
of  treatment  and  during  each  subsequent  interval
assessed, most patients remained on nearly the same dose
of antidepressant. At the fourth week, the daily mean dos-
ages of imipramine, clomipramine and paroxetine were,
respectively, 132.6 ± 74.3 mg/day (range 30–250), 109.3
± 84.6 mg/day (range 40–300), and 28.7 ± 14.6 mg/day
(range 10–60). Superposable values were observed at the
beginning of the first remission (imipramine, 116 ± 79.8
mg/day, range 30–300; clomipramine, 126.2 ± 73.8 mg/
day, range 25–250; paroxetine, 30.6 ± 11.2 mg/day, range
10–50) and  at the last  evaluation (imipramine,  121.8 ±
81.2 mg/day, range 30–300; clomipramine, 115.9 ± 74.4
mg/day, range 25–250; paroxetine, 28.6 ± 10.2 mg/day,
range  10–50).  No  statistically  significant  differences  in
daily  mean  dose  of  antidepressants  were  observed
between patients with or without bipolar II comorbidity.

At baseline, for those patients who were taking benzodi-
azepines (BDZ) a gradual tapering was scheduled. Subse-
quently,  the  administration  of  BDZ  was  allowed  only
occasionally when absolutely unavoidable.

When comorbidity with BP-II was present, mood stabiliz-
ers such as valproate or lithium were prescribed. The latter
was based on clinicians' judgment, according to routine
clinical practice. All bipolar patients were deemed by the
investigators to have derived maximum benefit from the
treatment with mood stabilizers prior to receiving antide-
pressants.  At  the  time  the  latter  were  started,  PD/agora-
phobia was present at a clinical level in all subjects.

Statistics
Statistical  comparisons  between  patients  with  PD  (n  =
274) and PD+BP-II (n = 52) were conducted by means of
analysis of variance (ANOVA) and chi-square analysis for
continuous  and  categorical  variables,  respectively.  Kap-
lan-Maier survival analysis was utilized to define the rela-
tionship between PD course (length of periods free from
the illness and number of recurrences) and the presence of
comorbid BP-II.

Results
Of  the  326  PD  patients  of  our  sample,  52  (16%)  had
comorbid  BP-II.  At  the  time  that  treatment  with  antide-
pressants was started, none of them were suffering from
hypomanic episode, but a major depressive episode pre-
sented in 21 (40.4%) vs 91 (33.2%) subjects, respectively
in the group with and without bipolar II comorbidity (chi
square = 1.0; p = not significant (NS)).

Comparisons between bipolar patients and those without
BP-II showed similar results with respect to demographic
and clinical features, such as age, sex distribution, age at
onset, length of illness, presence of agoraphobia, person-
ality  and  temperamental  features, as well  as  the  severity
scores  of  PD  and  agoraphobia  and  Global  Adjustment
Score (GAS) at baseline evaluation (Table 1).

Some statistically significant differences were observed as
regards  the  lifetime  presence  of  other  comorbid  mental
disorders:  patients  with  BP-II  showed  a  significantly
greater frequency of social phobia and obsessive-compul-
sive disorder, as well as alcohol-related disorders, in com-
parison  with  patients  without  bipolar  comorbidity.
Bipolar  patients  were  also  significantly  more  likely  to
report  a  positive  history  of  separation  anxiety  during
childhood  and  adolescence.  The  presence  of  comorbid
generalized  anxiety disorder  was  not  significantly  differ-
ent between the two groups (Table 1).

As regards family history, a significantly greater frequency
of PD-agoraphobia was present in the group with BP, as
well as a greater familial load for mood disorders. Family
history of substance-related disorders (including alcohol)
was similar in the two groups (Table 1).

No significant differences were observed in the efficacy of
the various drug treatments (Table 2). Likewise, the com-
parison  between  bipolar  and  non-bipolar  PD  patients
showed  that  the  presence  of BP-II  did  not  influence  the
likelihood of staying in the follow-up or interrupting the
pharmacological  treatment  for  various  reasons,  such  as
remission or ineffectiveness (Table 3). Moreover, the pres-
ence of comorbidity with BP-II did not appear to have sig-
nificant  effects  on  the  long-term  course  of  either  PD  or
agoraphobia. Kaplan-Maier survival analysis showed that

Discussion
This  study  evaluates  the  prevalence  of  BP-II  lifetime
comorbidity and its consequences on clinical features and
treatment response in a large group of PD outpatients fol-
lowed in a naturalistic setting of routine pharmacological
treatment.  To  our  knowledge,  this  is  the  first  study  that
has dealt with the impact of BP-II on the course of PD in
patients selected on the basis of PD-agoraphobia as a prin-
cipal diagnosis. The 16% prevalence rate of comorbid BP-
II  in  our  patients  is  consistent  with  those  observed  in
other  clinical  samples  selected  with  similar  criteria
[19,23,25]. The findings from different psychiatric centers
in both Europe and the US go against a common percep-
tion that the relationship between anxiety and mood dis-
orders  is  largely  limited  to  unipolar  depression  and
dysthymia. The importance of screening all PD-agorapho-
bic patients for past hypomania should be emphasized.

We did not find any significant effect of BP-II comorbidity
on the clinical features of PD, including those related to
the  severity  of  the  disease  such  as  age  at  onset  of  panic
attacks,  baseline  severity  of  PD-agoraphobia,  general
adjustment scores, and length of illness. Moreover, such
comorbidity does not appear to have significant effects on
the  long-term  outcome  of  the  PD-agoraphobia,  as  indi-
cated by the mean duration of the remission or the relapse
periods.  Even  the  responses  to  pharmacological  therapy
and the patients' adherence to long-term drug treatment
do not appear to be significantly influenced by the pres-
ence of BP-II.

[8,17,23,34,46]. This discrepancy might be accounted for
by the different criteria used for the selection of the sam-
ple.  In  fact,  whereas  other  clinical  studies  typically
described  inpatients  with  mania  and/or  mixed  mania
with  concomitant  PD,  the  present  study  focused  on  PD
outpatients with comorbid BP-II. This choice was justified
by  growing  evidence  that  limiting  the  diagnosis  of  the
bipolar spectrum disorders to the classical type I form is
too  restrictive  and  severely  underestimates  the  presence
and impact of the bipolar disease [2,47,48].

Moreover, the present study aimed to investigate the pres-
ence and the implications of bipolar comorbidity on PD-
agoraphobia  in  a  naturalistic  setting  of  routine  clinical
practice, and BP-II is the most common form of bipolarity
in such a setting [49]. Broadening the inclusion of bipo-
larity to less severe, softer and more prevalent forms might
account for the milder effects of bipolar comorbidity on
the  severity  and  course  of  PD-agoraphobia  that  were
found in our sample.

BP-II comorbidity, nonetheless, appears to influence the
pattern of lifetime clinical features in PD patients, espe-
cially with regard to the presence of alcohol and substance
use  and  other  concomitant  anxiety  disorders,  such  as
social  phobia  and  obsessive-compulsive  disorders.  The
coexistence of multiple anxiety and substance-related dis-
orders with bipolarity has been reported in previous clin-
ical studies [48,50,51].

Previous clinical studies on BP-I patients with comorbid
PD showed more severe symptomatology with early onset
of  panic  attacks.  Moreover,  they  were  more  difficult  to

Although  the  severity  and  the  outcome  of  panic-agora-
phobic  symptomatology  seem  to  be  similar  in  patients
with and without BP-II comorbidity, the higher number

of  concomitant  disorders  in  our  PD  patients  with  BP-II
indicated a greater complexity of the overall clinical pic-
ture.  The  latter  might  explain  the  treatment  difficulties
reported in open clinical observations [23,25,31]. The fact
that our center specializes in BP-II may have led to opti-
mal or reasonable stabilization of the bipolar component
of the comorbidity in the present sample.

Another interesting finding is the presence of higher rates
of  childhood  separation  anxiety  among  subjects  with
comorbid  BP-II  in  comparison  with  other  PD  patients.
Anxious  bipolarity  thus  appears  to  be  related  to  a  more
intense vulnerability for early onset phobic-anxious man-
ifestations,  indicating  that  clinical  complexity  in  these
patients extends to childhood precursors of PD-agorapho-
bia [52].

The  pattern  of  complex  relationships  among  PD  and
mood  disorders  would  require  better-designed  prospec-
tive  observations.  Nonetheless,  the  validity  of  the  phe-
nomenon  of  anxious-bipolar  comorbidity  should  no
longer be in doubt. This relationship is further suggested
by  our  finding  of  a  stronger  load  of  PD-agoraphobia
among the first-degree relatives of PD subjects with BP-II.
Previous  reports  from  family  studies  have  also  reported
high prevalence rates of PD in families with a high load of
bipolar disorder [32,33].

Our  findings  are  consistent  with  the  hypothesis  that,  at
least in a significant minority of cases, PD and BP-II may
share common familial and genetic factors, and these fac-
tors  may  influence  the  earliest  manifestations  of  the
panic-agoraphobic  syndrome  and  the  complexity  of  the
longitudinal clinical picture. By contrast, bipolar comor-
bidity  does  not  seem  to  have  significant  effects  on  the
severity of the core symptomatological features, as well as
the clinical  course  or  response to treatments of  the  full-
blown panic-agoraphobic syndrome that, hypothetically,
appears  to  be  shaped  by  other  factors,  possibly  distinct
and unrelated to BP comorbidity.

Other  attractive  theoretical  possibilities  must  be  consid-
ered too. Indeed, the recognition of bipolar comorbidity
in PD patients has relevant theoretical and practical impli-

taken 

should  be 

cations.  In  hypothesizing  a  putative  common  substrate,
the  fact  that  not  only  depression  but  also  (hypo)mania
and mixed states frequently coexist with anxious-phobic
symptomatology 
into  account.
Hypomanic switches on antidepressants or alcohol repre-
sent frequent coexisting mood states in the longitudinal
history of many PD patients [1,4,18,53]. In a more theo-
retical vein, we submit that the foregoing considerations
challenge the view that anxiety and bipolar spectrum dis-
orders are completely independent syndromes, and they
stress the advantage of diagnosing such comorbidity from
the  psychopathological,  clinical,  and  public  health  per-
spectives. To recapitulate what we have advanced in the
present work, the co-occurrence of bipolar and panic-ago-
raphobic  spectra  suggests  that a  distinct  anxious-bipolar
diathesis does exist. Most panic-agoraphobic disorders are
probably unrelated to such an entity. By contrast, a sub-
stantial proportion of BP-II might belong to the joint anx-
ious-bipolar  diathesis,  possibly  part  of  an  even  broader
spectrum of psychopathology [48].

One  important  caveat  of  this  study  is  that  we  focused
herein on the pharmacologic treatment of the PD-agora-
phobia in otherwise mood stabilized BP-II. The optimum
treatment  of  BP-II  in  the  presence  of  panic-agoraphobic
disorders, often also comorbid with social phobia, repre-
sents  a  therapeutic  challenge  to  clinicians.  Such  panic-
agoraphobia  comorbidity  has  been  described  with  BP-I,
with delayed and poorer naturalization outcome for the
bipolar disorder [54]. In our clinical experience, the same
is equally true for BP-II, unless it is stabilized before insti-
tuting pharmacologic treatments for the anxious comor-
bidity.  This  topic  will  be  the  subject  of  a  subsequent
manuscript by our group.
