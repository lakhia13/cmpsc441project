Abstract

Background/Objectives: Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) frequently overlaps with
trauma-related conditions, particularly PTSD and Complex PTSD (cPTSD). Adverse Child-
hood Experiences (ACEs)—especially emotional and sexual abuse—are considered key
factors in the development of emotion dysregulation and dissociation. This study inves-
tigates the impact of different ACE dimensions on borderline symptomatology, emotion
dysregulation, and dissociative symptoms. Methods: Eighty-three BPD patients were as-
sessed using standardized self-report questionnaires: CTQ-SF (ACEs), DERS (emotion dys-
regulation), DES (dissociation), BSL-23 (borderline symptoms), and PDS-3 (post-traumatic
symptoms). Analyses included bivariate correlations, Structural Equation Modeling (SEM),
and Exploratory Graph Analysis (EGA). Results: Emotional abuse significantly predicted
borderline symptoms, while sexual abuse predicted dissociation. Emotion dysregulation
was strongly associated with both borderline and dissociative symptoms, emerging as
a central node in the symptom network. EGA confirmed the clustering of dissociative
symptoms with sexual abuse and the centrality of emotion dysregulation across domains.
Conclusions: Findings support the role of specific ACEs in shaping the clinical expres-
sion of BPD. Emotion dysregulation acts as a key transdiagnostic factor linking trauma
history to borderline and dissociative features. These results underscore the importance of
trauma-informed assessments and interventions, such as DBT and DBT-PTSD, tailored to
individual ACE profiles.

that shape their clinical profiles. Recent research has focused on these specific traits to
enhance diagnostic clarity and inform treatment strategies.

BPD [1] is classified among personality disorders, with an estimated prevalence of
1–2% in the general population and substantially higher rates in clinical settings (10–20%),
making it one of the most frequently diagnosed personality disorders [2]. According to the
categorical model of the DSM-5-TR, BPD is diagnosed by meeting five out of nine main cri-
teria, including: (1) frantic efforts to avoid real or imagined abandonment, (2) unstable and
intense interpersonal relationships, (3) identity and self-image disturbances, (4) impulsivity
in at least two self-damaging areas, (5) recurrent self-harming behavior and/or suicidal
ideation, (6) affective instability due to marked mood reactivity, (7) chronic feelings of
emptiness, (8) inappropriate, intense anger or difficulty controlling anger, and (9) transient
dissociative symptoms or stress-related paranoid ideation [1]. This diagnostic threshold re-
sults in a highly heterogeneous symptom profile, allowing patients with markedly different
presentations to fall under the same diagnostic category [3].

The Alternative Model for Personality Disorders (AMPD) in the DSM-5-TR approaches
BPD through two main criteria: (A) the level of personality functioning—evaluating impair-
ments in identity, empathy, intimacy, and self-direction—and (B) maladaptive personality
traits, such as emotional lability, impulsivity, and hostility, among others. AMPD concep-
tualizes BPD as resulting from the interplay between an unstable sense of self—marked
by self-criticism, emptiness, and dissociation—and problematic interpersonal function-
ing, often characterized by extreme idealization or devaluation [1]. This dimensional
approach helps capture the disorder’s complexity and allows for more tailored therapeutic
interventions [4].

Linehan’s biosocial theory [5] conceptualizes BPD as a disorder of emotion dysregu-
lation arising from the interaction between a biological vulnerability, characterized by high
emotional sensitivity, reactivity, and a slow return to baseline [6], and an invalidating envi-
ronment [7], which reinforces emotional and behavioral difficulties. This model aligns with
key components of AMPD Criteria A and B, particularly emotional lability and impulsivity,
considering them central to BPD development. However, emerging evidence suggests that
the biosocial model may extend beyond BPD, encompassing a broader range of disorders
characterized by emotion dysregulation [4].

As previously noted, BPD shares considerable symptom overlap with PTSD [8,9] and
with cPTSD [8–10]. Indeed, approximately 30% of BPD patients also meet diagnostic criteria
for PTSD, and nearly 50% for cPTSD [11,12], as confirmed by recent systematic reviews [13].
This comorbidity may be attributed to shared symptoms across the three disorders, such
as emotional hyperreactivity and interpersonal difficulties. Nevertheless, PTSD is typi-
cally linked to a single traumatic event, with symptoms including intrusive recollections,
avoidance, hypervigilance, and negative alterations in mood and cognition [1]. In contrast,
BPD involves chronic dysfunction not necessarily tied to one traumatic episode [14,15].
Zlotnick and colleagues [16] found that among individuals with comorbid BPD and PTSD,
childhood trauma was more strongly associated with symptom severity than in those
with BPD alone. This suggests that PTSD may amplify clinical complexity and general
dysfunction in BPD without altering its core traits.

When PTSD symptoms include disturbances in self-organization (DSO), the diagnosis
of Complex PTSD (cPTSD) may apply. DSO encompasses (1) pervasive emotion dysregu-
lation, (2) a profoundly negative self-concept marked by shame and worthlessness, and
(3) chronic relational disturbances, such as isolation and difficulty forming stable bonds.
The key distinction of cPTSD lies in exposure to prolonged, repeated trauma—particularly
interpersonal trauma like emotional, physical, or sexual abuse during childhood. The high
prevalence of cPTSD in BPD patients [11] has led some authors to conceptualize cPTSD

Brain Sci. 2025, 15, 889

3 of 19

as a trauma-related subtype of BPD [10,17,18]. However, the specific DSO symptoms are
relatively distinct from those of BPD [19,20]. In cPTSD, emotion dysregulation presents as
chronic self-regulation difficulties and emotional numbing, rather than the intense mood
swings and explosive anger seen in BPD [9]. Furthermore, the negative self-concept in
cPTSD is defined by stable, enduring feelings of shame and guilt, contrasting with the
unstable and fragmented self-image in BPD. Lastly, while both disorders involve relational
difficulties, BPD is marked by intense, alternating patterns of idealization and devaluation
to prevent abandonment, whereas cPTSD reflects avoidance rooted in fear of intimacy [19].

1.1. Emotion Dysregulation in BPD, PTSD, and cPTSD

Emotion dysregulation lies at the core of BPD. Although also present in PTSD and

cPTSD, it manifests in different ways and to varying degrees of severity [9].

In BPD, the interplay between biological and environmental vulnerabilities [5] leads to
a chronic inability to modulate intense emotional states. This dysregulation is considered
ego-syntonic (i.e., experienced as an integral part of the self) and is often triggered by inter-
personal situations perceived as invalidating or threatening [5,8,9]. It reflects a structural
instability of identity, a hallmark of BPD [1,15], which appears to be strongly correlated
with Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs), particularly emotional abuse and emotional
neglect [21]. In this regard, a specific analysis by Alafia and Manjula [22] highlighted a
significantly higher prevalence of emotional abuse in individuals with BPD compared to
clinical control groups, and a substantial association with the development of maladaptive
emotion regulation strategies. These maladaptive strategies have been identified as key
predictors of negative affective states such as anger and sadness [22].

In PTSD, emotion dysregulation tends to be more specifically linked to traumatic
memories and triggers that reactivate the trauma. It is frequently characterized by intense
emotional states such as anger, fear, or shame that emerge during flashbacks or in response
to trauma-related stimuli [1]. Unlike BPD, dysregulation in PTSD is ego-dystonic (i.e.,
experienced as alien to the self and closely tied to the traumatic event [8]).

In cPTSD, emotion dysregulation is more persistent and generalized than in PTSD. It
involves not only difficulties in modulating negative emotions such as fear and anger, but
also a chronic sense of worthlessness and shame that extends to self-perception and inter-
personal functioning [23]. It is closely associated with repeated and prolonged interpersonal
trauma, which impairs the individual’s capacity to develop adaptive emotional regulation
strategies [8,10]. As such, cPTSD is marked by a profound and structural impairment in
emotional self-regulation, an element it shares with BPD. Although the overlap between
cPTSD and BPD is substantial, Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) studies have revealed
that cPTSD symptoms are more closely related to avoidance and relational disconnection,
whereas BPD is marked by heightened emotional and relational instability and impulsive
behavior [20]. These findings underscore the importance of a precise diagnostic approach
that takes into account both the shared features and the differences between the disorders,
thereby enhancing the understanding of their interrelations and supporting trauma-focused
interventions.

1.2. Dissociation in BPD, PTSD, and cPTSD

Dissociation is defined in the DSM-5-TR as a “disruption and/or discontinuity in
the normal integration of consciousness, memory, identity, emotion, perception, body
representation, motor control, and behavior” [1]. From an evolutionary and pathogenetic
perspective, dissociation appears to represent the human organism’s extreme response to
intolerable stress, particularly in the context of severe abuse [24].

Brain Sci. 2025, 15, 889

4 of 19

Since the work of Kernberg [25], dissociation has been conceptualized as an alteration
of consciousness and a fragmentation of mental experience, serving an adaptive function
in promoting individual survival. This definition has largely remained consistent across
different schools of psychotherapy.
In the context of BPD, Linehan reconceptualized
dissociation as an extreme form of experiential avoidance [26], employed by patients in
response to aversive tension states that are perceived as unbearable [5]. The notion of
dissociation as experiential avoidance continues to be supported by empirical research on
BPD. For instance, a meta-analytic review by Cavicchioli and colleagues [27] confirmed
this function across multiple studies.

The link between dissociation and trauma is robust in both Borderline Personality Dis-
order (BPD) and Dissociative Disorders (DD; [28]), particularly when viewed within a mul-
tifactorial etiological framework. A growing body of evidence suggests that ACEs and dis-
organized attachment are common among individuals with DD, BPD, and cPTSD [29–34].
However, patients with BPD tend to exhibit higher levels of dissociation compared to indi-
viduals with other psychiatric or personality disorders [35], though not when compared
to those with DD or PTSD [36]. This finding may be understood in light of the differing
functions that dissociation serves across these disorders.

Specifically, in BPD, dissociation may reflect an acute, situational response to
stress [37,38], serving to manage aversive emotional states in the moment, without con-
stituting a structural or stable personality feature [39]. In contrast, in DD, dissociation is
a structural element of personality, functioning to protect the individual from traumatic
emotions or memories by creating significant compartmentalization within consciousness,
identity, and memory [40,41]. Finally, in PTSD, dissociation serves to shield the individual
from the traumatic memory. Although it is less chronic than in DD, it is more specifically
related to trauma than in BPD [10,42].

In cPTSD, dissociation often manifests as a combination of hyperarousal and hy-
poarousal, with marked difficulty regulating both positive and negative emotional states.
Unlike PTSD, dissociation in cPTSD is closely tied to persistent emotional and relational
disorganization, attributed to chronic and prolonged interpersonal trauma [8].

One of the outstanding questions in current research on dissociative symptomatology
concerns which specific features of BPD are most strongly associated with dissociation [39].
The present study aims to contribute new evidence on this issue as well.

1.3. Adverse Childhood Experiences in BPD, PTSD, and cPTSD

ACEs encompass a wide range of traumatic experiences occurring during childhood,
including severe forms of physical, emotional, and sexual abuse, neglect, chronic mal-
treatment, and invalidating environments [43]. These often cumulative experiences can
profoundly impact a child’s psychological, emotional, and neurobiological development,
disrupting the ability to regulate emotions, form stable relationships, and develop a coher-
ent and positive sense of self. The effects of ACEs are not limited to childhood but often
persist into adulthood, increasing vulnerability to a broad spectrum of psychopathologies,
including BPD, PTSD, and cPTSD [10,44]. Their relevance has been extensively studied in
both clinical and research settings, consistently identifying ACEs as significant risk factors
for long-term emotional and behavioral difficulties.

Patients with BPD are 13 times more likely to report ACEs compared to non-clinical
controls and other clinical populations (e.g., mood disorders, psychosis, and other per-
sonality disorders [45]), highlighting the central role of ACEs in the development of the
disorder [46]. However, not all ACEs exert the same impact. While traumatic events such
as physical, emotional, and sexual abuse, neglect, and domestic violence are linked to a
greater risk of developing personality disorders in adulthood [44], in BPD, emotional abuse

Brain Sci. 2025, 15, 889

5 of 19

has been found to have the most direct and significant association [22], followed closely by
emotional neglect [21]. The evidence regarding the role of sexual abuse is more nuanced.
While some studies suggest that sexual abuse is a significant predictor of adult dissociative
phenomena—pointing to a specific link between dissociation and sexual trauma (see [47]
for a literature review)—more recent findings suggest a more indirect relationship, poten-
tially mediated by other factors such as insecure attachment [46]. This study also aims
to shed light on the relationship between sexual abuse, borderline symptomatology, and
dissociative and post-traumatic symptoms.

In PTSD, ACEs primarily contribute to the emergence of symptoms related to exposure
to single or episodic traumatic events, such as hyperarousal, intrusive traumatic memories,
and avoidance behaviors [48]. These symptoms reflect emotional regulation dysfunctions
and heightened hypervigilance, which undermine trust in others. While ACEs in PTSD
are impactful, their effect tends to be less pervasive than in cPTSD, leading to more cir-
cumscribed difficulties rather than widespread and chronic emotion dysregulation [49].
Nonetheless, ACEs remain a critical vulnerability factor, influencing maladaptive emotional
responses and psychological functioning, and highlighting the importance of addressing
these factors in clinical interventions.

In cPTSD, ACEs—especially when prolonged and repeated—have a profound impact
on personality functioning and epistemic trust [49], understood as the ability to trust
and learn from social information.
Impaired epistemic trust hinders the individual’s
capacity to revise self-perceptions and worldviews through positive social interactions,
thereby intensifying interpersonal difficulties and the negative self-concept that typify
cPTSD. Specifically, the three hallmark Disturbances in Self-Organization (DSO)—emotion
dysregulation, negative self-concept, and chronic interpersonal difficulties—emerge from
the interplay between multiple, enduring ACEs and impaired personality functioning.
Kampling and colleagues [49], in their study on British military veterans, found that
those with high exposure to ACEs exhibited more severe cPTSD symptoms, including
pronounced DSO, and reported lower levels of perceived social support. These findings
underscore the protective role of social support, the absence of which may contribute to the
chronic course of the disorder.

1.4. The Present Study

Building on the existing body of literature, the present study aims to address the
following research question: How do different dimensions of ACEs influence key psy-
chopathological domains, namely emotion dysregulation, dissociation, and borderline
symptomatology?

To this end, the research hypotheses to be tested through bivariate correlation analysis

and Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) are as follows:

(1) Different dimensions of ACEs are expected to be positively and significantly corre-
lated with levels of post-traumatic symptomatology, dissociative symptomatology,
borderline symptoms, and emotion dysregulation.

(2) Levels of dissociative symptoms are hypothesized to be highly correlated with post-
traumatic symptomatology, whereas levels of emotion dysregulation are expected to
be strongly correlated with borderline symptomatology.

(4)

(3) Emotional abuse and emotional neglect are hypothesized to be the ACE dimensions
with the greatest impact on emotion dysregulation and borderline symptoms.
Sexual abuse is hypothesized to be a positive and significant predictor of dissociative
symptoms, reflecting a specific link between dissociation and sexual trauma in patients
with BPD.

Additionally, Explorative Graph Analysis (EGA) will be used to explore the following

research questions:

(1) Which psychopathological factors emerge as central nodes within the symptom net-

work of the tested sample?

(2) Are there patterns that diverge from previously validated measurement structures,

thereby suggesting novel latent configurations?

2. Methods
2.1. Participants

A total of 83 patients (76 females, 7 males) were assessed for the present study between

2019 and 2024.

Participants were voluntarily recruited in a CBT-DBT Psychotherapy Center in Italy,
based on the following inclusion criteria: Being 18 years of age or older, being a native
Italian speaker, having normative cognitive functioning, and having received a clinical
diagnosis of BPD through SCID-5-PD interviews and clinical assessments. At the time of
the study, 24 participants had been in psychotherapy for less than three months, 13 for
about three months, eight for six months, five for nine months, and 27 for more than
nine months. Regarding pharmacological treatment, 22 participants were not taking any
medication, 13 were on monotherapy-anxiolytics (n = 2), antidepressants (n = 5), mood
stabilizers (n = 2), or atypical antipsychotics (n = 3), while 42 were following combined
pharmacological regimens.

The study was conducted in accordance with the ethical standards of the 1964 Helsinki
Declaration and its later amendments. Ethical approval was obtained from the Ethics
Committee of the APC-SPC School of Cognitive Psychotherapy in Rome. Written informed
consent was obtained from all participants prior to their participation in the study.

2.2. Measures

All participants were administered the Raven’s Progressive Matrices [50] to ensure
normative cognitive functioning. Subsequently, the following self-report questionnaires
were used to assess the constructs relevant to our research questions:

Brain Sci. 2025, 15, 889

•

Borderline Symptom List–23 (BSL-23; [51]): A short version of the Borderline Symp-
tom List (BSL-95), developed to reliably and efficiently assess symptoms typical of
Borderline Personality Disorder. The Italian version consists of 18 items rated on
a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (“not at all”) to 4 (“very much”), measuring
symptom severity over the past week. The BSL-23 is designed to be highly sensitive
to therapeutic change and to effectively discriminate between patients with BPD
and those with other psychiatric diagnoses. The scale has shown excellent internal
consistency (Cronbach’s α = 0.89).
Childhood Trauma Questionnaire–Short Form (CTQ-SF; [52,53]): A retrospective self-
report instrument for measuring childhood trauma. It consists of 28 items assessing
five specific dimensions of ACEs: emotional abuse (CTQ_emoab, five items, α = 0.79),
physical abuse (CTQ_phyab, five items, α = 0.82), sexual abuse (CTQ_sexab, five items,
α = 0.91), emotional neglect (CTQ_emoneg, five items, α = 0.90), and physical neglect
(CTQ_phyneg, five items, α = 0.67). Items are rated on a 5-point Likert scale ranging
from 1 (“never true”) to 5 (“very often true”). The scale’s convergent validity is sup-
ported by moderate correlations with post-traumatic and general psychopathological
symptoms [53].
Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS; [21,54]): A self-report questionnaire
designed to assess difficulties in emotion regulation. It includes 36 items divided
into six subscales that assess clinically relevant aspects of emotion dysregulation:
Non-acceptance of emotional responses (DERS_non, six items, α = 0.90), difficulties
engaging in goal-directed behavior (DERS_go, five items, α = 0.80), impulse control
difficulties (DERS_im, six items, α = 0.90), lack of emotional awareness (DERS_aw, six
items, α = 0.85), limited access to emotion regulation strategies (DERS_st, eight items,
α = 0.91), and lack of emotional clarity (DERS_cl, five items, α = 0.86). Items are rated
on a 5-point Likert scale, ranging from 1 (“never”) to 5 (“always”).
Dissociative Experiences Scale (DES [55,56]): A self-report instrument composed of
28 items designed to measure the frequency of dissociative experiences in clinical
and non-clinical populations. Participants rate each item on a visual analog scale
from 0% to 100%. The DES assesses three primary dissociative dimensions: absorp-
tion and imaginative involvement (DES_assco, nine items, α = 0.84), dissociative
amnesia and behavioral lapses (DES_adiss, eight items, α = 0.81), and depersonaliza-
tion/derealization (DES_depder, six items, α = 0.88). The DES can be used to detect
both non-pathological and pathological dissociative symptoms.
Posttraumatic Stress Diagnostic Scale 3 (PDS-3; [57]): A 24-item self-report measure
(PDS_tot, α = 0.89) that assesses the severity of PTSD symptoms over the past month,
based on DSM-IV criteria. It evaluates symptom clusters such as intrusive thoughts,
avoidance behaviors, and hyperarousal. According to the literature, the PDS-3 is a
psychometrically sound instrument for PTSD screening under DSM-IV-R criteria. It is
particularly recommended in large-scale traumatic events such as natural disasters or
mass terrorism.

2.3. Data Analysis

Data analysis was conducted using the open-source statistical software R (ver-

sion 4.4.2).

Following an initial exploration of descriptive statistics for the sample, bivariate corre-
lations among measured variables were computed using Pearson’s correlation coefficient.
In particular, the corrplot package (Version 0.95) was employed to intuitively visualize
correlations between questionnaire scores (CTQ, DERS, BSL-23, DES, and PDS), including
their subscales, through a correlogram.

Brain Sci. 2025, 15, 889

8 of 19

For the analysis using SEM [58], the lavaan package (Version 0.6-19) [59] was utilized to
test our theory-driven hypotheses derived from the biosocial model of BPD. The following
measurement models were specified.

For borderline symptomatology (BSL), three parcels (each composed of six items)

were created.

For emotion dysregulation (DERS), a facet-representative approach was used. The
latent variable was composed by six observed variables, each representing the composite
score (i.e., the average of their respective items) of the six dimensions of DERS: (1) internal
state awareness (awareness subscale, DERS_aw), (2) acceptance of internal states (non-
acceptance subscale, DERS_non), (3) understanding of emotional responses (clarity sub-
scale, DERS_cl), (4) ability to engage in goal-directed behavior (goals subscale, DERS_go),
(5) impulsivity (impulse subscale, DERS_im), and (6) access to effective strategies (strategies
subscale, DERS_st).

The same facet-representative approach was applied to dissociative symptomatol-
ogy (DES), which includes three specific dimensions: (1) absorption and imaginative
involvement (DES_assco), (2) dissociative amnesia and behavioral lapses (DES_adiss), and
(3) depersonalization and derealization (DES_depder).

The ACEs (via the CTQ) were instead measured by five distinct observed variables,
which were computed as the mean of items from each subscale: (1) physical abuse
(CTQ_phyab), (2) emotional abuse (CTQ_emoab), (3) sexual abuse (CTQ_sexab), (4) physi-
cal neglect (CTQ_phyneg), and (5) emotional neglect (CTQ_emoneg).

Once the measurement models for each construct were defined, the structural model
was specified by regressing the latent psychopathology variables (i.e., borderline symp-
toms, dissociative symptoms, and emotion dysregulation) on the observed ACE variables
(i.e., emotional abuse, physical abuse, sexual abuse, emotional neglect, physical neglect).
Model fit was evaluated using chi-square statistics (a non-significant result at α = 0.05,
i.e., p > 0.05, indicates good fit) and the following indices: Comparative Fit Index (CFI;
values > 0.90), Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI; values > 0.90), Root Mean Square Error of Approx-
imation (RMSEA; values < 0.06), and Standardized Root Mean Square Residual (SRMR;
values < 0.08).

Finally, Exploratory Graph Analysis (EGA) was used to obtain additional insights into
the latent factorial structure of the observed variables. Unlike SEM, which tests a predefined
structure (i.e., confirmatory or theory-driven approach), EGA identifies factor structures
with a data-driven approach, identifying central nodes and interconnections without pre-
imposed structures, and, using methods from network science [60]. EGA involves three
steps: (1) Estimation of the Correlation Matrix to assess linear relationships among variables;
(2) Application of the GLASSO algorithm to build a sparse partial correlation network,
highlighting only the strongest associations; and (3) Community Detection and Factor
Estimation to cluster items into groups representing latent constructs with strong internal
associations. The EGAnet package (Version 2.3.0) in R was used for this analysis.

3. Results

Table 2 presents the descriptive statistics for the variables considered in the current

sample.

The correlogram in Figure 1 (see Table A1 in Appendix A for the full correlation matrix)
displays the correlations among the various psychopathological variables examined in this
study. Bivariate relationships between variables were assessed using Spearman correlations
with the Benjamini and Hochberg (BH) procedure for correcting p-values; the significance
level was set at α = 0.05.

The results of the bivariate correlation analyses suggest the following:
Different dimensions of ACEs show low-to-moderate positive correlations with post-
traumatic symptomatology (PDS3_tot, range ρ = 0.05–0.28), low-to-moderate correlations
with dissociative symptoms (DES_tot, range ρ = 0.15–0.28), and low-to-moderate positive
correlations with borderline symptomatology (BSL_tot, range ρ = −0.05–0.30). Correlations
with emotion dysregulation (DERS_tot) were non-significant (range ρ = −0.08 to 0.15).
These findings are consistent with Hypothesis 1, indicating that the strongest associations
are observed with dissociative and borderline symptoms.

Dissociative symptomatology showed a medium correlation with post-traumatic
symptoms (PDS3_tot, ρ = 0.33, p < 0.01), thereby supporting Hypothesis 2. Moreover,
dissociative symptoms were also significantly associated with borderline symptomatology
(BSL_tot, ρ = 0.44, p < 0.001), suggesting that dissociation is a salient feature in patients with
BPD, often linked to prior traumatic experiences. Levels of emotion dysregulation were
strongly correlated with the severity of borderline symptoms (BSL_tot, ρ = 0.61, p < 0.001),
also confirming Hypothesis 2, and with dissociative symptoms (DES_tot, ρ = 0.61, p < 0.001).
These results underscore that emotional difficulties represent a central component in the
development and expression of both borderline and dissociative psychopathology.

3.1. Structural Equation Models (SEM)

The analysis of the structural part of the model was conducted in two phases. In
Model 1 (see Figure A1 in Appendix B), it was specified that the three latent outcome
variables were regressed on all CTQ subscales. In Model 2 (see Figure A2 in Appendix B),
all paths whose standardized estimates had an absolute value less than 0.20 were fixed to
zero. Both models were tested using the Maximum Likelihood estimation method, with a
total of 78 observations (out of 83 available). In both models, the main fit indices suggest an
acceptable fit of the model to the data (Model 1: χ2 = 136.713, df = 95, p = 0.003, CFI = 0.945,
TLI = 0.921, RMSEA = 0.075, SRMR = 0.060; Model 2: χ2 = 143.340, df = 105, p = 0.008,
CFI = 0.949, TLI = 0.934, RMSEA = 0.068, SRMR = 0.091).

Partial support was found for Hypothesis 3: emotional abuse (CTQ_emoab) signif-
icantly and positively predicted borderline symptomatology (BSL_tot, β = .20, p < 0.05).
However, no significant effects were observed for emotional abuse (CTQ_emoab) on emo-
tion dysregulation, nor for emotional neglect (CTQ_emoneg) on borderline symptomatol-
ogy (BSL_tot) or emotion dysregulation (DERS_tot).

In support of Hypothesis 4, the effect of sexual abuse (CTQ_sexab) on dissociative
symptomatology (DES_tot) was positive and statistically significant (β = .22, p < 0.05).
Additional interesting results from the SEM analysis include a positive and marginally
significant effect of physical abuse (CTQ_phyab) on dissociative symptoms (DES_tot,
β = .19, p < 0.10), and a significant effect of sexual abuse (CTQ_sexab) on borderline
symptomatology (BSL_tot, β = .17, p < 0.05).

3.2. Exploratory Graph Analysis (EGA)

The results of the EGA are reported in Figure 2. The connections between the various
nodes are represented by lines of differing thickness. Thicker lines indicate stronger
correlations between variables, while thinner or nearly invisible lines represent weaker
associations. Variables occupying central positions in the network and showing a high
number of connections—so-called “hubs”—may be particularly relevant, as they suggest
factors that play a key role in linking different psychopathological nodes. Analyzing
the strongest connections and identifying variables that act as bridges between different
clusters may provide valuable insights into how various psychopathological domains
influence one another.

traumatic symptomatology. Note. BSL: Borderline Symptom List; CTQ: Childhood Trauma Question-
naire; DERS: Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale; DES: Dissociative Experiences Scale.

As illustrated in Figure 2, the nodes are grouped into four distinct clusters, each
marked by a different color (red, blue, green, and orange). These clusters suggest the
presence of statistically correlated subgroups of variables, which may reflect different
psychopathological dimensions or distinct underlying processes.

The green cluster includes variables related to dissociation, such as DES_depder,
DES_assco, and DES_adiss, which respectively measure depersonalization and derealiza-
tion, absorption and imaginative involvement, and dissociative behaviors. These variables
are connected by dense and strong links, indicating a high level of correlation among
these dissociative phenomena. This result is expected, given that they represent subscales
of the same measurement instrument. However, what is particularly noteworthy is the
inclusion of the node corresponding to sexual abuse (CTQ_sexab) within the same cluster,
highlighting a strong interrelation between dissociative symptomatology and childhood
experiences of sexual abuse. This finding further supports Hypothesis 4 of the study.

Borderline symptomatology (BSL_tot) appears to be strongly interconnected with the
inability to engage in goal-directed behaviors during emotional distress, the non-acceptance
of internal emotional states, and a tendency toward impulsive action—represented by the
subscales DERS_go, DERS_non, and DERS_im, respectively. The red cluster specifically
emphasizes the centrality of BSL_tot, not only within the red cluster itself but also in
relation to other variables, suggesting a possible role of borderline symptoms in linking
multiple psychological domains. The centrality of BPD is not surprising, given that the
data were collected from a population diagnosed with BPD. Two other subscales of the
DERS—namely, clarity (DERS_cl) and impulse (DERS_im)—seem to form a separate cluster
(orange cluster), suggesting a unique relationship distinct from the other subscales of the
same questionnaire.

The blue cluster, which includes variables such as CTQ_emoneg, CTQ_emoab, and
CTQ_phyneg, represents links among various ACE dimensions. This group of variables
appears to constitute a separate but meaningful dimension in the network, indicating
a strong relationship between early adverse experiences and present manifestations of
emotion dysregulation and dissociation. It is worth noting, however, that the variable
CTQ_sexab (sexual abuse) shows stronger correlations with dissociative symptomatology
than with other childhood adversities measured within the same scale.

Finally, the orange cluster includes awareness of internal emotional states (DERS_aw)
and the ability to recognize the nature of emotional responses (DERS_cl) as two distinct

Brain Sci. 2025, 15, 889

12 of 19

dimensions. These two components of emotion dysregulation appear to diverge from the
other DERS subscales and from borderline symptomatology (BSL_tot), suggesting a unique
pattern within the network structure.

4. Discussion

This study has contributed to clarifying the central role of ACEs in the development
of BPD. In particular, emotional abuse and emotional neglect are strongly associated with
emotion dysregulation, confirming the crucial role of invalidating environments in the de-
velopment of borderline symptoms, in line with Linehan’s biosocial theory [5]. Emotional
vulnerability, exacerbated by such contexts, thus emerges as a key factor in the development
of dysregulation and relational difficulties typical of BPD. The data support the hypothesis
that emotional abuse and emotional neglect have a stronger correlation with emotion
dysregulation than other forms of ACEs in individuals with BPD. Specifically, emotional
abuse appears to be more strongly associated with emotion dysregulation than other trau-
matic experiences, likely due to its direct impact on self-perception and self-esteem [21,22].
Furthermore, both the severity and the type of ACEs experienced significantly influence
emotional difficulties, highlighting the importance of clinical interventions focused on
improving emotion regulation.

Additionally, the analyses demonstrated that sexual abuse is a significant predictor
of dissociative symptoms, suggesting that dissociation may function as a defense mecha-
nism [25] or as a form of experiential avoidance [26,27] in response to severe interpersonal
trauma. These findings further support the theoretical models of Ford and Courtois [8]
and Herman [10], showing that dissociation acts as a protective mechanism against over-
whelming emotions and traumatic memories. Thus, sexual abuse emerges as a central
factor in dissociative symptomatology, confirming the original hypothesis and reinforcing
the specific and direct link between dissociation and sexual trauma. The SEM analysis
strengthens this connection, indicating that dissociation may serve as an adaptive coping
strategy in patients with a history of severe interpersonal trauma.

Moreover, the results suggest that emotion dysregulation plays a critical role in the
relationship between ACEs and observed symptoms (borderline, dissociative, and post-
traumatic), reinforcing the notion that emotion dysregulation constitutes a central node
in the symptom network of individuals with BPD. This has direct clinical implications:
interventions that enhance emotional awareness, acceptance, and clarity may help to
break down the transdiagnostic role of dysregulation, which connects trauma history with
current symptomatology. Clinicians should consider individualized assessments of specific
emotion regulation deficits, as our findings identified emotional awareness and clarity as
distinct dimensions within the network. These facets might require focused interventions
to improve patients’ reflective capacities and emotional self-understanding.

The subsequent EGA allowed for a more exploratory investigation of the interconnec-
tions among the various domains under study. Findings highlighted emotion dysregulation
as a central node in the symptom network, serving as a bridge between ACEs, dissociation,
and borderline symptoms. Clinically, this suggests that early identification of dysregulation
patterns may offer an effective entry point for intervention, potentially mitigating the
cascading effects on dissociative experiences and borderline symptomatology. Although
dissociation is prominent in individuals with a history of severe ACEs, it appears to be less
central than emotion dysregulation, supporting the view that it may act as a secondary
response to severe interpersonal trauma. Nonetheless, when dissociative symptoms are
reported in clinical settings, therapists should be vigilant in assessing for possible histo-
ries of sexual abuse, as our network analysis revealed a specific and robust link between
these variables.

Regarding cPTSD, the findings are consistent with those reported by Powers and
colleagues [20], revealing overlap with BPD in the domains of emotion dysregulation
and dissociation. However, key differences emerge in self-related symptoms. In cPTSD,
emotion dysregulation is chronic and accompanied by persistent emotional numbing and
a stable sense of worthlessness or shame. In contrast, BPD is characterized by intense
emotional lability, extreme anger, and an unstable and fragmented sense of self [9,19].
These distinctions reflect different origins and adaptive mechanisms in response to trauma:
cPTSD is typically associated with prolonged traumatic experiences that compromise the
development of adaptive regulation strategies, whereas BPD is marked by a more reactive
and impulsive functioning style. These findings underline the importance of accurate
diagnostic differentiation, which is essential for developing therapeutic interventions that
address the specific features of each disorder.

The results underscore the importance of systematically assessing the presence of
ACEs in clinical settings, especially in patients with BPD. Particular attention should be
paid to emotional and sexual abuse, in order to identify the most relevant domains of
vulnerability and inform successful treatment planning. A detailed clinical exploration of
trauma history, integrated with symptom-specific assessments of dissociation and emotion
dysregulation, may help clinicians tailor interventions more precisely to individual patients’
needs. The evidence supporting emotion dysregulation as a central node across all symp-
tom domains suggests that therapeutic approaches targeting emotion regulation capacities
may be essential components of treatment across diverse clinical profiles. In cases of co-
morbidity between cPTSD and BPD, treatments should jointly address emotion regulation
and trauma processing. Furthermore, the diagnostic distinctions between PTSD, cPTSD,
and BPD revealed through EGA and SEM analyses can assist clinicians in making more
accurate diagnoses and in developing personalized interventions. For example, patients
with marked dissociation and avoidance symptoms may benefit more from trauma-focused
interventions, whereas those with BPD may require prioritized interventions targeting
emotional regulation and relational instability.

Despite the promising results, the study presents several limitations. First, the rel-
atively small sample size may limit the generalizability of findings to broader clinical
populations. Moreover, at the time of assessment, patients were at different stages of
psychotherapy and a significant part of the sample was under pharmacological treatment.
In addition, only a portion of the sample met diagnostic criteria for PTSD, limiting the
robustness of SEM and EGA analyses in exploring PTSD-specific aspects. Additionally, the
PTSD assessment tool was based on DSM-IV criteria, and future research may benefit from
using updated measures that also capture the DSO components characteristic of cPTSD.
A limitation also concerns missing data on the PDS-3, as only participants reporting a
specific traumatic event could complete the questionnaire. Moreover, being a self-report
measure, some underreporting of traumatic experiences cannot be excluded. Given that
this is a cross-sectional study, caution is warranted in generalizing results and in avoiding
any causal inference between ACEs and psychopathological symptoms. Furthermore, the
cross-sectional nature of the study does not allow for evaluation of the effectiveness of
DBT, which the majority of participants had received. Finally, the retrospective assessment
of ACEs may be influenced by memory biases, potentially affecting the reconstruction of
traumatic experiences.

Future studies would benefit from adopting a longitudinal methodology to further
examine the role of emotion regulation as a mediator in the relationship between ACEs and
borderline symptoms. Additionally, it would be valuable to explore individual differences
in response to emotion regulation-based therapeutic interventions, in order to develop
increasingly personalized and evidence-based treatment strategies. Lastly, further research

Brain Sci. 2025, 15, 889

could investigate the interactions between ACEs and other biological and social risk factors
in the etiology of BPD.

5. Conclusions

This study has contributed to clarifying the central role of ACEs in the development of
BPD, highlighting how specific types of ACEs—namely emotional and sexual abuse—are
significantly associated with emotion dysregulation and dissociation. The results reinforce
the importance of considering ACEs not only as a foundational element in understanding
BPD, but also as a critical factor in explaining its symptomatic complexity, which is often
associated with comorbidity with PTSD and cPTSD.

The analyses conducted using SEM and EGA demonstrated that ACE dimensions
exert a diversified impact on emotion dysregulation, borderline symptoms, and dissociative
symptoms in a sample of patients with BPD and trauma. This suggests that difficulties
in emotion regulation are not merely a consequence of trauma but represent a central
component in the psychopathological network of BPD, linking past trauma to the current
manifestation of symptoms.

Another important contribution of this study lies in the differentiation among PTSD,
cPTSD, and BPD. While these conditions share symptoms such as emotional hyperreactivity
and dissociation, they differ in the origin and nature of those symptoms. The findings
emphasize that, whereas cPTSD is more directly associated with chronic and repeated
trauma, BPD presents with chronic, ego-syntonic emotion dysregulation that is often
unrelated to a single traumatic event.

These results have important implications for clinical practice. Clinicians should
systematically assess ACEs—especially emotional and sexual abuse—when working with
patients presenting with emotion dysregulation and dissociative symptoms. The identi-
fication of specific dysregulation patterns, such as deficits in emotional awareness and
clarity, can guide the selection of targeted interventions aimed at enhancing emotional
self-regulation. Furthermore, the observed links between dissociation and sexual trauma
suggest the need for thorough trauma assessment whenever dissociative symptoms emerge
in therapy. Personalized treatment planning, informed by these nuanced diagnostic distinc-
tions, can thus improve therapeutic precision and effectiveness.
