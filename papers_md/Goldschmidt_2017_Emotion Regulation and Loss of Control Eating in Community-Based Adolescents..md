Abstract

The current study investigated concurrent and prospective associations between emotion-related 
constructs and loss of control (LOC) eating in adolescents. Community-based females (N=588) 
completed annual self-report assessments of LOC eating, emotional awareness, emotion regulation 
strategies, and neuroticism from ages 16–18 years. Linear regressions and a regression-based 
multiple mediation model using bootstrapping were computed to examine the relationships among 
emotion-related constructs and LOC eating frequency. In the concurrent model, age 18 emotional 
awareness and emotion regulation strategies were associated with age 18 LOC eating, F(6, 
416)=12.11, p<.001, accounting for 4.5% of the variance after controlling for demographics, body 
mass index, and neuroticism, F change=10.81, p<.001. In the prospective model, age 17 emotional 
awareness predicted age 18 LOC eating, F(7, 425)=11.67, p<.001, accounting for 1.7% of unique 
variance beyond the effects of age 16 LOC eating and age 17 demographics, body mass index, and 
neuroticism, F change=4.26, p=.015. In the multiple mediation model, age 18 emotion regulation 
strategies mediated the association between age 17 neuroticism and age 18 LOC eating, indirect 
effect estimate=.003, 95% confidence interval=.001–.005, after controlling for age 16 LOC eating 
and age 17 demographics, body mass index, and emotion regulation variables. Results suggest that 
deficient emotion regulation may contribute to the onset and maintenance of LOC eating in 
adolescence (although effects were small), and may partially explain the well-established 
prospective relationship between negative emotionality and later LOC eating. Prevention and early 
intervention programs should seek to improve adaptive coping in at-risk populations.

Loss of control (LOC) while eating, characterized by the sense that one cannot control what 
or how much one is eating, is a key feature of binge eating (American Psychiatric 
Association, 2013). LOC eating is associated with obesity, excess weight gain, and 
psychosocial impairment (Goldschmidt, Aspen, Sinton, Tanofsky-Kraff, & Wilfley, 2008), 
independent of the amount of food consumed (Goldschmidt et al., 2012; Goldschmidt, 
Jones, et al., 2008; Shomaker et al., 2010). Although LOC eating is reported by 
approximately 10–15% of community-based adolescents (Johnson, Rohan, & Kirk, 2002; 
Neumark-Sztainer, Wall, Larson, Eisenberg, & Loth, 2011), there is an insufficient 
understanding of its contributing factors and, consequently, a relative dearth of effective 
interventions for this age group (Lock, 2015). Preliminary data suggest that difficulties with 
emotion regulation may underlie LOC eating behavior (Leehr et al., 2015), but research in 
youth is scant (Czaja, Rief, & Hilbert, 2009) and prospective data linking emotion regulation 
deficits to subsequent LOC eating are virtually nonexistent.

Negative affect is one construct that has been consistently associated with LOC eating across 
the age spectrum (Goldschmidt, Aspen, et al., 2008; Haedt-Matt & Keel, 2011). Negative 
affect often refers to a state construct describing the experience of distressing or unpleasant 
emotions, but it is highly correlated with the temperamental trait of neuroticism/negative 
emotionality, representing one’s proclivity towards negative affect (Watson & Naragon-
Gainey, 2014). Negative affect (at both the state and trait level) is elevated in adolescents 
with LOC eating in cross-sectional studies (Goldschmidt, Jones, et al., 2008; Shomaker et 
al., 2010), and also has been identified as a risk factor for the development of LOC eating in 
adolescence (Stice, 2002). LOC eating has been conceptualized as a maladaptive method of 
alleviating negative affect, a theory that is supported by multiple naturalistic and 
experimental studies indicating that increases in negative affect serve as a momentary 
precipitant to LOC eating episodes (Haedt-Matt & Keel, 2011). However, the nature of the 
relationship between negative affect and LOC eating is poorly understood and it is unclear 
whether other factors, such as a lowered capacity to modulate or cope with negative affect, 
may explain this relationship.

Emotion regulation refers to intentional or automatic strategies that influence the type, 
intensity, and duration of emotions one experiences (Gross & Barrett, 2011). Emotion 
regulation is believed to develop as a function of interacting temperamental (e.g., negative 
emotionality) and learned factors (e.g., familial socialization; learned beliefs that negative 
emotions are intolerable; John & Gross, 2004). LOC eating may be one behavioral outcome 
resulting from poor emotion regulation, emerging in part based on learned expectancies that 
eating will alleviate negative emotions (Combs, Smith, & Simmons, 2011). Experiencing 
eating as an effective (albeit maladaptive) emotion regulation strategy may strengthen this 
expectancy, such that LOC eating eventually operates through negative reinforcement 
(Pearson, Wonderlich, & Smith, 2015). In this way, emotion regulation and LOC eating are 
distinct, but overlapping, developmental processes. Given age-related changes in emotion

regulation and propensity towards LOC eating (Swanson et al., 2014; Zeman, Cassano, 
Perry-Parrish, & Stegall, 2006), there may be developmental windows in which the link 
between deficient emotion regulation and LOC eating is particularly strong. For example, 
this link may become more evident throughout adolescence and adulthood as associations 
between LOC eating and distress relief strengthen over time with repeated pairings, whereas 
the link may be weaker in early/middle childhood due to less consolidated learned 
associations between LOC eating and distress relief (Nevin & Grace, 2000). However, 
normative developmental changes in emotion regulation and relevant brain regions may also 
complicate associations between these constructs during adolescence.

Individuals with binge eating disorder (BED), who engage in recurrent overeating 
accompanied by LOC (American Psychiatric Association, 2013), report poorer emotion 
regulation than healthy, overweight, or depressed controls (Brockmeyer et al., 2014; Svaldi, 
Griepenstroh, Tuschen-Caffier, & Ehring, 2012). Moreover, poor emotion regulation 
(specifically, difficulties identifying and understanding one’s emotions, and having limited 
access to emotion regulation strategies) predicts LOC eating severity among college students 
(Markey & Vander Wal, 2007; Whiteside et al., 2007) and adults (Carano et al., 2006; 
Gianini, White, & Masheb, 2013). Experimental data suggest that adults with BED are more 
likely to regulate negative emotions via maladaptive strategies such as suppression (i.e., 
inhibition of emotion-expression behavior), and less likely to utilize adaptive strategies such 
as reappraisal (i.e., generating alternative interpretations of an emotional stimulus), than 
overweight controls (Svaldi, Tuschen-Caffier, Trentowska, Caffier, & Naumann, 2014). 
Furthermore, some (but not all; Dingemans, Martijn, Jansen, & van Furth, 2009) data 
suggest that suppression, but not reappraisal, increases the desire to engage in LOC eating 
(Svaldi, Caffier, & Tuschen-Caffier, 2010) and is associated with greater energy intake 
(Svaldi et al., 2014).

In contrast to this growing body of literature in adults, there is a relative dearth of research 
linking emotion regulation constructs to LOC eating in adolescents. Several studies have 
shown that the dispositional tendency to behave rashly when distressed (i.e., negative 
urgency) predicts LOC eating onset in youth (Combs, Pearson, & Smith, 2011; Fischer, 
Peterson, & McCarthy, 2013; Kelly, Cotter, & Mazzeo, 2014; Pearson, Combs, Zapolski, & 
Smith, 2012), but to our knowledge, only one study has examined dimensions of emotion 
regulation more broadly among youth with LOC eating (Czaja et al., 2009). In this small 
cross-sectional study of pre-adolescent children, those with LOC eating reported greater use 
of maladaptive emotional regulation strategies such as perseverating and giving up than 
controls. Prospective data collected in adolescence, a key developmental timeframe for the 
emergence of LOC eating (Kessler et al., 2013), are needed to further explore the 
relationship between emotion regulation and LOC eating in order to inform prevention and 
early intervention strategies.

The purpose of the current study was to examine the extent to which theoretically relevant 
dimensions of emotion regulation (i.e., emotional awareness, access to effective emotion 
regulation strategies) are concurrently and prospectively associated with LOC eating in 
adolescents. A secondary aim was to investigate whether these constructs mediate the 
relationship between negative emotionality and LOC eating. We hypothesized that lower

emotional awareness and limited access to emotion regulation strategies would predict more 
frequent LOC eating both concurrently and prospectively, as well as mediate the prospective 
relationship between negative emotionality and LOC eating.

Methods

Participants

Data were drawn from the Pittsburgh Girls Study, a community-based prospective study of 
psychosocial functioning from childhood to adulthood (Loeber et al., 2002). A stratified, 
random household sampling method, with oversampling of households in low-income 
neighborhoods, was used to identify girls for the first wave of data collection, when girls 
were ages five to eight years. All homes in neighborhoods in which at least 25% of the 
residents were living at or below the poverty level were contacted in person to determine if 
an age-eligible girl was living in the home. A randomly selected 50% of the households in 
non-risk neighborhoods were contacted during 1998 and 1999. A total of 3,118 households 
in which an age-eligible girl resided were identified (which represented 83.7% of all age-
eligible girls in contacted neighborhoods, according to Census data), of which 2,450 were 
ultimately included in the study; the other 668 households were either excluded (due to 
intellectual disability in the eligible girl or imminent plans to relocate) or were unwilling to 
participate. In homes in which more than one eligible girl resided, one girl was randomly 
selected for participation. Girls and their caregivers were then re-assessed annually in the 
home.

The current study utilized data from 588 girls who were assessed at ages 16–18 years 
(spanning assessment waves 12–14 of the Pittsburgh Girls Study), when measures relevant 
to the study aims were administered. The girls were, on average, 16.5 years of age at the first 
assessment point in the current set of analyses, and most were Caucasian (52.1%) or 
African-American (41.7%; see Table 1 for descriptive information). Approximately one-
third (n=210) of the families were receiving public assistance (i.e., Women, Infants, and 
Children, food stamps, welfare). Retention has ranged from 85–86% in data collection 
waves 12–14, with attrition due in part to difficulty tracking participants. There was very 
little attrition due to refusal to participate.

All study procedures were approved by the University of Pittsburgh Institutional Review 
Board. All primary caretakers provided written informed consent, and assent was obtained 
from the girls starting at age 10. At age 18 years, girls provided their own written, informed 
consent. Girls and their caregivers were reimbursed for their time completing the interviews.

Interviewer-measured height and weight were used to determine body mass index (BMI; 
kg/m2) at ages 16, 17, and 18 years. Girls’ age, race, and socioeconomic status (SES) were 
based on parent-report.

The Eating Attitudes Test-26 (EAT-26; Garner, Olmsted, Bohr, & Garfinkel, 1982), a 26-
item self-report measure of eating disturbance, was administered at ages 16 and 18 years. 
LOC eating is ascertained via one item asking the respondent how often, in the past year, “I

have gone on eating binges where I feel that I might not be able to stop” (response options 
include never, rarely, sometimes, often, very often, and always).

Lack of emotional awareness and limited access to adaptive emotion regulation skills were 
measured at ages 17 and 18 years using two subscales of the Difficulties in Emotion 
Regulation Scale (DERS; Gratz & Roemer, 2004): awareness and strategies, respectively. 
The awareness subscale contains six items, and the strategies subscale contains eight items, 
all of which are rated on a five-point scale, with higher scores reflecting greater difficulties 
in the particular emotion regulation domain. In the current sample, the alpha coefficient for 
the awareness subscale was .88 at age 17 and .87 at age 18, while the alpha coefficient for 
the strategies subscale was .80 at age 17 and .82 at age 18.

The neuroticism scale of the Neuroticism-Extraversion-Openness Five Factor Inventory-3 
(NEO-FFI-3; McCrae & Costa, 2010), a self-report personality assessment, was 
administered at ages 17 and 18 years. The neuroticism subscale contains 12 items inquiring 
about the respondent’s tendencies towards negative emotionality (e.g., “I am not a worrier,” 
“sometimes I feel completely worthless”), each rated on a five-point scale, ranging from 
strongly disagree to strongly agree. In the current study, the alpha coefficient for the 
neuroticism scale was .71 at age 17 and .77 at age 18.

Statistical Analysis

All data were analyzed in SPSS 22.0. Missing data were excluded from analyses in a 
listwise fashion. Less than 20% of the sample was missing data on any given measure at 
each time point (n=102 missing age 16 LOC eating,17.3%; n=97 missing age 18 LOC 
eating, 16.5%; n=104 missing age 17 awareness and strategies, 17.7%, respectively; n=97 
missing age 18 awareness and strategies, 16.5%, respectively; n=102 missing age 17 
neuroticism, 17.3%; n=95 missing age 18 neuroticism, 16.2%). Chi-square analyses and t-
tests were used to evaluate demographic and psychosocial factors associated with missing 
LOC eating data. Logarithmic transformations were applied to age 16 and age 18 LOC 
eating frequency to correct for positive skew. Two separate linear regression models were 
computed to examine concurrent and prospective associations between emotion regulation 
constructs and LOC eating frequency. For the concurrent model (n=417), emotional 
awareness and emotion regulation strategies at age 18 were examined as correlates of age 18 
LOC eating frequency, controlling for race, SES, BMI, and neuroticism at age 18. For the 
prospective model (n=426), emotional awareness and emotion regulation strategies at age 17 
were examined as predictors of age 18 LOC eating frequency, controlling for age 16 LOC 
eating frequency, and race, SES, BMI, and neuroticism at age 17. A regression-based 
bootstrapping approach (n=431) with k=5,000 re-samples and 95% bias-corrected 
confidence intervals using the PROCESS macro (Hayes, 2013) in SPSS was used to 
simultaneously evaluate the indirect effects of age 17 neuroticism on age 18 LOC eating 
frequency through age 18 emotion regulation constructs, adjusting for the above-mentioned 
covariates, as well as for age 17 emotion regulation constructs. This approach has been 
recommended as the most powerful method for estimating indirect effects, even in large 
samples, in part because it does not rely on assumptions of normality (Preacher & Hayes, 
2008). A regression-based approach was selected to maintain consistency with the preceding

sets of analyses, and its use was informed by a priori hypotheses about the directionality of 
effects. Given that the three main variables in the indirect effect analysis were not available 
at all three time points (i.e., full temporal precedence could not be established), the decision 
was made to establish temporal precedence between the independent variable (neuroticism) 
and the mediating variables (emotion regulation constructs) due to the more substantial 
overlap between these constructs (i.e., both emotion-related constructs; see Table 2). 
Significant mediation was considered to have occurred if the 95% confidence intervals for 
the indirect effect did not contain zero. All data were weighted to account for oversampling 
in low-income neighborhoods, with the exception that mediation analyses utilized 
unweighted data since sample weights cannot be implemented in PROCESS.

Results

Descriptive Characteristics and Intercorrelations

At age 16, 23.9% of the sample (n=141) reported ever engaging in LOC eating (rarely to 
always), and 23.8% (n=140) reported ever engaging in LOC eating at age 18 (see Table 1 for 
descriptive characteristics). Individuals who were missing data on LOC eating did not 
significantly differ from the rest of the sample on race, SES, BMI, emotional awareness, 
emotion regulation strategies, or neuroticism.

Correlations among the independent, dependent, and mediating variables were mostly in the 
medium range (see Table 2).

Concurrent Prediction of Loss of Control Eating Frequency

Poor emotional awareness and deficient emotion regulation strategies at age 18 each were 
associated with LOC eating frequency at the same age, accounting for the effects of race, 
SES, BMI, and neuroticism at age 18. The full model, including both emotion regulation 
constructs, accounted for 15.0% of the variance in age 18 LOC eating frequency, F(6, 
416)=12.11, p<.001, with emotional awareness and emotion regulation strategies accounting 
for an additional 4.5% of the variance beyond the effects of age 18 control variables, F 
change=10.81, p<.001 (see Table 3).

Prospective Prediction of Loss of Control Eating Frequency

Poor emotional awareness at age 17 independently predicted age 18 LOC eating frequency, 
controlling for the effects of age 16 LOC eating frequency and race, SES, BMI, and 
neuroticism at age 17. The full model, including both age 17 emotion regulation constructs, 
accounted for 16.3% of the variance in age 18 LOC eating frequency, F(7, 425)=11.67, p<.
001, with emotional awareness and emotion regulation strategies accounting for an 
additional 1.7% of the variance beyond the effects of age 16 and 17 control variables, F 
change=4.26, p=.015. However, deficient emotion regulation strategies at age 17 was not an 
independent predictor, p=.340 (see Table 4).

Mediation Analyses

Multiple mediation analysis indicated that age 18 emotional awareness and emotion 
regulation strategies mediated the relation between age 17 neuroticism and age 18 LOC

eating frequency, after controlling for age 16 LOC eating frequency and race, SES, BMI, 
and emotion regulation constructs at age 17. Deficient emotion regulation strategies was a 
significant independent mediator, indirect effect estimate=.003, 95% confidence interval=.
001–.005, effect ratio=.600, while poor emotional awareness was not, indirect effect 
estimate=.001, 95% confidence interval=−.000–.005, effect ratio=.111 (see Table 5). The 
direct effect of age 17 neuroticism on age 18 LOC eating frequency was nonsignificant.

Discussion

The purpose of the current study was to explore the concurrent and prospective relationships 
between emotion regulation, negative emotionality, and LOC eating in a community-based 
sample of adolescent girls. We found that poor emotional awareness and limited access to 
adaptive emotion regulation strategies were uniquely associated with greater LOC eating 
concurrently at age 18, and that poor emotional awareness at age 17 uniquely predicted 
greater LOC eating frequency at age 18. Furthermore, limited access to adaptive emotion 
regulation strategies at age 18 significantly mediated the relationship between neuroticism at 
age 17 and LOC eating frequency at age 18 (accounting for 60% of the effects of 
neuroticism on LOC eating frequency), suggesting that poorer emotion regulation at least 
partially explains the well-established association between negative affect and later LOC 
eating (Stice, 2002). Overall, results provide support for the role of emotion dysregulation in 
the development and severity of adolescent LOC eating, although it should be noted that 
effect sizes were mostly small, suggesting that other variables that were not assessed in the 
current study (e.g., interpersonal dysfunction, negative urgency; Elliott et al., 2010; Pearson 
et al., 2012) could account for unexplained variance. Our findings add to the growing 
literature suggesting that emotion regulation is a relevant construct in the etiology and 
maintenance of eating disorders (Leehr et al., 2015; Svaldi et al., 2010; Svaldi et al., 2012), 
supporting the use of interventions aimed at improving one’s understanding, tolerance, and 
management of negative emotions.

Further research is needed to clarify the means by which deficient emotion regulation 
contributes to LOC eating in adolescents at both the trait- and state-level. For example, LOC 
eating may develop in the context of a lack of adaptive emotion regulation strategies, in part 
based on learned expectancies that negative emotions are intolerable (Corstorphine, 
Mountford, Tomlinson, Waller, & Meyer, 2007) and that eating will alleviate negative 
emotions (Combs, Smith, et al., 2011). Experiencing eating as an efficient means of 
alleviating negative affect, and perhaps failing to develop alternative (more adaptive) 
strategies as a consequence, may strengthen these expectancies, such that emotion regulation 
ultimately promotes the momentary occurrence of LOC eating through negative 
reinforcement contingencies (Pearson et al., 2015). This, and other possible models, should 
be explored in future studies.

This study was marked by several important strengths, including the large, racially and 
socioeconomically diverse sample of community-based girls, and the prospective nature of 
the design. However, there are also several limitations. First, because of the epidemiological 
nature of the study, self-report questionnaires were used to assess LOC eating (which was 
operationalized using a single questionnaire item, which, although consistent with previous

research on LOC eating in children, could have introduced measurement bias; Tanofsky-
Kraff, Marcus, Yanovski, & Yanovski, 2008) and emotion-related constructs. Because 
adolescents may tend to over-report LOC eating behaviors on self-report questionnaires 
(Decaluwe & Braet, 2004; Goldschmidt, Doyle, & Wilfley, 2007) due to various forms of 
bias (De Los Reyes & Kazdin, 2005), it is unclear whether similar findings would apply to 
LOC eating as identified by practitioners in clinical settings, or using more objective 
assessment tools. Second, due to the absence of a measure of neuroticism at age 16, we were 
unable to establish full temporal precedence in our mediation model (i.e., age 17 emotion 
regulation mediating the association between age 16 neuroticism and age 18 LOC eating 
frequency). Thus, the directionality of the relationship between emotion regulation and LOC 
eating is unclear, such that having few adaptive strategies may promote LOC eating, and 
LOC eating may simultaneously impair the use of adaptive strategies, perhaps via increased 
reliance on LOC for coping resulting in reduced opportunities to implement more adaptive 
skills (Pearson et al., 2015). Additional research is needed to investigate the directionality of 
effects. Third, due to the small number of participants endorsing LOC eating at each time 
point (i.e., ~24% reporting any LOC eating in the past year at ages 16 and 18), we were 
unable to examine whether emotion regulation is a risk factor for new onset LOC eating, 
which is important in terms of identifying foci for preventive interventions and should be 
investigated in future studies. Fourth, the PROCESS macro did not allow for the application 
of sample weights, thus the findings from our indirect effects analyses cannot be generalized 
beyond our sample, which was oversampled for low income. However, of note, when we re-
ran our mediation analyses using an alternate approach (Baron & Kenny, 1986) which 
allowed us to implement sample weights, results were consistent with the findings from our 
regression-based bootstrapping analysis. Finally, the exclusively female sample precludes 
generalization of our findings to males.

In general, deficits in emotion regulation may serve as a precipitating and/or maintaining 
factor for LOC eating in adolescents, especially when preceded by higher overall negative 
emotionality, and thus should be further explored in future studies, including extending 
findings to eating disorder samples. Importantly, the findings expand on the extant literature 
by suggesting that negative emotionality may not directly impact on loss of control eating, 
but rather operates indirectly through poor emotion regulation. Prospective data collected 
over a longer timeframe are needed to understand the optimal timing of interventions 
designed to prevent the onset of LOC eating, and momentary data could elucidate whether 
emotion dysregulation serves as an acute trigger for LOC eating episodes, which could 
further inform the development of effective interventions for this problem. Moreover, given 
that dialectical behavior therapy, which focuses on reducing emotion dysregulation and 
related maladaptive behaviors, has produced encouraging results in adult BED (Berg & 
Wonderlich, 2013) and has been shown to reduce LOC eating pathology in adolescents in a 
small pilot study as well (Fischer & Peterson, 2015), the current findings should be further 
explored in the context of prevention and early intervention research.
