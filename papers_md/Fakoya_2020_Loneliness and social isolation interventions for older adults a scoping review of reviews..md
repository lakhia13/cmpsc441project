Loneliness and social isolation interventions
for older adults: a scoping review of
reviews
Olujoke A. Fakoya*

, Noleen K. McCorry and Michael Donnelly

Abstract

Background: Loneliness and social isolation are growing public health concerns in our ageing society. Whilst these
experiences occur across the life span, 50% of individuals aged over 60 are at risk of social isolation and one-third
will experience some degree of loneliness later in life. The aim of this scoping review was to describe the range of
interventions to reduce loneliness and social isolation among older adults that have been evaluated; in terms of
intervention conceptualisation, categorisation, and components.
Methods: Three electronic databases (CINAHL, Embase and Medline) were systematically searched for relevant
published reviews of interventions for loneliness and social isolation. Inclusion criteria were: review of any type,
published in English, a target population of older people and reported data on the categorisation of loneliness
and/or social isolation interventions. Data extracted included: categories of interventions and the reasoning
underpinning this categorisation. The methodology framework proposed by Arskey and O’Malley and further
developed by Levac, et al. was used to guide the scoping review process.
Results: A total of 33 reviews met the inclusion criteria, evaluating a range of interventions targeted at older
people residing in the community or institutionalised settings. Authors of reviews included in this paper often used
the same terms to categorise different intervention components and many did not provide a clear definition of
these terms. There were inconsistent meanings attributed to intervention characteristics. Overall, interventions were
commonly categorised on the basis of: 1) group or one-to-one delivery mode, 2) the goal of the intervention, and
3) the intervention type. Several authors replicated the categorisation system used in previous reviews.
Conclusion: Many interventions have been developed to combat loneliness and social isolation among older
people. The individuality of the experience of loneliness and isolation may cause difficulty in the delivery of
standardised interventions. There is no one-size-fits-all approach to addressing loneliness or social isolation, and
hence the need to tailor interventions to suit the needs of individuals, specific groups or the degree of loneliness
experienced. Therefore, future research should be aimed at discerning what intervention works for whom, in what
particular context and how.

Background
Loneliness and social isolation are international public
health concerns that particularly affect the ageing society
globally [1]. Loneliness and social isolation are distinct
but interrelated concepts. According to Valtorta and
Hanratty [2], one of the most widely used definitions of
loneliness constitutes of social and emotional loneliness:
loneliness is a subjective negative feeling associated with
a perceived lack of a wider social network (social loneli-
ness) or absence of a specific desired companion (emo-
tional loneliness). There is much less consensus about
the definition of social isolation however authors have
approached it as a multidimensional concept, defining
social isolation as the objective lack or paucity of social
contacts and interactions with family members, friends
or the wider community [2].

lives

to a certain degree [6],

Loneliness and social isolation are risk factors for all-
cause morbidity and mortality with outcomes compar-
able to other risk factors such as smoking, lack of exer-
cise, obesity and high blood pressure [3–5]. In addition,
loneliness has been associated with decreased resistance
to infection, cognitive decline and mental health condi-
tions such as depression and dementia [3]. Whilst every
individual will experience loneliness at some point in
research has
their
highlighted that older people are particularly vulnerable
to experiencing loneliness and social isolation [7, 8]. Ap-
proximately 50% of individuals aged over 60 are at risk
isolation and one-third will experience some
of social
degree of loneliness later in life [3]. Although loneliness
and social isolation have been associated with a reduc-
tion in health status and therefore a decreased quality of
life, findings suggest that both concepts may have inde-
pendent
impacts on health and therefore should be
regarded as individual characteristics [9]. However, there
is also an overlap in the factors which contribute to
isolation and sometimes authors
loneliness and social
use the terms interchangeably [10, 11].
for

and social
isolation
loneliness
among older people include:
family dispersal, de-
creased mobility and income, loss of loved ones, and
poor health. It is thought that societal change includ-
ing reduced inter-generational
living, greater geo-
graphical mobility and less cohesive communities
have also contributed to higher levels of loneliness in
the older population [7, 12]. Due to advancements in
public health and medical technologies, in addition to
improved sanitation,
the average life expectancy of
the population aged 60 years or over has increased
globally, resulting in a projected 56% growth in this
population from 901 million to 1.4 billion by 2030
[13]. Healthy life expectancy however still lags behind,
and the increasing prevalence of
loneliness contrib-
utes to this state of affairs [14].

Risk factors

Given the increasing burden of loneliness and its im-
pact on health and wellbeing, it is not surprising that
there has been a growing academic literature, public and
policy interest worldwide in loneliness and social isola-
tion. For example, the Campaign to End Loneliness
began in 2010 in the United Kingdom (UK) and aimed
to create connections among older age people [8]. In
Denmark, a campaign titled ‘Danmark spiser sammen’
which when translated in English means ‘Denmark eats
together’ was established in 2015 as a popular movement
against loneliness [15]. The Australian Coalition to End
inspired by the Campaign to End
Loneliness (ACEL),
Loneliness in the UK, was developed in Australia in
2016 and aimed to use evidence-based interventions and
advocacy to increase awareness of, and address, loneli-
ness and physical social
isolation [16]. ACEL did not
clarify what was meant by the term ‘physical social isola-
tion’ and this further highlights the varied terminology
used regarding loneliness and social isolation. There are
also growing campaigns in the Netherlands and New
Zealand to tackle loneliness [1]. ALONE, a national or-
ganisation in Ireland that offers support to older people,
launched a Christmas campaign in 2018 called ‘Have a
Laugh for Loneliness’ which encouraged families, friends
and communities to get together during the winter in
order to combat loneliness in their communities [17].

Several reports about the range and types of loneliness
interventions have been published globally. Within the
United Kingdom, these have included reports by organi-
sations such as Age UK [18] and the Institute of Public
Health in Ireland [19]; guidelines by the National Insti-
tute for Clinical Excellence [20]; reviews by the Social
Care Institute for Excellence [7, 21], and material col-
lated by the Campaign to End Loneliness [1]. The Can-
adian Counselling
and Psychotherapy Association
(CCPA) have published guidelines for addressing loneli-
in the United States of America
ness [22]. Similarly,
(USA), organisations such as Humana [23], have pub-
lished reports and a toolkit to overcome loneliness and
social isolation, and the National Institute on Aging (Na-
tional Institutes of Health) [24] have published reports
on improving the development of interventions to re-
duce loneliness and social isolation.

The report published by Age UK [25] specifically
highlighted the gap between evidence of what consti-
tutes an effective ‘loneliness intervention’
in the aca-
demic literature and the practice of those delivering
interventions. Nevertheless, service providers are experi-
encing increasing demand to provide initiatives to tackle
loneliness, even in the absence of empirical evidence to
fully support their innovations.

There are several published systematic reviews of lone-
liness and/or social isolation interventions, e.g. Cattan
and White [26], Cattan, et al. [10] and Dickens, et al. [9].

For example, Cattan and White [26] critically reviewed
the evidence of effectiveness of health promotion inter-
ventions targeting social isolation and loneliness among
older people. It was reported that an effective interven-
tion to combat social
isolation and loneliness among
older people tended to be long-term group activity
aimed at a specific target group, with an element of par-
ticipant control using a multi-faceted approach [26].
Cattan, et al. [10] conducted a systematic review to de-
termine the effectiveness of health promotion interven-
tions that targeted social isolation and loneliness among
older people, and found educational and social activity
interventions that target specific groups can alleviate so-
cial isolation and loneliness among older people. How-
ever, the effectiveness of home visiting and befriending
schemes remains unclear [10]. Similarly, a systematic re-
view conducted by Dickens, et al. [9] aimed to assess the
effectiveness of interventions designed to alleviate social
isolation and loneliness in older people. It was reported
that common characteristics of effective interventions
were those developed within the context of a theoretical
basis, and those offering social activity and/or support
within a group format. Interventions where older people
were active participants also appeared more likely to be
effective [9].

Within this diverse literature, there are a range of
frameworks used to categorise loneliness/social isolation
interventions, often without clear definitions or ration-
ale. Hence, there is a need to: map, organise and synthe-
sise the large and diverse body of literature in this area;
describe the range of intervention types; and to synthe-
sise their content and characteristics.

Scoping reviews are useful for synthesising research
evidence and are often used to categorise existing litera-
ture in a field. They can be used to map literature in
terms of nature, features and volume; to clarify defini-
tions and conceptual boundaries; and to identify re-
search gaps and recommendations. They are particularly
useful when a body of literature exhibits a large, com-
plex or heterogeneous nature [27].

Scoping review objectives
The objective of this scoping review is to map the large
body of literature and to describe the range of interven-
isolation among
tions to reduce loneliness and social
older adults. By focusing on existing reviews of loneli-
ness/social isolation interventions, it aims to synthesise
the ways in which interventions have been conceptua-
lised and their components described.

Scoping review questions
How have authors of the reviews that were included in
this paper (hereafter referred to as ‘review authors’)

grouped or categorised loneliness and social
interventions?

isolation

How have review authors defined the terms used to

categorise interventions?

How have review authors described their reasoning for

categorising interventions in the format used?

Are there any similarities or differences in the terms

used to categorise interventions across the reviews?

Methods
The conduct of this scoping review was based on the
reported by Arksey and
framework and principles
O’Malley [28] and further recommendations provided by
Levac, et al. [29]. Additional guidance on reporting by
Peters, et al. [27] was also used. As the primary interest
was in capturing how loneliness and social isolation in-
terventions are categorised and described in the litera-
ture, an efficient way of doing this was to focus on
review papers (of any type) rather than primary litera-
ture. Appropriate adjustments were made to reflect the
nature of the evidence (i.e. only secondary evidence) be-
ing reviewed. The review included the following 5 key
phases [28]:

Stage 1: Identifying the research question
Stage 2: Identifying relevant studies
Stage 3: Study selection
Stage 4: Charting the data
Stage 5: Collating, summarising and reporting the
results

The optional ‘consultation exercise’ recommended by

Arskey and O’Malley [28] was not conducted.

Information sources and search strategy
Following several preliminary scoping searches which
were intended to gain familiarity with the literature and
aid with the identification of key words, three health
bibliographic databases (Medline, EMBASE and Cumu-
lative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature
(CINAHL)) were searched for relevant literature from
their inception until the date that the search was con-
ducted (15th June 2018). Searches were devised in col-
laboration with an information specialist librarian and
the research team. The search strategy was developed to
isolation interven-
identify reviews of loneliness/social
tions for older people, but the strategy was tailored to
the specific requirements of each database as seen in
Additional file 1: Table S1. Grey literature was searched
using Google (including Google Scholar) and the first 30
links (sorted by relevance) were compared against the
inclusion criteria. Backward citation chaining was also
undertaken which involved hand-searching the reference
lists of the reviews identified to find other relevant

research [30]. Electronic search results were exported
into an Excel spreadsheet and duplicates deleted. Add-
itional
file 1: Table S1 details the search terms and
strategy.

Eligibility criteria
Whilst loneliness and social isolation are distinct con-
cepts (as defined previously), we have included both out-
comes as a focus of the review but have taken care to
document the review findings in relation to these con-
cepts. Hence, papers were included if they satisfied all of
the following eligibility criteria:

1) A review of any type;
2) Available in English language;
3) Focus of the review on loneliness and/or social
isolation interventions for older adults/elderly
individuals;

4) Reported a categorisation of loneliness and/or social
isolation interventions or grouped interventions.

Reviews of interventions in any setting or context, in-
cluding older populations with existing physical or men-
tal health problems were of interest. Since there are
various definitions of the age range of ‘older’ popula-
tions, a lower age limit was not specified as an inclusion
criteria. Rather, reviews were included which identified
themselves as focusing on older people. There were no
limiters applied in relation to date or subject, but the
search was limited to reviews published in English be-
cause of limited resources for translation.

Selection of reviews
The selection of relevant reviews was undertaken in
three stages: 1) Initial screening of the title and abstract
which was conducted by the first author (OAF), 2) re-
trieval and screening of the full text which was com-
pleted independently by the first and second authors
(OAF and NMC), with discrepancies resolved through
discussion with all three authors, and 3) data extraction
and collation. The agreement coefficient was 97%. Pa-
pers that did not meet the criteria were excluded, with
the reason(s)
for exclusion recorded. The Preferred
Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-
Analysis (PRISMA) chart (Fig. 1) reports the phases of
paper identification and selection.

Data extraction and charting
Eligible papers were independently reviewed by OAF
and NMC and the following data were extracted: author
information (title, author and year of publication), aims
and objectives of the review, type of review (e.g. system-
atic, literature etc.), inclusion criteria used in the review
(where appropriate), number of primary studies included

in the review (where appropriate), number of interven-
tions reviewed (where appropriate), categories used by
the review authors, and any explanation given by the au-
thors in regards to the categorisation of interventions. It
should be noted that the following parameters were not
applicable to non-systematic type reviews such as basic
literature reviews and some evidence reviews: inclusion
criteria; number of primary studies; and number of in-
terventions reviewed.

Results
Literature search
Electronic searches identified 529 citations, resulting in
485 unique citations to be screened for inclusion follow-
ing removal of duplicates (see Fig. 1). The titles and ab-
stracts were assessed for their relevance to the review
based on the inclusion criteria (Stage 1 screening),
resulting in 46 citations being retained. The full texts of
all these citations were obtained and after applying the
inclusion criteria (Stage 2 selection), 30 citations were
excluded; 12 did not provide data relevant to categorisa-
tion of loneliness and/or social isolation intervention(s),
15 were not reviews and three did not have a primary or
secondary objective of reducing loneliness and/or social
isolation. An additional 17 citations were identified
through backward citation chaining and these citations
were also included. As such, 33 citations were included
in the scoping review (see Fig. 1). Characteristics of the
included reviews are shown as a structured table and as
a narrative summary in Additional file 2: Table S2.

Characteristics of reviews
There is increasing interest and research in the area of
loneliness and social isolation among the older popula-
tion. The first review appeared in 1984 and following
that, there were three more reviews up until the year
2003. Subsequently, there were more frequent publica-
tions of literature on loneliness and/or social isolation
and at least one review was published consecutively
every year from 2010 onwards. This information is rep-
resented in a diagrammatic form in Fig. 2.

Type of reviews
Review papers were published between 1984 and 2017
and of these, systematic reviews were the most common
type of reviews obtained [9, 10, 26, 31–41], followed by lit-
erature reviews [6, 42–47], evidence reviews [18, 48–50],
narrative reviews [25, 51, 52], and other types of review in-
cluding critical [53], empirical [54], rapid [55] and integra-
tive review [11]. This information is represented in a
diagrammatic form in Fig. 3.

Of those reviews which employed a systematic means
of selecting eligible primary research (n = 14), ten papers
included only studies published in English, two review

Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR): Checklist and Explanation. Annals of Internal Medicine. 2018. pp. 467–473. doi: https://doi.org/10.7326/M18-0850

papers included studies published in any language, one
review included studies published in English and Italian
[34], and 1 included studies published in English,
French, Italian and Spanish [41].

Concept of loneliness and social isolation
In terms of the consideration of the concepts of loneli-
ness and social isolation, most reviews (28/33) could be
assigned to one of three categories: 1) reviews that expli-
citly focused on interventions to reduce social isolation
(n = 4) e.g. Chen and Schulz [37], Findlay [33], Oliver,
et al. [47] and Wilson and Cordier [52]; 2) reviews that
explicitly focused on interventions to alleviate loneliness
(n = 11), e.g. McWhirter [6] and Masi, et al. [31] and
Cohen-Mansfield and Perach [53]; and 3) reviews that
included papers with interventions for both loneliness
and social isolation (n = 13) e.g. Poscia, et al. [34] and
Cattan, et al. [10]. The remaining five reviews focused

on loneliness and other outcomes of interests such as
anxiety and depression (n = 3); or other related concepts
such as social participation [56], and social connected-
ness [35]. While there is a distinction between loneliness
and social isolation, there was not any obvious differ-
ences in reviews that focused on loneliness or social iso-
lation in terms of the review type, where the research
was conducted, and how the findings were reported.

Loneliness/social isolation was not always reported as
the primary outcome and was sometimes reported
alongside other health outcomes as seen in three reviews
[36, 38, 40]. A review by Choi, et al. [40] examined the
effectiveness of computer and internet training on redu-
cing loneliness and depression in older adults. Elias,
et al. [38] evaluated the effectiveness of group reminis-
cence therapy for loneliness, anxiety and depression in
older adults. In a review by Franck, et al. [36], interven-
isolation,
tions were reviewed if they addressed social

loneliness, or the combination of depression with social
isolation or loneliness. In a systematic review by Morris,
et al. [35], the effectiveness of smart technologies was ex-
amined in improving or maintaining social connectedness.

Population characteristics
The majority of the reviews (n = 24) focused solely on
the older population [9–11, 18, 25, 26, 32–41, 46, 48–51,
53, 55, 56] but the age range used to define this popula-
tion varied [32, 35–38, 53], or was not specified at all
[9–11, 26, 33, 46, 51, 56]. For example, a systematic re-
view by Morris, et al. [35] targeted older people who live
at home and included participants that were aged ≥45
years, whereas Cohen-Mansfield and Perach [53] and
Chen and Schulz [37] targeted individuals aged ≥55
years; and Chipps, et al. [32], Franck, et al. [36], and

[38]

targeted individuals aged ≥60 years.
Elias, et al.
Where age was not specified, review authors used the
term ‘older people’ or its synonyms, e.g. older adults [40]
and seniors [39, 56], to describe the target population. It
was stated in two of these reviews that the definition for
the older person was defined by the criteria used in the
studies included in the review [26, 56].

Some reviews focused on specific subgroups of the
older population which research has identified to be
more prone to loneliness and social isolation. For ex-
ample, six reviews focused only on older people residing
within the community [6, 10, 39, 42, 48, 52], whereas
three focused only on older people living in institutiona-
lised settings e.g. care or nursing homes [36, 38, 47].
The majority of reviews (21 in total) included popula-
tions of both community-dwelling individuals and those

common type of reviews published between 1984 and 2018. Other types of reviews include literature, evidence, narrative, critical, empirical, rapid
and integrative reviews

living in long-term care [9, 11, 18, 25, 31–35, 37, 40, 41,
44–46, 49–51, 53, 55, 56]. Residential status was not re-
ported in three reviews [26, 43, 54]. This population
characteristic is represented diagrammatically in Fig. 4.

Only two of the 33 reviews [41, 52] included gender as
an inclusion criteria, and these two papers focused spe-
cifically on interventions targeted at the male population
only, including Men’s Sheds [52] and gendered interven-
tions for older men [41]. Men’s Sheds are community-
based organisations that provide a space for older men
to participate in craftwork and engage in social inter-
action [52]. Review authors often reported that the gen-
der distribution of participants in primary research
involving loneliness/social isolation was heavily skewed
towards the female population [31, 33, 34, 37, 39]. The
subsets of the female population reported in the reviews
includes: isolated older women, women at risk of suicide,
senior women on the housing waiting list
[33];
community-living, chronically ill women [31]; women
with primary breast cancer, community-dwelling, single
low-income
and community-dwelling
women [34];
women with low perceived social support [39].

Countries in which interventions were delivered
The countries in which interventions were delivered was
not reported in some of the review papers (n = 16). Of
the papers that did report this (n = 17), USA was the
most reported (n = 14), followed by Netherlands (n = 13),
Canada (n = 10), UK (n = 9), Australia (n = 8), Sweden
(n = 8), Finland (n = 5), Taiwan (n = 5), Israel (n = 4),
Norway (n = 4), Germany (n = 4), Japan (n = 3), China
(n = 2), Hong Kong (n-2), Denmark (n = 2), Italy (n = 2),

New Zealand (n = 2), South Africa (n = 1), Austria
(n = 1), Slovenia (n = 1) and Iran (n = 1).

Categorisation of interventions
There was a broad range of terms that review authors
used to describe the characteristics of
interventions,
such as: format [31], delivery mode [9, 31, 34], goal [42,
44, 46], type [9, 31, 34, 53], focus [53], and nature [46],
and often the same terms had different meanings. Some
authors used two or more categorisation systems as seen
in the reviews by Dickens, et al. [9] and Poscia, et al.
[34], where interventions were categorised by both their
‘delivery mode’ and ‘type’. Alternatively Grenade and
Boldy [46] categorised interventions by their ‘nature’ and
‘goal’, and Cohen-Mansfield and Perach [53] categorised
interventions based on their ‘focus’ and ‘type’. Masi,
et al. [31] categorised interventions based on their ‘type,
format and mode’. It was common (n = 20) for review
authors to categorise interventions on the basis of
whether they were delivered via a ‘group’ or ‘one-to-one’
[9, 10, 18, 26, 31, 33, 34, 36, 38, 39, 42, 44–46, 49–51,
53, 55, 56]. In a review by Raymond, et al. [56], social
participation interventions were delivered in an individ-
ual or group context. Elias, et al. [38] explored the ef-
fectiveness of group reminiscence therapy in alleviating
loneliness whereas the Medical Advisory Secretariat [39]
evaluated in-person group-based interventions in allevi-
ating loneliness and social isolation among community-
dwelling care seniors. The term ‘mode’ was used fre-
quently within review papers but often with inconsistent
meanings. By way of illustration, Poscia, et al. [34] and
[9] referred to the categorisation of
Dickens, et al.

Fig. 4 Pie-chart of residential status of populations included in eligible reviews identified. The majority of reviews (n = 21) included populations of
both community-dwelling individuals and those living in long-term care. Six reviews focused solely on older people residing within the
community and three focused solely on older people living in institutionalised settings such as care or nursing homes. Three reviews did not
report the residential status of the target population

interventions via group or one-to-one delivery as ‘mode’,
and classified interventions as individual, group or mixed
(both individual and group). In contrast, delivery ‘mode’ in
Masi, et al.’s [31] review referred to ‘technology’ or ‘non-
technology’ based interventions, and ‘format’ was used to
describe whether the intervention was implemented on a
one-to-one basis or as a group (if more than one person
participated in the intervention at the same time or if the
intervention involved asynchronous interactions such as
internet-based chat room exchanges).

Some review authors categorised interventions by their
type (n = 4) [9, 31, 34, 53], and the descriptions for this
category also varied. In a review by Dickens, et al. [9], in-
terventions categorised by their ‘type’ were described as:
‘offering activities’ (e.g. social or physical programmes),
‘support’ (discussion, counselling, therapy or education),
‘home visiting’ or ‘service provision’.
‘internet training’,
In another review, intervention type was described as: 1)
social skills training if it focused on improving partici-
pants’ interpersonal communication skills, 2) enhancing
social support if the intervention offered regular con-
tacts, care or companionship, 3) social access if the
intervention increased opportunities for participants to
engage in social interaction (e.g. online chat room or so-
cial activities), and 4) social cognitive training if the
intervention focused on changing participants’ social
cognition [31].

Similar to the categories used in the review by Masi,
et al. [31], Poscia, et al. [34] categorised interventions by
their type, further describing the category as offering: [1]
social support (e.g. discussion, counselling, therapy or
education), 2) social activities,
in form of social pro-
grammes, 3) Physical activity (fitness programme or rec-
reational activity), 4) technology (e.g. companion robot,
telephone befriending or internet use), 5) singing ses-
sions, and 6) horticultural therapy. By contrast, when
Cohen-Mansfield and Perach [53] categorised interven-
tions by their ‘type’ this referred to whether interven-
tions were delivered in a ‘group’ or ‘one-to-one’.

Three reviews categorised interventions by their ‘goal’
[42, 44, 46]. In two of these reviews [42, 44] the same
constructs were used to define goals and these were: 1)
to facilitate social bonding e.g. via cognitive behaviour
therapy or social skills training, 2) to enhance coping
with loneliness e.g. through support groups, and 3) to
prevent loneliness from occurring e.g. through commu-
nity awareness and educational programs. In the third
review [46], the authors implicitly addressed these three
constructs but used different terminology, i.e. to enhance
people’s social networks, and promote personal efficacy
and behaviour modification, and/or skills development.
A similar categorisation system was used by Cacioppo,
et al. [45], but these review authors labelled this category
as ‘models of loneliness interventions’ rather than ‘goal’,

and included interventions aimed to: 1) provide social
support, 2) increase opportunities for social interaction
and 3) teach lonely people to master social skills.

A total of six reviews focused on technology-based in-
terventions to improve communication and social con-
nection among older people [32, 35, 37, 40, 47, 48]. An
evidence review by Age UK [48] reviewed the use of
modern (e.g. internet) and assistive technology (e.g. tele-
care or telehealth) in maintaining and establishing social
contact. Chen and Schulz [37] reviewed the effects of
communication programs such as telephone befriending,
computer and internet, and high-technology apps such
as virtual pet companions in reducing loneliness and so-
cial
isolation in the elderly. The effectiveness of e-
interventions which can be described as online activities
e.g. computer or internet training and usage; interper-
sonal communication e.g. Skype; and internet-operated
therapeutic software e.g. Nintendo Wii entertainment
system and videogames, were synthesised and assessed
for decreasing social
isolation and loneliness among
older people living in community/residential care [32].
One systematic review evaluated the effectiveness of
smart
technologies [35], which can be described as
internet-based support groups and computer use and
training, whereas the potential of videophone technology
in improving communication between residents and
family members was reviewed by Oliver, et al. [47]. In
another review, computer and internet training among
lonely and depressed older adults were examined [40].

The rationale for the categorisation of interventions
was reported in the majority of reviews (n = 21). It was
stated in an integrative review by Gardiner, et al. [11]
that interventions were categorised based on their pur-
pose, intended outcomes and mechanisms by which they
targeted loneliness and social isolation. Gardiner, et al.
[11] highlighted the importance of this categorisation
given the growing diversity in intervention types, and
considered rigorous and transparent categorisation to be
a necessary pre-requisite for identifying which elements
of interventions influence their effectiveness. Their the-
matic synthesis identified six categories which included:
social facilitation interventions, psychological therapies,
health and social care provision, animal
interventions,
befriending interventions, and leisure/skills development.
In a narrative synthesis by Jopling [25],
interventions
were grouped in accordance to addressing three key
challenges: 1) reaching lonely individuals, 2) understand-
ing the nature of an individual’s loneliness and develop-
ing a personalised response, and 3) supporting lonely
individuals to access appropriate services.

Other reviews [36–41, 47–51, 55] did not report a ra-
tionale for the categorisation of interventions (as seen in
Additional file 2: Table S2). Some review authors justi-
fied their categories on the basis that they had been used

Fakoya et al. BMC Public Health          (2020) 20:129 

Page 9 of 14

in previous reviews, e.g. two reviews [10, 33] replicated
the categorisation used in a previous study by Cattan
and White where intervention studies were divided into
four categories based on the programme or method type,
i.e. group activity; one-to-one intervention; service deliv-
ery; and whole community approach [26]. Likewise,
McWhirter [6] used similar categories as Rook and Peplau
[57], such as cognitive-behavioural therapy, social skills
training, and the development of social support networks;
Andersson [42] categorised interventions based on the
typology of social network interventions by Biegel, et al.
[58] (either clinical treatment, family caretaker enhance-
ment, case management, neighbourhood helping, volun-
teering linking, mutual aid/self-help, and community
empowerment); and Masi, et al. [31] categorised the inter-
vention type (i.e. providing social access, social cognitive
training, social skills training or social support) based on
similar constructs used in the reviews by Rook [44],
McWhirter [6], Cattan and White [26], Findlay [33],
Cattan, et al. [10] and Perese and Wolf [43].

Discussion
The objective of this scoping review was to map the
large body of literature and describe the range of inter-
ventions aimed at reducing loneliness and/or social iso-
lation among older adults. By focusing on existing
reviews of
it
aimed to synthesise the ways in which interventions have
been conceptualised and their components described.

isolation interventions,

loneliness/social

There are various interpretations of loneliness and so-
cial isolation in the literature. Social isolation can be de-
fined as ‘a state in which an individual lacks a sense of
lacks engagement with others, and
belonging socially,
has a minimal number of social contacts which are defi-
cient in fulfilling quality relationships’ [59–62]. On the
loneliness can be defined as a ‘subjective
other hand,
state based on a person’s emotional perception of the
number and/or quality of social connections needed in
comparison to what is being experienced at the time’
[63, 64]. There is evidence to suggest that both concepts
are distinct [9, 65–67] as an individual can have a large
number of social connections and still experience the
subjective feeling of loneliness, or alternatively be object-
ively isolated but not experience loneliness [68]. For
some individuals, social isolation is a risk factor for lone-
liness [18], and hence interventions designed to target
social isolation may also alleviate loneliness. For other
individuals, where the pathway to loneliness is not as a
result of social isolation, such interventions are likely to
have limited impact.

Although it is generally understood that loneliness and
social isolation are distinct concepts, some review au-
thors have stated that the terms are often used inter-
changeably [10, 11, 46] or are conflated into a single

construct [68]. While there were fewer reviews identified
that specifically focused on social isolation (n = 4) com-
pared to loneliness (n = 11), there were no differences in
terms of the countries where the research was conducted,
the review type, or how the findings were reported. Distin-
guishing between the concepts of loneliness and social iso-
lation is
important when describing the goals of
interventions and hence for specifying intervention char-
acteristics that are relevant and effective in addressing
each of these problems [4]. This clarity is necessary if ser-
vice providers are to use the accumulated evidence to
choose interventions which are appropriate and effective
relative to their service context and goals, for matching in-
dividuals to appropriate interventions, and for choosing
appropriate outcome measures for evaluation. Rook [44]
made reference to the causes of
loneliness and often
linked these with the ‘goal’ of the interventions. Social in-
hibition or deficient social skills were linked to loneliness
for some people and hence it was suggested that helping
lonely individuals establish interpersonal ties might im-
prove how they relate to others or provide new opportun-
ities for them to have social contact. Alternatively,
in
circumstances where an individual was geographically iso-
lated, an intervention which improves the social network
may be more appropriate.

Review authors have used a range of terms to categor-
ise the characteristics of interventions, such as mode of
delivery, focus, nature, format, type and goal, but often
with different meanings. Interventions were commonly
categorised only by whether they were delivered to a
group or to an individual. This is an important charac-
teristic because group interventions are likely to be more
appropriate for addressing social loneliness among indi-
viduals with insufficient social links [69] than one-to-
one interventions. However, it is only one of many inter-
vention characteristics which may be directly, or via
interaction with other characteristics, associated with
intervention effectiveness.

Terms and terminology are important when undertak-
ing research in the field of loneliness [70]. Consistency
in the definition of the terms and terminology increases
accuracy, improves reporting, and aids in the replication
of interventions across contexts [71].

In some reviews, the underlying theoretical basis or ra-
tionale for the categorisation of interventions was not
provided. Lack of theoretical underpinnings or explana-
tions as to why interventions were categorised in a cer-
tain manner could lead to difficulty when attempting to
distinguish in what context a particular category of
intervention is most appropriate or effective. This re-
duces the value of the accumulated evidence base, since
we are less able to identify candidate characteristics that
may contribute to the effectiveness of
interventions.
there is a need for the development of a

comprehensive framework that encompasses, defines,
and elucidates all the key constructs identified in this
scoping review. Without this framework, research to
identify the effective mechanisms of loneliness interven-
tions will be undermined by lack of clarity around inter-
vention characteristics.

Interventions to reduce loneliness and/or social isola-
tion are complex as they have several interacting compo-
nents (e.g. goals, personnel, activities, resources and
delivery mode), which may interact with features of the
local context in which they are applied (e.g. age profile
of participants, health status, environment such as hous-
ing, and cultural characteristics) [72]. These characteris-
tics need to be sufficiently described in order to allow
use of the body of evidence to identify which character-
istics (or combination of characteristics) are effective in
a particular context and for which specific population.

The Template for Intervention Description and Repli-
cation (TIDieR) checklist and guide, published by Hoff-
mann, et al. [73] was developed as an extension of the
Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT)
2010 statement [74] and the Standard Protocol Items:
Recommendations for
Interventional Trials (SPIRIT)
2013 statement [75]. The TIDieR checklist provides a
to describe key
standardised template for authors
elements for reporting of non-pharmacological interven-
tions. The development of the checklist is associated
standardising
with
towards
the growing
research reporting, demonstrated by
EQUATOR (Enhancing the QUAlity and Transpar-
ency Of health Research) network [73]. The overarch-
ing purpose of
is to prompt
the TIDieR checklist
authors to describe interventions sufficiently in order
to allow their replication [73].

a wider movement

The benefits of using the TIDieR framework is that it
can be used for better description and reporting of inter-
ventions. This may lead to a more standardised report-
ing of
intervention characteristics particularly in the
primary literature, and therefore make synthesis of the
literature more consistent. Additionally,
it allows for
comparison of key characteristics of interventions and
for synthesis of interventions that share similar charac-
teristics. The checklist makes it easier for authors to
structure the accounts of their interventions/services; for
editors to assess these descriptions; and for readers to
use the information [73]. However, although the TIDieR
checklist may go some way towards assisting with the
reporting of complex interventions, it might not be able
to capture the full complexity of these interventions [73]
such as the interaction between different intervention
components or their combined effect, the difficulty or
complexity of behaviours/skills required either by those
delivering or receiving the intervention; and also vari-
ability of outcomes [76]. This is particularly relevant to

loneliness/social
isolation interventions which rely on
more than one mechanism, therefore making it unclear
which particular aspect of the intervention contributed
most to its success or failure.

The heterogeneous nature of the interventions aimed
at alleviating loneliness and/or social
isolation among
the older population; the settings where they are deliv-
ered e.g. care home or community; the group or one-to-
one intervention delivery mode; and the population
characteristics described in this scoping review, present
a challenge for policy recommendations. The individual-
ity of the experience of loneliness is also an important
issue which has also been highlighted in the literature, as
this may cause difficulty in the delivery of standardised
interventions [3]. There is no one-size-fits-all approach
to loneliness interventions [25, 70], and it is recom-
mended that the assessment of individual needs should
be conducted during the early phases of intervention,
with subsequent tailoring of programmes to meet the
needs of individuals [77], specific groups or the degree
and determinants of the individual’s loneliness. This in-
cludes sociodemographic factors i.e. age, poverty, being
a carer; the social environment i.e. access to transport,
driving status and place or resident; and physical or
mental health [2]. It is also essential to consider the
needs of less well-researched groups such as individuals
with physical disabilities, or ethnic minority groups,
caregivers, recent immigrants, individuals with hearing
and visual impairments, those who have been isolated
for a long time, and older men [78]. Several review au-
thors have reported that the uptake of participants in
the primary studies was heavily skewed towards the fe-
male population. This may be due to the reluctance of
older men to engage with services and activities com-
pared to women [41]. Moreover, women also have a lon-
ger life expectancy across nations than men, and are
more likely to participate in research studies [37].

Systematic reviews are most appropriate for synthesis-
ing the findings of research that evaluates clinical treat-
ments (simple interventions) [79] and consequently base
their estimates of effectiveness on one (or more) of the
intervention characteristics, e.g. group or individual de-
livery settings. Complex interventions have several inter-
connecting parts and it is recognised that the evaluation
of this type of interventions should go beyond the ques-
tion of effectiveness to identify ‘mechanisms’ of action
which can be described as the resources offered through
an intervention and the way that people respond to
those resources (for example, how do resources intersect
with participant’s beliefs, reasoning, attitude, ideas and
opportunities?) [80, 81]. Hence, a realist review may be a
more suitable approach to research synthesis when
attempting to understand the mechanisms by which
complex social interventions work (or not) in particular

Fakoya et al. BMC Public Health          (2020) 20:129 

Page 11 of 14

contexts [62]. The realist review is a model of research
synthesis that is designed to work with complex inter-
ventions or programmes and provides an explanatory
analysis aimed at discerning what works, for whom, in
what circumstances, in what respects and how [82]. This
approach is more likely to result in findings that will
help to identify and tailor interventions to fit the profile
of the individual and their pathway to loneliness.

Strengths and limitations
A strength of this scoping review is that it is the first re-
view of its type to examine the range of loneliness inter-
ventions for the older population and to describe how
these interventions have been reported and categorised.
It has highlighted the need for an appropriate framework
to specify and describe the nature of loneliness and so-
isolation interventions, ideally a framework which
cial
defines interventions based on their mechanisms of ac-
tion, and as a result helps to tailor or choose interven-
tions which are matched to the individual’s needs and
pathway to loneliness. Although this review utilised mul-
tiple databases and grey literature, searching other data-
bases such as Cochrane Library and PsychInfo may have
yielded other relevant published papers relevant to the
aims of this scoping review. In addition, because the re-
view was limited to papers published in the English lan-
guage,
is possible that other potentially relevant
reviews were omitted. A quality assessment of the re-
views included was not undertaken, although this is not
always necessary for scoping reviews (Arksey and O’Mal-
ley, 2006).

Conclusion
A broad range of interventions have been developed in
an attempt to combat loneliness and social
isolation
Interventions were often cate-
among older people.
they were
gorised solely on the basis of whether
delivered to a group or an individual. Moreover, the
underlying theoretical basis or rationale for the categor-
isation was not provided in a third of reviews. Lack of
theoretical
reasoning could lead to difficulty when
attempting to distinguish in what context a particular
category of intervention is most appropriate or effective,
and also by which mechanisms these interventions work
to reduce loneliness and social isolation. Comprehensive
description of these interventions, using appropriate and
consistent terminology should be encouraged as this will
increase the value of the accumulated evidence base for
service providers and policy-makers. Not all older people
experience loneliness in the same way or to the same
degree and hence there is a pressing need to tailor inter-
ventions to meet individual’s requirements. It is recom-
mended that future research differentiates the diverse
group of older adults and takes an approach aimed at

discerning what interventions work for specific subsets
of this population; the contexts where these interven-
tions work; and the mechanisms by which they operate
in that given context. This information will be highly
valuable in the planning and implementation of pro-
grammes to reduce loneliness and social isolation, and
improving the wellbeing of older people.
