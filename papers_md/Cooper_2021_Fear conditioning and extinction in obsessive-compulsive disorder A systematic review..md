Abstract

Laboratory experiments using fear conditioning and extinction protocols help lay the groundwork 
for designing, testing, and optimizing innovative treatments for anxiety-related disorders. Yet, 
there is limited basic research on fear conditioning and extinction in obsessive-compulsive 
disorder (OCD). This is surprising because exposure-based treatments based on associative 
learning principles are among the most popular and effective treatment options for OCD. Here, 
we systematically review and critically assess existing aversive conditioning and extinction 
studies of OCD. Across 12 studies, there was moderate evidence that OCD is associated with 
abnormal acquisition of conditioned responses that differ from comparison groups. There was 
relatively stronger evidence of OCD’s association with impaired extinction processes. This 
included multiple studies finding elevated conditioned responses during extinction learning 
and poorer threat/safety discrimination during recall, although a minority of studies yielded 
results inconsistent with this conclusion. Overall, the conditioning model holds value for OCD 
research, but more work is necessary to clarify emerging patterns of results and increase clinical 
translational utility to the level seen in other anxiety-related disorders. We detail limitations in 
the literature and suggest next steps, including modeling OCD with more complex conditioning 
methodology (e.g., semantic/conceptual generalization, avoidance) and improving individual­
differences assessment with dimensional techniques.

Introduction

Page 2

Translating conditioning and extinction principles and paradigms to effective behavioral 
treatments has led to the development of effective first-line treatments for anxiety-related 
disorders, most notably exposure therapies (Foa & McLean, 2016; Rachman, 2015). One 
of the disorders that benefits from exposure intervention is obsessive-compulsive disorder 
(OCD; American Psychiatric Association, 2013). OCD is an anxiety-related disorder 
associated with considerable personal and occupational burden (Huppert et al., 2009; 
Markarian et al., 2010) and characterized by entrenched and intrusive obsessional cognitive 
content (including thoughts, images, and impulses) and interfering compulsive behaviors. 
The gold-standard exposure intervention for OCD is exposure and response prevention 
(EX/RP; Foa et al., 2012; Meyer, 1966; Rachman et al., 1971), which primarily involves 
techniques that teach the patient to resist enacting a compulsion while enduring obsession­
related distress. Although EX/RP is the most effective available behavioral treatment for 
OCD (Olatunji et al., 2013), a significant minority of patients either do not respond to 
the treatment, drop-out, or show symptom remission and do not maintain treatment gain 
(Abramowitz, 1996; Fisher & Wells, 2005; Foa & McLean, 2016; Jacoby & Abramowitz, 
2016; Johnco et al., 2020; Simpson et al., 2006). A noteworthy statistic regarding EX/RP 
is that up to 60% of patients with OCD who complete the treatment go on to experience 
partial relapse of symptoms (Eisen et al., 2013). Unfavorable exposure treatment outcomes 
are attributed to multiple factors. This includes factors common to many treatments, such 
as poor adherence to between-session work (Ojalehto et al., 2020), and those more specific 
to EX/RP’s underlying classical conditioning framework, such as failure of within-session 
learning generalizing outside of the therapy context and the insufficiency of habituation to 
a feared stimulus (Jacoby & Abramowitz, 2016). Due to these known difficulties related 
to EX/RP, as well as the associative learning underpinnings of exposure interventions 
in general, both basic and clinical scientists have proposed increased investigation into 
perturbed classical conditioning and extinction processes in OCD as a potential route 
forward for further innovation and improvement in EX/RP and related therapies (e.g., Foa & 
McLean, 2016; Jacoby & Abramowitz, 2016).

1.1  OCD and Classical Conditioning and Extinction Principles

Classical fear conditioning (Pavlov, 1927) is the process through which an inherently neutral 
unconditioned stimulus becomes a conditioned stimulus (CS) through repeated pairings with 
an inherently aversive unconditioned stimulus (US). Through acquisition of the aversive CS­
US association, the CS is capable of eliciting a conditioned response (CR), such as defensive 
reactions, increased physiological responses, and subjective reports of fear in humans. 
Following acquisition of the CR, the CR can be diminished through repeated presentations 
of the CS in the absence of the US (i.e., extinction). Both conditioning and extinction 
learning are increasingly well-understood across animal species at both the behavioral 
and neural levels (Fullana et al., 2016, 2018; Maren, 2001; Vervliet & Boddez, 2020). 
Conditioning and extinction offer a compelling and testable framework for understanding 
anxiety-related disorders, as they describe fundamental mechanisms through which people 
acquire severe anxiety that does not abate over time or through new experiences (Mineka & 
Zinbarg, 2006; Vervliet, Craske, et al., 2013).

The components of classical conditioning are evident in established behavioral models of 
OCD (Rachman & Hodgson, 1980; Teasdale, 1974) (see Figure 1). For example, the CR 
can take the form of distressing obsessions that arise from observing, experiencing, or 
imagining a negative consequence (US) related to an object or situation (CS). Examples 
include a patient seeing a family member cut themselves on a knife the patient owns or 
imagining stabbing the family member, or the patient becoming sick after touching an 
unclean surface. Further, the obsessions are not limited to the period around the initial 
experience of the CS and US together and often continue unabated even when the US is 
not present, such as when the patient’s family member uses a knife but does not sustain 
an injury. This is analogous to impaired extinction learning, such that the CR does not 
diminish in the absence of the US. In some circumstances, the obsessions can serve as the 
CS itself, as the obsessional content leads to subsequent thoughts that are also distressing. 
For example, some patients think about a family member being hurt and then think, “I am 
evil for wanting that to happen.” Obsessions might inevitably gain distressing properties 
through this type of circuitous process (Salkovskis, 1985). Obsessional content and distress 
can also generalize to neutral stimuli that incidentally resemble the initial CS. In the case of 
a knife that caused a family member harm, generalization might lead to other bladed objects 
or household tools becoming CSs. Compulsions, such as constantly checking if dangerous 
objects are locked away, can temporarily reduce obsessions but circumvent the opportunity 
for exposure and lead to the return of maladaptive and unwanted thoughts and behavior 
(Meyer, 1966). In other words, extinction of the CR does not occur and there is only a 
temporary reduction. Further, compulsions are more likely to be enacted in the future due 
to strengthened associations with temporary relief from distress (i.e., negative reinforcement; 
Mowrer, 1947). Although the described conditioning model does not fully explain the 
phenomenology of OCD (see work on cognitive models, e.g., Abramowitz et al., 2007; 
Salkovskis, 1999; Taylor et al., 2007), it provides a key foundation for systematic empirical 
investigation into the pathological substrates of the disorder and offers considerable promise 
for productive clinical translational efforts.

1.2  The Current Review

To date, there has not been a systematic review of conditioning work in OCD, and thus 
there is not currently a synthesis of the literature to serve as a foundation for future research. 
In particular, it is not clear if impaired acquisition and extinction of conditioned fear are 
characteristic of OCD and, if so, what form or pattern these deficits take. Synthesizing this 
literature and drawing cross-study conclusions is particularly needed before the important 
next step of leveraging experimental conditioning work to improve treatment for OCD, 
especially as exciting new avenues for extinction-based treatments, such as behavioral and 
pharmaceutical extinction enhancers, emerge from pre-clinical research (for reviews, see 
Craske et al., 2014; Dunsmoor et al., 2015). In the current review, we address this need 
by systematically reviewing the OCD and conditioning literature to determine if aberrant 
acquisition and extinction processes are consistently related to OCD across studies. We also 
evaluate design differences and experimental and assessment limitations that potentially 
hinder strong conclusions, with a goal of providing recommendations for future work 
in this area. We limit the scope of our review to studies using associative conditioning 
paradigms employing aversive USs. Empirical interest in conditioning and anxiety-related

disorders primarily focuses on aversive conditioning, and current OCD treatments place 
a large emphasis on the reduction of unpleasant emotional experiences and the behaviors 
they motivate. We also limit reviewed articles to studies of classical (i.e., Pavlovian) 
aversive conditioning and extinction in OCD. Currently, there are not a sufficient number of 
published studies to allow for a comprehensive review of other forms of conditioning (e.g., 
operant conditioning) as they relate to OCD.

We first provide an overview of the methodological characteristics of identified studies and 
then provide a detailed narrative review of key findings from each study. We next briefly 
summarize acquisition and extinction results across studies, discuss the findings from our 
review in the context of the larger conditioning and OCD literature, and conclude with a 
discussion of broad next steps and specific future recommendations in this area.

2.  Method

Our systematic review was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items 
for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA; Moher et al., 2009) statement. The 
documents used during literature search and screening for this review are available via this 
project’s repository on the Open Source Framework (https://osf.io/a6wm4/).

2.1  Literature Search Strategy

Our strategy was designed to find published empirical work that 1) applied a classical 
conditioning protocol 2) using an aversive US 3) to test people with and without OCD or 
those with differing levels of OCD-related traits (e.g., personality traits that are empirically 
demonstrated to relate to OCD, but also are present to some degree in most people), 
including some with elevated levels that are consistent with OCD pathology, and 4) reported 
between-group differences or correlational analyses with an OCD scale on one or more 
conditioning index. We did not exclude eyeblink conditioning, which resembles basic 
classical conditioning except that the US is an air-puff to the eye and the CR is the eyeblink 
that is elicited by the anticipation of the air-puff. We included these studies because of the 
anticipated paucity of relevant OCD studies and because eyeblink conditioning is somewhat 
aversive (e.g., fear-relevant circuitry is involved in the acquisition of the eyeblink CR; Ng 
& Freeman, 2014). We limited the scope of this review to human research (for reviews 
of OCD-related research in non-human animals, see Abramowitz et al., 2011; Ahmari & 
Dougherty, 2015; Boulougouris et al., 2009; Szechtman et al., 2017).

All searches were performed using Google Scholar and Pubmed. We searched article titles, 
abstracts, and full text for the following keywords: (OCD OR obsessive-compulsive OR 
obsessive OR compulsive) AND (conditioning OR conditioned AND fear OR disgust OR 
aversive OR classical OR Pavlovian OR extinction OR acquisition OR differential OR 
evaluative) OR (associative learning) AND human AND NOT review. We also screened 
the references of articles from these searches, from recent reviews of exposure therapy in 
OCD that consider associative learning principles (Arch & Abramowitz, 2015; Jacoby & 
Abramowitz, 2016), and from two meta-analyses of classical conditioning in anxiety-related 
disorders (Duits et al., 2015; Lissek et al., 2005) for additional articles that met criteria for

our review. Identified domain experts were also queried for possible eligible articles. The 
final search for this review was conducted on December 02, 2020.

2.2  Screening

We screened identified articles using the following a priori inclusion criteria: 1) original data 
from an aversive conditioning paradigm was reported for a group with OCD or elevated 
traits closely associated with OCD; 2) a validated diagnostic measure of OCD,psychometric 
measure of OCD symptoms, or a measure of OCD-related traits was administered; 3) 
English language. After initial searches, tightened search criteria were re-applied to titles 
and abstracts only to ensure non-relevant incidental matches (e.g., match only found in 
reference section) were excluded. Screening was done by the first author (SC) and confirmed 
with the senior author (JD).

3.  Results

3.1  Characteristics of Identified Studies

After full-text review, screening resulted in a total of twelve studies that met eligibility 
out of 6,190 from the initial search (see Figure 2 for PRSIMA flow diagram). Of these 
studies, two used a single-cue design (Table 1; No. 11, 12; Nanbu et al., 2010; Tracy et al., 
1999), which only involve one CS (termed a CS+) that is paired with the US during the 
acquisition phase. The remaining ten studies used a differential conditioning design, which 
includes CS+ trials as well as a CS that is never paired with the US (CS−). Six of these 
studies used a differential cue design (Table 1; No. 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, ; Apergis-Schoute et al., 
2017; Armstrong & Olatunji, 2017; Geller et al., 2017, 2019; Kaczkurkin & Lissek, 2013; 
McGuire et al., 2016). The remaining four studies used a differential cue-in-context design, 
in which the CSs were superimposed over a background context picture that varied between 
different phases of the experiment (Table 1; No. 3, 6, 9, 10; Fyer et al., 2020; Giménez et al., 
2020; McLaughlin et al., 2015; Milad et al., 2013). Nine studies included at least one phase 
in which the CS+ was no longer reinforced, as most commonly done in extinction learning 
phases (Table 1; No. 1–6, 8–12; Apergis-Schoute et al., 2017; Armstrong & Olatunji, 2017; 
Fyer et al., 2020; Geller et al., 2017, 2019; Giménez et al., 2020; McGuire et al., 2016; 
McLaughlin et al., 2015; Milad et al., 2013; Nanbu et al., 2010; Tracy et al., 1999). Three 
studies tested children (as opposed to adults) (Table 1; No. 4, 5, 8; Geller et al., 2017, 2019; 
McGuire et al., 2016). Eleven studies used a tactile or auditory aversive US, and one study 
used disgust-inducing images as the US (Table 1; 2; Armstrong & Olatunji, 2017). Seven 
studies tested a group of participants with a current diagnosis of OCD (Table 1; No. 1, 3–6, 
8, 10, 11; Apergis-Schoute et al., 2017; Fyer et al., 2020; Geller et al., 2017, 2019; Giménez 
et al., 2020; McGuire et al., 2016; Milad et al., 2013; Nanbu et al., 2010), one tested those 
with a lifetime, but not necessarily current, diagnosis of OCD (Table 1; No. 9; McLaughlin 
et al., 2015)1, and the remaining three created OCD analogue groups (for review on this 

1The reported mean symptom severity for the OCD group from McLaughlin et al. (2015) is roughly comparable with reviewed studies 
testing those with current OCD diagnoses only, although it should be noted that the standard deviation is larger and likely reflects 
less-symptomatic individuals who might not meet full OCD criteria. That said, given that most participants in the OCD group are 
likely reporting significant symptoms, McLaughlin et al. (2015) appears to be more accurately described as testing a clinical, rather 
than an analogue, OCD group.

practice, see Abramowitz et al., 2014) for between-group comparisons (Table 1; 2, 7, 12; 
Armstrong & Olatunji, 2017; Kaczkurkin & Lissek, 2013; Tracey et al., 1999). Sample sizes 
ranged from N=30 to N=105. Most studies reported an N=64 or less; only three studies 
analyzed larger samples (Table 1; No. 1, 3, 4; Apergis-Schoute et al., 2017; Fyer et al., 2020; 
Geller et al., 2017). In studies comparing OCD groups to control groups, the ratio of OCD to 
control participants ranged from 0.64 to 1.87.

3.2  Detailed Narrative Review of Identified Studies

Given a limited number of studies that met criteria for inclusion in this review, we can 
provide a detailed narrative review of each study. Our detailed review is comprised of 
two subsections: acquisition of behavioral CRs (e.g., physiological arousal, self-report 
ratings) and extinction of behavioral CRs. We distinguish between extinction learning (i.e., 
extinction training or within-session extinction) and tests of extinction retention, such as 
extinction recall or contextual renewal. Common methodological variations or extensions 
of acquisition (e.g., generalization) or extinction processes (e.g., reversal) are included in 
the relevant subsection. Note that most studies are reviewed in both the acquisition and 
extinction sections, as all studies with an extinction component contained a preceding 
acquisition procedure. Additionally, three studies included in this review (Apergis-Schoute 
et al., 2017; Milad et al., 2013; Nanbu et al., 2010) reported both behavioral and 
functional neuroimaging (electroencephalography [EEG] or functional magnetic resonance 
imaging [fMRI]) results. These studies’ neuroimaging results are separately discussed in a 
subsequent section (see 3.2.3 Functional Neuroimaging Studies).

3.2.1  Acquisition of Behavioral CRs—Of the twelve identified studies, seven report 
at least one significant acquisition deficit or impairment related to OCD (see Table 1). 
One of these studies, conducted by Nanbu et al. (2010), was a single-cue study that used 
a shock US and measured SCR as one conditioning index. There were no between-group 
differences in SCR indices for the CS+ during the acquisition phase. The other single-cue 
study (Tracy et al., 1999) used eyeblink conditioning (air-puff US and eyeblink CR). There 
was a significant between-group difference at acquisition, with those higher on a composite 
of OCD-related traits more rapidly acquiring CRs to the CS+ (i.e., response potentiates 
within first few trials) compared with participants lower on these traits. However, more 
rapid acquisition might not correspond to a maladaptive or abnormal response (e.g., Cook 
et al., 1985; Rescorla, 1988). Thus, it is not clear if this finding can be considered an 
OCD-associated acquisition deficit. Tracy et al. (1999) also did not find between-group 
differences in the strength of the CRs. Considering both single-cue studies together, they 
do not appear to provide strong evidence for enhanced acquisition related to OCD. For a 
detailed description of the drawbacks of single cue designs, see Lissek et al. 2005.

Three studies (Geller et al., 2017, 2019; McGuire et al., 2016) tested children with OCD 
(ages 7–18). These studies used a differential (CS+ and CS−) conditioning design with 
neutrally expressive female faces as CSs and an auditory scream as the US. Geller et 
al. (2017) reported significantly greater SCRs to the CS+ in those with OCD compared 
with control participants. Using the same design, McGuire et al. (2016) reported a 
positive correlation between a dimensional scale of OCD symptoms and SCR to the CS+.

However, Geller et al. (2019) did not find a significant correlation between a dimensional 
OCD symptom measure and acquisition indices, which is inconsistent with McGuire and 
colleagues’ (2016) correlational findings. A possible explanation is related to McGuire et 
al. (2016) including both those with and without an OCD diagnosis in their correlational 
analyses. In contrast, the sample in Geller et al. (2019) was only comprised of children who 
met criteria for OCD during testing. Reported OCD symptom scores had relatively moderate 
variance and, therefore, possibly limited range. Thus, attenuated range of and decreased 
variance in OCD symptom scores in Geller et al. (2019) might have impacted the strength of 
the association.

In a study of adults with OCD, Aspergis-Schoute et al. (2017) used mildly angry male faces 
as CSs, a shock as the US, and SCR as one index of differential conditioning. In this study, 
early trials and late trials of the acquisition phase were analyzed separately. Those in the 
OCD group showed poorer discrimination (i.e., smaller differential SCRs between CS+ and 
CS−) compared with the control group during later, but not earlier, acquisition trials. Poor 
discrimination is sometimes taken to reflect a failure to learn safety signals relative to threat 
and is more characteristic of anxiety-related disorder pathology than single-cue reactivity 
(Duits et al., 2015; Lissek et al., 2005). Their follow-up analyses showed that this effect was 
driven by greater responding to the CS+ in the OCD group relative to controls, indicating 
that safety learning was not necessarily aberrant in the OCD group.

Two studies conducted by Milad and colleagues (McLaughlin et al., 2015; Milad et al., 
2013), as well as studies by Fyer et al. (2020) and Giménez et al. (2020), also tested adults 
with OCD using a shock US. These four studies employed cue-in-context designs, with 
lamp colors as the cue CSs and pictures of different rooms used as contexts. Three of these 
did not find differences in conditioned SCRs between OCD and control groups during the 
acquisition phase. The exception was Fyer et al. (2020), which found significantly greater 
SCR to the CS− in the OCD group compared with control participants across the whole 
acquisition phase. When breaking this down at the trial level, however, CS+ responses to 
all but the initial trial are greater in the OCD group compared with the control group. 
The mixed nature of the findings from this set of studies, with the majority failing to 
find significant between-group acquisition differences, accords with earlier studies using 
this cue-in-context task in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or other anxiety-related 
disorders that did not find any differences in acquisition-related SCRs between disorder and 
comparison groups (e.g., Milad et al., 2009; Shvil et al., 2014).

No differences during acquisition were observed in fear-potentiated startle (FPS; a measure 
of central nervous system-mediated defensive responding; Davis, 1992) or subjective ratings 
of risk of shock between individuals characterized as high or low on OCD symptoms and 
related traits (Kaczkurkin & Lissek, 2013). This study followed the acquisition phase with a 
second phase that introduced generalization stimuli (GSs; in this study represented by rings 
of intermediary sizes between the CS+ and CS−), along with continued presentation of the 
CS+ (intermittingly reinforced to prevent extinction) and CS−. Those with high levels of 
OCD-related threat overestimation demonstrated higher FPS, but not risk ratings, to the GSs 
most resembling the CS+ (i.e., fear generalized from the CS+ to the most visually similar 
stimuli) compared with those low on this OCD-related trait. The process of acquiring fear

to GSs overlaps with the process of CS+/CS− discrimination and is mediated by shared 
neurocircuitry (Hermans et al., 2013; Lissek, 2012). Accordingly, these generalization 
results can be interpreted as poorer discrimination learning in those with elevated levels 
of an OCD-related threat overestimation. They are also roughly comparable to other results 
in the current review that found poorer discrimination learning associated with OCD.

Armstrong and Olatunji (2017) employed a differential cue design using neutral male faces 
as CSs and disgust-related images as US2. Although disgust is a core emotion involved in 
OCD pathology (e.g., Cisler et al., 2009; Olatunji, Lohr, et al., 2007), there are only two 
studies examining disgust conditioning within the broad context of OCD-related constructs 
(Armstrong & Olatunji, 2017; Olatunji et al., 2017), with only one meeting our inclusion 
criteria. In Armstrong and Olatunji (2017), groups were constructed based on a dimensional 
measure of contamination concerns (a preoccupation with becoming infected or dirtied by 
outside contaminants that has been strongly linked to OCD pathology; Brady et al., 2010), 
with a higher scoring group framed as an analogue-OCD group. The CRs were ratings of 
subjective level of disgust for the CS as well as expectancy for receiving the US. Ratings 
were collected after each phase rather than simultaneously with conditioning. Participants 
with higher contamination concern rated the CS+ as significantly more disgust-provoking 
than those in the low group. Although this result superficially aligns with other findings of 
enhanced CRs to the CS+ in OCD, caution should be taken in considering this an equivalent 
finding due to the nature of the CR measurement in this study (a retrospective, single-trial 
report of perceived disgust). There were no group differences in US expectancy, which was 
interpreted as indicating that cognitively-mediated processes (compared with the purportedly 
affective process that the disgust rating represents) are not aberrant in those with higher 
contamination concerns. As only one of the other reviewed studies included a comparable 
dependent variable (online risk ratings in Kaczkurkin & Lissek, 2013), it is difficult to 
ascertain if this reflects a difference between disgust and fear conditioning.

Altogether, there is mixed evidence in the literature that OCD is associated with abnormal 
acquisition of conditioned fear. In the acquisition phase in single-cue and differential 
conditioning designs, the relationship between the CS+ and US is mostly unambiguous 
and a CR represents a normative response to a threat cue. Therefore, it is possible that 
mixed findings emerge due to a greater chance of uniform responding across all participants 
irrespective of diagnostic status or symptoms (i.e., a strong situation, Lissek et al., 2006). In 
the extinction procedure, the contingency becomes more ambiguous due to the omission of 
the US, and therefore extinction performance is perhaps better suited to detect meaningful 
differences between OCD and control groups.

3.2.2  Extinction of Behavioral CRs—Eleven of twelve studies included an extinction 
learning phase immediately after acquisition on the same day (see Table 1). On the day after 
initial testing, four studies included an extinction recall test, and two of these also included 

2The use of disgust-conditioning differentiates Armstrong and Olatunji (2017) from the other reviewed studies, which primarily test 
fear-conditioning. Conditioning differences between the two emotions have been directly compared and were found to share many of 
the same neural circuitry (Klucken et al., 2012), and affective responses to fear vs. disgust stimuli were mostly similar in an OCD 
sample (Schienle et al., 2005). Thus, we contend that disgust- and fear-conditioning sufficiently overlap for the purposes of the current 
review.

an extinction renewal test. We first review single-day studies that only tested extinction 
learning and then review the subset of two-day studies that tested extinction learning and 
then extinction recall (and renewal, for some) the next day.

3.2.2.1  Single-Day Studies of Extinction Learning: Neither single-cue conditioning 
study found behavioral differences during extinction learning between OCD and control 
groups (Nanbu et al., 2010; Tracy et al., 1999). Prior research that directly compared single­
cue to differential extinction learning observed relatively quick and robust behavioral CR 
decreases in the single-cue condition (Norrholm et al., 2008) compared with the differential 
condition. The single-cue design might therefore not provide enough variance in extinction 
learning CRs to detect OCD-control group effects.

In studies of children with OCD, two studies identified extinction learning abnormalities 
related to OCD pathology. In McGuire et al. (2016), the OCD group maintained higher 
SCRs to the CS+ (similar in magnitude to the level of SCRs to the CS+ during 
the acquisition phase) throughout the extinction learning phase compared with control 
participants, which suggested a failure to extinguish. Additionally, both groups showed 
relatively poor discrimination between CS+ and CS−, but control participants showed 
slightly less discrimination than those with OCD and also demonstrated lower CRs to both 
stimuli. Unlike acquisition, stronger discrimination is indicative of impaired learning during 
extinction learning, as the CR is expected to diminish over the course of the extinction 
learning phase. The authors suggested that maintaining a CR to both the CS+ and CS− is 
related to participants’ belief that the US contingency will switch from one CS to the other, 
which has been observed in past conditioning studies in children (e.g., Jovanovic et al., 
2014). Geller et al. (2017), which used the same task, also concluded that extinction learning 
is impaired in OCD. One subtle distinction between Geller et al. (2017) and McGuire (2016) 
is that the former found a Group × Stimulus effect for the entire extinction phase, whereas 
the latter only found a group difference in later trials. Finally, Geller et al. (2019) did not 
find any evidence of impaired extinction learning in children with OCD.

Apergis-Schoute et al. (2017) used a reversal learning design following the acquisition 
phase, and therefore this study is comparable to other studies using standard extinction 
learning designs. In reversal learning, the acquisition CS+ is no longer paired with the 
US (i.e., it is extinguished), while at the same time, the previously unpaired CS− is 
now paired with the US. As measured by SCR, participants with OCD were impaired at 
learning the new associations for the CS+ and CS− relative to control participants, with 
the OCD group showing decreased discrimination between the CS+ and CS− across the 
entire reversal phase. These reversal learning results align with the other reviewed results 
that implicate impaired extinction learning is associated with OCD. Additionally, reversal 
learning involves both extinction learning and acquiring fear to a previously safe stimulus 
and is conceptualized as a probe of flexible learning (Schiller et al., 2008). Accordingly, a 
deficit in reversal learning in OCD potentially indicates that the ability to adjust responding 
to new fear and safety information in a flexible manner is impaired in the disorder, as shown 
in PTSD (Homan et al., 2019).

The single available study of disgust conditioning (Armstrong & Olatunji, 2017) reported 
impaired extinction learning in a sample with elevated OCD-related traits. Specifically, a 
group with elevated contamination concerns demonstrated impaired extinction relative to 
a group with lower contamination concerns on measures of disgust and US expectancy. 
US-expectancy ratings were overall elevated for the higher group, whereas disgust ratings 
were specifically elevated for the CS+ relative to the CS−. Further, the change in US­
expectancy for the CS+ from acquisition to extinction was significantly smaller for the 
higher group; this effect was not observed for disgust ratings. Notably, these ratings were 
collected retroactively after the extinction phase. These results align with extinction results 
from the reviewed studies using non-disgust USs, albeit with dependent measures collected 
retrospectively following extinction. An additional consideration for interpretation of disgust 
learning data is the possibility that non-classical conditioning processes contributed to 
extinction results. Evaluative conditioning (learning to like or dislike a stimulus; De 
Houwer et al., 2001) is implicated in disgust learning (e.g., Olatunji et al., 2009) and is 
more resistant to extinction procedures than classically conditioned fear (e.g., Blechert et 
al., 2008; Olatunji et al., 2007; Vansteenwegen et al., 2006). If interpreting through the 
lens of evaluative conditioning, difficulty extinguishing in the higher contamination group 
might reflect an initially acquired dislike of the CS+, as opposed to any specific difficulty 
extinguishing that is explicitly linked with individual differences in contamination concerns. 
Although we cannot confirm this explanation or not, given that Armstrong and Olatunji 
(2017) did not collect evaluative ratings, it remains a viable alternative explanation and 
caution is recommended when synthesizing these results with the fear conditioning studies 
of OCD.

3.2.2.2  Two-Day Studies of Extinction Learning and Recall: All the reviewed two-day 
studies (Fyer et al., 2020; Giménez et al., 2020; McLaughlin et al., 2015; Milad et al., 2013) 
applied a cue-in-context paradigm to adults with OCD. These studies included a second 
day of testing to test for recall of the extinction memory. Compared with immediate testing 
of extinction learning, extinction recall tests provide insight into the retention of extinction 
learning, which is often impaired in anxiety-related disorders (Milad & Quirk, 2012). In 
these cue-in-context designs, the context for both extinction learning and extinction recall 
incorporated the same background picture (referred to as an ABB design).

None of these four studies found evidence for extinction learning deficits in OCD, and 
all reported significant extinction results were found during day-two testing. In Milad et 
al. (2013), impaired extinction recall was operationalized with two metrics: differential 
SCRs between the CS+ and CS− across the first two recall trials, and an “extinction 
retention index” that quantified extinction recall as the magnitude of SCR during recall 
relative to initial extinction. Higher values on this index indicated increased maintenance 
of extinction learning. In this study, differential SCR analyses yielded limited evidence for 
impaired extinction recall in the OCD group, which showed overall greater SCR during 
this phase, but without a significant difference in CS+ vs. CS− magnitudes. In a group 
comparison, the extinction retention index showed that the OCD group failed to maintain 
initial extinction levels relative to the control group. Conversely and surprisingly, improved 
extinction retention was positively correlated with the degree of OCD symptom severity,

which was at odds with the hypothesis that extinction learning would not persist in those 
with OCD. The study by McLaughlin et al. (2015), which also assessed extinction recall, 
replicated the primary group difference findings from Milad et al. (2013). However, in this 
study, extinction retention index scores were not significantly correlated with OCD symptom 
scores, which is different from Milad and colleagues’ (2013) findings. Extinction recall 
differences in Fyer et al. (2020) were limited to significant differential SCR responding, 
with elevated CS+ responses, for a subset of trials within the OCD group. This pattern 
was not seen in the control group, but the direct statistical comparison between the two 
groups was not significant. Similarly, the extinction retention index was not significantly 
different between groups. The remaining study, Giménez et al. (2020), did not find any 
significant between-group differences during the extinction recall phase. The mixed nature 
of extinction recall and retention results here is reminiscent of a broader pattern in the 
literature, particularly as these processes relate to individual differences (Lonsdorf et al., 
2017; Lonsdorf & Merz, 2017). Also notable is that operationalization of recall and retention 
varies across studies, most notably in regards to the number of trials that are analyzed. 
Inconsistent operationalization of recall and retention are identified as contributing to 
ambiguity and failure to replicate across studies (Lonsdorf et al., 2019).

McLaughlin et al. (2015) and Fyer et al. (2020) included an additional phase after extinction 
recall that tested contextual fear renewal (i.e., return of CR related to an incidental change 
in context without reintroducing the US; Bouton, 2004). During renewal, the background 
context was the same as the one used during the acquisition phase (referred to as an ABA 
renewal design). Fyer et al. (2020) found the OCD group demonstrated significantly greater 
CS+/CS− differential SCRs compared with the control group, with CS+ SCRs in the OCD 
group consistently elevated across the entire renewal phase. Conversely, there were no group 
differences in renewal in McLaughlin et al. (2015), as both groups demonstrated similarly 
elevated SCRs to both CS+ and CS− during early trials that gradually decreased. A possible 
explanation for the inconsistent group differences in renewal is that context at test was 
the same background used when the CS was paired with shock, which might generate a 
heightened expectation of threat in both groups that weakens the potential between-group 
difference. For this reason, additional research on fear renewal in OCD is warranted that 
perhaps compares contextual renewal in a novel environment (referred to as an ABC renewal 
design) rather than in the acquisition or extinction context (for reviews, see Bouton, 2002; 
Vervliet et al., 2013). It is also important to note that the OCD group in McLaughlin et 
al. (2015) was less symptomatic than in Fyer et al. (2020) and that participants all had 
a lifetime, but not necessarily current, OCD diagnosis. Accordingly, it is possible that 
significant renewal differences are contingent on higher severity of current OCD symptoms.

3.2.3  Functional Neuroimaging Studies—To date, only three studies have used 
functional neuroimaging to examine associative fear learning processes in OCD. 
Neuroimaging of OCD, at a broader level, has tended to focus on a set of orbitofrontal­
striatal interactions (or “fronto-striatal loops”) that operate in parallel function and appear 
dysregulated in OCD (Breiter & Rauch, 1996; Graybiel & Rauch, 2000; Menzies et al., 
2008; Saxena & Rauch, 2000). These circuits contribute to a broad suite of behavioral 
control functions and consist of projections from orbitofrontal regions associated with a

range of higher-order operations, such as affect regulation (e.g., ventromedial prefrontal 
cortex [vmPFC]) and executive functioning (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex [dlPFC]), to 
striatal reward and action regions (e.g., nucleus accumbens, caudate, putamen), which then 
project back to the frontal regions via the thalamus (Alexander et al., 1986). These regions 
have also been meta-analytically implicated as underlying emotional processing aberrations 
in other anxiety-related disorders (Etkin & Wager, 2007). Milad and Rauch (2012) linked 
the fronto-striatal model of OCD to a fear-conditioning neural model that centers on the 
amygdala, hippocampus, and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) (Fullana et al., 2018; 
Milad et al., 2007). This aligns with meta-analytic findings that regions implicated in fear 
extinction, namely the amygdala and ACC (data was insufficient to implicate the dACC 
subdivision), are impaired in OCD (Thorsen et al., 2018).

Milad et al. (2013) found that during acquisition, participants with OCD demonstrated 
decreased fMRI activity (relative to control participants) to the CS+ (relative to the CS−) in 
the hippocampus, caudate, and vmPFC. All these regions are involved in fear conditioning, 
with the vmPFC receiving particular attention due to its relation to safety learning (Milad 
& Quirk, 2012). During extinction, vmPFC activity to the CS+ (relative to CS) remained 
lower for the OCD group relative to control participants. The extinction recall stage yielded 
the strongest collection of findings in favor of deficits related to OCD: the vmPFC was 
hypoactive in OCD relative to control participants, as were the cerebellum (implicated 
in behavioral response related to conditioning processes, e.g., Thompson & Steinmetz, 
2009), the putamen region within the striatum, and the posterior cingulate cortex (a region 
implicated in mediating internally-focused cognition and found to be related to impaired 
inhibition in OCD, e.g., Del Casale et al., 2011; Leech & Sharp, 2014).

Apergis-Schoute et al. (2017) also employed fMRI and found vmPFC hyperactivity in the 
OCD group in response to the CS+ (relative to CS−) in the first, but not the second, half of 
the acquisition phase. This finding is striking because one of the most consistent findings 
from univariate contrasts of differential fear conditioning in fMRI is greater activity to the 
unpaired (i.e., safe) CS− versus the CS+ (i.e., CS− > CS+) in healthy adults (Fullana et 
al., 2016). That the OCD group exhibited the opposite result (i.e., CS+ > CS−) indicates 
an absence of safety signaling in the vmPFC, at least during early learning as participants 
attempted to learn which CS predicted danger and which CS predicted the absence of 
danger. Task-related functional connectivity analysis during early acquisition, using the 
vmPFC as the seed region, revealed multiple areas within the functionally-defined salience 
network (Uddin, 2014) were more strongly co-activated in the OCD group on CS+ trials. 
These areas included dACC, bilateral insula, and right thalamus. Stronger task-related 
connectivity between vmPFC and these salience network nodes in participants with OCD 
was interpreted as biased processing towards threat at the expense of safety processing. 
During late reversal, the left caudate and left insula tracked the new CS+ (differential CS+ 
> CS−) better in the control group than in the OCD group. These results highlight that OCD 
is characterized by impaired fear and safety updating in brain regions putatively involved in 
tracking the threat and safety value of conditioned stimuli.

Nanbu et al. (2010) used EEG in conjunction with auditory probes to measure P50 event­
related potential as a CR. The P50 response is indexed during CS+ presentations by

calculating the response ratio between an initial and subsequent auditory probe. The P50 
is interpreted as a deficit in sensory-gating processes and proposed to index enhanced cue 
conditioning. There were no between-group differences in the P50 ratio during acquisition. 
However, during extinction, participants with OCD had significantly higher P50 ratios on 
CS+ trials compared with control participants. This difference was interpreted as increased 
difficulty inhibiting sensory processing during extinction for those with OCD, which the 
authors link to poor inhibition of intrusive thoughts and obsessions.

4.  Discussion

Based on this review of the literature of fear conditioning and extinction in OCD, results 
implicate mixed evidence for impaired fear acquisition but compelling evidence for impaired 
extinction in OCD. Acquisition and extinction deficits were apparent across different types 
of self-report, behavioral, and neurobiological indicators. Amassed results also suggest that 
these deficits are detectable in both children and adults with OCD, in sub-clinical OCD 
and analog groups, and are associated with symptom-level features of the disorder. Limited 
evidence also supports the assertion that conditioning deficits are not limited to fear-related 
processing (as a single study tested disgust conditioning). However, this is a tentative 
conclusion, and more research is warranted, as we discuss below.

4.1  Tentative Evidence for Increased Acquisition of CS+ Response in OCD

Overall, evidence for acquisition deficits in OCD is mixed. Six out of twelve studies 
reported behavioral evidence and two studies reporting neuroimaging evidence in support 
of an OCD-associated deficit. Additionally, the specific form of acquisition deficit was not 
consistent across studies. This heterogeneity of results suggests that impaired acquisition is 
only weakly associated with OCD, at least in the context of relatively simple conditioning 
tasks. A defensive CR is also a normative response to impending threat during acquisition, 
and thus only an abnormally elevated response would likely differentiate an anxiety-related 
disorder sample from the rest of the population.

The most consistent OCD-associated pattern to emerge from these results was increased 
CR magnitude to the CS+ without a corresponding increase in CS− response. This 
specific pattern has been related to the concept of enhanced conditionability (most often 
discussed in conjunction with PTSD, see Lissek & van Meurs, 2014; Orr et al., 2000). 
Enhanced conditionability, which broadly refers to a between-subjects difference in speed 
and magnitude of CS+ acquisition, is not an ideal description for the reviewed results 
because only one set of results provide evidence of more rapid CS+ acquisition in OCD 
(Tracy et al., 1999). Speed of acquisition was either not tested in the other studies or did 
not differ by group. That said, abnormally elevated CS+ responding (irrespective of speed 
of acquisition) could be consistent with the clinical phenomenology of obsessions in OCD. 
There is strong evidence that pervasive and repetitive thoughts are common for everyone, 
not just those who have or go on to develop OCD (García-Soriano et al., 2011; Fullana et 
al., 2009), which suggests that the mere presence of these types of thoughts are not sufficient 
for the development of the severe obsessions that are characteristic of OCD. Therefore, an 
increased tendency to form stronger aversive associations might promote the conversion

from normal to maladaptive intrusion/obsession and thus act as both predisposing risk factor 
and key pathogenic mechanism of OCD. Put another way, two people might have the same 
intrusive thought over a period of days, but the one who responds with greater distress is 
more likely to have the intrusion develop into a full obsession and thus develop OCD.

Also consistent with a pattern of increased CS+ responding in OCD are results from a 
quasi-experimental self-report study that found a general cognitive tendency (indexed by 
measures of different dysfunctional beliefs) towards overestimating threat in the disorder 
(for review, see Hezel & McNally, 2016). That said, none of the currently reviewed studies 
found evidence for increased CS+ responding on more cognitively mediated measures, such 
as US expectancy or risk ratings, although these measures weren’t assessed in each study. 
In general, based on the empirical research, it is premature to integrate evidence of broad 
belief patterns with the physiological and neuroimaging evidence reviewed here. Further, 
a pattern of increased CS+ responding in differential conditioning paradigms also diverges 
from some non-conditioning experimental work in OCD. This body of work consistently 
finds that inhibitory or regulatory, but not excitatory, processes differentiate those with OCD 
from those without (for reviews, see Cavedini et al., 2006; Milad & Rauch, 2012) and would 
suggest that CS− responding would also differentiate OCD from control groups. The only 
reviewed study that aligned with this pattern was Fyer et al. (2020).

In terms of neuroimaging results, the only notable acquisition finding was poorer 
discrimination between CS+ and CS− in those with OCD within the hippocampus, caudate, 
and vmPFC in the study by Milad et al. (2013). Although these results do not necessarily 
contradict the findings of increased CS+ responding as seen in the behavioral data, they also 
do not explicitly support those findings. That is, poorer discrimination between the CS+ and 
CS− in OCD does not imply increased activity to the CS+ in these regions relative to control 
groups. Additionally, the vmPFC is more often associated with safety/inhibitory learning, 
rather than threat acquisition, in the context of fear conditioning protocols (Fullana et al., 
2016).

4.2  Stronger Evidence for Extinction Deficits in OCD

OCD was associated with some form of extinction deficit, either during extinction learning, 
recall, or contextual renewal, in nine of the eleven studies we reviewed that tested extinction 
processes. The most prominent findings were that those with OCD showed elevated CRs 
during extinction and poor discrimination during extinction recall. Of note is that the two of 
the three studies that did not report significant group differences or symptom associations 
during extinction learning (Geller et al., 2019; Tracy et al., 1999) also employed relatively 
atypical designs compared with the other reviewed articles. Geller et al. (2019) tested 
dimensional relations within a group of children with OCD and did not include a group of 
children without OCD symptoms. Tracy et al. (1990) used eyeblink conditioning, which is 
different in many ways from standard delay fear conditioning designs. The third study which 
did not find any form of extinction deficit, Giménez et al., 2020, was published as a pilot 
study and had the smallest N of all the reviewed studies (17 OCD, 13 control). Thus, the 
amassed evidence for extinction deficits in OCD is relatively consistent when considering

the limited number of available studies and the limitations of the studies that did not produce 
significant extinction differences.

Although significant extinction abnormalities related to OCD were found in most of the 
reviewed studies, the particular form of the extinction deficit and if the deficit was during 
initial extinction learning or during extinction recall was not entirely consistent. Specifically, 
there is a discrepancy between the studies using cue-only conditioning and those using 
a cue-in-context conditioning design. In terms of the cue-only studies, most analyzed 
extinction as a function of time (e.g., trial-by-trial or first half vs. second half) and found that 
those with OCD demonstrated larger CRs to the CS+, compared with control participants, 
during the later trials of extinction. The normative response reflective of full extinction is for 
CRs to reach floor for both the CS+ and CS− by the later trials of extinction (e.g., Bouton 
et al., 2006; Fullana et al., 2018). That several studies showed maintained CRs within the 
extinction learning session suggests the ability to adaptively regulate behavior is impaired 
in OCD despite repeated presentations of the CS+ in the absence of the US. However, 
the four reviewed studies using a cue-in-context design (Fyer et al., 2020; Giménez et al., 
2020; McLaughlin et al., 2015; Milad et al., 2013) did not find within-session differences 
in extinction learning performance between OCD and control groups. Rather, the majority 
of these studies report group differences in SCRs between-sessions (i.e., during day-two 
testing). These results support the argument that a strong return of fear after initial extinction 
(commonly referred to as spontaneous recovery; Pavlov, 1927) is more characteristic of 
anxiety pathology than initial difficulty extinguishing fear (Bouton et al., 2001; Craske et 
al., 2011), and align with clinical observation (e.g., Furst & Cooper, 1970; Marks et al., 
1969; Pitman, 1993; Rachman et al., 1970) and empirical theory and data (Craske et al., 
2008; Kozak et al., 1988) indicating that successful within-session fear reduction does not 
necessarily correspond to sustained improvement in those with anxiety-related disorders. 
However, caution is recommended in interpreting extinction recall results given documented 
methodological inconsistencies across studies, both in this review and in the literature more 
broadly (Lonsdorf et al., 2019).

A possible explanation for the discrepancy between the cue-only and cue-in-context studies 
is that the CS-US association is partially dependent on the context in which it is learned, 
such that stronger CRs to the CS+ emerge in the original conditioning context. The context 
switch in the cue-in-context design, in which acquisition is conducted in one novel context 
and extinction in another, potentially weakened the CS-US association (as is seen in 
occasion setting studies, e.g., Bouton & Swartzentruber, 1986; Myers & Gluck, 1994) to the 
point that those with OCD could sufficiently extinguish their CR and resemble the control 
group during this phase.

Neuroimaging results from the two studies using fMRI (Apergis-Schoute et al., 2017; Milad 
et al., 2013) also potentially provide evidence of an extinction learning deficit in OCD. 
Both studies found differences in vmPFC activity during extinction between OCD and 
control groups, although the multiple differences in study and analytic design preclude direct 
comparisons. Human work based on animal models has proposed the vmPFC as a central 
region for extinction learning (e.g., Diekhof et al., 2011; Dunsmoor et al., 2019; Phelps et 
al., 2004). However, the relation between vmPFC and extinction learning is not robust, and

a recent meta-analysis did not find the vmPFC to be related to extinction learning across 
31 studies. Additionally, the vmPFC has also been implicated as a key point of dysfunction 
in non-aversive learning processes (Nielen et al., 2009) and as a central contributor to 
impaired decision making and error-detection in OCD (Nielen et al., 2002; Stern et al., 
2011), suggesting that disrupted vmPFC engagement during extinction might reflect a global 
deficit in the disorder, as opposed to a fear extinction-specific abnormality. Further work is 
needed to more conclusively determine how vmPFC differences in OCD related to impaired 
extinction processes.

An important qualifier on the reviewed extinction results is that all the studies that tested 
extinction learning did so immediately after the acquisition phase, as opposed to testing 
after a delay. This design is not unique to OCD research. Most human extinction studies, 
both in clinical and non-clinical samples, use this design (see Duits et al., 2015; Fullana et 
al., 2018). However, the neural mechanisms underlying immediate extinction learning differ 
from those underlying delayed extinction learning (Maren, 2014). The clinical implications 
are different as well, as delayed extinction learning is a more accurate analogue of clinical 
intervention, which targets an established fear memory given that it typically takes place 
days, months, or years after initial fear acquisition (e.g., Hollandt et al., 2020).

4.3  Comparing Conditioning Process in OCD to Other Anxiety-Related Disorders

Over decades of conditioning studies of anxiety-related disorders, multiple studies 
have identified patterns of aversive conditioning deficits that appear to operate trans­
diagnostically and represent core pathogenic mechanisms of these disorders. The current 
review affords the opportunity to compare how conditioning in OCD compares to 
other anxiety-related disorders. Two comprehensive meta-analyses of behavioral studies 
in anxiety-related disorders identified increased CS− responding during acquisition and 
increased CS+ responding during extinction as differentiating anxiety-related disorder 
groups from control groups (Duits et al., 2015; Lissek et al., 2005). In terms of acquisition, 
a pattern of elevated CRs to CS+, but no significant differences in CRs to CS− in all but 
one study (Fyer et al., 2020), distinguishes OCD from the other anxiety-related disorders. 
It is difficult to explain this discrepancy when considering how OCD differs from other 
anxiety-related disorders: OCD is perhaps the anxiety-related disorder most easily defined 
by difficulties with inhibition of unwanted thoughts and behaviors. Therefore, it seems 
likely CS− deficits would be evident. However, a crucial detail is that data showing poor 
inhibition in OCD is typically in terms of poor inhibition of compulsions (e.g., Chamberlain 
et al., 2005; Morein-Zamir et al., 2010). Classical aversive conditioning is assumed to map 
onto obsession symptoms in OCD more cleanly than compulsions. Therefore, the observed 
pattern of CS+ responding might not necessarily disagree with prior non-conditioning work. 
However, this does not explain why OCD would not show CS− acquisition deficits that are 
apparent in other anxiety-related disorders, and additional work to clarify this discrepancy is 
needed.

In contrast to acquisition deficits, the CS+ related extinction deficits that differentiated OCD 
from control groups are consistent with the meta-analyses that also find this pattern in other 
anxiety-related disorders during initial extinction training, indicating difficulty learning that

the CS+ is no longer a signal for the US. Further, the finding in a subset of studies that 
people with OCD had particular difficulty reducing their CR to the CS+ during the final 
parts of extinction aligns with several studies of PTSD that obtained a similar pattern of 
results (for reviews, see Lissek & van Meurs, 2014; Zuj et al., 2016). In terms of extinction 
recall, the finding that OCD is associated with elevated return of fear compared with control 
participants resembles findings from some behavioral results, particularly those from studies 
of PTSD (e.g., Garfinkel et al., 2014; Milad et al., 2008; Rabinak et al., 2017). However, 
it should be noted that some studies fail to find recall group differences on behavioral 
measures in PTSD (Milad et al., 2009) or in a trans-diagnostic anxiety-related disorders 
sample (Marin et al., 2017). Additionally, the noted discrepancy between extinction results 
from the cue-only and cue-in-context studies align with other studies failing to find initial 
extinction deficits in PTSD (Garfinkel et al., 2014; Marin et al., 2017; Milad et al., 2008, 
2009; Shvil et al., 2014). Prior reviews have suggested that these discrepancies in the PTSD 
data emerge from cross-study methodological difference and overall weak or inconsistent 
underlying effects (Lissek & van Meurs, 2014; McGuire, Orr, Essoe, et al., 2016; Zuj et al., 
2016), an explanation that could also be applied to the discrepancy observed in the currently 
reviewed OCD studies.

In terms of functional neuroimaging work involving aversive conditioning and extinction in 
clinical populations, much of this work has focused on PTSD, likely because conditioning 
remains dominant in contemporary models of PTSD (e.g., Bowers & Ressler, 2015; Pitman 
et al., 2012). A recent meta-analysis of seven studies found that PTSD was associated with 
a robust amygdala response across acquisition and extinction, with aberrant insula and ACC 
activity related to PTSD during acquisition and vmPFC during extinction (Suarez-Jimenez 
et al., 2019). Similar results have been found in studies of panic disorder (e.g., Kircher 
et al., 2013; Schwarzmeier et al., 2019) and generalized anxiety disorder (e.g., Greenberg 
et al., 2013), although not all anxiety-related disorders are associated with this pattern of 
neural results, including specific phobia (e.g., Lange et al., 2019) and social anxiety disorder 
(e.g., Savage et al., 2020). Relatively consistent vmPFC and ACC results from the two 
neuroimaging studies of conditioning in OCD suggest that, at the neural level, OCD might 
have more in common with PTSD and the other anxiety-related disorders characterized by 
vmPFC and ACC dysfunction.

4.4  Design Complexity and Improving Parallels Between Conditioning Techniques and 
Clinical Reality of OCD

At present, the OCD and conditioning literature is primarily comprised of studies using 
basic differential acquisition and extinction paradigms that utilize relatively unambiguous 
and straightforward perceptual cues and contexts. These designs have the advantage of 
offering more parsimonious interpretation but likely limit the ability to discern more 
complex and clinically relevant processes as they relate to OCD. Researchers have 
consistently advocated for the use of more complex conditioning designs to disentangle 
nuanced or difficult-to-measure emotional learning phenomena (e.g., Beckers et al., 2013; 
Dunsmoor et al., 2015; Gewirtz & Davis, 2000; Rescorla, 1988), enhanced detection of 
pathogenic markers (Lissek et al., 2006), and provide further avenues for novel treatment 
advances (e.g., Craske et al., 2014). In this case, increased complexity refers to experimental

manipulations that potentially increase ecological validity through increasing the number 
and/or abstractness of stimuli, associations between stimuli, or task demands and rules. 
In the following sections, we consider iterations or elaborations on the basic differential 
design that were absent from the reviewed literature and how improving design complexity 
could substantially contribute to conditioning models of OCD, potentially clarify emerging 
patterns of results, and enhance clinical translation.

4.4.1  Conditioning Through Conceptual and Semantic Routes—Many 
obsessions are verbal-linguistic in nature (Knapton, 2016), and the complex and frequently 
abstract or bizarre contents of obsessional thought in OCD are important aspects of 
the pathology that can differentiate them from non-clinical cognitive intrusions and 
uncomfortable thoughts (García-Soriano et al., 2011; Rassin et al., 2007). Further, these 
OCD-related obsessions are distinct from the typically simpler associations that frequently 
occur in other anxiety-related disorders due to their elaborative and abstracted quality 
and the level of inductive reasoning involved in their generation. For example, consider 
a contamination obsession in someone with OCD. The obsession might have started with 
an initial observation in a bathroom that there were many sensory cues indicating the 
bathroom is dirty and has germs, such as unwashed floors and aversive smells. However, 
there is also the known function of a bathroom and the commonly expressed societal view 
of bathrooms as “dirty places” that contribute to this obsession, which is an abstract concept 
without a direct sensory correlate. Further, the person has been told that “germs can cause 
disease” and, even though it is statistically unlikely to contract a disease in a bathroom, 
catching a disease is the assumed outcome of entering a bathroom and thus a focus of 
the obsession. The only way for this type of cognition to develop is through abstraction 
and inductive reasoning, and these processes are indeed identified as related to OCD and 
linked to a model of obsession development (Liew et al., 2018; O’Connor, 2002; Pélissier 
& O’Connor, 2002, 2002). Accordingly, understanding this aspect of obsessions is crucial to 
furthering OCD research and increasing the ecological validity of said research. However, 
the reviewed studies all use conditioning paradigms that employ perceptual stimuli and 
test for CRs that are therefore related to more automatic, sensory-level associations and 
responses. The predominance of perceptual stimuli is not unexpected, as more abstract or 
conceptual forms of conditioning have received less empirical attention overall (for review, 
see Dunsmoor & Murphy, 2015), largely owing to the predominance of animal-to-human 
translations driving conditioning efforts in humans. This represents a notable gap in the 
literature and an important area for future conditioning work in OCD.

One intuitive explanation for how obsessions spread and become unbearable for people with 
OCD is through semantic generalization. Exposure hierarchies for OCD typically resemble a 
personalized list of generalized stimuli (Himle & Franklin, 2009). Given the abstract nature 
of many obsessions, it follows that many of the associations between these generalized 
stimuli are conceptual in nature. For example, a person with OCD might report that their 
primary obsession is about catching germs from dirty surfaces in bathrooms and kitchens. 
They then might generalize this obsession to people who work in what are considered dirty 
places (e.g., janitorial staff), places that have lots of people touching multiple surfaces with 
different body parts (e.g., gyms), and clothing or tools that are used to negate or clean

environmental hazards (e.g., face masks, mops) Although there is no perceptual overlap to 
account for the association between these stimuli, the conceptual association is clear: they 
are all indirectly related to dirt and germs, some of them quite distally.

Generalization across conceptual pathways is as yet untested in OCD, although it has been 
successfully implemented in non-clinical samples (e.g., Dunsmoor et al., 2012; Dunsmoor 
& Murphy, 2014; Vervoort et al., 2014). Further, a recent study by Morey et al. (2020) 
identified PTSD-specific neural responses to novel stimuli that were part of a conditioned 
conceptual category (e.g., a participant has not seen a cat yet in a task, but responds 
fearfully because they were conditioned to fear the mammal category, of which the cat 
is a member) within fronto-limbic regions commonly associated with perceptual fear 
generalization. This type of design applied to people with OCD holds promise for more 
precisely modeling how obsessional content and associations spread on the neural level. 
Further, the success of the task used by Morey et al. (2020), which uses disorder-aspecific 
stimuli (e.g., animals and tools) applied to PTSD, suggests that similar results might emerge 
for those with OCD even without disorder-specific conceptual categories. The use of neutral, 
disorder-aspecific stimuli in this type of task might help identify if overgeneralization of 
conceptual associations is a basic mechanism underlying OCD broadly or if it is more 
circumscribed to the specific type of obsession. Based on the currently reviewed studies, 
particularly those with neuroimaging findings, we would predict that those with OCD would 
also overgeneralize fronto-limbic responses across a conceptual category.

Instrumental Conditioning and Approach-Avoidance Conflicts—A 

4.4.2 
fundamental understanding regarding OCD pathology is that compulsions serve to relieve 
distress related to obsessions, but only temporarily. In turn, this temporary relief reinforces 
the belief that obsessions are unbearable and that compulsions must be enacted (Meyer, 
1966). The obsession-compulsion dynamic fundamentally “holds the disorder together,” 
and this link is the primary target of EX/RP: if you can disrupt the compulsions, then 
patients will learn that associated obsessions are tolerable and be less likely to enact 
compulsions (Foa et al., 2012; Wheaton et al., 2018). Functionally, compulsions serve as 
a form of avoidance (McGuire et al., 2012), which fits with research that finds avoidance 
of emotionally salient material is a primary maintenance factor that prolongs many forms 
of psychopathology (e.g., Borkovec et al., 2004; Hayes et al., 1996; Pittig et al., 2018; 
Salters-Pedneault et al., 2004). Putting obsessions and compulsions together, we see that 
they cleanly fit into Mowrer’s influential two-factor theory of anxiety (Mowrer, 1939, 
1947, 1951), in which avoidance of a threat cue results in relief that serves as a motivator 
for future avoidance and prevents opportunities to learn that a feared stimulus is not 
dangerous. Importantly, this theory links the underlying classical and instrumental (i.e., 
operant) conditioning processes in a functional framework that explains how the passive­
emotional process of classical conditioning exerts its pathogenic influence through the 
behavior it motivates. Although Mowrer’s model has received criticism and its limitations 
have been expanded on through empirical testing (Rachman, 1976), the proposed functional 
relationship between the two conditioning processes remains a compelling foundation 
for explanatory models of anxiety-related pathology. Further emphasizing the need for 
instrumental conditioning studies in OCD are neural models of avoidance that implicate

frontal and temporal structures central to OCD pathology (e.g., Bravo-Rivera et al., 2015; 
Rosas-Vidal et al., 2018).

Notably, none of the reviewed conditioning studies included an instrumental conditioning 
test (or tested compulsions with any other experimental model of avoidance) despite the 
applicability of Mowrer’s two-factor model and its presence in treatment-focused writings 
related to OCD (e.g., Franklin & Foa, 2011; Storch et al., 2007). Outside of the aversive 
conditioning literature, there are a handful of relevant studies of those with OCD or 
OCD symptoms. These include tests of habitual avoidance (Gillan, Apergis-Schoute, et 
al., 2014; Gillan, Morein-Zamir, et al., 2014), probabilistic reinforcement learning (Endrass 
et al., 2011; Nielen et al., 2009; Remijnse et al., 2006; Voon et al., 2015), simple operant 
conditioning in a non-emotional context (Hassoulas et al., 2014), and self-report studies of 
subjective, broadly defined avoidance tendencies (e.g., Abramowitz et al., 2009; Ettelt et 
al., 2008; Summerfeldt et al., 2014). Generally, the patterns of results from these studies 
indicate that people with OCD or higher levels of OCD-related traits describe themselves 
as more risk-averse and avoidant, more readily associate avoidance with negative outcomes 
and increased threat sensitivity, and are more likely to enact avoidance responses than 
comparison participants in a laboratory setting. However, none of these studies involve 
truly aversive USs. Therefore, we still know very little about how aversive conditioning 
contributes to avoidance (and vice versa) and are likely missing key information on how 
obsessions are associated with compulsions.3

An important next step is formally testing those with OCD on a task that combines classical 
aversive conditioning and instrumental avoidance. There is a rich history of animal studies 
that test these processes (e.g., Kirlic et al., 2017; Mackintosh, 1974). Human studies of 
instrumental avoidance have been less common compared with classical conditioning studies 
and, until relatively recently, had fallen out of favor in the conditioning field (LeDoux et 
al., 2017; Pittig et al., 2018). A recent resurgence in this area has resulted in efforts to 
revitalize the study of avoidance in the context of anxiety-related pathology. These efforts 
have also resulted in new experimental paradigms, or modifications of past paradigms, that 
hold great promise for the study of OCD. Perhaps the most relevant are avoidance tasks 
that require an active response to remove or escape the aversive outcome (analogous to 
enacting a compulsion) and tasks in which avoidance has an associated cost (e.g., Hunt et 
al., 2019; Pittig & Scherbaum, 2019; Rattel et al., 2017). Cost is a particularly important 
parameter to model in experimental studies of OCD, as part of the clinical definition of 
compulsions is that these behaviors are repeated excessively or otherwise interfere with a 
person’s life, thus denying more valued activity. For example, some people with OCD have 
very strong checking obsessions and compulsions report social and romantic discord due to 
others accommodating the time-intensive and frequently inconvenient checking behavior of 
the person with OCD (e.g., Boeding et al., 2013). In other words, the “cost” of avoidant 

3It should also be noted that differing views on compulsions in OCD exist, such as compulsions being conceptualized as the 
manifestation of broad and excessive habit formation as opposed to behaviors that are enacted with a goal of avoidance (Gillan & 
Robbins, 2014). We acknowledge that multiple processes are likely contributing to the behavioral output of compulsions, but that at 
the present we cannot directly compare habit models of avoidance to conditioning models of avoidance in OCD due to the lack of 
studies of the latter. A recent review on this subject provides a more detailed and neurobiologically informed discussion of this issue 
(Geramita et al., 2020), and other reviews delineate and compare the forms and stages of avoidance more broadly (e.g., LeDoux & 
Daw, 2018).

behavior is the valued outcome of relational stability. Conditioning tasks that test these 
situations, termed approach-avoidance conflicts or mixed outcome designs, typically involve 
an inherently salient reward that, when removed or lost, serves as the cost of an avoidance 
response and can potentially buffer against avoidance of a feared stimulus (Pittig et al., 
2014, 2018). Examples of rewards used in these tasks are monetary compensation or 
winning a specific task and receiving points (for review, see Pittig et al., 2018).

Inhibitory Learning During Acquisition and Extinction—Although aversive 

4.4.3 
conditioning is commonly used as an explanatory model for excitatory responding that 
results in excessive negative emotionality (e.g., a strong fear response in anxiety-related 
disorders), understanding how people learn to inhibit their conditioned responses has clear 
scientific and clinical relevance. Inhibitory learning is of particular interest to the study of 
OCD because of clinical conceptualizations of the disorder centrally involving failures to 
inhibit obsessions and compulsions, as well as consistent experimental evidence for neural 
abnormalities in inhibitory regions (e.g., Thorsen et al., 2018). As with excitatory learning, 
inhibitory learning plays a central role in both acquisition and extinction of conditioned 
associations. Below we discuss each separately in the context of future studies of OCD.

During the initial acquisition of an aversive association, excitatory and inhibitory 
information and processes simultaneously contribute to the expressed CR (e.g., Fullana 
et al., 2016; Krabbe et al., 2018). Thus, the CR can be seen as the result of competition 
between excitatory and inhibitory influences, with the stronger of the two dictating the 
behavioral expression for a particular CS. Although the reviewed studies suggest that CS+, 
but not CS−, responding during acquisition differentiated OCD groups from the control 
group, this does not necessarily correspond to impaired inhibitory learning in OCD. The 
observed CR to a CS+ or CS− is comprised of some combination of excitatory and 
inhibitory activity, but the exact contributions of each are not identifiable using standard 
differential conditioning designs (Jovanovic et al., 2005; Myers & Davis, 2004). For 
example, a relatively decreased CR to the CS− could be equally related to a decrease in 
excitatory activation or an increase in inhibitory activation. Similarly, a strong CR to a 
CS+ could equally be the result of a complete lack of inhibitory activation or a maximal 
excitatory response that has been tampered down by a moderate inhibitory response.

An elegant solution to the issue of entangled excitatory and inhibitory processes is the 
conditioned inhibition paradigm (Rescorla, 1969; Rescorla & Holland, 1977). This paradigm 
is a modification of the differential conditioning design in which some trials present the 
previously conditioned CS+ simultaneously alongside a novel stimulus and without US 
reinforcement. This novel stimulus is then combined with the CS− and other novel stimuli 
to measure inhibitory learning, which is operationalized as a lack of CR on these later 
trials. Researchers have used conditioned inhibition paradigms to measure PTSD-control 
differences in inhibitory responding (e.g., Jovanovic et al., 2010; Jovanovic & Norrholm, 
2011; Sijbrandij et al., 2013), and this paradigm would also be a logical next step for 
OCD conditioning work. Despite acquisition in OCD being somewhat biased towards CS+ 
reactivity, we would expect that conditioned inhibition during acquisition would also be 
impaired in OCD relative to comparison participants and reflect the broader inhibition 
learning deficits – both emotional and non-emotional – that are commonly seen in the

disorder (e.g., Berlin et al., 2015; Enright & Beech, 1993; Kampman et al., 2002; van Velzen 
et al., 2014).

Inhibitory learning during extinction is crucial to understanding the mechanisms and 
conditions through which a CR can decrease and eventually abate. Modern understanding 
of the extinction process is that through repeated presentation of the CS+ in the absence of 
the US, two competing memory traces are formed: the original CS+−US association and a 
new inhibitory memory of the CS+ without the US (Bouton, 1993, 2004). A corollary to 
this extinction model is that CR reductions are not necessarily solely driven by repeated 
exposure (habituation) to the CS+ that results in a weakening of the CS+−US association 
and instead also involve promotion of the competing inhibitory memory. Consequently, 
exposure therapy’s effectiveness is not exclusively dependent on successful habituation, 
as initially proposed (Foa & Kozak, 1986), but is also related to the strength of new 
inhibitory memories and experiences (Craske et al., 2008, 2014, 2018; Tolin, 2019). Modern 
research on extinction learning and exposure therapy has started to center on how to harness 
inhibitory learning models most effectively during treatment, with OCD discussed as one 
disorder that would benefit from this type of work (e.g., Arch & Abramowitz, 2015; 
Craske et al., 2008; Jacoby & Abramowitz, 2016; Krompinger et al., 2019). Findings of 
OCD-related extinction deficits in the reviewed studies, as well as the need to improve upon 
the limitations of EX/RP, suggest that this would be a fruitful avenue of future research and a 
natural next step for conditioning investigations of OCD.

A potential template for future empirical studies can be found in the clinical techniques 
developed in line with the inhibitory learning model and based on basic science work 
(Dunsmoor et al., 2015), but still need validation within OCD samples. Craske et al. 
(2014) detail eight techniques with strong conditioning foundations, and a review by Jacoby 
and Abramowitz (2016) specifies four techniques that hold great promise for treatment 
of OCD in particular: expectancy violation (maximizing the discrepancy between the 
expected and actual aversive outcome), combining multiple fear cues/deepened extinction 
(increasing inhibitory learning by extinguishing two or more CS+s during extinction), 
maximizing contextual variability (presenting extinction in multiple contexts to promote 
durable and generalized CR reductions), and expanding the inter-session interval (increasing 
the duration between extinction trials). All these techniques have corresponding laboratory­
based conditioning protocols and are ideal next steps for OCD conditioning research that 
builds off the reviewed studies’ findings.

4.4.4  Adjuncts to Exposure Therapy and Improved Conditioning Models of 
OCD—Exposure techniques for OCD can be enhanced with therapeutic adjuncts from 
outside of the conditioning toolbox to improve effectiveness. However, the interaction 
between these adjunct interventions and conditioning techniques and processes is not well­
studied in OCD, and results in other anxiety-related disorders or pre-clinical results are 
ambiguous. Improved conditioning methodology that more precisely tests clinically relevant 
processes in OCD could be valuable for future research on these adjunct interventions.

For example, pharmacological enhancement of extinction has been a goal for clinical 
researchers for decades (Fitzgerald et al., 2014). D-cycloserine (DCS), a N-methyl-D­

aspartate (NMDA) receptor partial agonist, has been put forward as a potential extinction 
enhancer and tested in multiple clinical trials for OCD and other anxiety-related disorders. 
Meta-analytic results indicate that DCS has a small-to-null faciliatory effect on exposure 
treatment in anxiety-related disorders, with some of the smallest observed effects seen 
in studies of OCD (e.g., Bürkner et al., 2017; Mataix-Cols et al., 2017; McGuire et al., 
2016). Other meta-analyses suggest that DCS is a viable adjunct for exposure under certain 
timing and dose parameters (e.g., Rosenfield et al., 2019; Xia et al., 2015). However, 
these meta-analyses are somewhat at odds with meta-analytic findings that DCS improves 
fear extinction in experimental animal and human studies (Norberg et al., 2008), and 
with some moderators even showing opposite effects in the clinical vs. experimental 
literature (e.g., fewer DCS doses enhanced extinction in experimental studies, Norberg et 
al., 2008, but more DCS doses enhanced exposure in clinical studies, Rosenfield et al., 
2019). The questions that arise from these conflicting meta-analytic findings suggest that 
increased insight into the mechanisms underlying DCS and its relation to the processes 
underlying exposure therapy is needed. In terms of behavioral adjuncts to exposure therapy, 
one intriguing option is improving deliberate emotion regulation, such as reappraising or 
suppressing an emotional response or impetus. Evidence for emotion regulation strategies 
enhancing extinction (Delgado et al., 2008; Hennings et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2021) 
or exposure therapy (Renna et al., 2017; Wisco et al., 2013) in non-clinical and clinical 
populations is mixed. Accordingly, conditioning tasks that more closely align with the 
clinical reality of OCD and might provide more precise and ecologically valid outcomes 
could be valuable for future studies of DCS, emotion regulation, and other candidate 
pharmacological and behavioral adjuncts to exposure.

4.5  Clinical Considerations in Conditioning Studies of OCD: Assessment, Classification, 
and Medication

4.5.1  Assessment and Classification—Most of the reviewed conditioning studies 
employ the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM; American Psychiatric Association, 
2013) to assign a categorical OCD diagnosis. Those studies that contain dimensional 
symptom measures either use those measures to form analog groups that are analyzed 
categorically or do not assess all participants (e.g., those designated as psychiatric controls) 
with these measures. Categorical diagnostic systems, including the DSM, have increasingly 
received intense criticism (Kotov et al., 2017; Krueger et al., 2018; Watson, 2005). As it 
pertains to OCD, evidence broadly suggests that OCD does not conform to the categorical 
DSM structure (Kotov et al., 2011; Pinto et al., 2008; Raines et al., 2015), and the 
DSM category for OCD is viewed as inflexible for clinical and research use (Hollander 
et al., 2007). Further, heterogeneity within the disorder category is problematically high 
(Abramowitz & Jacoby, 2015; Lochner & Stein, 2003; McKay et al., 2004) and results in the 
grouping together of people who drastically differ from each other in terms of the themes 
of their obsessions and compulsions (Baer, 1994; Leckman et al., 1997; Summerfeldt et 
al., 1999, 2014). Conversely, dimensional trait systems are an appropriate fit for reported 
OCD symptoms and psychometrically outperform categorical diagnosis of OCD while better 
accounting for symptom heterogeneity (see Kotov et al., 2007, 2010, 2015; Watson, 2005).

Adapting a dimensional assessment and classification approach in future conditioning 
studies of OCD could yield numerous benefits. At a statistical level, dimensional indices 
of OCD naturally yield greater variance than categorical indices. Accordingly, testing 
dimensional indices of OCD as a primary predictor could result in increased precision to 
detect subtle conditioning abnormalities related to the pathology. The use of multivariate 
techniques to identify latent dimensions that cut across DSM-defined OCD criteria (such as 
empirically identified OCD symptom dimensions or higher-order internalizing traits, e.g., 
Faure & Forbes, 2021) might also improve detection of relevant conditioning abnormalities 
related to the pathology.

Dimensional approaches also help address psychiatric comorbidities that obscure a clearer 
picture of psychopathology and its relations (e.g., Kim & Eaton, 2015; Kotov et al., 
2017). Comorbidity, a natural consequence of a categorical classification system, creates 
difficulties in reliably assigning etiological or pathophysiological processes to specific 
categories (e.g., Krueger & Markon, 2006). In the current review, almost all the tested 
clinical groups contained participants who were also diagnosed with other anxiety-related 
disorders or mood disorders. Thus, the possibility remains that the patterns of conditioning 
deficits are not necessarily related to “pure” OCD but rather reflect an amalgamation of 
pathogenic processes in both OCD and commonly comorbid disorders. Alternatively, it 
is possible that the comorbidities created additional noise in an OCD-specific signal and 
that a more consistent pattern of conditioning deficits in OCD would emerge if comorbid 
presentations were excluded from tested samples. Adapting a dimensional approach could 
help address both of these possibilities, as each potential source of conditioning-related 
individual variation (e.g., OCD symptoms and traits, mood disorder symptoms and traits, 
etc.) could be included and tested in a statistical model.

To facilitate a more dimensional approach to OCD assessment, future studies might 
consider use of the Dimensional Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (DY-BOCS; 
Rosario-Campos et al., 2006). The DY-BOCS provides fine-grained OCD symptom severity 
subscales that are not typically derived from the standard adult or child Y-BOCS (Goodman 
et al., 1989; Goodman et al., 1991) that was used in many of the reviewed studies (see Table 
1). In addition to a primary interview measure of OCD symptom severity, we recommend 
employing an additional self-report measure when possible (e.g., Abramowitz et al., 2010, 
Foa et al., 2002); primarily because of documented differences in reported symptoms based 
on the measurement technique (Federici et al., 2010). Additionally, some OCD self-report 
measures are able to cover a broader range of content than interviews.

4.5.2  Medications—In the current review, the majority of studies tested OCD groups 
that contained participants reporting current use of psychotropic medication (see Table 1). 
The most frequently reported medication was the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor 
(SSRI) class of antidepressants that are frequently prescribed as a first-line pharmaceutical 
treatment for anxiety-related disorders and show acceptable efficacy (Soomro et al., 2008). 
Animal work finds that acute serotonergic challenge reliably attenuates conditioned fear 
acquisition and extinction (for review, see Inoue et al., 2011). Human studies are less 
conclusive: one study found SSRI treatment facilitates extinction (Bui et al., 2013), whereas 
another found that use of SSRIs, along with other medications, weakened but did not

eliminate significant anxiety patient-control differences in fear acquisition (Otto et al., 
2014). Other common psychotropic medications used by participants in the reviewed 
studies, such as sedatives and beta-blockers, have also been shown to affect human 
fear expression (e.g., Grillon et al., 2004, 2006). Specific to OCD, there is evidence 
that medication usage in studies of OCD patients confounds efforts to identify reliable 
biomarkers of the disorder (for review, see Fullana et al., 2020); and that machine learning 
algorithms applied to neural data reliably distinguished between medicated and unmedicated 
patients with OCD at a higher rate than OCD patient vs. control (see Heuvel et al., 2020). 
Taken together, there is a clear need to systematically investigate medication usage in OCD 
within the context of conditioning studies to determine the degree and form of confounding 
effect. That said, we contend that restricting study participation to those with OCD who are 
medication-free is not the answer. In the interest of generalizability and translation, future 
studies would benefit from studying conditioning processes within the clinical reality of 
OCD, and that clinical reality frequently involves psychotropic medication.

4.6  Conclusion

Our review of conditioning studies of OCD has revealed that a small but promising 
body of research supports a conditioning perspective of the disorder, especially regarding 
extinction deficits. Current priorities in the treatment research suggest that the next wave of 
conditioning work in OCD would benefit from building on basic acquisition and extinction 
paradigms to address more experimentally complex but clinically relevant questions. We 
hope that with future conditioning studies, translational scientists will have a robust and 
detailed foundation of data on which to build the next wave of exposure treatments, as has 
been done in the past in regard to other anxiety-related disorders. We also anticipate that the 
addition of new studies to the growing OCD conditioning literature will be conducive to an 
eventual quantitative synthesis (e.g., meta-analysis) in the future. Although the bulk of the 
scientific work has likely yet to be done, we view the field as well-positioned to make a 
scientifically impactful and clinically meaningful difference for those with OCD.

Highlights

•

•

•

•

Classical conditioning models of OCD inform gold-standard exposure 
interventions.

First systematic review of classical fear conditioning studies in OCD.

Twelve identified studies yielded mixed evidence for impaired acquisition in 
OCD, but more consistent evidence for extinction deficits.

Next steps and recommendations for ecologically-valid laboratory tasks 
and individual difference assessments to facilitate translational efforts are 
discussed.

Figure 1. 
Schematic of classical conditioning processes within the context of OCD and in the 
laboratory setting. Top half of figure models the development of obsessions and defensive 
responding. Note that in this example, the initial distressing experience could be observing 
actual harm or imagining harming others. Bottom half of figure shows the corresponding 
components of a classical conditioning protocol that uses electric shock as the US. CS = 
conditioned stimulus; CS+ = conditioned threat cue; SCR = skin conductance response; US 
= unconditioned stimulus.
