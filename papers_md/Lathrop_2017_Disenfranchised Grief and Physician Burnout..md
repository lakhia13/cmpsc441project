ABSTRACT
Over the span of their career, physicians experience changes to their profes-
sional role and professional identity. The process of continual adaptation in their 
work setting incurs losses. These losses can be ambiguous, cumulative, and may 
require grieving. Grief in the workplace is unsanctioned, and may contribute to 
physicians’ experience of burnout (emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, low 
sense of achievement). Acknowledging loss, validating grief, and being prescient 
in dealing with physician burnout is essential.

Ann Fam Med 2017;15:375-378. https://doi.org/10.1370/afm.2074.

I would like to propose that we have a grieving physician workforce. Phy-

sicians have traditionally encountered losses—regularly confronting death 
in the context of the care of their patients. They may not, however, recog-
nize that they are surrounded by more ambiguous losses, including rapidly 
changing expectations of their duties, roles, and regard.

Any transition offers the potential for loss, and losses incur grief.1(p3) 
Kennth Doka defines disenfranchised grief as “grief that persons experi-
ence when they incur a loss that is not or cannot be openly acknowledged, 
publicly mourned, or socially supported.”1(p4) Disenfranchised grief may 
contribute to the development and persistence of physician burnout. To 
adequately address the current crisis of physician burnout, the under-
recognized role of grief in the physician experience must be addressed.

Role of Workplace Transitions in Loss
Physicians’ work responsibilities have undergone significant changes in the 
last two decades. These include:

• The trend from running a private practice to becoming employees 

(changes in authority, level of autonomy, role, responsibilities)

• Implementation of electronic health records 
• Trend toward team-based vs physician-visit–based care and the rise 

of a midlevel practitioner presence

• Insurance product refinement (pre-authorizations, panel size changes)
• Increasing regulatory and administrative aspects 
• Evolving credentialing requirements
These changes, while incremental, have been continuous, and taken 
en masse, have required adjustments in how we practice medicine. These 
adaptations incur loss. For example, bringing computers into the patient 
room, while offering certain efficiencies, changes the initial moments of 
the patient-physician interaction: a login experience now accompanies 
the personal salutation. We have lost the initial, unadulterated moment 
between physician and patient/family. Similar small transitions over several 
decades have an additive effect, and the impact on physicians’ work expe-
rience is significant.

Adapting to such workplace transitions contributes to stress,2 and 
loss. Louis Trudel, et al, note that if a worker’s integrity is undermined by 
the work experience there is a “mourning of the loss of a part of oneself

engaged in work.”3 An example might be a physician 
whose sense of professional integrity feels threatened 
by his or her perceived inability to deliver care at an 
acceptable pace for the care to seem adequate, effec-
tive, or fruitful.4 Such situations can arise when sched-
uling is dictated by central templates, relative value 
unit (RVU) capture, contractual or marketing-based 
panel sizes, rather than by patient or physician needs. 
This can invoke loss and mourning.

Further, physicians who experience burnout experi-

ence the loss of their own ability to engage energeti-
cally, enthusiastically, or effectively in the workplace. 
Currently, occupational burnout (defined as exhaus-
tion, detachment/cynicism, low sense of achievement5) 
is present in 37% to 53% of physicians.6 Drs Christine 
Maslach and Michael Leiter, pioneers in the field of 
occupational burnout, maintain that management-
driven elements of work life are responsible for 
occupational burnout.7 Workload, reward, control, 
community (team climate/trust), values, and fairness 
are key spheres in which organizational processes cre-
ate a setting which promotes either engagement, or 
burnout. To illustrate, if a doctor leaves a partnership 
practice for an employed setting and experiences an 
increased administrative workload,8 yet as an employee 
has less say in the matter, the setting may engender 
an increased risk for burnout (workload, control, and 
reward are affected). For physicians with burnout, 
the loss of engagement at work is a loss of a part of 
themselves.

Physician’s Experience of Loss
The role of organizational, as well as structural (regula-
tory, fiscal, legal), factors in physicians’ changing work 
environment cannot be minimized. But it is the physi-
cian’s experience, after all, that is affected. While other 
professional and industrial sectors have faced upheav-
als, physicians face a long lead time between entering 
medical school and being able to work independently. 
Dissonance may develop between the expected role 
and regard a physician held before entering the profes-
sion, vs one’s current experience. This may strike the 
doctor directly during patient care, or by extrapola-
tion, from institutional, governmental, or societal 
cues. For example, there is a role adjustment required 
for physicians to go from being the holder of unique 
knowledge, to that of an expert partner aiding patients 
through Internet-mediated doctoring.

Cultural shifts in our changing medical landscape 

also play out semantically: the term “provider” now 
denotes physicians and any number of other health 
care professionals. Doctors are thus identified by the 
service they provide, rather than by the professional 
title which embodies hard-sought training, ethical 

mandates, and knowledge-based authority. In these 
ways physicians receive conflicting and/or marginal-
izing messages, which results in a loss of occupational 
esteem, and can evoke internal dissonance.

Disenfranchised Grief
When workplace transitions affect pivotal aspects of 
the physician’s professional identity, adaption may 
engender significant loss. “Where there is loss, there is 
grief,”1 and for those lamenting, even on an inexplicit 
level, grieving drains one’s physical energy, emotional 
stamina, and at times, intellectual capability.9(p94) 
Grieving, therefore, both at work and because of 
work, could contribute to what we typically define 
as risk factors for professional burnout. To date, phy-
sician burnout has been addressed primarily with 
informal strategies of stress reduction, lifestyle coach-
ing, and trying to build physician resilience. Yet this 
approach erroneously implies too little resilience or a 
weakness within the physician, while diminishing or 
even exonerating the health care delivery apparatus 
and organizations in which physicians work. In so 
doing, the physicians’ grief, and suffering, is disenfran-
chised by the system.

The 1989 compilation work entitled Disenfranchised 

Grief: Recognizing Hidden Sorrow addresses the conflict 
between the needs of the individual experiencing loss, 
and the goals of the workplace. At work, “Emotions 
and feelings are discounted, discouraged and disal-
lowed,” and therefore all losses are disenfranchised 
in the workplace.9(p92) Additionally, physician loss is 
underacknowledged due to limited collegial exchange, 
the hierarchical nature of the medical milieu, and con-
cerns about career consequences (eg, being labeled as 
disruptive or a whiner).

Privately, physicians may defensively suppress self-

awareness of their grief. Medical training’s historic 
“hidden curriculum” often required of trainees an ini-
tial loss of autonomy, sense of mastery, sleep, outside 
interests, etc, and cultivated the use of such defensive 
strategies. Mid- and late-career physicians now increas-
ingly hear the skills and nonclinical qualities promoted 
within that training system deemed obsolete, eroding 
acknowledgment of developed acumen and bringing 
to question the personal opportunity costs of their 
acquisition. Reflecting on the impact of sacrifice can be 
painful, and evaded through defensive techniques. In 
this way, physicians may suppress or minimize the rec-
ognition of their losses, which further complicates the 
experience of grieving.

A Systems Issue
Although physicians are suffering, efforts to assist 
them can exacerbate the problem. For example, in

PHYSICIAN GRIEFemployer-based models, physician extenders are often 
brought in under the auspices of increasing access 
and reducing physician burden, but with unexpected 
results. For example, using nurse practitioners poten-
tially decreases highly valued elements of work such 
as continuity with established patients, control of 
patient care plans, and revenue (if high RVU/time-
expenditure visits are siphoned off). Meanwhile, the 
physician acquires supervisory tasks, for which com-
pensatory adjustment or other rewards (mentoring, 
scheduling flexibility, etc) may be insufficient. Further, 
physicians may interpret this as a sign that their exten-
sive training, board certification, and experience are 
not as valued as their (risk-incurring, supervisory) sig-
nature. This again can undermine physician integrity, 
and sets up the dynamic for loss and grief.

Similarly, organizations’ attempts at resilience-
training to combat workplace burnout can further 
disenfranchise physicians’ experiences. First, evidence 
in the literature is insufficient to support that stress-
reduction/mindfulness techniques are effective against 
physician burnout; studies to date are lacking appropri-
ate controls, power, generalizability and/or statistical 
significance.10-15 Second, evidence points to occupa-
tional burnout being a consequence of system pro-
cesses,7  whereas promoting resiliency training implies 
a personal failing on the part of the physician. In fact, 
physicians have already demonstrated their high resil-
iency through successful completion of their medical 
education and training and some argue it is actually the 
high level of physician resiliency which has allowed 
system processes to become ripe for occupational 
burnout! When misconceptions of etiology, locus, or 
remedy for physician burnout are promoted, physi-
cians’ authentic experience is further disenfranchised. 

Moving Forward
Research in business management and industrial psy-
chology has clarified how systems need to attend to 
knowledge-based workers’ work experience to avoid 
dissatisfaction and burnout. Recently, increased atten-
tion has been paid to the effects of organizational 
climate,4 direct supervisor’s leadership skills,16 evidence 
of work progress,17 and physician-centered workplace 
initiatives.18 Occupational burnout can be prevented 
when research informs the solutions. But first, we need 
to pay attention to the losses that impact physicians. 
We need to name them, and validate physicians’ expe-
riences of transition, adaptation, and loss, and examine 
how health systems perpetuate losses.1(p313),19

Suffering physicians could benefit when they 
acknowledge changes in their work environment incur 
loss, chose to address any pain from hidden grief, 
withdraw emotional energy from earlier professional 

expectations, and reframe their professional future.1(p191) 
Meeting this challenge may require accessing resources 
or addressing personal and/or professional conflicts 
from which doctors have traditionally shied away. 
Most of all, as in all grief, physicians will need to 
accept that their losses are real—and permanent.
For physicians caring for physicians as their 
patients, it is an opportune moment to name occu-
pational losses as such, validate grief, offer collegial 
empathy, and treat clinically toward grief work goals. 
Modeling an affirming response helps mitigate that 
which makes these losses disenfranchised. 

For physician educators, preparing current doctors-

in-training for an ever-evolving practice landscape 
might increase professional sustainability and physi-
cian satisfaction in the future. Indeed, investigators 
might examine whether mentorship schemes in post-
residency settings reduce burnout.

For the physicians who have leadership roles in 
their practice or organization, there is much to do. It is 
essential and constructive that they bring an awareness 
of the extent to which organizational evolution causes 
shifts and losses that impact physicians’ inner work life. 
Each organization will have to weigh the cost of ame-
liorating such unintended consequences. In the mean-
time, we must give the utmost respect and care to the 
consideration that physicians are potentially grieving, 
while upholding their professional role.
