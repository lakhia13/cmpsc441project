subjects in terms of empathy and related processes

(cid:129) Evaluate the effects of empathy or related processes as factors contributing to abnormal social functioning in BPD
Abstract: We reviewed 45 original research studies, published between 2000 and 2019, to assess differences between
adult patients with the diagnosis of borderline personality disorder (BPD) and healthy control subjects in terms of empathy
and related processes (i.e., theory of mind, mentalizing, social cognition, and emotional intelligence). Thirty-six studies
reported deficits of empathy or related processes in patients with BPD. Enhanced emotional empathy in BPD was also
reported in eight studies, all of which revealed that patients had increased scores of personal distress on the Interpersonal
Reactivity Index self-report questionnaire. Six studies did not find significant differences between patients with BPD and
healthy control subjects in terms of empathy or related processes. No study reported enhanced cognitive empathy, social
cognition, or emotional intelligence in patients with BPD. We postulate that deficits of empathy or related processes con-
tribute to preempting the formation of stable interpersonal relationships, whereas enhanced emotional empathy might
lead to personal (and interpersonal) distress, further contributing to abnormal social functioning in BPD.

BPD is a chronic and debilitating mental disorder, whose esti-
mated median prevalence is 1.6%.1 It is associated with frequent
episodes of self-injury and with high mortality, and has the
highest degree of suicidality among personality disorders.1–3

As postulated by Gunderson,4 affective instability, impulsiv-
ity, and disturbed relationships represent the three core symptom
dimensions of BPD. Crucially, disturbed relationships have been
proposed as the best discriminator for the diagnosis of BPD and
are increasingly recognized as being essential to understand the
impairment and distress associated with the disorder.4

Empathy and Related Concepts
Empathy is commonly used as a lay term indicating the ability to
understand “others”—the capacity to “put yourself in someone
else’s shoes.” However, from the psychological, developmental,
and cognitive neuroscience points of view, the concept of empa-
thy is complex5,6 and embodies different dimensions. The most
well-known dimensions of empathy are the following: cognitive
and emotional. In addition, motor empathy has been proposed as
a distinct dimension representing the imitation of motor responses
(e.g., facial expressions, vocalizations, postures, and movements)
of “others.”5 This dimension has been incorporated in models
underlying empathy across a wide range of animal species.7,8
Emotion recognition refers to the identification of emo-
tions from expressions (e.g., facial). The identification of

emotions subsequently enables one to infer emotional states.
Human faces are a rich source of information regarding sub-
jective emotional states and social communication.9 This in-
formation is a prerequisite for (emotional) empathy.

Emotional empathy is conceptualized as the ability to respond
to emotional states of “others”10 in a sympathetic manner (i.e.,
by experiencing them vicariously). Such a state-matching reac-
tion has been related to the mirror neuron system.11,12 This
system corresponds to a set of specialized neurons, primarily lo-
cated in the premotor cortex, that are believed to be engaged in
“mirroring” the behavior and actions of others.12 The hypothesis
that emotional empathy could be related to this system is sup-
ported by functional neuroimaging data showing decreased acti-
vation at the right pars opercularis of the inferior frontal gyrus—a
part of the mirror neuron system—in children with reduced
empathy (e.g., as in autism spectrum disorder), during both
imitation and observation of facial emotional expressions.13
It is increasingly recognized that emotional and cognitive
empathy are interconnected.8 Cognitive empathy is the ability
to take the perspective of “others” without necessarily being
sympathetic or experiencing it vicariously.5 According to Blair,5
cognitive empathy is, in effect, the theory of mind (ToM).

ToM refers to the ability of attributing significance to
mental states (e.g., beliefs, desires, feelings, intentions, needs,
thoughts, and reasons) of “self and others” in order to under-
stand, explain, and predict behaviors.14,15 The concept of
affective ToM has also been proposed to capture the impor-
tance of emotion (and emotion recognition) in attributing
significance to mental states. Therefore, emotion recognition
can help to differentiate affective ToM from the purely cogni-
tive characteristics of ToM.16,17

Another concept closely related to ToM is mentalization
(i.e., mentalizing). Mentalizing corresponds to the ability to
understand and interpret the mental states of “oneself and
others.”18,19 Although the term mentalizing does not refer to
quite the same phenomenon as ToM20—mentalizing mostly
refers to an affective and self-oriented dimension, whereas
ToM mostly implies cognitive understanding and attribution
of significance to mental states of “others”—the terms are
often used interchangeably.21

Social cognition mostly includes information processing
about “others, the self, and the norms of the social world.”22
It is also a broad concept encompassing processes such as
emotion recognition, empathy, ToM, and mentalizing, and con-
tributes to the ability of an individual to understand and effec-
tively respond to the perspectives of “others,” enabling humans
to establish and maintain interpersonal relationships.23

Finally, emotional intelligence includes perceiving, assimi-

lating, understanding, and managing emotions.24,25

In summary, empathy, ToM, mentalizing, social cogni-
tion,26 and emotional intelligence are closely related concepts.
Although they are all different from one another, and authors
have conflicting and often confusing views about them, it is
widely believed that impairment of the underlying mental
processes occurs in several psychiatric disorders.

Empathic Dysfunction in Borderline Personality Disorder

Dysfunction of Empathy and Related Processes in Borderline
Personality Disorder
Dysfunction of empathy and related processes in patients
with BPD has been widely suggested. Fonagy27 first described
the inability of perceiving mental states in BPD as a probable
defense mechanism to early trauma, physical abuse (e.g., sex-
ual), and dysfunctional family relationships. Using a question-
naire aimed at assessing adult representation of attachment by
means of memories from their childhood—the Adult Attach-
ment Interview developed by Carol George, Nancy Kaplan,
and Mary Main in the mid-1980s—Fonagy and colleagues28
confirmed the existence of deficits in the awareness of mental
states contributing to the pattern of interpersonal dysfunction
in BPD. Likewise, deficits related to inaccurate attribution and
representation of behaviors are believed to be characteristic of
patients with BPD.29 Furthermore, mentalization-based therapy
was found to be effective in patients with BPD.30

Nevertheless, the results are inconsistent regarding the role
of empathy and related processes as a source of disturbed in-
terpersonal relationships in BPD. A key example here is the
empathic paradox that occurs in patients with BPD. The em-
pathic paradox, or borderline empathy paradox, is character-
ized by enhanced empathy, in spite of impaired interpersonal
functioning.26,31,32 In other words, it corresponds to a pecu-
liar ability of certain patients with BPD to recognize even sub-
tle emotional states of others, without the corresponding
ability to facilitate interpersonal relationships.

The purpose of this review is to assess differences in empa-
thy and related processes (i.e., ToM, mentalizing, social cog-
nition, and emotional intelligence) between patients with
BPD and healthy subjects.

METHODS

Literature Search and Selection Criteria
The PubMed database was searched for articles that were pub-
lished in English and used the term borderline personality disorder
and any of the following: empathy, theory of mind, mentalizing,
mentalising, mentalization, mentalisation, social cognition, or emo-
tional intelligence. In order to include further peer-reviewed articles
of interest in the field of psychology, an additional search—using
the same terms—was performed on the PsycINFO database.
The closing date for the searches was 31 December 2019.

All publications were scrutinized to confirm whether they
were substantively related to the purpose of the current review.
We selected original research articles involving adult patients
with the main diagnosis of BPD using criteria from the third re-
vised,33 fourth revised,34 and fifth1 editions of the Diagnostic
and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. We also used criteria
from the tenth revised edition of the International Classification
of Diseases35 for the “emotionally unstable personality disorder,
borderline type.” Mandatory inclusion criteria were the use of
measures of empathy or related processes and also the existence
of a group of healthy control subjects in the studies. Given that
patterns of abnormal brain functioning may underlie empathic

dysfunction in patients with BPD, studies using functional neu-
roimaging in this setting were also included.

Review articles (e.g., including those providing meta-analytic
results), commentaries, and editorials that exclusively addressed
the theoretical background of BPD were not included. Never-
theless, publications addressing empathy and related concepts
in BPD were surveyed for bibliographic references indicating
original research articles of interest not found in the PubMed
and PsycINFO searches.

Results of studies based on emotion-recognition tasks
without an explicit mention of empathy or related processes
were excluded, as were studies on borderline personality
symptoms, traits/features, or attachment style, and studies
specifically including adolescents in their samples. Further-
more, studies about biological mediators, type and effects of
therapies (e.g., mentalization-based therapy), and pharmaco-
logical modulation in BPD were excluded.

Supplemental Figure 1 presents a flow diagram showing
how the included studies were selected (available at http://
links.lww.com/HRP/A125).

Measures of Empathy and Related Processes
A major challenge in assessing empathy and related processes
is the availability of tests developed that take into account real-
life conditions.36 Moreover, applied tests are expected to be reli-
able enough to “represent” mental processes underlying the the-
oretical concepts discussed above. We report results of studies
using well-known, published, or “ecologically valid” tests for
assessing empathy or related processes in BPD. Specifically, the
ecological validity of a test refers to how well it mirrors real-life
conditions and, therefore, how clinically useful the test might be.
Tests used in more than one of the included studies for this re-
view are described below under separate subsections, in chronolog-
ical order of the earliest publication. In a subsequent subsection, the
test used to assess emotional intelligence is also described. Tests less
often used (i.e., only used in a single included study) are described
under a common subsection entitled “Other Measures.”

INTERPERSONAL REACTIVITY INDEX The Interpersonal Reactivity
Index (IRI)10 is a self-report questionnaire aimed at evaluating
empathy in a two-dimensional way (i.e., cognitive and emotional).
The IRI consists of four 7-item subscales: two cognitive subscales
(perspective taking [PT] and fantasy [FS]) and two emotional sub-
scales (empathic concern [EC] and personal distress [PD]). The
score of each subscale corresponds to the results of a 5-point
Likert scale (possible range of scores per item: 0–4 or 1–5).

HAPPÉ’S ADVANCED TOM TEST There are two different imple-
mentations of Happé’s advanced ToM test, also known as
the “strange stories” task,37–39 to assess ToM capacities in
patients with BPD.

Arntz and colleagues40 used the most complete implemen-
tation of this test. Their version consists of a mental and a
physical subtest, each comprising eight stories on small illus-
trations. The mental subtest presents two stories involving
double bluffs, mistakes, persuasion, and white lies (i.e.,

harmless or trivial lies, to avoid hurting the feelings of others).
This subtest evaluates ToM by requiring inferences concern-
ing the thoughts, feelings, and intentions of the characters.
The physical subtest includes stories requiring the inference
of physical causation, irrespective of the characters’ mental
states. Incorrect answers are scored 0; implicit or partly cor-
rect answers are scored 1; and explicit, complete answers
are scored 2. The maximum possible score is 16 per subtest.
An average score for each subtest can also be calculated.40

Yeh and colleagues41 used a simpler and less well-characterized
implementation of this test. This implementation includes
only five stories, and the maximum possible score is 10.

FAUX PAS DETECTION TEST The Faux Pas task42,43 is believed to
assess both cognitive and affective ToM capacities. Questions
are made about a set of written stories, for the detection of a faux
pas, which literally means a “misstep” and is actually defined by
Baron-Cohen and colleagues43(p 408) as a sort of communication
“without considering if it is something that the listener might not
want to hear or know, and which typically has negative conse-
quences that the speaker never intended.” It involves the infer-
ence of mental states and emotions of the characters in the
stories. The various implementations of this test differ mainly
in the number and type of questions used, and subsequently re-
garding the possible range of scores. Usually, this test comprises
a set of 20 stories, but one implementation uses only 10.41

READING THE MIND IN THE EYES TEST The Reading the Mind in
the Eyes Test (RMET), revised version,44 assesses ToM ca-
pacities. This test relies on the observation of 36 black-and-
white photographs of the eye region of different human faces.
Participants are asked to choose, from four available mental-
state descriptors (e.g., annoyance, amusement, bewilderment,
reflectiveness), the descriptor that best matches the mental
state of the person whose eyes are represented in each photo-
graph, without any specific time constraint. If necessary, a
glossary containing the meaning of the mental-state descriptors
can be presented during assessment. The total score is the num-
ber of correctly identified mental-state attributions (possible
range of scores: 0–36). To ascertain mental-state decoding on
the basis of emotional valence, Harkness and colleagues45
and Scott and colleagues46 differentiated the stimuli into posi-
tive, neutral, and negative, each ranked by the observer on a
7-point Likert scale. To evaluate the confidence rating of re-
sponses on the RMET, Schilling and colleagues47 asked sub-
jects to rate how confident they were about their responses.

Additional implementations of the RMET have been pro-
posed. Preißler and colleagues36 used a total number of 40 photo-
graphs instead of 36. Frick and colleagues48 presented the possible
choices of mental state attributions after each photograph’s dis-
play, as well as time limits for such display and the mental-state
decoding. The latter implementation is especially well suited for
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies.

EMPATHY QUOTIENT The Empathy Quotient (EQ)49,50 is a self-
report questionnaire comprising 60 items, 40 of which aimed

240

Volume 28 (cid:129) Number 4 (cid:129) July/August 2020

to assess empathy using a 4-point Likert scale: definitely
agree, slightly agree, slightly disagree, and definitely disagree.
A non-empathetic response is rated 0, and an empathetic re-
sponse is rated 1 or 2, depending on the strength of the re-
sponse (resulting in total scores from 0 to 80).

MOVIE FOR THE ASSESSMENT OF SOCIAL COGNITION The Movie
for the Assessment of Social Cognition (MASC)51 question-
naire relies on a nearly 15-minute video showing interac-
tions between four characters gathering for a dinner
party. Dominant topics of the interactions between charac-
ters involve dating and friendship issues. The video is
paused during its presentation so that questions about the
characters’ feelings, thoughts, and intentions (i.e., requir-
ing social cognition) can be answered by selecting the most
accurate response among the four available options. The
three types of error (for each question) are considered to
correspond to overmentalizing, reduced ToM, and no
ToM. Reduced or no ToM corresponds to undermentalizing
errors. The MASC has 15 items “challenging the interpreta-
tion of emotions,” 14 items “challenging the interpretation
of intentions,” 4 items to “measure thoughts,” and 4 control
questions. Correct responses are scored 1, and incorrect re-
sponses are scored 0. An overall score, as well as different
subscale scores, can be calculated. Andreou and colleagues52
evaluated the confidence rating of responses on the MASC.

MULTIFACETED EMPATHY TEST The Multifaceted Empathy Test
(MET)53 is a computer-assisted method comprising 23 pairs
of picture stimuli showing people in emotionally charged con-
ditions. It allows assessment of both cognitive and emotional
empathy. Cognitive empathy is assessed by inferring the men-
tal states of individuals displayed in photographs (one correct
attribution out of four possible mental-state descriptors).
Emotional empathy is evaluated by rating the emotional reac-
tions of subjects in response to the pictures; a 9-point Likert
empathic-concern subscale is used.

Dziobek and colleagues54 proposed an adaptation of the
MET for fMRI, using a series of 80 less ambiguous pictures
and a two-option answer for both the cognitive- and
emotional-empathy subscales. Ritter and colleagues55 evalu-
ated emotional empathy not only using the empathic-
concern subscale but also scoring emotional contagion (i.e.,
mirroring emotions) with a 0–9 point visual analogue scale.
Finally, Wingenfeld and colleagues56,57 proposed a modified
version of the MET using 30 picture stimuli.

REFLECTIVE FUNCTIONING QUESTIONNAIRE The Reflective Func-
tioning Questionnaire (RFQ)58 is a mentalizing self-report
measure with responses to specific items scored on a 6- to
7-point Likert scale, rescored from 0–2 or 0–3 both for a sub-
scale of certainty (RFQ_C) and a subscale of uncertainty
(RFQ_U) about mental states of self and others. The RFQ
provides measures of empathy, mindfulness, and perspective
taking, both associated with self- and clinician-reported mea-
sures of borderline personality features.58

Empathic Dysfunction in Borderline Personality Disorder

MAYER-SALOVEY-CARUSO EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE TEST The Mayer-
Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test (MSCEIT)25 is a
performance-based measure to assess the following four
branches (skills) of emotional intelligence: perceiving emo-
tions, assimilating or using emotions to facilitate thought, un-
derstanding emotions, and regulating or managing emotions.
Each of the four skills is measured with two tasks. Different
scoring methods are implemented for each task.25

OTHER MEASURES The Picture Sequencing Task consists of 11
stories, each in the form of a four-card picture set,59 and an
additional story designed to detect a false belief.60 A short
version of this test or the False-Belief Picture Sequencing
Task uses 10 stories in patients with BPD, 4 of which assess
simple cognitive understanding of false beliefs (involving
cognitive ToM).61

The Mental State Attribution Tasks (MSAT)62 assess ToM
capacities. The MSAT total (MSAT-T) score corresponds to
the sum of the MSAT event sequencing (MSAT-S) plus the
MSAT questionnaire (MSAT-Q) subscores. The MSAT-S
comprises six cartoon picture stories, each represented by
four cards, indicating three specific types of social interaction:
a cooperation between two subjects, one subject tricking an-
other, and two subjects cooperating to deceive a third one.
It tests the ability of the participants to order cards in a logical
sequence of events, and the corresponding subscore is based
upon a rating method proposed by Langdon and col-
leagues.59 The maximum possible subscore for the MSAT-S
is 36. The MSAT-Q comprises 23 questions to test the ability
of participants to recognize the characters’ mental states (e.g.,
cooperation, deception, and beliefs). Each correct answer on
the MSAT-Q corresponds to a subscore of 1. Therefore, the
possible range of scores for the MSAT-T is 0–59. According
to Ghiassi and colleagues,63 the MSAT-Q subscore is consid-
ered to be “the most interesting component” of the MSAT to
assess ToM capacities in patients with BPD.

The Theory of Mind Assessment Scale64,65 consists of a
semistructured interview assessing cognitive and affective
ToM capacities. Its current implementation uses 37 open-
ended questions divided into four scales by means of which
participants are prompted to express understanding of their
mental states and those of others.

The Joke-Appreciation66 and Nonverbal ToM41 tasks cor-
respond to novel measures of ToM capacities partly based on
Happé’s advanced ToM test. Both address implicit or nonver-
bal ToM and were included as valid measures for this review.
Likewise, the Questionnaire of Cognitive and Affective
Empathy67 is a relatively novel instrument for assessing em-
pathy partly based on the Interpersonal Reactivity Index
and Empathy Quotient self-report questionnaires.

Self-report mentalizing abilities can be assessed using the
Mentalization Questionnaire (MZQ)68 or the Mentalization
Scale (MentS).69 Although none of these measures is clearly
related to other well-known tests, their reliability was re-
ported to be satisfactory.68,69

Finally, Niedtfeld70 used an approach to assess emotional
empathy in BPD based on the relative contribution of facial
expressions, prosody, and speech content. This approach
was previously used in healthy subjects and in patients with
psychiatric conditions other than BPD.71

Analysis
All studies were analyzed as to whether they reported de-
creased, similar, or increased levels of empathy or related pro-
cesses in patients with BPD relative to healthy control
subjects, according to the statistical thresholds used in the cor-
responding publications (Tables 1–10).

RESULTS
Forty-five studies, published between 2000 and 2019, were in-
cluded in this review.17,36,40,41,47,48,52,54–57,61,63,69,70,72–101 Thirteen
(28.9%) of the 45 studies comprised samples of patients with psy-
chiatric conditions other than BPD,40,41,52,55,72,74,77,81,82,87,91,97,100
including other personality disorders, major depressive disorder
(MDD), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD),
schizophrenia, substance abuse disorder, and anorexia nervosa

(Tables 1–4 and 6–10). All but two studies47,82 reported sex
distributions for patients with the diagnosis of BDP. The
female-to-male ratio of patients included in studies reporting
sex distribution was 8:1.

Interpersonal Reactivity Index
Eleven (24.4%) of the 45 studies included in this review used the
IRI as a measure of empathy (Table 1).17,54,55,61,72,76,79,83–86

INTERPERSONAL REACTIVITY INDEX COGNITIVE SUBSCALES Seven
studies using the perspective-taking subscale of the IRI found
a significant reduction of the corresponding scores in patients
with BPD relative to healthy control subjects.55,61,76,83–86
Three studies did not find significant differences of PT scores
between groups.54,72,79

No study found a significant difference of fantasy scores between

patients with BPD and healthy control subjects.54,61,72,76,79,83–86

Harari and colleagues17 and Martin and colleagues86 cal-
culated the sum of scores from both cognitive subscales of
the IRI (i.e., the PT + FS score). Both studies revealed an over-
all deficit of cognitive empathy in patients with BPD.17,86

Two studies found reduced MASC scores in patients with
BPD relative to healthy control subjects.36,55 In particular,
they found an average reduction of 4.6 points in the MASC
total score, as well as an average reduction of 1.7 points in
the score specifically measuring items “challenging the inter-
pretation of intentions” in patients with BPD.36,55 With re-
spect to items “challenging the interpretations of emotions”
and regarding the capacity to “measure thoughts,” Preißler
and colleagues36 found lower scores in patients with BPD rel-
ative to controls, whereas Ritter and colleagues55 did not find
a significant difference between groups.

Although four studies did not find significant differences of
MASC scores between patients with BPD and healthy control
subjects,56,81,97,99 three studies revealed an increase of
overmentalizing errors in patients.52,81,97 In addition, one
study revealed “overconfidence in errors” as the major ab-
normality in BPD.52

Multifaceted Empathy Test
Four (8.9%) of the 45 studies included in this review used the
MET as a measure of empathy (Table 7).54–57

On the MET cognitive subscale, Dziobek and colleagues54
found deficits of cognitive empathy in women with BPD, but
no other study found a significant difference between patients
with BPD and healthy control subjects on this subscale.55–57
On the MET emotional subscale, two studies found defi-
cits of emotional empathy in patients with BPD.54,55 Specifi-
cally, these studies found an average reduction of 0.9 points
in the “emphatic concern” subscale score of patients with
BPD relative to healthy control subjects.54,55 One of these stud-
ies also found impaired “emotional contagion” in patients.55
Two studies by Wingenfeld and colleagues56,57 did not find
significant differences of emotional empathy between women
with BPD under usual conditions and healthy control
women, but one of these studies reported deficits of emotional
empathy in women with BPD under stress.57

Reflective Functioning Questionnaire
Three (6.7%) of the 45 studies included in this review used
the RFQ as a measure of mentalizing (Table 8).87,90,93

Perroud and colleagues87 found higher RFQ_U and lower

lated the RFQ total score by subtracting the RFQ_C score
from the RFQ_U score. The result was a negative value for
the subtraction (−4.4) in patients with BPD, and a positive
value (+7.5) in healthy controls.90

The main purpose of a study by Morandotti and col-
leagues93 was to differentiate patients with BPD from healthy
subjects by using receiver operating characteristic curves. Their
study found that the RFQ_U score was particularly useful for
such a differentiation and also for predicting BPD severity.93

Mayer-Salovey-Caruso Emotional Intelligence Test
Six (13.3%) of the 45 studies included in this review used
the MSCEIT as a measure of emotional
intelligence

Two studies did not find significant differences of emotional
intelligence between patients and controls.75,96

Other Measures
Table 10 summarizes results of the eight studies (17.8%)
using other measures of empathy and related processes.

The Questionnaire of Cognitive and Affective Empathy re-
vealed decreased cognitive empathy, but similar levels of
emotional empathy, in patients with BPD relative to healthy
control subjects.92 Curiously, in women with BPD, Niedtfeld70
found enhanced emotional contagion secondary to nonverbally
expressed emotions (i.e., ones just conveyed by emotionally
charged facial expressions and prosody, but not by speech con-
tent) and lack of emotional empathy when both speech content
and nonverbally expressed emotions were presented.70

The Joke-Appreciation and the Nonverbal ToM tasks re-
vealed deficits of ToM in patients with BPD.41,61 Colle and
colleagues95 also reported ToM deficits using the Theory of
Mind Assessment Scale and found them to be more pro-
nounced when mindreading tasks of patients required them
to undertake an “allocentric” perspective—that is, the per-
spective of another individual. Likewise, the Mentalization
Questionnaire and the Mentalization Scale revealed deficits
of mentalizing abilities in BPD.69,89

The False-Belief Picture Sequencing Task and the Mental
State Attribution Tasks did not reveal significant differences
between patients with BPD and healthy control subjects in

terms of ToM.61,63 Ghiassi and colleagues63 reported, how-
ever, that parental care during childhood influenced ToM ca-
pacities of patients with BPD as assessed by the MSAT;
maternal rejection and punishment, taken together, were found
to be a significant predictor of poor mentalizing in BPD.63

Summary of Results Across Studies
Thirty-six studies included in this review reported deficits of
empathy (i.e., cognitive or emotional), ToM, mentalizing, so-
intelligence in patients
cial cognition, or emotional
with BPD.17,36,41,47,52,54,55,57,61,69,70,74,76–90,92–98,100,101

Eight studies reported enhanced emotional empathy in pa-
tients with BPD, mostly because of an increase in the PD sub-
scale scores of the IRI.54,61,72,76,79,83,84,86 Curiously, three

studies using the RMET also revealed enhanced ToM capaci-
ties in patients with BPD.48,73,88

Contradictory results between distinct tests for assessing
empathy and related processes were reported in three stud-
ies.54,79,88 The study by Dziobek and colleagues54 showed
deficits of both cognitive and emotional empathy on the
MET but revealed enhanced emotional empathy on the basis
of the PD subscale of the IRI. Matzke and colleagues79 re-
ported deficits of empathy on the basis of the EQ but found
enhanced emotional empathy on the basis of the PD subscale
of the IRI. Finally, Zabihzadeh and colleagues88 found lack of
ToM capacities in patients with BPD based on the Faux Pas
detection test but found enhanced ToM capacities on
the RMET.

Volume 28 (cid:129) Number 4 (cid:129) July/August 2020

Six studies showed no significant differences of empathy
or related processes between patients with BPD and healthy
control subjects.40,56,63,75,91,99 With respect to the tests em-
ployed in these studies, Arntz and colleagues40 used Happé’s
advanced ToM test; Beblo and colleagues,75 the MSCEIT;
Ghiassi and colleagues,63 the MSAT; Wingenfeld and col-
leagues,56 the MASC and the MET; Berenson and col-
leagues,91 the RMET; and Duque-Alarcón and colleagues,99
the RMET and the MASC.

Comorbidities
Eight (17.8%) of the 45 studies included in this review ana-
lyzed the possible effect of comorbid psychiatric conditions
on dysfunction of empathy and related processes in BPD.36,73,
80,87,88,91,94,96

Preißler and colleagues36 reported significantly lower
MASC scores for items to “measure thoughts” in patients
with BPD and comorbid posttraumatic stress disorder
(PTSD) relative to patients without comorbid PTSD. In addi-
tion, this study found the following two significant predictors
of poor social cognition: intrusive symptoms (a core feature
of PTSD) and history of sexual trauma.36

Unoka and colleagues80 reported higher RMET total, neu-
tral valence, and negative valence scores in patients with BPD
and major depressive episode relative to patients without this
comorbidity. Zabihzadeh and colleagues88 also reported
higher RMET total and negative valence, but lower positive
valence, scores in patients with BPD and comorbid MDD rel-
ative to patients without comorbid MDD. By using the Faux
Pas detection test, this study found reduced ToM capacities in
patients with BPD and comorbid MDD relative to patients
without comorbid MDD.88

Finally, Perroud and colleagues87 found higher RFQ_U
scores in patients with BPD and comorbid ADHD relative
to patients without comorbid ADHD. No further significant
contribution of comorbidities for the pattern of empathic dys-
function in BPD was reported.

Neuroimaging
Two (4.4%) of the 45 studies included in this review assessed
empathy or related processes in the setting of blood oxygena-
tion level–dependent (BOLD) fMRI.48,54

Using an adaptation of the MET for fMRI, Dziobek and
colleagues54 found that patients with BPD showed less activa-
tion of the left superior temporal gyrus in a condition challeng-
ing cognitive empathy but found higher activation of the right
insular cortex in a condition challenging emotional empathy.
Using the implementation of the RMET for fMRI, Frick
and colleagues48 found activation of multiple brain regions
both in patients with BPD and healthy control subjects. The
authors highlighted a pattern of enhanced activation of the
right amygdala during positive emotional valence stimuli
and a pattern of enhanced activation of the left amygdala dur-
ing negative emotional valence stimuli in patients with BPD.

Empathic Dysfunction in Borderline Personality Disorder

DISCUSSION
Eighty percent of the studies included in this review reported
deficits of empathy or related processes in patients with
BPD.17,36,41,47,52,54,55,57,61,69,70,74,76–90,92–98,100,101 Moreover,
enhanced emotional empathy in BPD was reported in eight stud-
ies, all of which revealed that patients had increased scores of
distress on the IRI self-report questionnaire.54,61,72,76,79,83,84,86
Several studies found no significant differences between patients
with BPD and healthy control subjects in terms of empathy or
related processes,40,56,63,75,91,99 and some even found contrad-
ictory results between distinct tests.54,79,88 No study reported
enhanced cognitive empathy, social cognition, or emotional in-
telligence in patients with BPD.

Clinical heterogeneity (i.e., differences in characteristics of
patients) across samples partly explains the diversity of results
reported by studies included in this review. Specifically, demo-
graphic factors (age, sex, and education), the severity of BPD
symptoms, history of traumatic events, history of suicidal at-
tempts, features leading to hospitalization, concurrent medi-
cation, and psychiatric comorbidities might have influenced
the reported results. A key example here is the influence of
childhood trauma and comorbid PTSD on the development
of empathic dysfunction in BPD,36,102 which leads to a prac-
tical inability in determining where the aberrations in empa-
thy and related processes originated. Statistical variance due
to small sample sizes might also have contributed to the diver-
sity of results.

The measures used to assess empathy and related processes
can also explain part of the results, and some tests might even
be unable to detect abnormalities. An example is perhaps the
RMET,44 which—despite being the most frequently used test in
studies included in this review36,47,48,61,73,78,80,88,89,91,98,99,101—
was the test that most often did not detect differences between pa-
tients and controls,36,61,78,91,99 and the only one revealing en-
hanced ToM capacities in patients with BPD.48,73,88 Maybe the
absence of stimuli resembling realistic social interactions on the
RMET can explain the presumably inaccurate results.

The absence of realistic social interactions is also a common
feature of performance-based tests using cartoons or illustra-
tions to present stimuli, such as Happé’s advanced ToM test,
the False-Belief Picture Sequencing Task, and the MSAT. None
of these tests revealed significant differences between patients
with BPD and healthy subjects in terms of ToM.

In addition, results based on the IRI, EQ, RFQ, and other
self-report measures should be interpreted with caution be-
cause these tests are dependent on the participants’ ability to
understand percepts, perspectives, and emotions—an ability
potentially lacking in patients with mental disorders.

Alternatively, some of the applied measures might have
disproportionately weighted different dimensions of empathy
and related processes in patients with BPD. This can lead to
somewhat discrepant results, such as those reported by
Dziobek and colleagues,54 in which a decrease of cognitive
and emotional empathy was shown using the MET, whereas
enhanced emotional empathy was revealed using the PD

subscale of the IRI. It is conceivable that the reason for such a
discrepancy might be the absence of a specific measure of dis-
tress on the MET.

Lack of cognitive empathy, ToM, mentalizing, social cog-
nition, or emotional intelligence was found to be a common
feature among patients with BPD. This can explain a failure
in their process of repairing disrupted social cooperation,
which is a finding supported by neuroimaging data in the set-
ting of an economic exchange game with healthy partners.103
The possible concomitance of reduced emotional empathy
further diminishes the ability of patients with BPD to sustain
social cooperation, but a most intriguing finding is the possi-
ble occurrence of the empathic paradox, or borderline empa-
thy paradox, in these patients.31,32 This is a form of enhanced
emotional empathy enabling access to the emotions of others,
which are possibly misinterpreted in the setting of interpersonal
relationships. Put simply, it is possible that some patients with
BPD may perceive and respond to subtle emotional cues that
healthy subjects might otherwise ignore for the sake of socializa-
tion. The occurrence of this borderline empathy paradox has
been related to a previous history of abuse during childhood,
and is consistent with results of selected studies indicating en-
hanced emotional empathy and ToM.48,54,61,72,73,76,79,83,84,86,88
Along these lines, a proposed model explains the borderline
empathy paradox resulting from a combination of increased
attention to social stimuli and dysfunctional processing of so-
cial information,31 but the model needs to be confirmed. In
addition, it is uncertain how patients with BPD interpret basic
social information, and how well they use it to support
interpersonal relationships.104

We did not include results of studies based on emotion-
recognition tasks. Although this exclusion may be regarded
as a limitation of the current review, it was intended to avoid
possible confounds. As mentioned in the introduction, we
consider emotion recognition as a prerequisite for empathy,
but the possible occurrence of preserved or even enhanced
emotion-recognition abilities is not necessarily a synonym of
preserved empathy. In other words, although empathy and re-
lated processes are dependent on emotion recognition, an in-
dividual can be able to recognize emotions without being
empathetic at all. We also did not include results of studies
using unpublished105,106 or not generalizable assessment
measures of empathy-related processes,107 and we did not
include results of studies using other than “traditional
ToM tasks.”108

Previous reviews have focused on dysfunction of empathy
and related processes in patients with BPD.26,31,102,104,109–116
The major advantage of the present review relative to former
ones is the inclusion of a larger number of studies assessing a
wider range of psychological processes, using tools that help
to explain the abnormal social functioning in patients with
BPD. Furthermore, we separately reported the possible role
of comorbidities and also considered findings of neuroimaging
studies. Most previous reviews were either nonsystem-
atic26,102,104,109,110,112 or had a different scope in terms of the

addressed psychological processes.111,113–116 In particular, a
substantial number of those reviews included studies on emo-
tion recognition,31,104,112,116 and some were also devoted to
psychiatric conditions other than BPD.111,114,116

The heterogeneity of samples and assessment measures,
the different implementations of the latter, and the discrepan-
cies among concepts underlying the addressed psychological
processes correspond to limitations of this review, leading to
a practical inability to calculate valid effect sizes or to take a
meta-analytic approach. A possible strategy to deal with this
particular limitation in the future could be to develop and im-
plement research domain criteria117 as well as to use accurate,
more homogeneous, and valid neuropsychological tools to
assess empathic dysfunction in BPD.

Accordingly, no cutoffs to establish impaired empathic ca-
pacities in patients with BPD have been previously established
in the literature, apart from a value of 4.5 reported by
Morandotti and colleagues93 for the RFQ_U. It is relevant
to point out that cutoff values have been previously proposed
for tests applied to healthy subjects or in the setting of psychi-
atric conditions other than BPD. For instance, a cutoff of 30
has been proposed for the EQ in a study involving patients
with Asperger’s syndrome or high-functioning autism.49
The current absence of cutoffs for the vast majority of tests
assessing empathy or related processes represents a limitation
in conveying validated information regarding salient differ-
ences between patients with BPD and healthy control sub-
jects. Future original research studies aimed at resolving this
issue are warranted.

Another limitation was the scarce number of neuroimag-
ing studies using valid assessment measures and conditions
designed to test empathy and related processes in BPD. Most
probably, the results of these studies are not generalizable
and did not specifically confirm the involvement of brain re-
gions considered as part of the mirror neuron system in the
process of empathic dysfunction. Curiously, one study not
fulfilling inclusion criteria for this review revealed decreased
activation in brain regions belonging to that system, as well
as increased activation of the amygdala.118

Also of note is that published functional neuroimaging
studies in BPD have been diverse in terms of their designs,
paradigms, and conditions, with results that still need to be
integrated into a single, coherent picture. For instance, studies
not included in this review found increased activation of the
following regions of the brain in BPD: frontal pole, medial pre-
frontal, frontal, anterior cingulate, and temporal-parietal corti-
ces, as well as the precuneus and the superior and middle
temporal gyri.85,119,120 Similarly, resting-state BOLD fMRI
studies mostly reported decreased functional connectivity
among several brain regions in patients with BPD.121,122

Structural neuroimaging studies have also been carried out
in the setting of BPD. A widespread reduction of gray matter
volume was demonstrated by using segmentation-based
methods—including voxel-based morphometry and algo-
rithms combining either analyses of cortical surface and

250

sulci,123,124 or assessments of cortical thickness and source-
based morphometry.125,126 Regional abnormalities (e.g., in
the limbic system) were also reported.127,128 One study using
diffusion tensor imaging revealed reduced fractional anisot-
ropy of the inferior longitudinal fasciculus in adolescents,
but not in adult patients, with BPD.129

Novel work is needed to clarify the underlying neurobio-
logical mechanisms of empathy and related processes in patients
with BPD via neuroimaging studies mapping psychopathology
in combination with reliable neuropsychological assessment
measures. Furthermore, it will be relevant to explore novel strat-
egies to study neural substrates of social interaction in BPD. A
key example here is hyperscanning—the use of simultaneous be-
havioral experiments in which participants can interact with
each other while fMRI data are synchronously acquired from
different scanners. With hyperscanning, a given pattern of brain
activity can be consistently compared with the corresponding
pattern of another brain.130 This sort of strategy would be espe-
cially well suited to evaluate trust and sensitivity to rejection in
patients with BPD, given that lack of trust and an increased or
inappropriate (i.e., maladaptive) rejection sensitivity occur in
these patients, and might contribute to their pattern of abnormal
social functioning.131,132 Furthermore, hyperscanning could be
used to test the sense of belonging, acceptance, or inclusion of
patients with BPD to specific social contexts.132 Another strategy
that could provide similar advances is the “second-person neuro-
scientific approach” to study social interaction. In simple terms,
second-person neuroscience refers to studies in which there are
real-time interactions, as opposed to simply observational con-
texts (sometimes referred to as third-person neuroscience).133

Further proposed dimensions of empathy, such as the prosocial
concern,134 and novel psychophysiological assessment measures,
such as ecological momentary assessment,135,136 should also
be brought to the fore to evaluate patients with BPD. Prosocial
concern, as proposed by Zaki and Oshner,134 refers to an ad-
ditional dimension to the concept of empathy, apart from
“experience sharing” (largely related to emotional empathy)
and “mentalizing” (largely related to cognitive empathy and
ToM). By taking prosocial concern or motivation into ac-
count, it would be possible to assess how well an individual
can help another on the basis of his own resources or both
of theirs. Ecological momentary assessment involves a series
of repeated measures of behaviors or physiological processes
from participants engaging in real-life activities.135,136

In summary, a common finding in patients with BPD is
dysfunction of empathy and related processes. This seems to
contribute to their symptoms because a lack of cognitive or
emotional empathy, ToM, mentalizing, social cognition, or
emotional intelligence serves to preempt sustained social co-
operation or to prevent its repair after disruption. In addition,
enhanced emotional empathy or an excessive and inappropri-
ate awareness of patients to emotions of others may occur.
The authors postulate that such an inappropriate awareness
instability and intense personal
might lead to emotional

distress subscale of the Interpersonal Reactivity Index. This
conclusion further helps to explain the unstable interpersonal
relationships of patients with borderline personality disorder.
