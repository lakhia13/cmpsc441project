Abstract 
Background:  Antipsychotic medication can reduce psychotic symptoms and risk of relapse in people with schizo-
phrenia and related disorders, but it is not always effective and adverse effects can be significant. We know little of 
patients’ views about continuing or discontinuing antipsychotic treatment.

Aims:  To explore the views of people with schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders about continuing their antip-
sychotic medication or attempting to reduce or discontinue this medication with clinical support.

Methods:  We collected quantitative and qualitative data by conducting semi-structured interviews in London, 
UK. Factors predicting a desire to discontinue medication were explored. Content analysis of qualitative data was 
undertaken.

Results:  We interviewed 269 participants. 33% (95% CI, 27 to 39%) were content with taking long-term antipsychotic 
medication. Others reported they took it reluctantly (19%), accepted it on a temporary basis (24%) or actively disliked 
it (18%). 31% (95% CI, 25 to 37%) said they would like to try to stop medication with professional support, and 45% 
(95% CI, 39 to 51%) wanted the opportunity to reduce medication. People who wanted to discontinue had more 
negative attitudes towards the medication but were otherwise similar to other participants. Wanting to stop or reduce 
medication was motivated mainly by adverse effects and health concerns. Professional support was identified as 
potentially helpful to achieve reduction.

Conclusions:  This large study reveals that patients are commonly unhappy about the idea of taking antipsychotics 
on a continuing or life-long basis. Professional support for people who want to try to reduce or stop medication is 
valued.

Introduction
Antipsychotic  medication  is  considered  the  primary 
treatment  for  people  with  a  diagnosis  of  schizophrenia 
and  related  disorders  across  the  world  [1–4].  It  is  effec-
tive  in  reducing  acute  symptoms  [5]  and  long-term 
antipsychotic  medication  is  recommended  for  people

with  recurrent  episodes  on  the  basis  of  evidence  that 
continuous  antipsychotic  treatment  reduces  the  risk  of 
relapse  compared  to  discontinuation  [6,  7].  However, 
the  adverse  effects  of  these  drugs  are  often  serious  and 
disabling,  including  diabetes,  tardive  dyskinesia,  heart 
disease, sedation, emotional blunting, akathisia and sex-
ual dysfunction [8–13]. In addition, the beneficial effects 
of  long-term  treatment  may  have  been  over-estimated 
given that most previous studies have compared mainte-
nance antipsychotic treatment to abrupt discontinuation 
without  controlling  for  the  impact  of  withdrawal  effects 
(which are more likely following abrupt discontinuation) 
[14–17].

Studies of the long-term outcomes of naturalistic, non-
randomised  cohorts  give  conflicting  results  about  the 
benefits  of  maintenance  antipsychotic  treatment,  with 
some  suggesting  it  improves  outcomes  [18]  and  some 
reporting that people who avoid long-term treatment do 
better [19–21]. Few randomised trials have followed peo-
ple  up  for  more  than  a  few  months,  and  evidence  from 
such  studies  suggests  that  the  impact  of  discontinua-
tion lessens over time [6]. Two randomised trials report 
results  of  a  long-term  follow-up  involving  people  with 
a first episode of psychosis. One included people in sta-
ble  remission  (remission  for  6  months)  and  found  that 
gradual  antipsychotic  reduction  had  beneficial  effects 
on  social  functioning  in  the  long-term  [22].  The  other 
reported  that  a  more  abrupt  process  of  discontinuation 
had detrimental effects [23], with early psychotic relapse 
linked  to  poorer  outcomes  [24].  However,  a  composite 
outcome and inclusion of some data from the end of the 
original  trial  may  have  influenced  results,  and  no  dif-
ference  was  observed  in  symptom  levels  or  functioning 
[25]. Several authors have since discussed reasons for the 
uncertainty  of  current  evidence  on  the  implications  of 
antipsychotic discontinuation, including a lack of under-
standing of patients’ perspectives and limitations in study 
design [26]. There are no data from randomised trials of 
long-term  outcomes  following  antipsychotic  discontinu-
ation among people with recurrent episodes.

The  balance  between  the  benefits  and  harms  of  long-
term antipsychotic treatment requires careful considera-
tion, therefore. Studies that describe people’s experiences 
of  taking  antipsychotics,  highlight  both  positive  and 
negative  aspects  of  using  medication,  and  also  reveal 
the complexity of weighing up the pros and cons of drug 
treatment when making decisions about  medication use 
[11,  13,  27].  Some  patients  report  a  lack  of  involvement 
in  decisions  about  their  treatment  and,  specifically  that 
requests  to  reduce  or  discontinue  medication  are  often 
not  supported  [28,  29].  These  factors  may  be  related  to 
the  low  adherence  rates  amongst  patients  with  schizo-
phrenia  [30,  31],  which  are  linked  to  increased  risk  of 

relapse  and  rehospitalisation  [32].  These  consequences 
may  result  from  people  stopping  medication  abruptly 
without  clinical  supervision,  which  may  increase  with-
drawal-related  adverse  effects  including  ‘supersensitiv-
ity’  psychosis  and  withdrawal-induced  relapse  [33,  34]. 
Despite this, there has been little research that focuses on 
people’s  views  about  stopping  medication.  We  aimed  to 
explore the views of people with diagnoses of schizophre-
nia  and  other  psychotic  disorders  towards  taking  antip-
sychotics  on  a  long-term  basis,  and  attitudes  towards 
reducing  or  stopping  these  drugs  with  clinical  support. 
We  also  aimed  to  explore  the  characteristics  of  people 
who want to discontinue antipsychotic medication com-
pared to those who do not.

Methods
Study design

We  conducted  face-to-face  interviews  with  people  with 
a  diagnosis  of  schizophrenia  spectrum  condition  using 
a  combination  of  structured  and  open-ended  questions. 
The  study  was  also  designed  to  elicit  people’s  views  on 
taking part in an ongoing randomised trial of supported 
antipsychotic reduction [35].

Ethics statement

Ethical  approval  was  provided  by  the  East  of  Scotland 
Research Ethics Service (Research Ethics Committee ref-
erence: 15/ES/0163).

Participants

Inclusion  criteria  consisted  of:  1)  a  clinical  diagnosis  of 
schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, delusional disor-
der or other psychotic disorder (excluding bipolar disor-
der and psychotic depression) as recorded in participants 
medical notes; 2) a history of either more than one epi-
sode  of  psychosis  or  schizophrenia,  or  a  single  episode 
that  lasted  more  than  a  year,  3)  taking  antipsychotics; 
4)  being  stable  for  a  period  of  at  least  3  months  (e.g. 
not  requiring  acute  care  by  the  crisis  team  or  inpatient 
unit).  Exclusion  criteria  consisted  of;  1)  lack  of  capacity 
to consent to the research; 2) being legally compelled to 
take antipsychotic medication; 3) the potential to present 
a  serious  risk  of  harm  to  self  or  others  in  the  view  of  a 
treating  clinician;  4)  inability  to  speak  or  comprehend 
spoken English such that an interpreter is required.

Setting

Participants  were  recruited  from  community  mental 
health services and primary care practices across areas of 
London between April 2016 and August 2017.

In  both  settings,  clinical  staff  were  asked  to  iden-
tify  patients  meeting  eligibility  criteria,  as  far  as  these 
could  be  assessed  using  clinical  records  and  clinician’s

knowledge.  Clinical  staff  then  contacted  the  patients 
identified either in person or by letter. They explained the 
study  and  asked  patients  if  they  were  willing  to  be  con-
tacted  by  the  research  team  to  receive  further  informa-
tion. A researcher then contacted willing participants to 
arrange a face-to-face interview at a convenient location.

Data collection

Written  informed  consent  was  obtained  from  all  par-
ticipants  prior  to  conducting  the  interview.  Participants 
were  reimbursed  for  their  time  and  travel  expenses. 
Trained  researchers  administered  a  pre-designed  inter-
view schedule, including open and closed questions. The 
interviews were typically between 30 and 60 min in dura-
tion. Participants were given the opportunity to respond 
to an open question first and then presented with a series 
of fixed-format, mutually exclusive options and asked to 
decide  (in  discussion  with  the  researcher  if  necessary) 
which one best captured their views (see Additional file 1 
for details of questions).

The  schedule  was  developed  based  on  previous  litera-
ture  and  in  collaboration  with  a  panel  of  service  users 
and carers. Participants were also asked to complete the 
Drug Attitude Inventory (DAI) [36]. The DAI is a 10-item 
inventory that assesses attitudes towards taking medica-
tion  for  mental  health  problems  and  is  scored  between 
plus  10  (positive  attitude)  and − 10  (negative  attitude). 
Parts of the interview including the open questions were 
audio-recorded with the participant’s consent, and if con-
sent  was  not  given  to  audio-record,  written  notes  were 
made.

Analysis

We  conducted  quantitative  analyses  using  Statistical 
Package  for  Social  Sciences  (SPSS,  Version  25.0)  [37].  A 
pre-planned  analysis  was  conducted  to  explore  factors 
associated  with  wanting  to  stop  antipsychotic  medica-
tion  versus  not  wanting  to,  or  feeling  ambivalent.  The 
following  plausible  explanatory  variables  were  selected 
and explored using univariate analyses: age, gender, mari-
tal status, ethnicity, employment, duration of treatment, 
antipsychotic dose and form of antipsychotic (depot ver-
sus oral). A confirmatory logistic regression analysis was 
performed.

Qualitative  data  from  open  questions  were  analysed 
using content analysis in order to identify data that would 
help clarify responses to quantitative questions, particu-
larly  the  reasons  people  gave  for  their  responses.  Con-
tent analysis is a broad technique that aims to provide ‘a 
systematic and objective means to make valid inferences 
from  verbal,  visual,  or  written  data  in  order  to  describe 
and  quantify  specific  phenomena’  [38].  We  used  the 
‘directed approach’ as set out by Hsieh and Shannon [39] 

in  which  knowledge  from  previous  research  was  used 
to guide the initial formulation of categories. Data from 
audio-recordings  and  written  notes  were  entered  into 
NVivo software (version 11) to facilitate analysis. Initially, 
seven members of the research team listened to five ran-
domly selected interview recordings to develop an initial 
set  of  categories.  These  were  reviewed  by  the  research 
team,  refined,  and  then  a  further  five  interviews  were 
analysed using these refined categories. Categories were 
subsequently  reviewed  again  and  collapsed,  divided  or 
further refined in order to produce a set of categories that 
were  conceptually  clear,  distinct  from  each  other,  and 
were named appropriately to reflect content. These final-
ized  categories  were  used  to  analyze  the  complete  data 
set. Analysis was reviewed for accuracy by two research-
ers  (NC  and  JT),  and  the  research  team  met  regularly 
during this process to review uncertainties about how to 
categorise  data,  which  were  resolved  by  discussion  and 
consensus.

Results
Sample characteristics

People  were  screened  for  the  study  from  a  total  of  29 
clinical  teams  across  four  mental  health  organisations. 
Participants  were  also  recruited  from  18  primary  care 
practices. A total of 269 patients consented to take part. 
Characteristics  of  the  sample  are  reported  in  Table  1. 
The  mean  age  of  the  sample  was  46 years  (SD = 11.50), 
65%  (175/269)  were  male  and  52%  (137/266)  identified 
as  white  British  or  other  white  background.  Most  par-
ticipants  were  single  (67%;  176/264),  living  alone  (66%; 
174/262) and unemployed (70%; 187/266).

Nearly all participants had a diagnosis of either schizo-
phrenia (70%; 188/267) or schizoaffective disorder (18%; 
47/267). Most were recruited through secondary mental 
health  services  (85%;  228/269),  mainly  from  community 
mental  health  teams.  Fifteen  per  cent  were  recruited 
through  primary  care  services.  The  majority  of  partici-
pants had long term involvement with services, with 36% 
(95/267)  of  participants  reporting  being  in  contact  with 
mental health services for more than 20 years.

The mean length of time taking antipsychotic medica-
tions  was  16.5 years  (SD = 10.31).  Most  patients  (84%; 
222/264) were taking only one antipsychotic medication 
at the time of the interview. In total, 69% (183/265) were 
taking a second generation antipsychotic (including clo-
zapine), and 50% (133/264) were prescribed a long-acting 
antipsychotic depot injection.

a diagnoses are listed according to those given by participants, which may not have agreed with diagnoses established during screening. Therefore some people are 
included who described their condition as ‘bipolar disorder’ even though this was not an inclusion diagnosis

antipsychotic medication on a long-term basis. A further 
19  %  (51/265;  95%  CI,  15  to  25)  accepted  it  reluctantly. 
Eighteen  percent  (47/265;  95%  CI,  13  to  23)  of  partici-
pants reported that they were not satisfied taking antip-
sychotic medication long-term and another 24% (64/265; 
95%  CI,  19  to  30)  accepted  taking  it  for  the  present  but 
not necessarily forever.

When  asked  their  views  about  the  possibility  of  dis-
continuing  antipsychotic  medication  with  professional 
support  and  supervision,  almost  a  third  of  patients 
(82/266;  31%,  95%  CI,  25  to  37)  reported  that  they 
would  definitely  like  to  do  this,  with  a  further  21% 
(55/266; 95% CI, 16 to 26) reporting that they had some 
concerns  but  would  be  willing  to  try.  Twenty-one  per-
cent (57/266; 95% CI, 17 to 27) wanted to try to discon-
tinue  medication  in  the  future,  but  not  at  the  present 
moment. Twenty-five percent (66/266; 95% CI, 20 to 31) 
of patients reported that they did not want to stop their 
antipsychotic medication.

When asked how they would feel about the possibility 
of  reducing  antipsychotic  medication  with  professional 
support, almost half the participants (118/262; 45%; 95% 
CI,  39  to  51)  reported  that  they  would  definitely  like  to 
reduce their medication and 13% (35/262; 95% CI, 10 to 
18) reported that they would be willing to try to reduce. 
Fourteen  per  cent  (36/262;  95%  CI,  10  to  19)  wanted 
to  reduce  medication  in  the  future  but  not  at  present. 
Twenty one per cent (59/262; 95% CI, 18 to 28) reported 
that  they  would  not  want  to  reduce  their  antipsychotic 
medication now or in the future.

Table  2  shows  the  analysis  of  potential  predictors  of 
wanting  to  discontinue  antipsychotic  medication.  Only 
DAI  score  showed  a  statistically  significant  association 
(t(237) = − 8.30; p < 0.001), with people with more nega-
tive  attitudes  towards  taking  medication  being  more 

likely  to  want  to  discontinue.  Notably,  no  demographic 
factors,  illness  or  treatment  characteristics  were  associ-
ated with wanting to discontinue medication and neither 
was  coming  from  primary  or  secondary  care  services. 
Multivariable  analysis  (not  shown)  confirmed  that  DAI 
was the only statistically significant predictor of wanting 
to discontinue medication.

Content analysis

In  total,  interviews  from  267  participants  were  ana-
lysed  including  204  audio  recordings  and  63  written 
notes  (no  notes  were  made  for  two  of  the  unrecorded 
interviews  because  they  were  stopped  prematurely 
by  the  participant).  A  total  of  132  participants  pro-
vided  reasons  why  they  valued  or  accepted  continuing 
antipsychotic medication (Table 3). The most common 
reason  was  fear  of  relapse,  with  70%  of  the  132  par-
ticipants  citing  this.  Other  common  reasons  included 
the  view  that  antipsychotic  medication  helps  to  main-
tain stability or produce a general improvement, that it 
reduces positive symptoms, particularly hallucinations, 
the  sedative  or  calming  effects  of  antipsychotics,  and 
the reduction of other symptoms such as agitation and 
suicidal thoughts. A total of 24% of the 132 participants 
said that they took antipsychotics because doctors told 
them to take it.

A  total  of  121  participants  provided  data  on  reasons 
for  wanting  to  reduce  or  discontinue  antipsychotics.  A 
total  of  90  of  the  121  participants  (74%)  cited  concerns 
about  the  adverse  effects  of  antipsychotic  medication 
and/or  its  actual  and  potential  impact  on  their  physical 
health. The most commonly cited specific adverse effects 
included  sedative  effects,  weight  gain  and  neurological 
effects (such as shaking, twitching, stiffness, etc). Impair-
ment  of  general  functioning,  cognitive  and  emotional

capacities  and  sexual  functioning  were  also  mentioned. 
Some  respondents  felt  they  no  longer  needed  medica-
tion, and others simply disliked the idea of taking medi-
cation long-term.

A  total  of  61  participants  provided  responses  that 
described  what  they  thought  would  be  helpful  if  they 
were  to  consider  reducing  or  discontinuing  antipsy-
chotics.  Support  from  psychiatrists  and  other  profes-
sionals  was  most  commonly  mentioned.  Reducing 
medication  gradually  and  being  in  a  stable  situation 
or  having  a  ‘healthy  lifestyle’  at  the  time  of  reduction 
(e.g. being in employment or having a good diet), were 
considered important by some participants (40%; 24 of 
61).  Several  people  (16%;  10  out  of  61)  reported  that 
the aspiration to be independent or obtain employment 
was a significant motivation for trying to reduce or stop 
antipsychotics  and  might  help  them  to  reduce  or  dis-
continue medication successfully. Access to a supply of 
medication  to  take  ‘as  required,’  family  support,  psy-
chological therapy and alternative therapies were men-
tioned as being potentially useful by some participants 
(16%; 10 out of 61).

Discussion
Main findings

When  asked  about  long-term  antipsychotic  medication, 
only a third of participants in this large survey said they 
were  satisfied  taking  it,  whilst  others  reported  that  they 
took  it  reluctantly,  accepted  it  on  a  temporary  basis  or 
actively disliked it. A third said they would like to try to 
stop  medication  with  professional  support,  and  almost 
half wanted the opportunity to reduce medication. Many 

others  were  more  tentative,  but  still  wanted  to  try  and 
reduce  or  discontinue  medication,  or  said  they  would 
like to do so in the future. Apart from having more nega-
tive  attitudes  towards  medication,  which  mirrors  other 
research  on  reasons  that  people  discontinue  antipsy-
chotic  medication  [40],  no  other  characteristics  distin-
guished  those  who  wanted  to  try  and  stop  medication 
from  others  who  did  not  or  who  felt  more  ambivalent. 
The  fact  that  a  third  of  participants  were  unhappy  with 
the  idea  of  continuing  treatment  indefinitely  is  consist-
ent  with  qualitative  research,  suggesting  that  long-term 
antipsychotic  use  is  often  accepted  ambivalently  as  ‘the 
least  worst  option’  [11,  13,  29],  and  with  quantitative 
research  that  found  that  27%  of  patients  with  schizo-
phrenia felt their medication had done “more harm than 
good” [12].

The main reason people valued long-term antipsychotic 
treatment  was  for  preventing  relapse.  Other  reasons 
included reduction of positive symptoms, but people also 
valued antipsychotics for their sedating properties, which 
contrasts with the official purpose of the medication, but 
reflects first person accounts reported in qualitative stud-
ies [11, 13]. Some people reported taking antipsychotics 
simply  because  their  doctor  told  them  to.  Wanting  to 
stop  or  reduce  medication  was  motivated  by  concerns 
about adverse effects, particularly sedative effects, neuro-
logical effects and weight gain, and concerns about antip-
sychotics’  effects  on  physical  health  and  functioning, 
consistent  with  other  research  on  people’s  views  about 
antipsychotic  medication  [11,  13,  41–43].  Some  people 
felt they no longer needed medication or were curious to 
know  whether  they  could  manage  without  it,  which  has

also  been  found  in  research  on  reasons  for  non-adher-
ence [41, 44]. Support from healthcare professionals was 
identified as being helpful in attempting to reduce or dis-
continue antipsychotic medication, as was gradual reduc-
tion (cited by 25% of patients). This coincides with recent 
literature  on  the  importance  of  gradual  tapering  when 
reducing  or  stopping  antipsychotic  medication  to  mini-
mise the risk of relapse [45]. Wanting to be independent 
was  regarded  as  an  important  motivation  for  trying  to 
reduce or stop medication.

Strengths and limitations

With 269 participants, the current study is the largest 
survey  of  what  people  think  about  continuing  or  dis-
continuing antipsychotic medication. The sample was 
recruited from clinical services, but responses are not 
necessarily  generalizable  to  the  general  population  of 
patients who fulfil the eligibility criteria. Although we 
attempted to make selection as systematic as possible 
by screening clinical caseloads, inevitably clinical staff 
influenced  who  was  put  forward.  This  is  also  likely 
since  the  study  was  linked  to  a  future  randomised 
trial  of  antipsychotic  reduction.  People  who  consent 
to  take  part  in  research  may  be  more  adherent  and 
accepting of treatment than other patients [46]; on the 
other  hand,  the  current  study  may  have  appealed  to 
people with more negative views about taking antipsy-
chotic medication. Although not all interviewers were 
connected to the planned trial, some were, and hence 
were  likely  to  be  committed  to  the  principle  that 
antipsychotic  reduction  is  a  viable  treatment  option. 
This may have influenced the manner in which ques-
tions were presented.

People  with  long  histories  of  medication  use  and  ser-
vice  contact  made  up  the  majority  of  the  sample,  which 
may  also  have  biased  responses  towards  more  accept-
ance of medication. This might also account for the rela-
tively high proportion of patients taking first generation 
antipsychotics  within  this  study.  Therefore,  we  are  not 
able to produce estimates of the overall rates of different 
attitudes  among  our  target  population,  and  people  with 
shorter histories are particularly under-represented. The 
analysis of associations with wanting to discontinue med-
ication  could  potentially  have  involved  many  explana-
tory variables and been subject to false positive findings. 
However,  the  negative  association  between  wanting  to 
discontinue and general attitudes towards antipsychotics 
is highly plausible.

Content  analysis  allows  a  large  amount  of  qualita-
tive  data  to  be  converted  into  numerical  form,  but  cat-
egorisation of responses inevitably obscures some of the 
nuances  and  complexity  of  the  original  responses  and 
does not provide the depth of thematic analysis.

Interpretation and implications

Qualitative research shows how people who take antipsy-
chotics engage in a sophisticated process of weighing up 
the pros and cons of treatment based on a variety of con-
siderations including how the drugs influence symptoms 
and their impact on quality of life and ability to function 
[13,  29].  In  line  with  previous  studies  [29],  our  results 
suggest  that  many  people  take  antipsychotic  medication 
reluctantly either because they fear the consequences of 
stopping  or  because  they  accept  what  their  doctor  tells 
them  to  do.  Although  the  majority  do  not  actively  want 
to  change  their  treatment,  a  significant  minority  would 
like  the  opportunity  to  try  and  reduce  or  discontinue 
antipsychotic  medication  with  professional  support. 
They  are  often  motivated  by  the  experience  of  adverse 
effects  and  reasonable  concerns  about  their  physical 
health.  Yet,  as  other  research  indicates,  patients  often 
report that they lack the opportunity to make collabora-
tive decisions about taking antipsychotic medication, and 
support  to  try  to  reduce  or  discontinue  this  medication 
is rarely available [28, 29]. Clinicians can be reluctant to 
help people reduce or discontinue antipsychotic medica-
tion  because  they  are  focused  on  risk,  and  lack  training 
and official guidance on how best to do this [47]. This is 
a  concern  since  patients  may  sense  this  reluctance,  and 
may  reduce  or  stop  medication  without  sharing  this 
with  their  psychiatrists  [28].  If  done  abruptly,  this  may 
increase  the  risk  of  relapse  and  significant  withdrawal 
effects [14, 33].

Mental health services need to support informed deci-
sion-making and patient choice, and to this end services 
should  provide  support  for  patients  who  wish  to  try  to 
reduce or discontinue antipsychotics. However, there is a 
need for guidance on the best approach; current evidence 
suggests any reduction should be gradual and individual-
ised to each patient to minimize risk of relapse [45, 48]. 
Routine  discussions  with  long-term  patients  may  reveal 
people who are dissatisfied with their current treatment 
for a variety of understandable reasons that are important 
to  explore.  Some  people  who  stop  medication  abruptly 
and potentially dangerously on their own might cooper-
ate with a planned strategy of supervised reduction con-
ducted in collaboration with their psychiatrist. Yet other 
patients may wish to switch to a different medication to 
lessen the impact of specific adverse effects [49].

Further  research  is  required  to  clarify  what  patients 
want  and  how  it  might  best  be  offered  within  mental 
health services. More research is required on people who 
have a shorter history, and qualitative work could help to 
explore patient attitudes in more depth including across 
different  sub-groups  (e.g.  ethnicity).  Identifying  the  best 
ways  to  support  people  who  wish  to  discontinue  antip-
sychotics  is  important  to  alleviate  the  risks  involved.

Previous  studies  of  services  or  novel  interventions  that 
aim to minimise antipsychotic use, or encourage greater 
user  choice  about  medication  may  provide  pointers 
towards interventions that are evidenced-based and help-
ful  when  people  are  reducing  and  stopping  medication 
[50–52].

Conclusion
Many  patients  diagnosed  with  schizophrenia  or  related 
disorders  from  community  mental  health  services  are 
unhappy  about  the  idea  of  taking  medication  on  a  con-
tinuing or life-long basis, and would like to try reducing 
or  discontinuing  their  medication  at  some  point.  Pro-
fessional  support  was  identified  as  important  in  achiev-
ing  this.  Guidance  on  how  to  support  people  to  make 
informed decisions about long-term antipsychotic treat-
ment,  and  to  reduce  or  discontinue  if  they  wish,  would 
increase the options that are available to patients who are 
taking long-term antipsychotics.
