Abstract

Objective—To examine the association between neonatal jaundice and autism spectrum disorder 
(ASD) and non-ASD developmental disorder (DD).

Study design—We analyzed data from the Study to Explore Early Development, a US multisite, 
case-control study conducted from 2007 to 2011. Developmental assessment classified children 
aged 2–5 years into: ASD (n= 636), DD (n= 777), or controls (POP; n= 926). Neonatal jaundice 
(n= 1054) was identified from medical records and maternal interviews. We examined associations 
between neonatal jaundice and ASD and DD using regression models to obtain adjusted odds 
ratios (aOR).

Results—Our results showed interaction between gestational age and neonatal jaundice. 
Neonatal jaundice was associated with ASD at 35–37 weeks (aOR = 1.83, 95%CI 1.05, 3.19), but 
not ≥38 weeks gestation (aOR = 0.97, 95%CI 0.76, 1.24). Similar results were observed with DD.

Conclusions—Further exploration of timing and severity of neonatal jaundice and ASD/DD is 
warranted.

patterns of behaviors, interests, or activities [1]. In 2012, the prevalence of ASD in the 
United States was estimated to be 1 in 68 children aged 8 years [2]. ASD is a heterogeneous 
disorder, and its etiology is suspected to involve both genetic and environmental factors [3, 
4]. While environmental factors associated with ASD are not well understood, previous 
studies have implicated several exposures in the perinatal period [5–7].

Jaundice, a yellow discoloration of the skin and the sclera of the eyes, occurs in about half of 
newborn infants and most preterm infants (<37 weeks gestational age) usually as a result of 
increased serum levels of unconjugated bilirubin (unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia) from 
the breakdown of fetal hemoglobin after birth [8]. While jaundice typically resolves without 
treatment in the first week of life [9], bilirubin can cross the blood–brain barrier and at high 
concentrations may have toxic effects on the developing brain [10–12]. Unconjugated 
hyperbilirubinemia in the neonatal period has been associated with intellectual disability, 
cerebral palsy, and brain dysfunction in children [10, 13]. Further, clinical manifestations of 
bilirubin-induced neurologic dysfunction include several impairments in communication 
similar to ASD [14].

Some studies have reported an association between neonatal jaundice or hyperbilirubinemia 
and ASD, [8, 15–18] while others have reported no association [19, 20]. Inconsistent results 
may be partly due to methodological differences in data collection and classification of 
jaundice. Although jaundice occurs more frequently among infants born preterm [21] and 
the risk of ASD increases as gestational age decreases among preterm infants [22], previous 
studies have not assessed for interaction between jaundice and gestational age in association 
with ASD. To address limitations of previous studies, we analyzed data from the Study to 
Explore Early Development (SEED), a US multisite case-control study with extensive data 
from the perinatal period, to investigate the association between neonatal jaundice and ASD.

Methods

Study population

SEED is a multisite case-control study of children with ASD, children with developmental 
delays or disorders other than ASD (DD), and children sampled from the general population 
(POP) [23]. At the time of enrollment, children resided in one of six study catchment areas 
(California, Colorado, Georgia, Maryland, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania). The children 
were required to be 30 through 68 months of age at the time of in-person assessment and 
living with a knowledgeable caregiver who spoke English (or Spanish in California and 
Colorado) and who was at least 18 years of age and able to provide legal consent.

Compliance with ethical standards

Institutional review boards at each site approved study protocols and informed consent 
forms. Informed consent was obtained for each participant. All procedures performed in this 
study involving human participants were in accordance with the ethical standards of the 
institutional review boards.

Data collection

Page 3

Details on the SEED data collection protocol are provided elsewhere [22]. Briefly, SEED 
collected detailed data on maternal reproductive health and pregnancy outcomes through a 
telephone interview, abstraction of prenatal, neonatal, and pediatric medical records, and 
linkage with birth certificates. Data on child health outcomes as well as on their 
development and behaviors were obtained through telephone interviews and in-person child 
developmental assessment, as described below.

Outcome assessment

We used the Social Communication Questionnaire (SCQ) [24] to screen all children for 
autism symptoms during the invitation phone call. Children who screened positive for 
possible ASD (SCQ score >11), had a previous ASD diagnosis, or were suspected to have 
ASD based on the study clinician’s direct observation, were given a more extensive 
developmental assessment. The more extensive assessment included clinical observation of 
the child using the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) [25] and a structured 
interview administered to their caregivers, the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-
R) [26]. As these tools are considered the ‘gold standard,’ final ASD classification was 
based on the results from these two developmental assessments regardless of previous 
diagnoses [27].

Children suspected to have ASD but screened negative on the SCQ or did not meet ADOS 
and ADI-R criteria for ASD were classified as DD. Children with DD who had some ASD 
characteristics or did not complete the clinic visit to obtain a final ASD classification were 
excluded from this analysis. Children who screened negative on the SCQ and were sampled 
from birth records were classified as POP.

Study clinicians administered the Mullen Scales of Early Learning to all children to assess 
general development. The early learning composite standard score was used to identify 
children with ASD and intellectual disability (ID; score <70) or ASD without ID (score ≥70) 
[28]. The DD group consisted of children with a broad range of developmental disorders 
other than ASD, and was further restricted to exclude children with ASD characteristics 
[27]. More detail about the SEED outcome assessment is available elsewhere [23, 27].

Ascertainment of neonatal jaundice

Information on neonatal jaundice was obtained from the maternal interview, the neonatal 
medical record, and the first 28 days of pediatric medical records. The infant was classified 
as having neonatal jaundice if a diagnosis or treatment for jaundice was recorded in the 
medical record or through maternal interview. Treatment for neonatal jaundice included 
phototherapy (bili light or blanket) or, in severe cases, exchange transfusion. We classified 
neonatal jaundice as: (1) treated, if treatment for neonatal jaundice was reported in either the 
medical record or maternal interview, (2) definite, if a diagnosis of hyperbilirubinemia was 
available in the medical record, but treatment was not reported, (3) possible, if neonatal 
jaundice was reported only through maternal interview, or (4) no neonatal jaundice, if no 
report of jaundice or jaundice treatment was in the medical record or maternal interview.

Indicator variables were created for these mutually exclusive categories with a referent 
group of no neonatal jaundice.

Covariates

Covariates were derived from prenatal and neonatal medical records, birth certificates, and 
maternal interviews. We carefully considered infant race/ethnicity because differences in 
jaundice diagnosis can be affected by skin tone. Infant race/ethnicity was classified by 
combining maternal and paternal race as reported on the maternal interview, or from the 
birth certificate if missing from maternal interview. If both parents identified as Hispanic, 
the infant was classified as Hispanic, regardless of reported parental race. Among non-
Hispanics, when parents were the same race, the infant was classified by the parent’s race as 
White non-Hispanic (referent), Black non-Hispanic, or Other (primarily Asian, but those 
identifying as Pacific Islander or Native Hawaiian, or Native American, Alaskan Native, or 
American Indian). An infant was classified as Multiracial if the parents were of different 
races or ethnicities.

Gestational age was classified according to clinical practice guidelines from the American 
Academy of Pediatrics [29] for assessing neonatal jaundice: 35–37 completed weeks of 
gestation, or ≥38 completed weeks of gestation. Gestational age was also modeled as a 
continuous variable in some analyses.

Statistical analyses

We used multivariable logistic regression models to estimate odds ratios (OR) and 95% 
confidence intervals (CIs) for the association between neonatal jaundice and both ASD (vs. 
POP) and DD (vs. POP), adjusting for all confounders (aOR). We identified potential 
confounders through a thorough literature review and used a directed acyclic graph to 
determine a minimally sufficient set of confounders to obtain the least biased estimates of 
association [30]. Models included maternal age at conception (<20 years, 20–34 years 
(referent), ≥35 years), education at delivery (high school degree or less vs. some college or 
more), parity (nulliparous (referent), primiparous, multiparous), diabetes in pregnancy (yes 
vs. no), and infant sex (male vs. female), and race/ethnicity (White non-Hispanic (referent), 
Black non-Hispanic, Hispanic, Other, and Multiracial). A study site indicator was included 
for California, Colorado, Maryland, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania (referent: Georgia).

We tested the assumption of homogeneity of the association across strata of gestational age 
by including interaction terms for gestational age with neonatal jaundice in the model and 
evaluating significance at α < 0.05. Furthermore, we also assessed whether there were any 
differences in the association between neonatal jaundice and ASD with and without ID to 
evaluate the potential for these phenotypes to be etiologically distinct. We evaluated this 
association across strata of gestational age and among subcategories of neonatal jaundice. 
Analyses were conducted using SAS statistical software, version 9.3 (SAS Institute Inc., 
Cary, NC).

Results

SEED recruited 3769 participants. For this study, we restricted analyses to the 2339 mother–
child pairs born ≥35 weeks gestation who had data available on neonatal complications and 
had a final outcome classification of ASD, DD, or POP (Fig. 1). We excluded mother–child 
pairs enrolled in SEED due to missing data on neonatal jaundice (n= 502), were <35 weeks 
gestation (n= 222), or because they had a developmental disorder with some characteristics 
of ASD but insufficient to meet diagnostic criteria most likely due to an incomplete clinic 
visit (n= 706). Compared with the analytic sample, children in the excluded subset were 
more likely to be White, non-Hispanic and less likely to have a mother who attained a higher 
education. In our sample, 1054 infants (45.1%) had neonatal jaundice based on the maternal 
interview or medical records. Of these, we classified 42.9% with treated jaundice, 35.1% 
with definite jaundice, and 22.0% with possible jaundice (Fig. 1).

Our analysis was comprised of 636 children with ASD, 777 children with a non-ASD DD, 
and 926 POP children. Compared with POP, children with ASD and those with DD had a 
higher proportion of older and less educated mothers, multiple births, earlier gestational age, 
and males (Table 1). Children with neonatal jaundice (ASD, DD, and POP combined) had a 
higher proportion of older mothers, mothers with diabetes in pregnancy, and earlier 
gestational age, compared with those without jaundice.

The association between any neonatal jaundice and both ASD and DD varied across strata of 
gestational age, with significant p-values for the interaction term across any neonatal 
jaundice (ASD p= 0.031; DD p=≤ 0.001) and subgroups; thus all results are presented by 
strata of gestational age to improve model fit (Table 2). Neonatal jaundice was associated 
with higher odds of ASD and DD, but only among children born 35–37 weeks gestation 
(Table 2). For children born 35–37 weeks, the association was stronger with DD (aOR = 
3.34 [95%CI 1.99, 5.61]) than with ASD (aOR =1.84 [95%CI 1.06, 3.20]). Jaundice was not 
associated with ASD or DD among those born ≥38 weeks gestation. In separate models we 
further adjusted for gestational age as a continuous measure to account for any possible 
residual confounding; while this subtly altered some estimates, it did not change our 
interpretation of results.

We evaluated three subcategories of neonatal jaundice and refined ASD subtypes (Table 2). 
Among those with treated jaundice, confidence intervals were above the null in the 35–37 
weeks stratum for ASD (aOR = 2.33 [95%CI 1.19, 4.55]) and for DD (aOR = 4.27 [95%CI 
2.30, 7.93]). Estimates were attenuated for definite and possible jaundice and both ASD and 
DD in the 35–37 weeks stratum. Jaundice was not associated with ASD or DD among 
infants born ≥38 weeks gestation in any subcategories. Associations were also present for 
both ASD with ID and ASD without ID in the 35–37 weeks stratum (Table 3). Effect 
estimates in this stratum were higher among those with treated jaundice compared with 
those with any neonatal jaundice, however, while the confidence intervals were above the 
null for treated jaundice and both ASD with ID (aOR = 2.29 [95%CI 1.01, 4.96]) and ASD 
without ID (aOR = 2.73 [95%CI 1.13, 6.60], the confidence intervals were also wider.

Discussion

Page 6

Our results show an association between neonatal jaundice and both ASD and DD among 
infants born preterm. The association with both ASD and DD suggests jaundice may be 
associated with neurodevelopment generally, and not specifically related to ASD. Effect 
estimates were most precise for any neonatal jaundice as statistical power was limited in 
smaller subgroups. We observed no association between neonatal jaundice and either ASD 
or DD among infants born ≥38 weeks gestation.

In our study, the magnitude of the association between jaundice and ASD or DD among 
preterm infants varied according to the jaundice definition. The treated and definite jaundice 
subcategories were most strongly associated with ASD or DD, while we observed weak or 
no associations with possible jaundice, which was defined by maternal report of jaundice 
only. The possible jaundice group may have higher potential for misclassification because 
the diagnosis was not confirmed in the medical record and the condition was presumably not 
severe enough to warrant treatment. In addition, data on the severity or length of 
hyperbilirubinemia were not available, and criteria for hyperbilirubinemia diagnosis in the 
medical record may have differed across the sample due to the introduction of new 
guidelines by the American Academy of Pediatrics in 2004 [29].

To our knowledge, our study is the first to account for interaction between gestational age 
and jaundice and to provide stratum-specific effect estimates by gestational age; prior 
studies restricted their analyses to term infants or adjusted for preterm birth as a confounder. 
The health of infants with jaundice, especially preterm infants with jaundice, can be more 
complex than for term infants with no signs of jaundice. There may be several unknown or 
unmeasured factors that commonly co-occur with jaundice in preterm infants that may 
contribute to brain development, which include other perinatal and neonatal complications 
and how such complications are treated or managed. However, our study did not have 
sufficient sample size to assess confounding or moderation by rare complications, for 
example infection. Thus, the potential for uncontrolled confounding needs further 
exploration.

We were also not able to assess if there was any participation bias in the study, as we could 
not determine the eligibility of all families we attempted to recruit because SEED could not 
obtain any data from targeted, but unreached or unrecruited, participants from multiple 
sources. One site had more data available to assess the generalizability of their sample. This 
assessment found response to be related to maternal age, education, and race/ ethnicity, but 
unrelated to available pregnancy and health variables. Accordingly, all analyses include 
adjustment for maternal age, maternal education, and infant race/ethnicity.

Our results were consistent with some previous studies [16, 17, 31, 32], but not with others 
[8, 19, 20, 33]. Inconsistencies between our results and prior studies may be due to 
differences in how ASD was ascertained or defined and adjustment of confounding. Most 
previous studies relied on ICD-9 codes or insurance databases that may reflect treatment 
codes that are not necessarily consistent with a final diagnosis [8, 16, 19, 32, 33]. Our 
analysis is unique in that information on neonatal jaundice was collected through medical

record and maternal report. SEED confirmed ASD through in-person evaluation, thus 
reducing the potential for outcome misclassification. Additional evaluation of children with 
DD also provides some insight that jaundice may be associated with development more 
generally rather than specifically associated with ASD.

Conclusion

We observed associations between neonatal jaundice and both ASD and DD among infants 
born 35–37 weeks gestation, but not among infants born ≥38 weeks gestation. These 
findings support results from some previous studies suggesting that preterm infants with 
jaundice may be at higher risk of adverse outcomes as compared with term infants. Our 
analysis did not have sufficient sample size to appropriately study bilirubin measurements or 
those born <35 weeks gestation, but plans to do so in future phases of the study. Future 
studies of neurodevelopment should explore the complexity of other neonatal conditions that 
accompany jaundice, and treatment profiles for jaundice, especially among preterm infants. 
In addition, monitoring children with jaundice or other early risk factors associated with 
ASD and developmental disabilities may lead to earlier diagnosis and treatment.
