Abstract
In the face of a global epidemic of drug addiction, neglecting to develop new effective therapies will perpetuate the stagger-
ing human and economic costs of substance use. This review aims to summarize and evaluate the preclinical and clinical 
studies of deep brain stimulation (DBS) as a novel therapy for refractory addiction, in hopes to engage and inform future 
research in this promising novel treatment avenue. An electronic database search (MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane library) 
was performed using keywords and predefined inclusion criteria between 1974 and 6/18/2021 (registered on Open Science 
Registry). Selected articles were reviewed in full text and key details were summarized and analyzed to understand DBS’ 
therapeutic potential and possible mechanisms of action. The search yielded 25 animal and 22 human studies. Animal stud-
ies showed that DBS of targets such as nucleus accumbens (NAc), insula, and subthalamic nucleus reduces drug use and 
seeking. All human studies were case series/reports (level 4/5 evidence), mostly targeting the NAc with generally positive 
outcomes. From the limited evidence in the literature, DBS, particularly of the NAc, appears to be a reasonable last resort 
option for refractory addictive disorders. We propose that future research in objective electrophysiological (e.g., local field 
potentials) and neurochemical (e.g., extracellular dopamine levels) biomarkers would assist monitoring the progress of treat-
ment and developing a closed-loop DBS system. Preclinical literature also highlighted the prefrontal cortex as a promising 
DBS target, which should be explored in human research.

Introduction

Addictive  substances  pose  significant  socioeconomic 
impact  on  society  and  the  healthcare  system,  costing 
hundreds of billion dollars annually in the USA alone [1, 
2]. Psychological and adjunctive pharmacological treat-
ments are the current mainstay for addiction therapeutics. 

However, the risk of relapse remains high, with some cit-
ing relapse rates as high as 75 to 98% within 1 year of 
treatment [3]. Investigations into new treatment modali-
ties are urgently warranted. To develop novel therapies 
for addiction, researchers are focusing on the behavioral 
and neuroscience aspects in the biopsychosocial model 
(Fig.  1).  Deep  brain  stimulation  (DBS)  in  particular  is

a neuroscience-based potential treatment for medically 
refractory addictive disorders, given its diminishing sur-
gical risks. “Medically refractory” cases have no formal 
definition, although these are generally regarded when con-
ventional treatments repeatedly fail [4].

Recent advances in neuromodulation techniques and 
devices led the indication of DBS to include movement 
disorders, such as Parkinson’s disease, to neuropsychiat-
ric conditions, such as depression, Tourette’s syndrome, 
and obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) [5–8]. The use 
of DBS to reduce substance use has also been explored 
in both preclinical and clinical settings [9–12], offering a 
beacon of hope to patients suffering from medically refrac-
tory addictive disorders. This review aims to summarize 
and evaluate the potential therapeutic efficacy, mechanisms 
of action, and biomarkers involved in the use of DBS in 
the treatment of addictive disorders. We cautiously report 
that DBS is promising to treat certain refractory addictive 
disorders. Recommendations for the future directions are 
also provided.

Addiction Neurobiology: a Brief Overview

Addiction is a highly complex process involving multiple 
neurochemicals and brain structures. A highly simplified 
model highlights the central role of dopamine in mediat-
ing drug reward learning and drug seeking (compulsive) 
behaviors (Fig. 2). In essence, addictive drugs, such as the 
psychostimulants and opioids, enhance synaptic concentra-
tions of dopamine in forebrain subcortical structures, such 
as the nucleus accumbens (NAc) [13]. These drugs of abuse 
significantly enhance dopamine concentrations over and 
above the ability of natural rewards, hijacking the system

dopamine receptors  D1-R and  D2-R is shown in inset.  D1-R mediates

acid 

and encoding a more biologically salient reward association 
with surrounding environmental cues [13]. Such Pavlovian 
drug-environmental conditioning can trigger the desire to 
seek more of the drug. For example, the drug associated cues 
can elicit a surge of dopamine, which may manifest in drug 
craving, seeking and ultimately use [14].

Serotonin (5-HT) is another important neurotransmitter 
mediating neuroplasticity, hedonic tone, motivational, and 
reinforcement processes, as well as cognitive functions [15, 
16]. 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors in the prefrontal cortex 
(PFC), NAc, and ventral tegmental area in particular appear 
to be critical. 5-HT2A receptor increases, and 5-HT2C recep-
tor decreases, striatal dopamine release [15]. The seroton-
ergic neuroadaptations may be accountable for emotional 
components such as anhedonia and depression during drug 
withdrawal [16]. Recent evidence in mice also suggest that 
serotonin signaling via 5-HT1B receptor may attenuate tran-
sition from casual to compulsive cocaine use [17].

Chronic drug use ultimately alters the homeostatic neuro-
plasticity in the brain which not only results in a sensitized 
dopaminergic system [18], but also leads to changes in the 
glutamatergic system [13, 19, 20]. For example, calcium-
permeable ionotropic glutamatergic AMPA receptors become 
upregulated relative to glutamatergic NMDA receptors [13, 
19, 20]. The changes in AMPA and NMDA receptors have

become a hallmark process of neuroplasticity that underpins 
behavioral changes following chronic drug use [21]. Another 
neurobiological adaptation that occurs with chronic drug use is 
the process of “dorsalization” [22]. Here, repeated exposure to 
drugs of abuse leads to recruitment of the circuit that projects 
from the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) to the dorsal striatum (cau-
date and putamen), where synaptic potentiation occurs at both 
dopamine receptors 1 and 2  (D1-R and  D2-R) on GABAergic 
medium spiny neurons (MSNs).

Activation of  D1-Rs receptors causes excitation in the post-
synaptic cell via cyclic adenosine monophosphate production 
(cAMP) production [23] that ultimately leads to promotion 
of  long-term  potentiation  [24].   D1-R-  and  NMDA  recep-
tor–dependent activation of extracellular signal-regulated 
kinase (ERK) in brain areas such as striatum is an important 
pathway for drug-induced locomotor response and sensitiza-
tion [25–28]. For example, systemic injection of  D1-R- or 
NMDA antagonist prevents ERK phosphorylation triggered 
by d-amphetamine in the mouse striatum [29]. In addition, 
cocaine-induced ERK phosphorylation and locomotor sensi-
tization is prevented with mitogen-activated protein kinases/
ERK kinase inhibitor or in mutant mice with alanine-replaced 
Thr-34 residue of dopamine- and cAMP-regulated phospho-
protein (DARPP-32) [29].  D1-R MSN structural plasticity 
depends on NMDA and DARPP-32 signaling [24]. Psycho-
stimulants appear to affect ERK signaling via DARPP-32-
based  D1-R- and NMDA intracellular pathways [29].

Importantly,  D1-R activation inhibits long-term depres-
sion, as revealed by  D1-R antagonist unmasking long-term 
depression [30]. In contrast,  D2-Rs can promote long-term 
depression and prevent the induction of long-term poten-
tiation [30]. However,  D2-Rs are particularly sensitive to 
dips in the tonic dopamine level, during which they activate 
protein kinase A (PKA) to induce long-term potentiation 
[30–32]. Taken together,  D1-R and  D2-R are critical for bidi-
rectional plasticity of striatal MSNs when dopamine levels 
are high vs low to guide adaptive and maladaptive behav-
iors involved in reward learning [31, 32]. Therefore,  D1-R 
and  D2-R signaling dynamically modulates cortico-striatal 
plasticity depending on the level of synaptic dopamine to 
facilitate transition into persistent drug seeking and use.

While DBS appears to target these processes involved in 
addiction to reduce drug seeking and taking [10, 33–37], 
the potential therapeutic efficacy and mechanisms of action 
of DBS in the treatment of addictive disorders are poorly 
understood. We address this gap in the present review.

Methods

A search was performed using keywords, such as “deep brain 
stimulation” and “addiction” in MEDLINE, EMBASE, and 
Cochrane Library database between 1974 and 6/18/2021. 

Details of search criteria and inclusion and exclusion criteria 
are given in Supplementary Information Appendix A. Search 
results are presented in a Preferred Reporting Items for Sys-
tematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) flow chart 
(Fig. 3). This review was registered at the Open Science 
Framework [38]. The process yielded 47 papers (25 pre-
clinical studies and 22 human studies), which were further 
reviewed in full text. The results of this literature search are 
summarized in the sections below.

Results and Discussion

Preclinical Models and Clinical Correlation

Animal DBS studies in the selected literature (Table 1) 
predominantly used conditioned place preference (CPP) or 
self-administration paradigms (Fig. 4) to model addiction. 
Self-administration models have high construct, content, and 
face validity relative to human addictive behaviors. Exper-
imenter-administration models such as CPP can measure 
drug-induced behavioral sensitization, such as increased 
locomotion, and are easier to perform. Both models also 
allow modeling of withdrawal symptoms during abstinence 
and/or extinction phase, followed by relapse behaviors, such 
as cue or drug-induced reinstatement. Most common DBS 
brain targets in the selected animal studies (Table 1) were the 
NAc [33, 39–45], PFC [44, 46, 47], and subthalamic nucleus 
(STN) [10, 37]. The following sections will focus on these 
three most studied targets.

NAc Electrical Stimulation

The NAc is divided into core and shell subregions with dif-
ferent histopathological compositions, projections, and func-
tions [48]. Studies suggest that the shell is responsible for 
reinforcing properties of novelty, rewards (both drug- and 
non-drug-related), and drug relapse, whereas the core medi-
ates spatial learning, conditioned responses, responses to 
motivational stimuli, and impulsive choices [14, 49]. These 
features of motivated behaviors suggest NAc shell under-
lying extinction and reinstatement behavior [50], and NAc 
core underlying the initial acquisition of drug taking and 
cue-elicited drug seeking [48]. However, there is synergy 
between the two subnuclei, and both play a role in drug 
addiction.

Stimulation of either the core or shell subregions of the 
NAc using a range of low and high frequencies leads to 
reduced drug taking, seeking, or CPP in rats conditioned 
with alcohol [34, 51, 52], nicotine [53], opioids [9, 37, 39, 
41, 46, 54–57], cocaine [10, 33, 35, 40, 42, 43, 47, 58, 59], 
or methamphetamine [45] (Table 1). Behavioral improve-
ment was related to the timing of when electrical stimulation

was given—that is, stimulation given before a self-adminis-
tration session or CPP acquisition would reduce drug intake 
or prevent CPP, respectively [39, 45]. When given during 
abstinence or reinstatement, stimulation would diminish 
drug or cue-induced drug seeking after extinction and/or 
forced abstinence phase [40–43, 45]. Such efficacy of stimu-
lation during abstinence to prevent relapse is particularly 
promising in the clinical context.

While most animal and human studies (Table 2) show 
success in modulating addictive behavior using NAc stimu-
lation, there are two main issues. First, there is conflicting 

evidence in animal studies regarding the efficacy of NAc 
core vs shell stimulation. Both high- and low-frequency 
stimulation (HFS, LFS) of NAc (electrodes placed across 
core and shell) can reduce cocaine-primed drug seeking fol-
lowing 24 days of abstinence [43]. Other studies using core 
as the DBS target showed reduced morphine-induced CPP 
[39], ethanol self-administration [51], and heroin reinstate-
ment [41]. The shell was also shown to be an effective tar-
get for morphine-induced CPP [55], cocaine reinstatement 
[40], ethanol self-administration [44, 51, 52], and metham-
phetamine reinstatement [45]. In contrast, Vassoler et al.

J. Yuen et al.

demonstrated that stimulation of the NAc shell but not the 
core attenuated cocaine-induced reinstatement [42].

The contradicting evidence above may be explained by 
the large activation volume of stimulation pulses, such that 
pulses centered on the core may also affect the shell, and 
vice versa. From human studies, the volume of activation 
was estimated to be between 30 and 120  mm3 [60] and the 
human NAc volume is around 700  mm3 [61]. However, 
for adult Sprague–Dawley rats, the total volume of NAc is 
approximately 5  mm3 with the NAc core making up half 
of that [62]. Therefore, neighboring structures could be 
co-stimulated in rats. Notably, the core and shell divide is 
functionally present in humans while they are less distinct 
in rodents [63, 64].

The second issue concerns laterality. While most studies 
used bilateral stimulation, some studies only used unilateral 
NAc stimulation [34, 39, 41, 43]. One study used left, right, 
and bilateral NAc core stimulation, demonstrating only the 
latter two were effective in reducing heroin seeking behavior 
[41]. It is unclear why such asymmetry exists. Dopamine 
concentration in the NAc is reported to be higher on the side 
ipsilateral to the paw-dominance of a mouse [65]; however, 
morphometric NAc human studies based on laterality have 
been controversial [49].

Almost all of these published studies in humans show 
some  improvement  from  DBS  in  the  NAc  in  addiction-
related behaviors (Table 2) as well as cognitive improvement, 
which raises the possibility of potential publication bias. 
With this precaution in mind, NAc DBS is likely the low-
est hanging fruit for refractory addictive disorders. A recent 
systematic review supports NAc DBS to treat substance 
use disorders, demonstrating that NAc DBS in patients led 
to a relapse rate of ~ 39% with a reasonable safety profile, 
which is an improvement compared to the ~ 60% relapse rate 
reported in that population (selection bias factors notwith-
standing) [66]. In addition, individual case reports revealed 
that  those  with  comorbid  psychiatric  disorders,  such  as 
depression and OCD, showed improvement in these other 
symptoms with NAc DBS with or without anterior limb of 
internal capsule (ALIC) intervention (DBS or capsulotomy) 
[12, 67, 68]. DBS may provide additional benefit for patients 
with multiple psychiatric comorbidities.

Cortical Stimulation

The PFC is believed to provide top-down control of NAc 
in addiction (Fig. 2). DBS of the PFC (subregion not speci-
fied) significantly reduced cocaine seeking and motivation 
to take cocaine measured by progressive ratio test [35]. 
Stimulation of the infralimbic cortex of the PFC following 
a cocaine prime also reduced cocaine reinstatement [47]. 
Notably, mPFC stimulation in rats showed increased phasic 

dopamine release in the NAc, which might explain the stim-
ulation effect [69]. However, stimulation of the infralimbic 
cortex starting 1 h or 4 days before alcohol prime did not 
affect alcohol-induced relapse following abstinence in rats 
[44]. The contrasting findings may be due to the different 
mechanisms of actions of the drugs being given (alcohol is 
a depressant whereas cocaine is a stimulant). Alternatively, 
infralimbic cortex stimulation may be more effective in 
reducing relapse-like behaviors following extinction rather 
than forced abstinence, consistent with the well-known role 
of the infralimbic cortex in extinction [70]. Infralimbic cor-
tical DBS success is concordant with reduced craving by 
transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) of dorsolat-
eral PFC in humans [71]. However, DBS of the prelimbic 
cortex following cocaine priming had no effect on cocaine 
reinstatement in rats [47].

In the OFC, DBS prevented rats from learning morphine-
induced CPP, while DBS during extinction facilitated extinc-
tion acquisition and prevented morphine-induced reinstate-
ment [9]. Chronic DBS of the anterior insular cortex either 
during 11 days of extinction or 14 days of abstinence reduced 
CPP, but CPP relapsed 10 days after chronic DBS [57]. This 
finding is consistent with how repetitive transcranial mag-
netic stimulation (rTMS) reduced heavy drinking only dur-
ing the intervention but not after in alcohol-dependents [72]. 
The insula’s superficial location and delicate anatomy may 
be better suited for non-invasive interventions such as rTMS 
rather than DBS.

Anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) dysfunction can disrupt 
ongoing processing and detection of erroneous outcomes 
relevant for reward learning [73, 74]. ACC DBS following 
cocaine prime did not alter reinstatement following self-
administration in rats [47]. However, when people with 
alcohol dependence received bilateral DBS (6- or 10-Hz 
stimulation), craving was significantly reduced [75]. The 
reduced craving was associated with a reduction in beta-1 
band (13–18 Hz) current density on electroencephalogram 
(EEG) post-stimulation in the rostrodorsal ACC [75]. Alco-
hol craving also correlated with beta activity in the dorsal 
ACC in a case report, although relapse was associated with 
increased gamma band activity [76]. Another case report 
showed that a patient with concomitant OCD and alcohol 
dependence was successfully treated with ACC rTMS [77]. 
Interestingly, NAc DBS reduced craving correlated with 
improvement in error-related negativity in LFP in the ACC 
in humans [78], suggesting the effect of NAc DBS may alle-
viate ACC dysfunction. In addition to DBS, rTMS of the 
dorsal ACC demonstrated improvement in alcohol craving 
and concomitantly reduced NAc activation on fMRI [76]. 
Taken together, DBS in ACC may be particularly relevant 
for alcohol use.

Most of these cortical regions project to the NAc, rais-
ing  the  possibility  that  their  DBS  effects  are  mediated

via these connections [49, 79]. Animal studies show not 
only strong projections from the cortex to NAc, but also a 
high degree of interplay between the two regions [80]. For 
example, c-Fos reactivity is observed in infralimbic cortex 
and NAc during DBS [42, 56] Pharmacological silencing 
of cortical interneurons can reinstate drug seeking [42, 81], 
which is consistent with silencing effects observed in the 
NAc [81]. Nevertheless, NAc is unlikely to be the sole 
driver of effects of DBS in the PFC considering that DBS 
in the prelimbic cortex does not affect drug seeking in rats, 
even though prelimbic cortex has strong connections to 
NAc [47].

STN Stimulation

Parkinson’s patients who take dopaminergic medications for 
their movement disorder may chronically feel compulsion to 
over-consume such agents, even at the expense of dyskine-
sia and other side effects. Studies suggest that STN DBS in 
humans may improve movement symptoms as well as reduce 
compulsive use of medications [82, 83].

STN DBS or lesions in rats have been shown to reduce 
motivation for cocaine taking, while increasing motivation 
to consume more common rewards such as food [10, 37, 59, 
84]. The lesion study in particular suggests that STN DBS 
may work via local inactivation [59, 84]. Further evidence 
shows STN HFS in rats inhibiting substantia nigra, entope-
duncular nucleus, and NAc shell measured with brain map-
ping analyses of immediate-early gene expression but not 
PFC, and silencing STN neurons measured using recording 
ex vivo [37].

Although HFS of STN in rats reduced both cocaine tak-
ing and heroin seeking [37, 59], a conflicting study demon-
strated only LFS (30 Hz) but not HFS modulates cocaine 
taking behavior in the presence of foot-shock punishment 
[10]. Abnormal alpha/theta and low-beta oscillatory activ-
ity during escalation of the cocaine intake phase also pre-
dicted the subsequent emergence of compulsive-like seeking 
behavior, where the animals were shock-resistant [10]. The 
discrepancy here may be explained by the absence/presence 
of punishment during drug taking, but further studies are 
warranted to understand STN LFS vs HFS outcomes.

Other Brain Regions

Electrical stimulation targeting other brain regions in ani-
mals—amygdala [47, 85], hippocampus [47], periaqueductal 
gray matter [54], lateral hypothalamus [35], dorsal striatum 
[40, 44], and lateral habenula [58]—has also been described 
in the literature (Table 1). However, due to the limited num-
ber of studies per brain region, meaningful conclusions are 
difficult to draw. Hence, these regions are beyond the scope 
of this review.

Fig. 4   Illustration  of  two  most  widely  used  experimental  para-
digms  for  the  study  of  drug  addiction  in  animals.  On  the  left,  con-
ditioned  place  preference  (CPP)  is  shown,  where  “non-contingent” 
drug-administration  is  associated  with  one  side  of  the  chamber  dur-
ing  drug-side  associated  conditioning.  If  the  drug  is  experienced  as 
rewarding, the animal will spend more time in the drug-administered 
side  relative  to  the  other  side,  even  in  the  absence  of  further  drug 
administration.  On  the  right,  “contingent”  drug  self-administration 
paradigm allows the animal to regulate its own drug intake (e.g., via 
nose-poke or lever-pressing). A discrete light and/or tone cue may be 
provided in association with the drug intake to serve as a drug-associ-
ated cue. In extinction, the animal is placed back into the environment 
where CPP or self-administration is acquired but without drug avail-
ability.  Extinction  sessions  lead  to  reduced  place  preference  or  drug 
seeking.  During  reinstatement,  the  drug,  the  drug-associated  cue, 
and/or stress can be given, which can lead to “relapse” measured by 
preference or drug seeking. Created with Biorender.com

High‑ Versus Low‑Frequency Stimulations

Whereas  most  animal  studies  reported  HFS  (> 130  Hz) 
effects on behavior, some used a lower frequency (< 20 Hz) 
and observed beneficial effects targeting the NAc [43], lat-
eral habernula [58], ventral striatum [56], and periaque-
ductal gray [54] even at frequencies as low as 8 Hz (STN) 
[10] (Table 1). In contrast, LFS targeting the NAc shell [33], 
PFC [35], or OFC [9] were ineffective. Interestingly, DBS 
at 12 Hz alone did not affect cocaine-induced locomotor 
sensitization, but combined with dopamine  D1-R antagonist, 
reversed cocaine-induced hyperlocomotion and plasticity in 
the NAc shell [33]. Such findings suggest that LFS may be 
effective only when basal dopamine signaling is low.

The effect of HFS in NAc shell may be short-lived, lasting 
less than 4 h in a cocaine experimenter-administered mouse 
model [33] or 1 day in an alcohol self-administration rat model 
[34]. However, reduction in cue-induced seeking behavior was 
maintained more than 4 weeks post-HFS (NAc shell) com-
pared to the sham group in rats that self-administered meth-
amphetamine [45]. Yet, LFS and HFS (mixture of NAc core 
and shell) effects lasted at least 2 weeks but less than 30 days 
in a cocaine self-administration rat model [43]. The different 
DBS parameters, targets, drugs, rodents, and tests across these 
studies (Table 1) pose a challenge to evaluate the best DBS 
protocol to reduce drug use.

Potential Mechanism(s) of Action

Neuronal Inhibition

Despite  the  promising  results  of  DBS  in  addiction,  the 
mechanism of action is poorly understood and likely highly 
complicated. Several hypotheses on the mechanism of DBS 
in addiction have been suggested, such as direct inhibition/
excitation  of  neural  activity,  information  lesioning,  and 
synaptic filtering where DBS blocks transmission of patho-
logical low-frequency oscillations [86]. In particular, the 
inhibition hypothesis is supported by animal studies where 
both injection of GABA agonists (i.e., temporary inhibition) 
and HFS in the NAc was found to reduce alcohol use in 
rats [34]. Similar effects were also seen between STN lesion 
paradigms and DBS with cocaine conditioning [59, 84]. It 
is likely the neurons and their respective synaptic activities 
respond in a combination of different ways depending on the 
stimulation frequency and the drug being tested.

Depotentiation of Excitatory Inputs onto  D1‑R Via 
Modulation of Glutamate Receptors

Evidence also suggests the interaction between dopamine 
and glutamate receptors is involved in the mechanism of 
DBS action. For example, NAc shell LFS (12 Hz), only 
when used in combination with a  D1-R antagonist, could 
reverse the motor sensitization and cocaine-evoked plastic-
ity changes in  D1-Rs on GABAergic MSNs, in the form of 
increases AMPA/NMDA glutamate receptor ratio [33]. By 
using a metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR1) antago-
nist to block the therapeutic effect, the authors proposed that 
the mechanism of action of DBS is mGluR-dependent, the 
activation of which depotentiates excitatory synaptic inputs 
onto  D1-Rs on GABAergic MSNs [33]. Such depotentiation 
was associated with a normalization in drug-adaptive behav-
ior. The findings are also consistent with the upregulation of 
GluR1 seen in the NAc in other stimulation studies [35, 36].
In contrast, both LFS (20 Hz) and HFS (160 Hz) stimula-
tion of the NAc core attenuated cocaine seeking behavior in 
rats without the need of additional medications [43], similar 
to the outcome of PFC stimulation [35]. The contrasting 
findings between NAc core and PFC stimulations may be 
explained by the different levels of basal dopamine in these 
brain regions. Examining how DBS affects mGluR1 expres-
sion in different regions to affect  D1-R signaling would be 
informative in future work.

Antidromic Activation of Cortex

Post-mortem brain c-Fos immunohistochemistry following 
in vivo NAc shell HFS showed both local activation and 
activation of the infralimbic cortex, suggesting that DBS of 

J. Yuen et al.

the NAc shell led to antidromic stimulation of the cortex via 
cortico-accumbal afferents [42]. Consistent with infralimbic 
cortex-NAc circuitry in DBS, electrophysiological studies 
showed NAc HFS but not LFS enhances both NAc-evoked 
LFP responses and spontaneous LFP slow oscillatory activ-
ity in OFC in an antidromic fashion [87]. These results fur-
ther demonstrate the complex interplay between NAc and 
the cortex.

Dopamine Replacement

One study showed that HFS of the NAc shell led to a para-
doxical augmentation in relapse behavior in a rat model of 
alcohol addiction [44], a contrary finding to other studies 
(Table 1). The authors also demonstrated an increase in 
extracellular levels of dopamine as measured by microdialy-
sis. DBS-evoked increase in dopamine is reminiscent of the 
intracranial self-stimulation model, where the subjects self-
administer electrical stimulation via implanted electrodes in 
the brain [88]. Reinforcing effects of electrical stimulation 
is presumably mediated by dopamine release in the reward 
circuitry [89]. In addition, medial PFC DBS evoked dopa-
mine release in the NAc in a frequency-dependent manner 
in anesthetized rats measured by fast-scan cyclic voltamme-
try (FSCV) [69]. Taken together, DBS of PFC may operate 
partially via the replacement of dopamine, but whether this 
can reduce drug taking or seeking has yet been tested. Most 
of the DBS studies did not employ in vivo microdialysis 
techniques for direct quantification; hence, replacement of 
dopamine as a DBS mechanism is unconfirmed.

Limitations of Animal Models

Human subjects tend to require weeks and months of DBS 
to observe an improvement, whereas animal studies show an 
almost immediate effect. In animal studies, the condition-
ing occurs over days (rather than years). The short time-
frame indicates that the neuroplasticity reversal may not be 
the dominating effect of DBS in animals and the dopamine 
replacement caused by stimulation may mediate the acute 
improvement in behavior. In humans, DBS likely operates 
via reversal of neuroadaptations that have been built up on a 
much longer time scale than animals subjected to condition-
ing. This interpretation is supported by case reports where 
subsequent explantation of the DBS device did not reverse 
the initial effect of abstinence [90, 91]. In addition, a fur-
ther case report showed that NAc DBS reduced risk taking 
behavior and increased activation of brain regions implicated 
in behavioral control arising from lasting neuroadaptations, 
measured by positron-emission tomography [92].

Some human studies also include subjects with comorbid 
OCD, depression, and anxiety [12, 93, 94]. In fact, addiction 
may be part of a maladaptive coping mechanism for other

underlying disease/s. DBS may alleviate addiction by reduc-
ing the severity of an underlying comorbid disease, which 
is challenging to model in animals. For example, the higher 
cognitive and emotional component as well as the impact of 
social cues are difficult to assess in animals.

tailored to maximize therapeutic efficacy while minimizing 
side effects. Nonetheless, a recent systematic review showed 
that NAc DBS has similar efficacy and safety profile as radi-
ofrequency ablation of the NAc [66].

Alternatives to DBS

Given the invasive nature of DBS, other neuromodulatory 
modalities  are  worth  considering.  Of  note,  noninvasive 
techniques such as rTMS and tDCS have been of particu-
lar interest [95, 96]. A detailed review of these techniques 
and outcomes is out of the scope of this article but in brief, 
rTMS operates by applying a stimulating coil at the scalp, 
which generates magnetic fields. The magnetic fields then 
pass through the skull and induce strong focal currents in the 
underlying brain tissues [97]. It is believed that long-term 
repetitive stimulation can lead to neuroplasticity, which can 
provide therapeutic effect to the addicted brain [97]. tDCS 
involves application of a direct or alternative electrical cur-
rent to the scalp, such that current travels from a positive 
(cathode) to a negative (anode) electrode. Cortical neurons 
are suggested to be facilitated under the anode, whereas 
those under the cathode are suppressed [98]. Although rTMS 
and tDCS have been shown to be effective in preclinical 
studies and small clinical case series on reducing symptoms 
such as craving, more data are required to ascertain their 
long-term safety profiles, efficacy, and the ideal patient pro-
file [98–100]. Although research shows that non-invasive 
neuromodulation can be successful in certain cases with-
out the need for neurosurgery, the main limitations are the 
focality of these non-invasive treatments and the relatively 
low spatial resolution. These non-invasive interventions also 
require numerous frequent visits to facilities in a specialized, 
tertiary center. In contrast, DBS can be implanted as a per-
manent or chronic stimulation system, which can potentially 
be programmed remotely [101].

There was a recent success of semi-invasive MRI-guided 
focused ultrasound (MRgFUS) thalamotomy in the treat-
ment of movement disorders and other psychiatric disorders 
(depression and OCD) [102, 103]. Such a technique would 
avoid the complications associated with the implantation of 
devices, which may necessitate explantation for reasons such 
as lack of efficacy or infection. Alongside DBS, MRgFUS 
offers a novel therapeutic avenue that should be explored to 
treat refractory addictive disorders.

Invasive techniques can offer a more focal region of ther-
apy. Ablation techniques in drug addiction targeting the NAc 
with promising results have long received attention [104]. 
Indeed, a recent systematic review showed that NAc DBS 
has similar efficacy and safety profile as radiofrequency 
ablation of the NAc [66]. Compared to ablation techniques, 
however, DBS allows adjustment of stimulation parameters 

Future Directions

Potential Biomarkers

The hunt for a reliable biomarker serves three critical pur-
poses: to facilitate patient selection, to monitor the progress 
of the disease (and therapeutic effect of treatments), and 
to progress towards a holy grail of DBS—a closed-loop 
therapeutic system. Not only can this potentially increase 
the battery longevity (hence reducing the need for battery 
replacement), it also can increase the efficacy of stimula-
tion by tailoring to the patients’ neural responses. Further, a 
“tolerance” effect can be observed with chronic open-loop 
DBS stimulation in movement disorder patients, with the 
stimulation effect wearing off after a period of time [105]. 
Such a tolerance is also likely in patients receiving DBS to 
treat psychiatric illnesses. Closed-loop system with inter-
mittent, dynamic stimulation can potentially minimize tol-
erance. Such biomarkers need to be easy to measure and 
possess a relatively high spatiotemporal resolution of meas-
urement that, in turn, correlates well with clinical/behavio-
ral changes. In our opinion, the most promising candidates 
would be electrophysiological and neurochemical measure-
ments, although they will need to be tailored towards indi-
vidual addictive substances and patients.

In terms of electrophysiological measurements, LFP is 
the most widely studied potential biomarker among DBS 
studies. LFP’s wide use is mostly because of its measure-
ment using the stimulating electrodes themselves. In ure-
thane-anesthetized rats, NAc HFS suppressed pyramidal cell 
firing and enhanced slow LFP oscillations in the OFC via 
antidromic activation of cortico-striatal recurrent inhibition 
[87]. In addition, prolonged NAc HFS and LFS (delivered 
over 90 min) have been shown to affect both spontaneous 
and evoked LFPs in the medial PFC, lateral OFC, mediodor-
sal thalamus (MD), and NAc sites [106]. HFS also produced 
widespread increases in spontaneous beta and gamma power 
and enhanced coherent beta activity between MD and all 
other regions. In contrast, LFS elevated theta power in the 
MD and NAc. Acutely, HFS increased and LFS decreased 
induced relative gamma coherence. Stimulation-induced 
changes in gamma coherence shows that NAc DBS may 
achieve therapeutic effects by restoring the synchronicity 
of a neural circuitry that is disrupted in neuropsychiatric 
diseases. The differences in the effect on LFPs between 
HFS and LFS may also explain the differences in behavioral 
effects described above.

J. Yuen et al.

In a study assessing 7 people with heroin use disorder, 
pre-DBS electrophysiology revealed prominent theta and 
alpha band activity in both the NAc and ALIC [107]. Addi-
tionally, a beta band peak was detected in the power spec-
tra of ALIC LFPs, which, the authors hypothesized, may 
represent the activity of striatal bridge cells. Furthermore, 
there was a negative correlation between the power of the 
theta band of ALIC LFPs and subjective craving, and a 
positive correlation between the power of the alpha band of 
NAc LFPs and depressive symptoms. LFPs of the NAc and 
ALIC both exhibited higher coherence values in the theta 
and alpha frequency bands. No comparison with post-DBS 
recordings was given in this study. Together with the animal 
and human DBS studies on NAc [108, 109], the most con-
sistent biomarker frequency is yet unknown. Further studies 
are required for clarification. New technologies such as the 
Medtronic Percept Stimulator [110] may be able to provide 
more information by simultaneously recording from and 
stimulating brain targets in humans. In addition, trials inves-
tigating electrophysiological changes secondary to DBS in 
addiction (such as [111]) will provide more insights.

Unlike electrophysiological signals (i.e., action poten-
tials) that naturally lead to neurotransmitter release into 
synapses, quantification of synaptic-related neurotransmit-
ter extracellular concentrations directly measures the activa-
tion of relevant neural circuits (such as the ones depicted in 
Fig. 2). Most studies in addiction focus on the monoamines, 
particularly dopamine, glutamate, and 5-HT. One animal 
study reviewed here [44] employed in vivo microdialysis 
and found that local dopamine concentrations increased after 
NAc shell HFS. While in vivo microdialysis has long been 
the gold standard for sampling neurochemicals, the process 
necessitates an external analyzer and has low temporal reso-
lution. In contrast, in vivo electrochemical techniques, such 
as FSCV, provide potential benefits such as higher temporal 
resolution, less tissue damage, and the ability to be chroni-
cally implanted [112–116]. However, compared to micro-
dialysis, electrochemical techniques have other limitations. 
Often, they are restricted to measurement of a single electro-
active amine at a time, such as dopamine or serotonin. Thus, 
future studies which aim to develop biomarkers for DBS 
efficacy will need to demonstrate suitability of neurochemi-
cal biomarkers for translation and may be limited by present 
detection technology. While microdialysis provides impor-
tant measurements of the tonic (basal) extracellular levels 
of neurochemicals, voltammetry can provide measurement 
of phasic and tonic measures of neurochemicals [117–122].

Future Preclinical and Clinical Research Considerations

Other important considerations for future research include 
inclusion of both genders in both animal and human stud-
ies (currently most studies focus on males—see Tables 1  

and 2), and the use of larger animals—preclinical studies 
are predominantly rodent-based, but also well suited to large 
animal models. In addition, we have focused on technologies 
that are currently clinically viable in this review, namely 
electrical DBS devices. However, the use of optogenetics, 
where a viral vector is able to transfect a specific neural 
population, is increasingly popular in the preclinical study 
of underlying pathophysiology of different neuropsychiatric 
disorders and relevant therapies. Optogenetics has provided 
new insights into DBS protocol optimization for Parkinson’s 
disease with translational potential [123, 124], which may 
be extended to psychiatric illnesses. In addition, recent opti-
cal imaging techniques allow combination of fiber photom-
etry and electrophysiology to study specific cell population 
activity via genetically encoded calcium indicators, includ-
ing during deep brain stimulation [125, 126]. Cell-specific 
viral transfection in calcium imaging or optogenetics helps 
to study specific ion channels or neurotransmitters. How-
ever, the use of viruses in humans is very limited. Further 
technological advancements are necessary to harness optical 
methods in the clinical setting.

Currently, the use of DBS in addiction remains off-label, 
primarily due to the lack of high-quality clinical evidence. 
As seen in Table 2, most human studies consist of observa-
tional studies with a small sample size. However, more clini-
cal trials are currently being conducted. The ClinicalTrials.
gov database show that there are currently around 10 DBS 
trials underway trying to tackle this paucity of scientific evi-
dence, targeting the NAc, ALIC, and STN [127]. As dem-
onstrated in the present review, they are all very promising 
targets. In addition, we would add PFC to this list given the 
success from animal studies [47] as well as human imaging 
studies showing its dysfunction in subjects with substance 
use disorder [128].

Supporting the potential of DBS in alleviating addic-
tion-related behaviors, DBS to treat obesity has also shown 
early successes [129–131]. Given the similarities between 
substance use disorders and obesity, the findings in DBS 
for substance use disorder presented so far may be translat-
able to DBS for obesity. With the increasing prevalence and 
comorbidities associated with excessive calorie consumption 
in the modern society, this can be hugely beneficial.

While it is exciting to perform cutting-edge patient sur-
geries, it is also important to recognize that DBS is not 
an immediate cure and requires careful patient selection, 
consent, and patient-based optimization (including treating 
other comorbidities); otherwise, DBS can lead to a risk of 
major adverse outcomes [132]. DBS also has cost, transla-
tional, and capacity limitations for a highly prevalent disor-
der, but has the advantage of elucidating fundamental neural 
biology capable of detecting new therapeutic targets.

In our literature search, all human studies that involve 
stimulation of deep structures were conducted exclusively 

1 3Deep Brain Stimulation for Addictive Disorders—Where Are We Now?

1211

with high-frequency stimulation, as commonly used in DBS 
for movement disorders (see Table 2). Therefore, future 
work to compare how stimulation at different frequencies 
may affect the biomarkers such as LFP in humans would 
be beneficial.

The duration of trials may also be important. One of the 
possible reasons attributed to the failure of early trials in 
DBS for depression is the short treatment duration, as trials 
with longer duration appeared to show significant efficacy 
[6, 133–135]. DBS duration effects will need to be assessed 
in larger clinical trials. Further, for neuropsychiatric condi-
tions such as addiction, careful consideration of the ethical 
aspect is required.

Ethical Considerations

Although DBS is much safer than early forms of psychosur-
gery such as lobotomy, it is not a risk-free treatment [136]. 
Therefore, clinicians are obliged to always have the patients’ 
best interest in their mind. The risks and benefits of the treat-
ment need to be balanced appropriately. One of the main 
issues with human trials is the principle of autonomy, as 
patients with addictive disorders may not have the capacity 
to consent to such process. Furthermore, there are concerns 
that DBS (and indeed any forms of psychosurgery) may alter 
a patient’s personality, which can lead to actions and con-
sequences that may otherwise not be performed [137–139]. 
Academic societies and government institutions should also 
provide a medico-legal framework to ensure both medical 
professionals and patients are protected. A full ethical dis-
cussion is out of the scope of this review. Nevertheless, we 
recommend that the clinical team be multidisciplinary, with 
access to the resources and expertise to assess and manage 
the patients before and after the DBS surgery.

Conclusions

Preclinical and clinical studies suggest DBS is a potential 
treatment for refractory addictive disorders after other non-
invasive options fail. Here, we reviewed these studies and 
their implications. However, given the uncertainty in its 
mechanism of action and a lack of large scale randomized 
controlled trials, clinicians and scientists should be cau-
tiously optimistic. We also provided recommendations on 
the directions of future research, such as the need to iden-
tify reliable biomarkers, for which LFPs in the NAc and 
in vivo electrochemical measurement of monoamines so far 
appear the most promising options. With further research, 
we believe it can prove to be a highly effective treatment for 
a selected group of patients.
