Summary

Background: Chronic tinnitus is a commonly occurring symptom of the auditory system. Epidemiological studies assume a life-
time prevalence in men and women of 3.5% for chronic tinnitus requiring treatment. Almost 25% of all Germans have experi-
enced at least one episode of tinnitus. No causal therapy is yet available, but numerous treatment strategies are being pursued. 
Rigorous scientific assessment of these procedures is essential. 

Methods: For this exhaustive revision of the German clinical practice guideline, the literature in the medical databases PubMed 
and Cochrane Library, including existing guidelines from various countries, was systematically searched using keywords on the 
topic of chronic tinnitus. On the basis of the revised guideline, a separate guideline was written in language accessible to 
 patients.

Results: Chronic tinnitus is often associated with hearing loss, but the mental distress caused by the ear noise is another crucial 
element. Apart from expert counseling, the recommended treatment comprises psychotherapeutic interventions, particularly 
cognitive behavioral therapy (with effect sizes of 0.54 to 0.91 for reduction of the tinnitus-related distress), and measures to 
 improve the hearing. There is insufficient evidence regarding the effects of drug treatment, sound and music therapy, and 
 neuromodulation (magnetic stimulation or electrostimulation).

Conclusion: Alongside thorough and sound diagnosis and counseling, the principal treatment options for chronic tinnitus are 
specific cognitive behavioral therapy and expert psychotherapeutic interventions on an individual or group basis. Future—prefer-
ably interdisciplinary—research should evaluate the long-term effects of the treatment options, with particular attention to psy-
chosomatic comorbidity.

T innitus  is  a  very  frequent  symptom  of  impaired 

auditory  processing. According  to  epidemiological 
studies in Europe and the USA, around a quarter of 
all people have experienced at least one episode. Around 
10  to  15%  of  persons  are  affected  by  tinnitus  over  an 
 extended  period.  Women  and  men  are  affected  almost 
equally,  and  the  prevalence  increases  at  advanced  age 
(> 65 years).  The  main  risk  factors  are  noise  exposure, 
hearing loss, and mental stressors. However, only 3 to 5% 
are deemed to require treatment. Of these, half are seri-
ously  affected,  impairing  their  ability  to  conduct  and 
 organize their lives (1, 2, e1, e2). The actual distress (3) 
arises essentially from comorbidities (Box 1, Box 2), but 
also from the degree of hearing loss (4–6).

The distress is measured using validated question-
naires such as the Tinnitus Questionnaire (TQ) or its 
short form (Mini-TQ) according to Goebel and Hiller 
the  German-language  Tinnitus  Impairment 
(e5), 

Questionnaire according to Greimel (TBF12), or the 
Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI), or with the Tinni-
tus  Functional  Index  (TFI).  Treatment  should  be 
based  on  differential  diagnostic  considerations 
 regarding  the  causative  factors  and  concomitant 
symptoms. To date, however, no causal therapy able 
to ’’switch off“ tinnitus has been discovered (7).

At  the  same  time,  numerous  procedures  and  drug 
treatments  have  been  tested  in  consumer  observa-
tional studies, some of them scientifically evaluated, 
and in case studies and randomized trials (RCT). The 
empirical  evidence  for  many  of  these  approaches  is, 
however,  weak  (8).  This  is  directly  relevant  for  the 
updated  German  clinical  practice  guideline  on 
chronic tinnitus (9) developed under the guidance of 
the German Society of Oto-Rhino-Laryngology, Head 
and Neck Surgery. The guideline provides physicians, 
therapists, and also patients with an overview of the

scientific evidence regarding the diagnosis and treat-
ment of chronic tinnitus, with particular reference to 
novel  procedures  that  are  currently  in  evaluation. 
Decision making in affected persons is supported by 
an additional patient-centered guideline intelligible to 
the lay person (10).

Methods
The methods for the development of the current guide-
line comply with the regulations of the Association of 
the Scientific Medical Societies in Germany (AWMF) 
and  were  based  on  a  systematic  literature  search  in 
PubMed  and  the  Cochrane  Library  from  2014  to  31 
 December 2020. The starting point for the update was 
the  guideline  of  2014.  Newly  identified  studies  were 
added to the tables.

Based on an extensive literature search and the evi-
dence  tables  derived  therefrom,  recommendations 
 regarding  mandatory  and  supplementary  diagnostic 
procedures  for chronic tinnitus  were  established and 
consensus  was  reached.  Data  on  health  benefits, 
 adverse  effects,  and  risks  were  systematically  col-
lected and were considered in the formulation of the 
recommendations  (for  a  detailed  description  of 
methods see the eMethods). 

Results
Based  on  a  treatment  algorithm  established  for  the 
guideline (Figure), the following sections evaluate the 
diagnostic  procedures  and  therapeutic  approaches  and 
assess the evidence.

Diagnosis
In addition to otorhinolaryngological examination with 
otomicroscopy  of  the  tympanum,  the  basic  work-up 
 includes complete audiometric assessment (sound and 
speech  audiometry,  measurement  of  impedance)  and 
evaluation  of  the  tinnitus.  As  an  objective  measure, 
brain-stem  audiometry  (BERA)  is  recommended  for 
the exclusion of retrocochlear lesions such as the a very 
rare (1/100 000) vestibular schwannoma, for which tin-
nitus is almost always one of the first symptoms. Also 
recommended as an objective measure is the recording 
of  otoacoustic  emissions  (TEOAE  and/or  DPOAE)  to 
assess the functioning of the outer hair cells of the inner 
ear. This should be completed by basic examinations of 
the vestibular organ to detect spontaneous or provoca-
tion nystagmus and basic manual examinations of the 
masticatory  apparatus  and  the  cervical  spine.  Supple-
mentary  diagnostic  procedures  should  be  guided  indi-
vidually  by  the  case  history  and  the  findings  of  the 
basic assessment. Tinnitus distress is measured by vali-
dated  questionnaires  (TQ,  Mini-TQ,  TBF12).  In  the 
most  commonly  used TQ  (Mini-TQ),  a  score  of  0–30 
(0–7)  represents  a  mild  impairment,  31–46  (8–12)  a 
moderate impairment, 47–59 (13–18) a severe impair-
ment, and 60–84 (19–24) the highest degree of impair-
ment (e5). 

Treatment
The guideline provides recommendations for the treat-
ment  of  chronic  tinnitus  persisting  for  more  than  3 
months. For the treatment of acute tinnitus, particularly 
in association with or as a consequence of sudden hear-
ing loss, the guideline on hearing loss (11) recommends 
systemic or intratympanic cortisone therapy.

Counseling and education
The  starting  point  of  every  therapeutic  intervention 
should be the counseling and education of the patient, 
based  on  comprehensive  diagnostic  assessment.  The 
goal  of  tinnitus  counseling  is  a  psychoeducational 
 explanation  of  the  symptoms  and  the  description  of 
coping  strategies  to  reduce  fear  and  also  to  dampen 
 excessive  expectations  of  cure.  Counseling  provides 
the  basis  for  the  development  of  constructive  habitu-
ation  mechanisms  and  helps  to  avoid  negative,  self-
 reinforcing loops in the generation of tinnitus (12, 13). 
Particularly  important  is  the  message  that  effective 
therapeutic options do exist, even if the tinnitus cannot 
be  directly  “switched  off.”.  In  many  persons  tinnitus 
disappears spontaneously without therapeutic interven-
tion; however no studies exist and no precise percent -
ages can be cited because a large number of such cases 
are  not  registered.  Patients  should,  in  particular,  be 
 advised of the self-help options (14).

Interventions for hearing loss
As  tinnitus  is  associated  with  hardness  of  hearing  in 
more than 90% of cases (8, e1), the use of devices in the 
treatment of hearing loss plays an important role and is 
therefore  recommended.  Regarding  the  efficacy  of 
hearing aids for the treatment of tinnitus, the evidence 
strength  of  the  studies  published  is  only  moderate  or 
weak. This is mainly because only a small number of 
studies have been published investigating the efficacy 
of hearing aids specifically for the treatment of chronic 
tinnitus.  Therefore,  evidence  cannot  be  reached  even 
though  clinical  expertise  suggests  that  hearing  aids 
 increase tinnitus suppression and habituation. In a large 
RCT,  adjustment  of  hearing  aids  was  found  to  be 
 associated with amelioration of tinnitus by at least 20% 
in  more  than  70%  of  cases.  Hearing  aids  were  com-
pared  with  devices  combining  hearing  amplification 
and  noise-generating  functions  (15).  Similar  results 
were  found  in  a  smaller  study  comparing  high-
 compression  hearing  aids  with  normal  hearing  aids. 
Clinically relevant improvement was observed in 67 to 
82%  of  patients,  depending  on  the  method  employed 
(16).  Good  hearing  aid  provision  requires  intensive 
counseling  and  monitoring  of  patients,  however,  as 
shown by an American study of 133 hearing-impaired 
patients with tinnitus (17).

Better evidence exists for the treatment of severely 
hearing  impaired  and  deaf  tinnitus  patients  with  a 
cochlear  implant,  even  if  the  deafness  is  unilateral. 
However,  the  prevalence  of  such  extensive  hearing 
loss is, at 1.6%, much lower (e6). In a recent review 
(two RCTs and four prospective case–control studies 
with 136 patients overall), significant reduction of tin-
nitus  suppression  was  achieved  (average  improve-
ment  of  THI  score  11.66 points,  95%  confidence 
 interval [17.65; 5.67]) (18). Renewed onset of tinnitus 
following  implantation  is  possible  in  0  to  10%  of 
cases,  but  it  is  unclear  whether  this  effect  is 
 attributable  to  the  implantation  or  appears  sponta-
neously. Generally, a large number of studies show a 
positive and also age-independent effect (e7, e8).

Hearing  therapy,  in  which  strategies  are  taught  to 
distract  attention  away  from  the  tinnitus  sound,  can 
support these effects, increase the acceptance of hear-
ing aids and promote tinnitus habituation (19); how-
ever, this assessment is based on a single systematic 
review comprising 10 studies with just moderate (2a) 
evidence (20).

Noise generators (hearing aids that just emit a faint 
broadband noise) should not be recommended for tin-
nitus. A scoping review of 87 studies did not demon-
strate efficacy (21).

Behavioral therapy and psychodynamic methods
Numerous  studies  show  evidence  for  the  efficacy  of 
 behavioral  therapy  interventions  compared  with  both 
waiting-list  control  groups  and  active  control  groups 
for relief of tinnitus distress. Efficacy has been demon-
strated for the various forms of behavioral therapy, with 
no significant differences between the forms of admin-

found significant improvements in the THI score, with 
an  average  increase  of  10.9 points.  According  to  an 
older Cochrane Review (e9) the effect size lay between 
0.54 and 0.91, according to the new review it was 0.56

Causal treatment

If tinnitus persists

habituation  provide  an  important  basis  for  the  treat-
ment of patients with chronic tinnitus, particularly if 
comorbidities that are evoked by tinnitus or reinforce 
tinnitus  lead  to  significant  distress.  These  treatment 
programs  are  administered  on  an  outpatient  or  inpa-
tient basis and are recommended with high evidence 
in  the  guideline.  While  the  level  of  evidence  for 
is  high,  for  psychodynamic 
 behavioral 
methods—in 
psychology 
 approaches—no  randomized  studies  exist,  and  their 
effectiveness  is  at  best  indicated  by  catamnesis 
studies  (e10).  Prerequisites  are  the  suitability  of 
 patients  for  such  methods  and  their  willingness  to 
subscribe to the therapy and the underlying model. In 
the case of habituation as a consequence of a specific, 

the  main

depth 

cognitive  learning  process  of  the  brain,  the  noise  in 
the ear still exists but is perceived to a lesser degree or 
not at all in the absence of active focus on the tinnitus.

Tinnitus retraining therapy
 Tinnitus retraining therapy (TRT) is a habituation tech-
nique  intended  to  lessen  the  auditory,  emotional,  and 
autonomous  impact  of  the  tinnitus  noise  and  thereby 
 reduce the stress response to the tinnitus stimulus (23). 
After  a  detailed  tinnitus  history,  distraction  from  the 
tinnitus is achieved by broadband noise delivered via a 
tinnitus device (noise generator) worn as a hearing-aid 
and non-standardized psychological counseling. While 
there is no evidence for short-term interventions, TRT 
can be considered for use as as a long-term intervention

technique. An RCT showed significant improvement in 
the  THI  score  after  treatment  for  12  months  (e11). 
 According to recent research the simultaneous prescrip-
tion of noise generators can be dispensed with (24, 25).

Music and sound therapy
There  is  no  evidence  for  music  and  sound  therapies. 
Even  tailor-made  notched  music  training  (TMNMT) 
should not be employed, because according to an RCT 
its effectiveness is no greater than that of placebo (26). 
This is also the case for acoustic (CR reset) neurostimu-
lation, for which a review of eight studies with a total of 
329 patients (one RCT, three non-controlled case–con-
trol studies) found no effect (27). Owing to the poten-
tially  harmful  effect  of  tinnitus  reinforcement  and  the 
high costs, there is a strongly negative recommendation 
for this method.

Drug treatment
There are no sufficient data on the effectiveness of drug 
treatment targeting tinnitus specifically, but there is evi-
dence of potentially negative side effects. Based on sys-
tematic  surveys  and  randomized  studies,  there  is  high 
evidence  that  betahistine  (28),  Ginkgo  biloba  extract 
(29),  antidepressants,  benzodiazepines,  zinc,  melato-
nin,  cannabis,  oxytocin,  steroids,  and  gabapentin  are 
not effective against chronic tinnitus and therefore can-
not be recommended. This has to be distinguished from 
the drug treatment of frequent comorbidities of tinnitus 
such as anxiety disorders and depression. These comor-
bidities  should  be  treated  according  to  the  available 
guidelines, which may include administration of drugs.

Dietary supplements
Dietary  supplements  such  as  vitamins,  traditional 
 Chinese–Korean  herbal  medicine,  minerals,  home -
opathy,  and  lipoflavonoids  should  not  be  used  in  the 
treatment of tinnitus, because no proof of concept has 
been provided (30, 31).

Neuromodulation
The  following  so-called  neuromodulation  techniques 
seek to influence the neuronal excitability of the cortex, 
especially  the  auditory  cortex,  by  direct,  either  mag-
netic or electric stimulation: 

● Repetitive 
(rTMS)

transcranial  magnetic 

stimulation 

● Transcranial  (tDCS)  and  invasive  electrostimu-

lation

● Bimodal  acoustic  and  electric  stimulation  (vagus 

or trigeminus)

● Low-level laser therapy
As the proof of concept for these methods is either 
contradictory  (rTMS),  or  has  not  been  demonstrated 
robustly, they should not be used. Most of the studies 
carried  out  are  either  not  placebo-controlled  or,  if 
placebo-controlled,  demonstrate  non-effectiveness 
(32,  33).  Some  reviews  are  contradictory  in  their 
evaluation (34, e12,e13), while for bimodal vagus or 
trigeminus  nerve  stimulation  no  robust  studies  have 

yet been published (35,36) and the existing studies are 
not placebo-controlled and afflicted by bias (37). Low-
level  laser  therapy  (formerly  referred  to  as  “soft 
laser”) has been available for many years, but there is 
no evidence of either safety or therapeutic effects in 
tinnitus.  Controlled  studies  and  meta-analyses  are 
lacking (38, e14).

Manual medicine and physiotherapy
If  modulation  of  tinnitus  is  detected  during  the  initial 
basic  investigation  of  the  cervical  spine  and  mastica-
tory apparatus and the findings of supplementary man-
ual medicine examination point to involvement of the 
cervical  spine,  temporomandibular  joint  function,  and 
muscular  trigger  points  or  dysbalances,  manual  medi-
cine and physiotherapy should be employed. The stated 
frequency  of  such  causal  involvement  ranges  very 
widely, however, from rare (8) to 30–40% (40), includ-
ing vague, imprecise reports (e15). If the association is 
clear,  physiotherapy,  including  exercises  and  trigger 
point treatments, can have positive effects on the sever-
ity of the tinnitus. However, reviews have described the 
methodological  quality  of  the  RCT  they  analyzed  as 
poor (39, 40).

 Conclusion
There  is  little  or  no  evidence  for  many  of  the  thera-
peutic approaches evaluated in the new German clinical 
practice  guideline  on  chronic  tinnitus,  particularly  for 
drug treatment and device-supported methods. Reason-
able  and  effective  treatment  of  tinnitus  remains  pos -
sible, however, and the new clinical practice guideline 
gives evidence-based recommendations:

● The  treatment  of  chronic  tinnitus  is  based  on  a 
sound diagnostic work-up including assessment of 
audiological characteristics of the ear noise and the 
possible existence of hearing loss as well as psy-
chosomatic  comorbidities  and  other  concomitant 
disorders. Comprehensive, anxiety-reducing coun-
seling should be based on this assessment.

● Hearing  aids  should  be  prescribed  for  the  treat-
ment of accompanying hearing loss. In the case of 
severe hearing loss or deafness, even if unilateral, 
a  cochlear  implant,  should  recommended  when-
ever possible. There is also good evidence for this 
method regarding habituation.

● The  principal  techniques  available  for  further 
treatment,  apart  from  counseling,  are  tinnitus-
 specific  cognitive  behavioral  therapy  and  well-
founded psychotherapeutic interventions—in indi-
vidual  or  group  settings,  as  a  single  treatment  or 
multimodal. These therapeutic procedures amelio -
rate  tinnitus  distress,  improve  quality  of  life,  and 
may  also  have  a  beneficial  impact  on  comorbidi -
ties such as anxiety and depression.

● If  patients  with  severe  decompensation  due  to 
 tinnitus-induced helplessness or severe comorbidi -
ties  (depression,  anxiety)  cannot  be  treated  in  an 
ambulatory  setting,  partially  or  wholly  inpatient 
recommended.  Relevant

Clinical practice guidelines in the Deutsches Ärzteblatt, as in many other 
journals, are not subject to a peer review process, since clinical practice 
(S3 level) guidelines are texts which have already been evaluated, dis-
cussed, and broadly agreed upon multiple times by experts (peers).

CLINICAL SNAPSHOT

Necrotizing Myositis in a Patient With 
Capillary Leak Syndrome

A 50-year-old man with known systemic capillary leak syndrome (SCLS) 
was transferred to us after sonographic diagnosis of a subfascial abscess 
of the thigh (temperature 40° C, leukocytes 15 tsd/mL, CRP 9.3 mg/dL 
[normally <0.5], low blood pressure). In a patient with SCLS, even harm-
less infections may lead to systemic inflammation with interleukin release 
and increased capillary permeability (molecules of up to 200 kDa). This 
manifests clinically as generalized edema, and laboratory tests reveal 
 elevated hematocrit and hypalbuminemia. In the absence of causal 
 therapy, hemodynamically unstable patients have to be treated symp -
tomatically. Radical surgical debridement was indicated and was carried 
out as a matter of urgency. Intraoperatively we found infected muscle 
 fascia and full-thickness necrosis of the quadriceps femoris muscle (Figure 
a). The clinical findings were confirmed by histology. However, SCLS in its 
own right has no specific histological features (interstitial edema). The 
 infection was eliminated by means of proximal compartment resection, 
 vacuum therapy, adjuvant hyperbaric oxygenation, and systemic antibiosis 
(Figure b). The distal compartment was preserved and the functional 
 impairments (loss of strength: hip flexors 4/5, knee extensors 3/5) were 
compensated by means of an orthosis.

eMETHODS 

The methods for the development of this guideline comply with 
the  regulations  of  the  Association  of  the  Scientific  Medical 
 Societies  in  Germany  (AWMF)  according  to  the  criteria  of  the 
German instrument for methodological assessment of guidelines 
(DELBI, version 2005/2006 + domain 8) Guidelines from vari-
ous  countries  identified  by  a  systematic  search  were  consulted 
when  formulating  the  consensus-based  recommendations.  The 
basis  of  the  guideline  was  a  systematic  literature  search  in 
PubMed and the Cochrane Library from 2014 to the cut-off date, 
with the last update taking place on 31 December 2020. The con-
sensus conferences took account of the latest references.

Assessment  of  the  validity  of  the  evidence  underlying  the 
recommendations  is  crucial  for  a  clinical  practice  guideline. 
The starting point for the revision was the guideline published 
in 2014. The tables were supplemented with the newly identi -
fied studies. The participants in charge of the different sections 
then presented all studies in terms of the PICO questions and 
the probability of systematic risk of bias was evaluated. Over-
all,  the  search  strategy  (limited  to  publications  in  German  or 
English)  turned  up  4396  records,  of  which  174  new  studies 
(RCT)  and  43  systematic  reviews,  including  six  Cochrane 
 Reviews,  were  analyzed.  Moreover,  aspects  of  safety  and 
 extent of acceptance were taken into account. In addition, the 
reporting  quality  of  all  systematic  reviews/meta-analyses 
 (eTable  1)  was  assessed  on  the  basis  of  the  PRISMA  criteria 
(Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-
Analyses) without a formalized process. The evidence level of 
each recommendation is oriented on the best evidence found. If 
a study was found to have a relevant risk of bias, it was down-
graded  by  one  level—in  several  cases,  two  levels—of 

 evidence. Finally, in formulating the positive or negative rec-
ommendations  it  was  necessary  to  differentiate  between  the 
evidence strength for “efficacy,” “weak efficacy,” and “no effi-
cacy” of an intervention.

For  the  structured  consensus  process,  a  multidisciplinary 
authorized  group  of  20  professional  societies  and  patients’ 
representatives was constituted according to the strictures of 
the  AWMF  (eBox  and  eTable  2).  Several  consensus  confer-
ences  organized by the steering group took place; the last of 
them were held online, moderated by a representative of the 
AWMF.

The official representatives were requested to abstain from 
voting at the consensus conferences if they had any potential 
conflicts of interest; the latter are systematically laid out in the 
guideline.

Grading of the recommendations on diagnosis and treatment 
took  place  in  accordance  with  the  procedure  for  German 
national healthcare guidelines. Dissenting opinions were pos -
sible  during  the  consensus  process,  but  none  were  registered 
until the stage of final adoption (on three topics). 

Based  on  the  exhaustive  literature  search  and  the  resulting 
evidence  tables,  recommendations  for  necessary  and  supple-
mentary diagnostic procedures were formulated and agreed by 
consensus.  In  a  nominal  group  procedure,  positive  and  also 
negative  recommendations  for  various  treatment  approaches 
were  formulated  in  a  structured  consensus  process  and  the 
strength of consensus was defined in each case. Data on health 
benefits,  adverse  effects,  and  risks  (to  the  extent  available) 
were also recorded systematically and considered when formu-
lating the recommendations.

eTABLE 1

Evidence table for the German clinical practice guideline on chronic tinnitus

Evidence-based recommendations*1

Remarks

Counseling should be recommended as the basis for 
treatment of chronic tinnitus. 

 Counseling should form the basis of treatment in every patient with 
chronic tinnitus. It comprises explanation of the findings after diag-
nostic tests described in the guideline have been carried out. 
 Furthermore, counseling aims to avoid or take account of further/ -
pre-existing comorbidities by supplying information about potential 
 interventions to ameliorate the tinnitus-specific distress.

Evidence level*1

Moderate 

Hearing aids should be recommended in chronic tinni-
tus and hearing loss. 

Noise generators should not be recommended in 
chronic tinnitus.

A cochlear implant (CI) should be recommended in 
tinnitus patients with severe hearing loss and deaf-
ness, including unilateral deafness (strong recommen-
dation).

Compensate of pre-existing hearing loss by means of hearing aids is a 
prerequirement for tinnitus habituation and may have a positive effect 
on the degree of tinnitus distress.

Moderate 

Patients with hearing loss do not benefit additionally from the use of 
noise generators as well as hearing aids; no effect of noise generators 
alone in patients with normal hearing has been demonstrated.

Moderate 

Use of a CI can achieve good suppression of tinnitus in patients with 
severe hearing loss and deafness, including unilateral deafness.

Moderate 

Hearing training should be recommended in chronic 
tinnitus.*2

Specific hearing therapy can promote tinnitus habituation by training 
and reinforcing  inhibitory effects of hearing perception. 

Moderate 
Low to weak  efficacy

Behavioral therapy (in various forms) should be 
 recommended in chronic tinnitus (strong recommen-
dation).

Numerous studies have shown the efficacy of behavioral therapy inter-
ventions compared with both waiting-list and active control groups with 
regard to tinnitus distress. Efficacy has been demonstrated for differ-
ent forms of behavioral therapy and also, to a limited extent, for 
 Internet-based behavioral therapy. 

High 

Tinnitus retraining therapy (TRT) can be considered 
as a long-term treatment option in chronic tinnitus. 
Use of noise generators is not necessary (open rec-
ommendation).

The recommendation is restricted to long-term use (at least 
12 months; then TRT is more effective than a tinnitus masker); hearing 
loss and hyperacusis must be taken into account; and particular atten-
tion must be paid to the counseling protocol. There is good evidence 
to show that using a noise generator yields no additional benefit. 

High 
No evidence of efficacy in 
short-term use, weak evi-
dence of efficacy in longer-
term use

Music therapy is not required in chronic tinnitus (open 
recommendation).

Although music therapy techniques represent a reasonable approach 
with regard to training the hearing, no studies have yet demonstrated 
efficacy against chronic tinnitus.

High 
No evidence of efficacy

Tailor-made notched music therapy (TMNMT) should 
not be used in chronic tinnitus. 

 Sound therapy should not be used.

Acoustic neuromodulation should not be used (strong 
recommendation).

Drugs should not be used to treat chronic tinnitus
(strong recommendation). 

Music with the tinnitus frequency range “notched out” is available as a 
smartphone app or in connection with hearing aids. It is no more effec-
tive against tinnitus than normal unmodified music. 
There is evidence of potential for harm. 

High 
No evidence of efficacy

Various types of stimulation have been proposed and tested: sounds, 
noises, auditory scenes, etc. Because of this plethora of methods no 
overall positive recommendation can be made. 

Moderate 
No evidence of efficacy

There is insufficient evidence for the efficacy of acoustic neuromodu-
lation according to the coordinated reset (CR) procedure. Regrading of 
the recommendation to strongly negative is due to the potential for 
harm and the high costs incurred by the patients.

High
No evidence of efficacy

There are insufficient data on the efficacy of specific drug treatments 
for tinnitus; however, potentially significant adverse effects have been 
demonstrated. The negative recommendation has been upgraded 
owing to the potential risk to patients. This must be distinguished from 
drug treatment of frequent comorbidities of tinnitus such as anxiety 
disorders and depression. These concomitant diseases should be 
treated in accordance with the existing guidelines, including any 
 appropriate medication. 

Moderate to high, depending 
on type of preparation
No evidence of efficacy
Evidence for non-
 recommendation: betahistine, 
ginkgo, anti depressants 
(high), benzo diazepines, zinc, 
melatonin, cannabis, oxytocin, 
steroids, and gabapentin 
(moderate)

High 
Inconsistent evidence of effi-
cacy

Transcranial magnetic stimulation of the auditory 
 cortex should not be used in chronic tinnitus.

Methods for transcranial magnetic stimulation of the auditory cortex 
have been intensively researched, mostly in studies with very small 
case numbers: recent meta-analyses come to contradictory con-
clusions as to whether the efficacy exceeds that of placebo. 

Transcranial electrostimulation should not be used in 
chronic tinnitus.

There is evidence for the safety of transcranial electrostimulation but 
not for its efficacy in chronic tinnitus.

Moderate 
No evidence of efficacy

Transcutaneous or invasive vagus nerv e stimulation, 
whether alone or in combination with acoustic stimu-
lation, should not be used in chronic tinnitus.

Both transcutaneous and invasive cervically implanted vagus nerv e 
stimulation can be used safely, but there is no evidence of efficacy 
against chronic tinnitus.

Moderate 
No evidence of efficacy

Deutsches Ärzteblatt International | Dtsch Arztebl Int 2022; 119: 219–25 | Supplementary material 

IV

M E D I C I N E

Bimodal acoustic and electrical stimulation should not 
be used in chronic tinnitus.

Bimodal acoustic and electrical stimulation is safe to use, but there is 
no robust evidence of efficacy. 

Invasive electrostimulation of the brain should not be 
used in chronic tinnitus.

With regard to invasive treatments of tinnitus, there is no evidence 
either for their safety nor for therapeutic effects.  The adverse effects 
may be severe, so the recommendation has been regraded to to 
strongly negative. 

Moderate 
Negative recommendation in 
view of existing conflicts of 
 interest 

Moderate 
No evidence of efficacy

Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) 
should not be used in chronic tinnitus.

There is only moderate evidence or none at all for the safety of TENS 
or for therapeutic effects against tinnitus. No controlled trials have 
been carried out.

Moderate 
No evidence of efficacy

Low-level laser treatment should not be used in 
chronic tinnitus.

There is no evidence either for the safety of low-level laser treatment 
methods or for therapeutic effects against tinnitus. No controlled trials 
have been carried out.

Moderate 
No evidence of efficacy

Manual medicine and physiotherapy should be offered 
in chronic tinnitus in the presence of modulation of the 
tinnitus by comorbid lesions of the cervical spine and 
the masticatory apparatus.

Nutritional supplements should not be used in chronic 
tinnitus.

If modulation of tinnitus is determined in the course of basic assess-
ment of the cervical spine and the masticatory apparatus and the find-
ings of advanced manual medicine examination indicate involvement 
of the cervical spine, temporomandibular joint function, and muscular 
trigger points/imbalance,  manual medicine and physiotherapy should 
be used.
Manual medicine and physiotherapy have a positive effect on the 
 severity of tinnitus and on cervical spine symptoms. A combination of 
physiotherapy and manual therapy along with patient education yields 
positive effects in patients with tinnitus and concomitant 
craniomandibu lar dysfunction.

No evidence exists that nutritional supplements (e.g., vitamins, min-
erals, or phytotherapeutics) exert any effect on tinnitus, or that they 
differ from placebo treatments in respect of tinnitus reduction or 
 adverse effects.

High 
Recommendation down-
graded owing to high risk 
of bias of the randomized 
clinical trials analyzed

High 
No evidence of efficacy

(Electro)acupuncture should not be used in chronic 
tinnitus.

There is no evidence that acupuncture or electroacupuncture exhibits 
efficacy against tinnitus. There is moderate evidence that it can ameli-
orate comorbidities such as muscle tension or pain, with a possibly 
positive effect on the tinnitus.

*1 Simple recommendation (level B) unless otherwise indicated. The determinations of recommendation strength and evidence level are described in the methods report of the clinical practice 

guideline. The underlying evidence tables can be found in the long version.

*2 Dissenting opinion of the German Society for Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Psychosomatics and Neurology (DGPPN): Hearing training can be considered in chronic tinnitus (open recom-

mendation). Rationale: Owing to insufficient evidence, no recommendation can currently be made. Further research is required.
