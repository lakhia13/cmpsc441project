Abstract
Background  Liaison psychiatry services play a central role in self-harm care and suicide prevention by providing 
specialist mental health input in general hospitals. Psychosocial interventions, including brief contact approaches 
(e.g., safety plans) and longer-term structured therapies (e.g., cognitive-behaviour therapy [CBT], dialectical behaviour 
therapy [CBT]), may reduce self-harm and suicide risk but their relevance and effectiveness within liaison psychiatry 
settings remains unclear.

Aims  To synthesise systematic evidence review on psychosocial interventions for preventing self-harm and suicide in 
liaison psychiatry settings through an umbrella review.

Methods  We searched Medline, Embase, CINAHL, PsycInfo, and CDSR (2013–2023) for systematic reviews evaluating 
interventions in liaison psychiatry contexts (including emergency departments, wards in general hospitals, 
outpatient/follow-up clinics for acute care patients receiving treatment for self-harm/suicidal behaviour), in adults 
or mixed adult/adolescent populations. Review quality (AMSTAR-2), primary study overlap in reviews, and evidence 
certainty (adapted GRADE) were assessed. Findings were narratively synthesised and tabulated, with input from 
experts-by-experience throughout. PROSPERO: CRD42023442639.

Results  Twenty-three systematic reviews (including 12 meta-analyses; >450,000 participants), were included. 
Person-centred brief contact interventions, particularly those incorporating safety planning and follow-up, were 
most consistently associated with reduced suicide attempt rates. However, methodological limitations including 
heterogeneity, limited generalisability, lack of self-harm specific outcomes, and mixed findings for remote only 
contact interventions warrant cautious interpretation. For longer-term psychological therapies, CBT was associated 
with reduced repeat self-harm, particularly with longer follow-up, whereas DBT reduced the rate of repetition. 
Evidence was limited by the lack of setting-specific trials, limited patient involvement, and suboptimal quality trials. 
Review quality varied. Primary trial overlap was slight overall, but high for some pairs of reviews of brief interventions.

SYSTEMATIC REVIEWOpen AccessPage 2 of 25

Conclusion  Current evidence for self-harm and suicide prevention interventions in liaison psychiatry services is 
methodologically suboptimal. Given widescale implementation of psychosocial interventions, there is an urgent 
priority to ensure they are safe, effective, and acceptable within liaison psychiatry services.

Keywords  Self-harm, Suicide, Therapeutic interventions, Health services, Umbrella review

Introduction
Self-harm,  defined  as  intentional  self-injury  or  self-poi-
soning [1] is a common reason for hospital presentation 
and  is  associated  with  an  increased  risk  of  early  death 
[2–4].  Hospital  care  for  people  who  have  self-harmed 
varies in delivery, capacity, and resources, and has trans-
formed rapidly over the last decade [5–7]. In the UK and 
elsewhere, liaison psychiatry teams, comprised of multi-
disciplinary staff, skilled in the treatment of co-occurring 
physical  and  mental  health  concerns,  provide  specialist 
support for patients who have presented to acute general 
hospital  with  self-harm  or  suicidal  behaviours  [5–9].  In 
the  United  Kingdom,  (UK)  liaison  psychiatry  services 
range  from  smaller  teams  with  minimum  staffing  and 
skills mix, to comprehensive/enhanced services that offer 
24/7 support in emergency department and ward settings 
[6,  7].  Larger  comprehensive  services  may  have  access 
to a broader staff mix, including specialist practitioners, 
consultant  psychiatrists,  clinical  psychologists,  and  may 
also  offer  specialist  outpatient  clinics  [6,  7].  The  type, 
depth,  and  duration  of  interventions  vary  on  whether 
care  is  provided  in  emergency  departments,  hospital 
wards,  or  outpatient  clinics.  Typically,  general  hospital 
staff provide initial assessments for people who have self-
harmed and refer to mental health staff for more compre-
hensive assessments and aftercare [5]. Environments are 
often  not  ideal  for  mental  health  assessments;  demand 
and staff turnover are high, time is short, and patient case 
mix is diverse [10–13].

Whilst  clinical  guidelines  recommend  psychosocial 
assessments  and  psychological  therapy  to  mitigate  self-
harm repetition and suicide risk [1], access is frequently 
inadequate  [10–12].  Clinicians  report  uncertainty  over 
which  therapeutic  interventions  work  for  whom  and 
where  [10–12].  Evaluating  relevant  psychosocial  inter-
ventions  for  liaison  psychiatry  services  is  further  com-
plicated  by  clinical  demands,  and  poor  translation  of 
intervention evidence to real-world clinical practice [13].
Systematic reviews represent gold standard in evidence 
synthesis  [14,  15].  However,  the  publication  of  variable 
quality  reviews  is  rapidly  increasing,  which  has  implica-
tions when utilising this evidence for high-demand clini-
cal practice [14, 15].

Umbrella  reviews  provide  an  opportunity  to  synthe-
sise  evidence  reported  from  multiple  published  sys-
tematic  reviews  to  inform  clinical  practice,  policy,  and 
patients  [14,  15].  In  this  umbrella  review,  our  aim  was 

to  systematically  identify  and  synthesise  data  from  pub-
lished  systematic  reviews  and  meta-analyses  that  have 
reported  on  interventions  relevant  to  liaison  psychiatry. 
Unlike  previous  cross-setting  reviews,  which  aggregate 
primary studies from a range of healthcare settings, our 
novel approach provides a consolidated and comparative 
evaluation of the systematic review evidence, specifically 
as it pertains to liaison psychiatry practice.

Methods
This  study  is  reported  according  to  the  Preferred 
Reported  Items  for  Overviews  of  Reviews  (PRIOR) 
guideline  [16],  and  was  registered  on  the  International 
Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) 
[registration number: CRD42023442639; 5.06.23]. Minor 
changes  included  utilising  the  Adapted  Algorithm  for 
GRADE  [17],  in  place  of  Guyatt  et  al.  [18]  to  evaluate 
methodological quality and certainty of the evidence.

Inclusion and exclusion criteria

Reviews were eligible for inclusion if they were: (1) peer 
reviewed  systematic  reviews;  (2)  they  included  at  least 
one  primary  study  that  evaluated  therapeutic  interven-
tions  for  self-harm  and  or  suicide  prevention  in  liaison 
psychiatry  settings  (e.g.,  emergency  departments,  psy-
chiatric wards in general hospital wards, wards in general 
hospitals  and  outpatients/follow-up  clinics  for  people 
who have presented to hospital for self-harm or suicidal 
behaviour). Liaison psychiatry outpatient clinics are typi-
cally managed by mental health trust staff, sometimes in 
partnership  with  the  acute  trust,  and  are  located  within 
or near to the acute general hospital; (see Table 1 for defi-
nitions of interventions, comparators and outcomes); (3) 
reported  data  for  adults  aged  18  or  over,  or  composite 
results for adults and adolescents.

Our  outcome  definitions  are  consistent  with  clinical 
guidelines for self-harm [1], and included any self-harm, 
or self-injury irrespective of suicidal intent (See Table 1). 
Suicidal  ideation,  whilst  important,  was  excluded  due 
to our focus on behavior [19, 20]. We set no restrictions 
on  study  designs,  comparators,  history  of  self-harm,  or

Intervention

Table 1  PICO* (population, intervention, comparison, and outcomes) criteria
Patients at risk of self-harm or suicide in liaison psychiatry settings.
Population
Emergency departments, general hospital wards, mental health wards/beds in general hospitals, liaison psychiatry outpatient 
Setting
or follow-up clinics.
Psychosocial or psychological interventions: Interventions in systematic reviews included, but were not limited to the following:
Brief contact interventions: (e.g., safety planning, single-session psychosocial support, crisis management), typically delivered in 
outpatient or acute care settings in one to four sessions.
Structured psychological therapies: (e.g., CBT, DBT), delivered over multiple sessions, often in outpatient or follow-up clinic 
settings. Other interventions: mentalisation-based therapy; case management; group-based psychotherapy; brief contact 
interventions, enhanced assessment approaches; treatment adherence; family interventions; remote contact interventions; 
and other multimodal interventions. Models of care interventions: specialist self-harm teams, assessment and intervention by 
the same team, mental health care-led teams, integrated care/seamless transition services. Training: Any self-harm or suicide 
prevention training for staff working across all three settings, reporting self-harm and/or suicide as outcomes.
Psychosocial or psychological therapy comparisons: Routine/standard care (e.g., treatment as usual), any other comparator or 
none (e.g., pre-post designs). Models of care comparisons: generic models of care, assessment and intervention provided by 
different teams. Staff training: No training, usual practice.
Self-harm, defined as any intentional act of self-poisoning or self-injury, irrespective of suicidal intent or motivation. This defini-
tion also includes attempted suicide and non-suicidal self-injury, because suicidal intent varies within and between episodes. 
Irrespective of suicidal intent, self-harm is a major risk factor for subsequent adverse events, including suicide. Consistent with 
the Office of National Statistics, suicide is defined as any death caused by intentional self-harm with or without suicidal intent, 
or of undetermined intent (ICD-10 codes: X60-X84, Y10-Y34, Y87.2).

Comparison

Outcome

*PICO categories were based on clinical guidelines for self-harm [1]

psychiatric  diagnoses.  Exclusion  criteria  included:  (1) 
evaluating  pharmacological  or  environmental  interven-
tions  either  combined  psychosocial  treatments  or  indi-
vidually  against  treatment  as  usual;  (2)  suicidal  ideation 
(as  composite  or  main  outcome);  (3)  studies  that  only 
reported  data  for  children  and  adolescents;  (4)  studies 
based in criminal justice, educational, community, men-
tal  health  inpatient  settings  (i.e.,  those  in  mental  health 
inpatient  units  rather  than  general  hospitals),  or  volun-
tary  settings,  reviews;  (5)  theoretical  and  opinion-based 
reviews,  letters,  commentaries,  non-systematic  reviews, 
reviews  of  qualitative  research;  and  (6)  review  articles 
that were not translated to English.

Search strategy and selection criteria

Search  strategy  details  including  terms,  reference  lists, 
and reasons for exclusion are in the supplementary mate-
rials, Table 1. We searched Embase, PsycInfo, MEDLINE, 
CINAHL,  and  the  Cochrane  Database  of  Systematic 
Reviews  (CDSR)  from  January  2013  to  December  2023, 
using  broad  search  strings  to  capture  reviews  in  this 
area  (see  supplementary  materials).  Search  terms  were 
developed  with  a  specialist  librarian  and  adapted  from 
clinical  guidelines  and  Cochrane  Reviews  of  interven-
tions  for  self-harm  [1,  21].  We  used  forward  and  back-
ward citation chaining and content expert knowledge to 
supplement  database  searches.  Two  reviewers  (LQ,  JW) 
independently reviewed all titles, abstracts, and full texts 
of potentially eligible studies, FM checked a random 10%, 
and  JG  cross-checked  100%  of  data  extracted.  Disagree-
ments  were  resolved  via  consensus  and  discussion  with 
senior  authors  (RW,  NK,  RE),  and  the  wider  team  (FM, 
JW, FS).

Data extraction

LQ and JW independently extracted data, which was ver-
ified (JG, FM), and reviewed by a multidisciplinary team. 
We  extracted  study  characteristics,  including  author 
details,  population,  author  defined  interventions,  com-
parison,  and  outcome  (PICO),  methods,  evaluation  of 
bias,  heterogeneity,  GRADE  assessment,  results,  and  if 
there was any reported patient involvement.

Quality assessment

Two  researchers  (LQ,  JW)  independently  evaluated 
the  methodological  quality  of  systematic  reviews  using 
the  Assessment  of  Multiple  Systematic  Reviews  Tool 
(AMSTAR-2)  [22].  Each  of  the  16  items  is  evaluated  as 
either  positive  (yes),  negative  (no),  or  partial  positive. 
We classified reviews as providing ‘high’, ‘moderate’, ‘low’, 
and ‘critically low’ quality evidence based on seven ‘criti-
cal’ and nine ‘non-critical’ domains. For example, reviews 
that listed summary justifications for excluded references 
in a flow chart, but did not supply a list of references and 
individual reasons, were marked as No (critical domain). 
Reviews  with  a  partial  yes,  or  that  did  not  report  data 
for  the  AMSTAR  2  [22]  item  were  classified  as  ‘No’  for 
domain classifications.

As  part  of  evidence  evaluation,  we  tabulated  and  syn-
thesised data for the Adapted GRADE algorithm [17] and 
other key methodological data. For the adapted GRADE 
algorithm,  quantitative  reviews  received  downgrades 
based  on  the  assessment  of  methodological  quality,  via 
heterogeneity,  number  of  participants,  risk  of  bias,  and 
items  from  AMSTAR-2  [17,  22].  Quantitative  reviews 
were  rated  as  providing  a  high  level  of  evidence  if  they 
have  received  zero  downgrades,  moderate  if  one  or  two 

Quinlivan et al. BMC Psychiatry         (2025) 25:1127 Page 4 of 25

downgrades,  low  if  three  or  four  downgrades,  and  very 
low  if  the  review  received  five  or  six  downgrades  [22]. 
We  also  report  any  use  of  GRADE  evaluations  [18]  in 
reviews. We based our conclusions on the combined evi-
dence from quantitative and narrative reviews.

Overlap analysis

We estimated the degree of the primary studies pairwise 
overlap  in  the  reviews  via  the  Covered  Area  (CA;  for-
mula:  N/rc)  and  corrected  covered  area  (CCA;  formula: 
(N–  r)/((r*c)–  r))  using  the  open-access  Graphical  Rep-
resentation  of  Overlap  for  OVErviews  open-access  tool 
[23, 24]. ‘N’ is the total number of publications, ‘r’ is the 
total  number  of  rows  (primary  studies),  and  ‘c’,  the  total 
number  of  columns  (included  reviews).  Results  are  cat-
egorised as slight (CCA 0–5%), moderate (CCA 6–10%), 
high  (CCA  11–15%)  and  very  high  overlap  (CCA > 15%) 
[23, 24]. One study was removed from the overlap analy-
ses  due  to  insufficient  information  for  the  extraction  of 
primary studies references [25].

Synthesis methods

Given the high degree of heterogeneity across the set of 
reviews,  we  used  a  systematic  approach  to  narratively 
describe  and  synthesise  the  data  in  tables  and  groups 
[26].  We  grouped  systematic  review  results  into  those 
with  quantitative  (meta-analysis)  and  narrative  synthe-
sis  analysis.  We  summarised  the  findings  from  the  two 

groups  separately  and  reported  results  and  outcomes  as 
described  by  the  review.  We  report  detailed  results  for 
interventions  with  evidence  of  effects  on  relevant  out-
comes, report contradictory findings, and summarise the 
interventions without supportive evidence.

For  quantitative  reviews  (meta-analyses),  we  report 
important  parameters  for  significant  results  including 
pooled odds ratios (OR) for dichotomous outcomes, such 
as  the  number  of  participants  that  repeat  self-harm  or 
die  by  suicide,  mean  differences  (MD)  for  quantitative 
outcomes,  such  as  the  frequency  of  repeated  self-harm 
episodes,  confidence  intervals  (95%CI),  means  (M),  and 
standard deviations (SD) where available. We report the 
I2  statistic  as  a  measure  of  between-study  variation  and 
heterogeneity  [27].  Outcomes  were  classified  into  self-
harm, attempted suicide, and suicide; based on the infor-
mation  available  in  the  publication.  Interventions  are 
reported as defined by the systematic reviews.

Results
Figure  1  summarises  the  results  of  the  search,  which 
yielded 1116 studies, of which, 1041 were excluded at the 
title and abstract screening stage. We screened 74 for full 
text eligibility and identified 23 additional studies through 
manual  searches.  In  total,  after  full  text  screening  and 
stratification, 31 reviews included relevant data for health-
care settings, and 23 met our inclusion criteria for liaison 
psychiatry settings (see Fig. 1 for the search flow chart).

Evaluation of bias in reviews

Characteristics of included studies

Thirteen studies used the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool [21, 
28–39], six used another method of evaluating bias (e.g., 
Joanna  Briggs  appraisal  tool)  [25,  35–44],  and  four  did 
not  report  information  [45–48].  Predominant  concerns 
for  bias  included  participant  attrition,  incomplete  out-
come data, and blinding (see Table 2).

Assessment of the reviews’ methodological quality and 
certainty of the evidence

AMSTAR-2  [22]  assessments  for  the  included  reviews 
are  presented  in  Table  4.  Methodological  quality  var-
ied widely across reviews: Two reviews did not have any 
critical  or  non-critical  flaws  and  were  rated  as  provid-
ing a ‘high quality’ summary of the results and available 
data [21, 34]. Three reviews were rated as ‘low’, due to one 
critical  flaw  (e.g.,  did  not  list  excluded  study  references 
individually)  [29,  30,  32],  with  the  remainder  rated  as 
‘critically low’ quality due to more than one critical flaw 
(e.g.,  lack  of  pre-registration,  excluded  studies,  compre-
hensive strategy) (Table 4). Most reviews (21/23) received 
a critical flaw due to item 5 (reference list with justifica-
tions  for  each  excluded  study);  18/23  received  a  critical 
flaw for receiving a partial yes for conducting a compre-
hensive search strategy (e.g., they may not have reported 
searching reference lists, trial registries or including con-
tent  experts),  and  13/23  did  not  pre-register  the  review 
(Table 4).

Two  systematic  reviews  [21,  34]  evaluated  the  cer-
tainty  of  the  evidence  according  to  GRADE  [18].  In  the 
updated Cochrane review to Hawton et al. [34, 49] Witt 
et  al.  [21]  rated  most  trials  as  ‘very  low’  to  ‘moderate’ 
quality according to GRADE. Trials for cognitive-behav-
iour  therapy  to  reduce  self-harm  repetition  received  a 
GRADE [18] rating of ‘low’ certainty evidence, and ‘very 
low’  quality  for  DBT.  Mentalisation-based  therapy  was 
rated  has  having  ‘high’  certainty  evidence  for  reducing 
self-harm repetition, but this was based on a single trial. 
Two  trials  for  group-based  emotion  regulation  psycho-
therapy  received  a  ‘moderate’  certainty  evidence  rating 
for  reducing  self-harm  repetition  [21].  One  review  [40] 
adapted  GRADE  [18]  to  evaluate  the  methodological 
quality  of  trials,  but  did  not  report  the  certainty  of  evi-
dence.  Given  the  quality  of  trials  in  this  area,  according 
to the Adapted Grade Algorithm scoring [17], no reviews 
provided  a  ‘high’  certainty  of  evidence  for  the  effective-
ness  of  psychosocial  interventions  for  self-harm  or  sui-
cide  prevention.  Additional  information  pertaining  to 
the  methodological  evaluation  of  reviews  (e.g.,  combi-
nations  of  the  adapted  algorithm  for  GRADE  [17]  and 
AMSTAR-2 [22] is presented in Tables 2, 3 and 4.

Characteristics  of  the  included  reviews  (e.g.,  including 
interventions, outcomes, comparators, bias, heterogene-
ity),  are  presented  in  Table  5.  Systematic  reviews  were 
published  between  2013  and  2023.  The  1106  primary 
studies dated from 1970 to 2022, with a total of 464,759 
participants.  Most  reviews  reported  data  for  adults 
(12/23),  9/23  reported  composite  data  for  adults  and 
adolescents,  and  two  reviews  had  insufficient  report-
ing  for  age  (Table  5).  Percentage  of  female  participants 
in  the  included  primary  studies  ranged  from  11  to  90%, 
and  10/23  had  insufficient  reporting  for  gender  (Table 
5).  Four  quantitative  [21,  25,  34,  45]  and  four  narra-
tive  reviews  included  self-harm  in  their  outcomes  [32, 
42, 46, 48]. Eight quantitative [21, 25, 31, 33–35, 38, 40] 
and eight narrative reviews included suicide re-attempts 
[28, 30, 36, 41, 43, 44, 47, 48]. Four quantitative reviews 
utilised  a  composite  outcome  of  suicide  and  suicide 
attempts  [29,  37,  39,  45]. Three  quantitative  [31,  37,  39] 
and one qualitative review excluded self-harm [35].

Twelve  reviews  conducted  meta-analyses  [21,  25,  29, 
31, 33–35, 37, 39, 40, 45] and 11 narratively summarised 
the data [28, 30, 32, 36, 41–44, 46, 48]. Arshad et al. [32] 
conducted  a  meta-analysis  for  suicidal  ideation,  but 
a  narrative  review  for  suicide  attempts.  There  was  no 
reported patient involvement across reviews.

Quantitative reviews: effectiveness
Brief contact interventions

Brief  contact  interventions  are  low-cost,  non-intrusive 
interventions  that  aim  to  mitigate  risks  of  self-harm 
repetition  and  suicide  for  people  presenting  to  hospi-
tal  following  a  self-harm  episode  or  with  elevated  sui-
cide  risk  [28–30,  33].  Interventions  vary  in  format  and 
delivery, but may include brief therapeutic interventions 
(e.g., safety planning), with or without regular follow-up 
through telephone calls, messages, letters, texts, or post-
cards.  Eight  quantitative  reviews  included  brief  contact 
interventions in their analyses [21, 29, 31, 33–35, 40].

Mixed brief contact interventions

Azizi et al. [40] pooled results from 19 RCTs evaluating 
brief contact interventions for patients who made a first-
time suicide attempt. Intervention contact with patients 
was  brief  (e.g.,  provision  of  telephone  calls,  messages, 
letters,  texts,  postcards,  psychoeducation,  crisis  cards), 
and  follow-up  length  was  split  into  those  receiving  fol-
low-up contacts for more or less than 12 months. Analy-
ses indicated that pooled interventions reduced repeated 
suicide  attempts  compared  to  controls  (risk  difference 
estimate:  RD = 4%,  95%CI  [2–6%];  I2 = 68.9;  risk  ratio:

RR = 0.62,  95%CI  [0.48–0.77];  k = 19,  I2 = 34.2%).  Partici-
pants receiving the brief contact intervention for longer 
than  12  months  had  fewer  repeated  suicide  attempts 
(RD = 13%,  95%CI  [3–23%],  k = 4,  I2 = 80.3%;  RR = 0.46, 
95%CI  [0.10–0.82],  I2 = 60.8%),  compared  to  those  who 
received  interventions  for  12  months  or  less  (RD = 23%, 
95% CI [1–4%], k = 14, I2 = 32.6%; RR = 0.67 (95% CI 0.54–
0.80, I2 = 0.0%) [40].

Doupnik  et  al.  [33]  pooled  results  from  seven  ran-
domised  controlled  trials  evaluating  the  effects  of  brief 
contact  intervention  for  preventing  subsequent  sui-
cide  attempts  compared  to  control  groups.  Most  of  the 
included interventions were single session and delivered 
during hospital visits. Some interventions included vari-
able follow-up contacts through phone calls, caring con-
tacts, or care coordination support, ranging from one day 
to  12  months.  Analyses  indicated  that  the  pooled  inter-
ventions  resulted  in  fewer  subsequent  suicide  attempts 
compared  to  control  groups  (pooled  OR = 0.69,  95%CI 
[0.55–0.87],  Hedges  g = 0.21,  95%CI  [0.08,  0.33],  k = 7, 
I2 = 0%).

Witt et al. [21] found some evidence to suggest a ben-
eficial effect from a multimodal intervention (three ther-
apy  sessions,  followed  by  regular  letters  for  24  months) 
in  reducing  the  frequency  of  suicide  attempts  by  post 
intervention,  for  adults  admitted  to  the  emergency 
department following an episode of self-harm, based on 
one trial with a 24-month follow-up (M = 0.08, SD = 0.28, 
n = 60  versus  M = 0.82,  SD = 1.89,  n = 50;  MD  −0.74,  95% 
CI [−1.27 to −0.21], N = 110; k = 1; I2 = not applicable).

Safety plans (brief interventions/meta-analyses)

Nuij et al. [29] analysed data from six studies evaluating 
standalone  safety  planning  interventions  that  contained 
personalised  coping  strategies  and  sources  of  support. 
Results indicated that the risk of suicidal behaviour (com-
posite  outcome  of  suicide  and  attempted  suicide)  was 
reduced  by  43%  for  the  intervention  group  compared 
to  controls  (Safety  planning 
intervention = RR = 0.57 
vs.  treatment  as  usual  (95%  CI  [0.41–0.80],  p = 0.001, 
I2 = 32.5%, 95%CI [0–71%], k = 6, NNT = 16).

Social support interventions

Hou  et  al.  [35]  pooled  results  from  16  studies  evaluat-
ing  mixed  interventions  (e.g.,  brief  contact  interven-
tions,  postal,  text,  fact-to-face,  email),  with  at  least  one 
component  that  promoted  social  support/connected-
ness,  or  decreased  social  isolation/feelings  of  loneli-
ness. Results suggested that social support interventions 
reduced deaths by suicide (RR = 0.48, 95% CI [0.27, 0.85], 
p = 0.01, k = 10, I2 = 17%) compared to controls. Subgroup 
analyses indicated that social support interventions were 
more  effective  in  reducing  suicide,  when  delivered  face-
to-face (RR = 0.16, 95%CI [0.05, 0.53], for people who had 

attempted suicide (RR = 0.24, 95% CI: [0.10, 0.58]) but not 
for other delivery methods or populations.

Provision of information and support

Witt  et  al.  [21]  found  a  significant  treatment  effect 
towards  fewer  deaths  by  suicide  in  the  multi-country 
SUPRE-MISS study intervention group in one of the five 
countries  by  the  18-month  follow-up  (OR  0.12,  95%  CI 
[0.03,0.44], k = 2, I2 = 0%), but there were some issues with 
inconsistent  reporting  of  suicide  deaths  overall  [21,  34, 
49].

Structured psychological interventions

Structured psychological therapies may be delivered over 
multiple sessions, often in outpatient, or follow-up clin-
ics. Psychotherapeutic interventions included treatments 
based  on  psychological  science  and  typically  included 
cognitive  behaviour  therapy  (CBT),  dialectal  behaviour 
therapy  (DBT),  and/or  problem-solving  techniques. 
Seven  quantitative  reviews  formally  evaluated  psycho-
therapies  to  prevent  self-harm  or  suicide  part  through 
meta-analyses [21, 25, 31, 34, 36, 39, 45].

Cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT)

In  an  updated  Cochrane  review  of  psychosocial  inter-
ventions  for  self-harm  [34,  49],  Witt  et  al.  [21]  found 
that  CBT  reduced  self-harm  repetition  compared  to 
treatment  as  usual  by  post-intervention  (OR = 0.35,  95% 
CI  [0.12,  1.02];  k = 4;  I2 = 0%),  6-month  (OR = 0.52,  95% 
CI  [0.38,  0.70],  k = 12,  I2 = 2%),  and  12-month  follow-
up  (OR = 0.81,  95%  CI  [0.66,0.99],  k = 9,  I2 = 0%).  CBT 
reduced  the  frequency  of  self-harm  repetition  at  six 
(MD=  −0.71,  95%  CI  [−1.32,  −0.11],  k = 4,  I2 = 0%)  and 
12-month  follow-up  (M = 1.18,  SD = 4.22,  n = 40  ver-
sus  M = 4.58;  SD  8.37;  n = 33;  MD  −3.40,  95%  CI  [−6.54, 
−0.26],  k = 1,  I2 = not  applicable),  but  not  the  post-inter-
vention assessment. Using the GRADE criteria [18], Witt 
et al. [21] rated the quality of evidence as providing ‘low 
certainty evidence’.

Consistent  with  Witt  et  al.  [21]  Sobanksi  et  al.  [39] 
found  that  pooled  psychotherapeutic  interventions  (e.g., 
CBT, DBT, psychodynamic psychotherapy, interpersonal 
problem-solving  skills  training)  for  patients  who  had 
attempted suicide, resulted in significantly fewer episodes 
of suicidal behaviour (composite outcome of suicide and 
attempted suicide) compared to controls (RR = 0.66; 95% 
CI [0.48, 0.90], Z = 2.63, p < 0.01, OR = 0.56, CI [0.36,0.84], 
p < 0.01,  k = 18,  I2 = 51%).  For  individual  interventions, 
Sobanksi  et  al.  [39]  found  significant  treatment  effects 
for CBT in the number of suicide re-attempts compared 
to  treatment  as  usual  (RR = 0.66;  95%  CI  [0.48,  0.90]; 
Z = 2.61,  p < 0.01;  OR = 0.53,  CI  [0.34,  0.83],  p < 0.01, 
k = 10,  I2 = 28%),  and  psychodynamic  interventions  in 
reducing  the  number  of  suicide  re-attempts  (RR = 0.21, 

Quinlivan et al. BMC Psychiatry         (2025) 25:1127 Page 17 of 25

95%  CI  [0.08,  0.57],  Z = 3.08,  p < 0.001,  OR  0.17,  95%  CI 
[0.06, 0.45], p < 0.001, k = 2, I2 = 30%,). However, treatment 
effects  for  CBT  compared  to  TAU  were  only  significant 
for longer follow-up for (12 months + versus < 6 months) 
(RR = 0.60, Z = 2.38, p = 0.02).

Dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT)

DBT  may  be  effective  in  reducing  the  frequency  of  self-
harm  compared  to  TAU  or  another  comparator,  based 
on  evidence  from  three  quantitative  reviews  [21,  25, 
34]. Consistent with Fox et al. [25] Witt et al. [21] found 
evidence  of  beneficial  treatment  effects  for  DBT  in 
reducing  the  frequency  of  repeated  self-harm  by  post-
intervention  follow-up  (MD  =  −5.00,  95%  CI  [−8.92, 
−1.08],  k = 7,  I2 = 49%,  GRADE  [18] = very  low  certainty 
evidence). Using a composite outcome that included sui-
cide  attempts,  non-suicidal  self-injury,  self-harm,  and 
suicide, DeCou et al. [45] found positive treatment effects 
for  combined  DBT  interventions  (e.g.,  comprehensive 
and  modified  DBT)  in  reducing  the  frequency  of  ‘self-
directed violence’ compared to controls (Weighted Mean 
Effect  Size,  Cohen’s  d = − 0.32,  95%  CI  [−0.471,  − 0.176], 
k = 15, I2 = 45.48%) [45].

Other interventions (Mentalisation-based therapy 
(MBT), emotion-based regulation psychotherapy, direct 
interventions)

Based on one trial rated, Witt et al. [21] found evidence 
to  suggest  that  mentalisation-based  therapy  may  reduce 
self-harm repetition for adults referred to a specialist per-
sonality  disorder  treatment  service  (18/71  versus  31/63, 
OR = 0.35,  95%  CI  [0.17,  0.73],  N = 134,  k = 1,  I2 = not 
applicable),  and  the  frequency  of  repetition  (M = 0.38, 
SD = 0.38,  n = 71  versus  M = 1.66,  SD = 2.87,  n = 63;  MD 
−1.28, 95% CI [−2.01, −0.55]; N = 134, k = 1, I2 = not appli-
cable, GRADE [16] = high certainty evidence). Witt et al. 
[20]  found  positive  treatment  effects  from  group-based 
emotional  regulation  psychotherapy  for  reducing  repeat 
self-harm  for  women  who  have  received  a  diagnosis  of 
personality disorder, but not for the frequency of occur-
rence  (OR = 0.34,  95%  CI  [0.13  to  0.88],  N = 83,  k = 2, 
I2 = 0%, GRADE [17] = moderate certainty evidence).

Mixed interventions (combined brief contact interventions 
with DBT, outreach, and other interventions)

Hofstra  et  al.  [31]  pooled  a  range  of  interventions  from 
15  studies,  including  brief  contact  and  follow-up,  safety 
plans,  postcards,  assertive  out-reach,  DBT,  brief  CBT  in 
a  meta-analysis.  Overall,  interventions  were  associated 
with  fewer  episodes  of  suicidal  behaviour  (combined 
outcome  of  suicide  attempts  and  suicide),  compared  to 
controls  (Cohen’s  d = − 0.495,  95%CI  [− 0.677,  − 0.313], 
p < 0.001,  k = 17,  I2 = 50%),  fewer  deaths  by  suicide 
(Cohen’s  d = − 0.535  (95%  CI  [− 0.898,  − 0.171],  p = 0.004, 

k = 7,  I2 = 0%),  and  suicide  attempts  (Cohen’s  d = − 0.449 
(95% CI [− 0.618, − 0.280], p < 0.01, k = 15, I2 = 62%). Mod-
erator  analyses  indicated  that  interventions  delivered  to 
patients admitted to a psychiatric ward in a general hos-
pital  had  the  greatest  effect  in  reducing  deaths  by  sui-
cide  compared  to  controls  (Cohen’s  d = − 1.082,  95%CI 
[− 2.027,  − 0.137],  p = 0.025).  Whereas 
interventions 
delivered in emergency departments or outpatient men-
tal  health  services  had  no  statistically  significant  effect 
on  deaths  by  suicide  compared  to  controls.  For  suicide 
re-attempts,  interventions  delivered  in  outpatient  set-
tings had the largest effect sizes (Cohen’s d = − 0.705, 95% 
CI  [− 1.275,  − 0.135],  p = 0.015),  followed  by  psychiatric 
wards  in  general  hospitals  (Cohen’s  d = − 0.483,  95%  CI 
[− 0.892, − 0.073] p = 0.021), and emergency departments 
(Cohen’s d = − 0.319, 95% CI [− 0.528, − 0.110], p = 0.003).

Direct versus indirect interventions

Meerwijk  et  al.  [37]  classified  interventions  into  those 
that  directly  addressed  suicidal  behaviour  (mostly  CBT 
or  DBT),  and  indirect  interventions  that  addressed 
symptoms associated with suicide or mental illness such 
as  hopelessness,  anxiety,  or  depression.  Results  indi-
cated  that  direct  interventions  significantly  reduced 
the  odds  of  suicidal  behaviour  (composite  outcome  of 
suicide  re-attempts  and  suicide)  compared  to  controls 
groups  (OR = 0.82,  95%  CI  [0.70,0.96];  k = 19,  I2 = 0.0%, 
NNT = 17). Of the indirect interventions, only active out-
reach reduced the odds of suicide or suicide attempts by 
the end of follow-up (OR = 0.80, 95% CI [0.66,0·97], k = 7, 
I2 = 0.0%).

Narrative effectiveness summary

Narrative  and  quantitative  review  findings  were  broadly 
consistent  for  safety  plans,  CBT  and  DBT.  Consistent 
with  quantitative  findings  [29],  narrative  reviews  con-
sistently  indicated  positive  effects  from  safety  planning 
interventions  in  reducing  suicide  attempts  compared  to 
controls  [28,  30,  43].  Three  narrative  reviews  suggested 
that  post-discharge  follow-up  or  outreach  may  reduce 
suicide  risk,  based  on  relatively  few  studies  [44,  47,  48]. 
Luxton et al. [47] suggested that post-discharge follow-up 
may  reduce  suicide  attempts  (3  studies),  and  suicide  (2 
studies). Wand et al. [46] suggested an assertive aftercare 
programme for older adults may be beneficial in reducing 
suicide but highlighted significant methodological limita-
tions  and  small  absolute  risk  reductions  with  the  study 
[46].  Consistent  with  quantitative  reviews  [21,  25,  34], 
Mann et al. [48] concluded that CBT-based interventions 
and  DBT  reduced  suicide  attempts.  Similarly,  Davidson 
et al. [46] found that DBT reduced the frequency of self-
harm  at  post  intervention  follow-up,  irrespective  of  the 
intensity,  but  there  no  difference  between  intervention 
and control groups.

Conflicting evidence
Non-significant findings for interventions

Several reviews evaluated interventions but did not find 
statistically significant treatment effects for reducing self-
harm or suicide attempt repepition [21, 25, 32, 34, 38, 39, 
42]. These interventions are listed in Table 6. Hawton et 
al. [34, 49] and Witt et al. [21] evaluated several brief con-
tact  interventions  separately  and  found  non-significant 
treatment  effects  for  telephone  contact  interventions, 
postcards,  emergency  cards,  coping  cards,  and  letters 
in  reducing  self-harm  repetition  compared  to  controls. 

Emergency cards were also associated with an increased 
risk of self-harm repetition for participants with a history 
of multiple episodes of self-harm (52/194 vs. 33/200, OR 
1.85, 95% CI [1.14, 3.03], k = 1) [21, 34, 49]. For the provi-
sion of information support, Hawton et al. [34] and Witt 
et al. [21] found no evidence of an effect for the interven-
tion  group  compared  to  controls  for  reducing  suicide 
attempts.  In  contrast  to  Sobanski  et  al.  [39]  Witt  et  al. 
[21]  found  no  evidence  of  an  effect  for  psychodynamic 
psychotherapy on reducing self-harm repetition.

Review overlap: fraction of evidence synthesised in two or 
more reviews

The  Covered  Area  for  the  available  reviews  was  8.29% 
and the Corrected Covered Area was 3.92% indicating a 
slight  degree  of  overlap  for  the  overall  review.  However, 
several pairs of reviews for brief interventions and safety 
planning interventions had very high overlap (See Fig. 2). 
For  example,  Zaraka  et  al.  [41]  had  ‘very  high  overlap’ 
with Doupnik et al. [33] (40%), Nuji et al. [29] (2021) had 
high overlap with Doupnik et al. [33] (35.7%), Ferguson et 
al. [43] (33%), Chartier et al. [28] (33%), and McCabe et 
al. [30] (28.6%), and Hofstra et al. [31] (20%). As expected 
from  an  updated  Cochrane  Review,  Witt  et  al.  [21]  had 
very high overlap with Hawton et al. [34] However, Witt 
et al. [21] includes additional evidence from 21 new tri-
als of psychosocial interventions for people who had self-
harmed. Figure 3 presents the Graphical Representation

Discussion
Person-centred  brief  contact  interventions  may  offer  a 
pragmatic,  scalable  option  for  acute  care  settings,  when 
integrated  into  care  pathways  with  adequate  follow-up. 
However,  limitations  of  the  research,  including  gener-
alisability  to  other  healthcare  contexts  and  populations 
warrant  consideration  and  further  evaluation,  prior  to 

implementation. Overall, we found substantial heteroge-
neity,  variable  trial  quality,  and  limited  patient  involve-
ment.  This  could  be  taken  as  highlighting  the  need  for 
bigger  and  better  randomised  trials.  However,  a  more 
urgent priority might be to assess how well these promis-
ing interventions work when implemented in real world 
settings and to ensure they are safe, effective, and accept-
able within liaison psychiatry services.

Brief contact interventions

Quantitative  [29,  31,  33,  40]  and  narrative  reviews  [28, 
30,  41,  43]  demonstrated  the  effectiveness  of  person-
centred  brief  contact  interventions  in  reducing  suicide 
reattempts compared to treatment as usual (TAU). Safety 
planning interventions, which enable patients to identify 
warning signs, coping skills, and support networks, were 
commonly included in reviews [28, 29, 33, 40, 41, 43, 47]. 
Two  reviews  [29,  43]  provided  specific  evidence  for  the 
effectiveness  of  safety  plans  as  standalone  interventions 
in  reducing  suicide  risk.  However,  findings  for  remote-
only  interventions  such  as  postcards,  text  messages, 
and  phone  calls,  were  inconsistent,  which  may  partly 
reflect  heterogeneity  introduced  pooling  different  types 
of  interventions  [21,  32,  34,  38].  These  inconsistences 
might  also  highlight  the  essential  role  of  relational  care 
and  personalisation  following  an  episode  of  self-harm. 
Some remote interventions (e.g., automated texts), might 

Quinlivan et al. BMC Psychiatry         (2025) 25:1127  
Page 20 of 25

Fig. 3  Infographics summary of the systematic review evidence and clinical considerations

fail to adequate validate and therapeutically engage indi-
viduals experiencing psychological distress. Findings also 
highlight  the  importance  of  setting  specific  needs,  due 
to stronger evidence for suicide risk reduction in general 
hospital  wards,  and  for  reducing  suicide  re-attempts  in 
outpatient settings [31].

Safety planning: caveats

Despite  widespread  clinical  adoption,  the  evidence  for 
standalone safety planning interventions remains narrow 
and methodologically limited. Most studies incorporated 
safety  plans  within  broader,  collaborative  interventions 
that varied in delivery mode, number of sessions, follow-
up  frequency,  and  management  of  referrals.  No  study 
evaluated the provision of a safety plan document alone, 
without clinical input and/or follow-up. The only quanti-
tative  review  that  evaluated  safety  plans  as  a  standalone 
intervention,  utilised  a  combined  outcome  of  suicide 
attempts and deaths [29]. Most of the evidence for safety 
plans is derived from six studies (four RCTS [50–53], one 
interrupted time series study [54], one cohort study [55]). 
The highly specific populations and healthcare contexts, 

including male military veterans in the USA [53, 55] and 
specialised suicide prevention services in Taiwan [51, 52], 
limit generalisability to other healthcare settings, popula-
tions, and demographics.

Cognitive behaviour therapy and dialectical behaviour 
therapy

Five  quantitative  [21,  34,  37,  39,  45]  and  two  narrative 
reviews [46, 48] consistently found that cognitive behav-
ioural  therapy  (CBT)  reduces  suicide  attempts  and/or 
self-harm  repetition,  particularly  with  longer  follow-
up. However, CBT did not reduce the frequency of self-
harm  or  suicide  [21,  25,  34],  which  highlights  potential 
limitations of this intervention for people who frequently 
self-harm.  Dialectical  behaviour  therapy  (DBT)  reduced 
self-harm frequency, but did not lower overall repetition 
or suicide rates [21, 25, 34, 45]. The lack of evidence for 
brief,  single-session  DBT  adaptions  within  emergency 
departments  [21]  suggests  that  intervention  length,  fre-
quency, and setting may impact effectiveness. Donker et 
al.  [42]  also  highlighted  diagnostic  specificity  in  inter-
vention responsiveness, with psychosocial interventions, 

Quinlivan et al. BMC Psychiatry         (2025) 25:1127  
Page 21 of 25

including CBT, showing no significant effect in reducing 
self-harm  or  suicide  risk  among  individuals  diagnosed 
with schizophrenia spectrum or psychotic disorders [42].

Deaths by suicide

Three  reviews  identified  interventions  with  potential  to 
reduce  deaths  by  suicide,  including  information  provi-
sion,  pooled  suicide  prevention  strategies,  and  face-to-
face  social  support  interventions  [21,  31,  35].  However, 
methodological  weaknesses  and  substantial  heterogene-
ity  limit  these  findings.  The  SURE-MISS  trial  demon-
strated  positive  effects  for  information  provision  in  one 
of five participating countries [21], highlighting potential 
challenges in intervention transferability and fidelity. The 
other reviews were limited by heterogeneity in interven-
tion type, delivery, population, and statistical power [31, 
35].

Quality of the evidence

Only two reviews [21, 34] received high AMSTAR-2 [22] 
quality  ratings,  likely  due  to  AMSTAR-2’s  stringent  cri-
teria, with several otherwise strong reviews downgraded 
due to reporting issues [29, 30, 32, 41]. Only two reviews 
evaluated  certainty  of  evidence  for  clinical  practice, 
which  was  generally  weak  to  moderate  overall  [21,  34]. 
Overall  limitations  in  trial  quality,  lack  of  protocol  reg-
istration,  and  heterogeneity  across  intervention  types, 
populations,  and  settings  further  limit  confidence  in 
conclusions  for  clinical  practice. These  limitations  high-
light the urgent need for more rigorous, better reported 
reviews  and  trials  in  this  area.  Implementation  of  any 
interventions warrant ongoing patient involvement, iter-
ative  local  evaluation  of  self-harm,  suicide,  and  patient 
experience metrics to ensure patient safety.

Strengths and limitations

This  umbrella  review  synthesised  broad,  heterogeneous 
evidence  from  23  systematic  reviews  and  identified  key 
evidence gaps. Whilst we did not conduct meta-analyses 
due  to  substantial  heterogeneity,  we  provide  detailed 
results and parameters that are relevant for research and 
clinical  practice.  We  could  have  excluded  overlapping 
reviews, but part of our aim was to highlight this limita-
tion  in  the  evidence  base  (e.g.,  for  safety  plans).  Robust 
methodological  assessments  were  used,  including  the 
AMSTAR-2 [22] and the adapted GRADE algorithm [17], 
to inform review evaluation. However, umbrella reviews 
are  limited  by  the  methodological  quality  in  included 
reviews and primary studies, heterogeneity, and potential 
sources  of  bias.  Primary  studies  ranged  from  observa-
tional  designs  to  RCTS,  with  many  subject  to  biases  for 
attrition and reporting.

Several reviews lacked adequate gender-related report-
ing  [33,  35–37,  42,  45–47],  and  others  only  reported 

binary  categories  (male/female).  Reporting  for  other 
protected  characteristics,  including  ethnicity,  disabil-
ity,  neurodivergence,  and  socio-economic  position,  was 
largely absent, likely indicating limitations in the primary 
evidence.  We  highlight  these  systematic  biases  and  pro-
vide an evidence overview to inform research and clinical 
practice.  Reporting  for  patient  and  public  involvement 
was absent across reviews. However, we integrated lived 
experience  perspectives  throughout  this  process,  to 
ensure relevance to real world clinical practice, patients, 
and carers. Our multidisciplinary, diverse research team 
further strengthened the evaluation.

We  focused  on  self-harm  and  suicide  because  they 
are  key  patient  safety  outcomes  [56].  Other  outcomes, 
including  quality  of  life,  functioning,  and  mental  health 
symptoms  are  also  important  [57],  but  were  beyond  the 
scope this umbrella review. Reductions in self-harm rep-
etition  may  not  always  align  with  patient  priorities,  and 
interventions  might  provide  benefits  in  broader  areas, 
including  general  functioning,  social  participation,  and 
engagement with services [57]. While we used a published 
search strategy, some reviews may have been missed, par-
ticularly  those  that  have  not  been  translated  to  English. 
We excluded reviews of qualitative research, which is an 
important  area  for  future  research.  However,  we  have 
completed a lived experience companion paper alongside 
this review, to enrich our summary of quantitative reviews 
and to provide an in-depth patient contextual viewpoint.

Comparisons with other research

Recent research has reported larger effect sizes for safety 
plans  in  emergency  department  settings  [13]  than  those 
seen in this umbrella review. Early findings from an UK-
based feasibility trial, suggest safety plans combined with 
psychological  interventions  may  improve  hope  and  care 
experiences  [58].  This  umbrella  review  supports  these 
findings, but also highlights research gaps that need to be 
considered  before  widespread  implementation  in  other 
healthcare  contexts.  Ongoing  trials  in  the  UK  evaluat-
ing safety plans for emergency presentations [58, 59] and 
with  autistic  individuals  [60],  may  further  develop  this 
evidence base.

Systematic reviews published after our search end date 
found no evidence of an effect for mentalisation therapy 
on  reducing  self-harm  repetition  compared  to  control 
groups [61], which is contrast to Witt et al. [21]. However, 
longer  treatment  durations  resulted  in  larger  reductions 
for  self-harm  repetition,  though  findings  were  based  on 
weaker pre-post designs [61]. Van Ballogooijen at al. [62] 
found evidence that both direct and indirect suicide pre-
vention  interventions  may  reduce  suicide  attempts.  In 
contrast, Meerwijk et al. [37] found that direct interven-
tions reduced the likelihood of suicide or attempted sui-
cide compared to controls.

Quinlivan et al. BMC Psychiatry         (2025) 25:1127 Page 22 of 25

Overall,  our  results  for  DBT  and  DBT  are  consistent 
with  other  reviews  [63,  64].  Our  findings  align  with  a 
recent umbrella review reporting CBT and DBT effective-
ness  for reducing the incidence of self-harm  and suicide 
re-attempts,  though  that  review  focused  on  adolescents 
[65].  In  contrast,  we  synthesised  evidence  from  broad 
interventions that may be effective for the wide spectrum 
of  patients  presenting  to  liaison  psychiatry  settings.  Our 
findings are aligned with calls for improved intervention 
trial quality [20]. We also highlight methodological limi-
tations  across  diverse  systematic  reviews  and  research 
gaps,  and  also  the  lack  of  lived  experience  involvement 
which weakens the strength of the evidence base.

Clinical and policy implications

Safety  plans  are  widely  considered  feasible  and  accept-
able [43] and are recommended by clinical guidelines [1] 
(to consider for use) and recent national UK policy [66]. 
However,  similar  to  risk  assessment  tools  [67],  safety 
plans may vary, in format, content, and use, and may be 
used superficially like tick-box assessments or punitively 
[68, 69]. Given the limited evidence base and widespread 
uptake,  it  is  important  that  safety  plans  are  collab-
oratively  developed  with  patients  and  healthcare  staff, 
with  continuous  evaluation  of  outcomes  and  treatment 
engagement. Safety plans should also be part of an over-
all  collaborative,  relational  clinical  assessment,  and  care 
package rather than a standalone intervention (e.g., pro-
vision of safety plan document alone). High quality prag-
matic trials and quality improvement studies are urgently 
needed,  particularly  for  people  who  have  self-harmed 
and are at risk of exclusion from services.

Evidence  for  CBT  and  DBT  highlight  the  importance 
of tailoring interventions to individual needs, clinical set-
tings, and patient priorities. CBT and DBT may be more 
suited  to  well-resourced  outpatient  clinics,  given  results 
indicating  greater  reductions  in  self-harm  repetition  for 
longer  follow-up  and  the  lack  of  evidence  for  the  effec-
tiveness  of  brief  adaptions  in  emergency  departments 
[21].  The  methodologically  weak  evidence  of  trials  for 
CBT/DBT  in  reducing  self-harm  and  suicide  risk,  may 
reflect challenges in conducting efficacy trials in this area 
[13].  Translation  to  real-world  clinical  practice  may  be 
influenced by patient acceptability, relevance, fidelity, and 
service  delivery  factors,  such  as  staffing,  time,  capacity, 
demand, and funding cuts [13]. Omission of patient-cen-
tred  outcomes  such  as  social  participation  and  quality-
of-life is also a long-standing issue with clinical trials for 
self-harm and suicide prevention [57].

Improving access to aftercare

There  is  considerable  unmet  clinical  need  for  therapeu-
tic intervention and relational care for patients who have 
self-harmed  or  presented  to  hospital  with  suicide  risk 

[10–12,  70].  Poor  access  to  psychosocial  assessments, 
compassionate  care,  increasing  demand,  and  limited 
capacity  to  deliver  timely  aftercare  for  people  who  have 
self-harmed  are  widely  reported  [10–12].  One  potential 
approach  to  improving  access  is  to  prioritise  aftercare 
based  on  risk  [71].  Existing  risk  assessment  tools  have 
limited predictive utility [72]. While recent research com-
bining clinician risk stratification with machine learning 
models  improved  global  predictive  accuracy  (as  mea-
sured  by  Area  under  the  Curve)  for  suicide  re-attempts 
in outpatient and emergency departments at 90 and 180-
day  follow-up  [71],  positive  predictive  values  remained 
low.  Even  with  high  sensitivity  or  specificity  levels,  and 
low risk thresholds [71], this may result in overly restric-
tive  care  for  those  misclassified  as  high-risk  and  missed 
care for others deemed as low risk. Longer follow-up (90 
to  180  days)  may  also  be  incongruent  with  fluctuating 
risk, and the widespread lack of access to aftercare.

Without universal, scalable interventions, risk prediction 
alone  could  lead  in  greater  inequitable  care  in  self-harm 
and  suicide  prevention.  Improved  and  renewed  research 
efforts  evaluating  brief  interventions,  as  part  of  a  whole-
system  care  pathways  may  address  this  clinical  need.  For 
example, the large Zero Suicide multi-site quality improve-
ment  trial,  demonstrated  reductions  in  suicide  attempts 
and  deaths  through  a  pathway-based,  multi-component 
intervention delivered to over 450,000 individuals monthly 
[73].  Central  components  included  safety  planning,  out-
patient  mental  health  care,  and  evidence-based  psycho-
therapy, suggesting potential benefits from comprehensive, 
integrated approaches tailored to local need [73].

Conclusion
Brief  contact  interventions,  particularly  those  incorpo-
rating  safety  planning,  are  consistently  associated  with 
reductions  in  suicide  re-attempts  in  liaison  psychiatry 
settings.  However,  despite  widespread  clinical  uptake, 
the  evidence  for  standalone  safety  planning  interven-
tions remains methodologically limited with questionable 
generalisability. Tailored, longer-term structured psycho-
logical therapies (CBT/DBT) demonstrated greater effec-
tiveness  in  reducing  suicide  re-attempts  and  self-harm 
repetition,  than  brief  adaptations  for  emergency  depart-
ments.  Overall,  evidence  quality  of  primary  research 
was limited, with substantial heterogeneity and a lack of 
reported patient involvement. Substantial unmet clinical 
need for people presenting to hospital with self-harm or 
suicide risk, is compounded by poor access to therapeu-
tic  interventions,  limited  capacity,  and  inequitable  care. 
Future research should prioritise high-quality trials, qual-
ity improvement studies, and whole-system intervention 
evaluations.  Interventions  may  be  more  effective  if  they 
incorporate patient priorities, broader outcomes, and are 
co-developed with those with lived experience.
