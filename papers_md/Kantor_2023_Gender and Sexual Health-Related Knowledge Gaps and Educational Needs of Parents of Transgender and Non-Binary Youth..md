Abstract
Parents can have a substantial impact on adolescent sexual decision-making, but few studies have explored the role of parents 
in providing sexual health information to transgender and non-binary (TNB) youth, a population that experiences significant 
sexual and mental health disparities and lower levels of perceived family support compared with other youth. This study 
aimed to elucidate existing knowledge gaps and content deemed important for a sexual health curriculum and educational 
materials for parents of TNB youth. We conducted 21 qualitative interviews with five parents of TNB youth, 11 TNB youth 
aged 18+, and five healthcare affiliates to identify parents’ educational needs. We analyzed the data using theoretical thematic 
analysis and consensus coding. Parents self-reported multiple knowledge deficits regarding gender/sexual health for TNB 
individuals and were primarily concerned with long-term impacts of medical interventions. Youth goals for parents included 
greater understanding of gender/sexuality and sufficient knowledge to support youth through social transition to their affirmed 
gender identity. Content areas suggested for a future curriculum for parents of TNB youth included: basics of gender/sexual-
ity, diverse narratives of TNB experiences/identities, gender dysphoria, non-medical gender-affirming interventions, medical 
gender-affirming interventions, and resources for peer support. Parents desired access to accurate information and wanted 
to feel equipped to facilitate affirming conversations with their child, something that could combat health disparities among 
TNB youth. An educational curriculum for parents has the potential to provide a trusted information source, expose parents 
to positive representations of TNB individuals, and help parents support their TNB child through decisions about potential 
gender-affirming interventions.

Introduction

Transgender and non-binary (TNB) youth experience bar-
riers to accessing comprehensive and inclusive sex educa-
tion (Bradford et al., 2019; Haley et al., 2019; Tordoff et al.,

2021). In a representative study of 3038 youth aged 12–24, 
adolescents identified their parents as being the most influen-
tial people in shaping their sexual decision-making—includ-
ing age of sexual debut and use of contraception, condoms, 
and sexually transmitted infection (STI) testing—with 52% 
of youth aged 12–15 and 32% of youth aged 16–19 report-
ing parents as the most influential factor (Guilamo-Ramos 
et al., 2020; Power to Decide, 2016). Only 17% of youth 
aged 12–15 and 28% of youth aged 16–19 reported that their 
friends were the most influential people in shaping their 
sexual decision-making (Power to Decide, 2016). However, 
few studies have explored the role of parents in providing 
sexual health information to TNB youth specifically. This 
area of research is particularly important given the evidence 
that transgender adolescents are at higher risk of acquiring 
HIV and other STIs and are more likely to report the use 
of drugs or alcohol before last sexual intercourse (Garofalo 
et al., 2006; Herbst et al., 2008; Johns et al., 2019; Reisner 

Vol.:(0123456789)1 3

et al., 2019). This research is also particularly essential and 
salient at this moment, given escalating legislative attacks on 
LGBTQ-affirming content in schools and access to gender-
affirming care for TNB youth (Barbee et al., 2022; Kremen 
et al., 2021).

Studies have shown that parental responses to their child’s 
lesbian, gay, or bisexual identity correlate with mental and 
physical health outcomes for the child (Huebner et al., 2013). 
It has been demonstrated that some parents experience and 
display strong negative emotional reactions when their child 
first comes out as LGBTQ, which can have a profoundly 
negative impact on their child’s well-being. Negative paren-
tal reactions are correlated with increased risk of suicide 
attempts and substance misuse among sexual minority youth 
(Beeler & Diprova, 1999; Ryan et al., 2009; Saltzburg, 2004) 
and LGBTQ youth more broadly (Newcomb et al., 2019, 
2020).

Conversely, there is also substantial research to suggest 
that family support is a protective mechanism for TNB youth 
with respect to a wide range of health disparities (Bockting 
et al, 2013; Grossman et al., 2006, 2021; Olson et al., 2016; 
Ryan et al., 2010, Valente et al., 2020). The literature on TNB 
youth has documented elevated rates of poly-victimization 
(such as bullying, violence, and family rejection), suicidal-
ity, anxiety, and depression among TNB youth compared to 
their cisgender peers (James et al., 2016; Newcomb et al., 
2020; Olson et al., 2015; Reisner et al., 2015; Wilson et al., 
2009). However, family connectedness and parental support 
has consistently been associated with improved outcomes 
across many of these domains for TNB youth, including 
lower rates of depression, suicidal ideation, disordered eat-
ing, PTSD, and perceived burden of being transgender, as 
well as improved self-esteem, quality of life, and reports of 
increased condom use during sex (Andrzejewski et al., 2021; 
Bauer et al., 2015; Johns et al., 2018; Olson et al., 2015; 
Simons et al., 2013; Veale et al., 2017; Watson et al., 2016; 
Wilson et al., 2012, 2016). Further, the National Transgender 
Discrimination Survey found that compared to those with 
unsupportive families, transgender respondents with family 
support were less likely to have ever engaged in sex work, 
experienced homelessness, or attempted suicide (James 
et al., 2016). A number of these studies have called for more 
research into specific interventions that will promote parental 
acceptance and support.

Many parents of LGBTQ youth desire access to infor-
mation that will help them support their child’s health and 
well-being (Mustanski et al., 2017; Newcomb et al., 2019, 
2020). Even among this group of parents who intend to be 
supportive, many lack the knowledge and skills necessary to 
help their LGBTQ child navigate future dating and sexual 
relationships (e.g., due to limited knowledge of STIs and 
safer sex practices specific to LGBTQ individuals) (Mustan-
ski et al., 2017; Newcomb et al., 2019, 2020).

Finding useful and accurate sexual health information 
as a parent may be particularly difficult for parents of TNB 
youth, and a lack of resources may exacerbate parental feel-
ings of helplessness and confusion. An international litera-
ture review by Sharek et al. (2018) examined the experiences 
of transgender young people and their families and found 
that their families experienced extensive difficulty accessing 
information about transgender identities. Family members’ 
ability to make sense of their loved one’s transgender identity 
was correlated with their ability to access appropriate, useful, 
and relevant information on this topic. Even among families 
who described finding information that improved their abil-
ity to support their child, most families still felt there were 
insufficient educational resources available to them. This lack 
of information often exacerbated parental feelings of power-
lessness, which sometimes led to parents envisioning worst 
case scenarios for their child.

When resources were available to family members, self-
education was seen as an active and positive coping strat-
egy for confusion, anger, and other initial negative emotions 
that arose after their loved one came out to them (Sharek 
et al., 2018). Most family members accessed information 
through the internet, although some learned about gender 
identity directly from their transgender family member or 
from healthcare professionals. Healthcare professionals were 
described as helpful in facilitating conversations, develop-
ing parents’ understanding of their child’s gender identity, 
and brainstorming how they could best support their child. 
Education and accurate information helped parents feel 
more secure in their ability to parent a transgender child, 
less guilty or confused about supporting their child’s choices, 
and more confident in their ability to make the best decisions 
for their child moving forward. Gaining knowledge was also 
associated with helping parents feel less isolated and alone. 
Another notable finding from this review was that access to 
information and education was instrumental in allowing fam-
ily members to move beyond their individual lens (e.g., sim-
ply accepting and supporting their personal family member) 
toward broader empowerment to advocate for their family 
member and other TNB people.

Additionally, most sources of puberty and sexual health 
information utilize binary and cisnormative language about 
bodies and often exclude information on non-normative gen-
ders and sexualities (Riggs & Bartholomaeus, 2018). Thus, 
TNB youth and their parents face challenges in accessing 
information on these topics that is both medically accurate 
and inclusive of TNB people. One study of online resource 
use by transgender youth and their parents found that while 
looking for information, youth and parents often encountered 
blatant misinformation and hate speech against transgender 
people (Evans et al., 2017). Many parents in the study dis-
cussed internet research as being risky and that some online 
articles were laced with malicious messaging against TNB

persons. Because of these challenges, it is important that par-
ents of TNB youth are able to access accurate sexual health 
information relevant to the experiences of TNB youth and 
that they know how to discuss it with their children in an 
affirming manner.

Though it is clear that familial knowledge, education, and 
support is important for TNB youth, few studies have specifi-
cally examined the needs of parents raising TNB children. 
One study examined the experiences of parents raising TNB 
children and found that the most common parental needs 
were for information (research and guidelines), social sup-
port, and educational resources to provide to schools, peers, 
professionals, and their local community (Riley et al., 2013a). 
Parents in this study believed that access to information and 
resources would provide them with skills to counteract bul-
lying and negativity toward themselves and their children, as 
well as help them tolerate the uncertainty of not definitively 
knowing future outcomes for their child (Riley et al., 2013a).
Another study assessed the retrospective childhood expe-
riences of transgender adults and found that these adults 
wished their parents had increased access to information 
about transgender identities and experiences in order to assist 
in conversations with other family members, teachers, and 
parents. The study also found that these transgender adults 
believed their parents would have benefitted from access to 
peer support and educated health professionals (Riley et al., 
2013b). A study examining the success of an educational and 
therapeutic support group for parents of transgender youth 
also found that active parent participants were more likely 
to report improved parental functioning, harmonization of 
the parent–child relationship, peaceful family dynamics, and 
improved adolescent behavior (Boivin et al., 2020). However, 
to our knowledge, no study has assessed explicit content areas 
that TNB youth and parents deem important for parents.

To fill this literature gap, we aimed to identify needed 
content areas with respect to gender, sexuality, puberty, and 
sexual health for parents raising TNB youth. This is a second-
ary analysis of a qualitative study that aimed to understand 
deficits in sex education content experienced by TNB youth 
and to identify content and best practices for a comprehen-
sive and trans-inclusive curriculum for TNB youth and their 
families. Two prior sub-analyses explored the sexual health 
education needs of TNB youth. The first assessed prior sex 
education experiences of TNB youth and recommended cur-
ricular content for a gender and sexual education program tai-
lored to TNB youth (Haley et al., 2019). The second explored 
the importance of employing transgender-inclusive language 
during the delivery of sexual health content for TNB youth 
(Tordoff et al., 2021). The analysis presented here shifts the 
focus to parental perspectives and aims to identify gaps in 
sources of sexual health information available to parents of 
TNB youth and explore content deemed necessary or desir-
able to include in a curriculum for parents of TNB youth.

Method

Participants

A total of 21 interviews were conducted among five par-
ents of TNB youth, five healthcare affiliates associated 
with the Seattle Children’s Gender Clinic (SCGC), and 
11 youth aged 18 or older, including six transmasculine, 
three transfeminine, and two non-binary individuals. For 
the purposes of this study and recruitment materials, we 
used the term transgender as an umbrella term to describe 
a diverse group of people who have a gender identity that 
differs from the sex they were assigned at birth. The term 
non-binary refers to individuals with gender identities that 
exist outside binary notions of gender (male/female, man/
woman, and boy/girl) and may identify as neither male nor 
female, both male and female, no gender at all, or as dif-
ferent genders at different times. Youth and parent partici-
pants were recruited in-person at Seattle Children’s Gender 
Clinic (SCGC) by posting fliers and study announcements 
throughout the clinic as well as through regional listservs 
of transgender community organizations.

Youth participants ranged from 18 to 26 years old. We 
intentionally recruited TNB youth spanning late adoles-
cence into young adulthood (ages 18–26) to capture a range 
of perspectives, from impressions after recently experi-
encing sex education to reflections after a few more years 
of lived experience. Existing literature on parenting TNB 
youth focuses primarily on the perspectives and experi-
ences of parents and caregivers; therefore, we intention-
ally recruited more youth than parent participants. As the 
recipients of the information and the individuals with the 
lived experience of being TNB, we consider the youth per-
spectives on what they believe their parents should know 
to be just as valuable as the perspectives of the parent 
participants.

All parents interviewed were cisgender women, includ-
ing four parents of transmasculine children and one parent 
of a non-binary child, whose children’s ages ranged from 
14 to 24 years old. Although efforts were made to include 
male parents/caregivers, all who were approached were not 
interested or unavailable to participate in the study. The 
parents of TNB youth interviewed in this study were not 
parents of the interviewed TNB youth. This methodological 
decision was made to maximize the likelihood that youth 
and parents could speak honestly about their experiences 
without being concerned about what their child/parent may 
separately say to the same interviewer.

Lastly, as practitioners working with both TNB youth 
and their families, the healthcare affiliates provided a 
unique and important perspective that was not provided 
by youth and parents alone. Healthcare affiliates were 

1 32188

identified by the authors, contacted directly, and sam-
pled to be representative of the major care roles at SCGC. 
Healthcare affiliates included three physicians (an adoles-
cent medicine specialist, a pediatric endocrinologist, and a 
pediatric primary care physician), a licensed clinical social 
worker, and a patient advocate who serves on the commu-
nity advisory board for SCGC. All interviewed youth and 
parent participants were white (Table 1).

Procedure

We conducted 30–60 min qualitative, semi-structured inter-
views in order to identify the sexual health education needs 
of TNB youth and their parents. Interviews with parents and 
youth were conducted either in-person or via phone based 
on participants’ preferences. In-person interviews were con-
ducted at a preferred location for TNB youth and parents (i.e., 
a café, their home). Interviews with healthcare affiliates were 
conducted in-person in the healthcare affiliate’s office. All 
interviews were conducted by one researcher (DMT), a white 
cisgender woman and doctoral student with over five years 
of experience working with LGBTQ youth.

An interview guide was developed, and additional probes 
were added throughout the interview process based on what 
came up for participants. Interview questions varied based on 

Table 1   Demographic characteristics of youth and parent participants

participant type, and example prompts are available in Sup-
plement 1. We asked questions about the following topics: 
sources of information about sexual health, parent–child con-
versations about sexual health, knowledge gaps and desired 
content areas for a future curriculum, the importance of 
having access to sexual health information, healthcare affili-
ate interactions with patients and their parents, and desired 
modes of delivery for a curriculum (Table 1). All parent and 
youth participants who completed the interview received 
$20; healthcare affiliates were not compensated for their time. 
All interviews were completed prior to beginning the coding 
and analysis phase. Interviews continued until the interviewer 
detected an acceptable degree of consistency/saturation on 
major topic areas using methods of theoretical saturation 
(Sandelowski, 1995; Saunders et al., 2018). We acknowl-
edge that saturation end points in qualitative research are 
inherently subjective and influenced by both participant and 
interviewer identities; thus, a single study should never be 
assumed to provide the “whole picture” on a given qualitative 
topic (see additional discussion on this Limitations section). 
The methods for this study have been previously described in 
more detail (Haley et al., 2019; Tordoff et al., 2021).

Coding and Analysis

Conversations Prior to Coming Out

Theoretical thematic analysis techniques were used to ana-
lyze the transcribed interviews and to identify patterns and 
themes within qualitative data (Braun & Clarke, 2006). A 
codebook of main subthemes was developed, and consen-
sus coding was conducted by three independent researchers 
(LZK, DMT, and SGH) in Atlas.ti Version 8. We created 
the preliminary codebook based on prior research, clini-
cal experience, and the interview guide. Next, members of 
the analysis team each independently reviewed and coded a 
sample of three (14%) exemplar interview transcripts, dis-
cussed and compared coding, and refined the preliminary 
codebook. After the development of the preliminary code-
book, each coder independently read the remaining (n = 19, 
86%) transcribed interviews and applied existing codes to 
the text. Additional codes were added to the codebook using 
an inductive approach to identify new themes based on the 
data. Coders also made comments in the master codebook 
to create, collapse, or refine theme definitions; modifica-
tions to the codebook were documented to ensure accuracy/
consistency in the application of the codes. After transcripts 
were independently coded, annotated transcripts were com-
bined, and each code application was jointly reviewed by all 
three coders to ensure consensus. Every difference in coding 
was discussed among all three coders until consensus was 
obtained. Participant categories (e.g., youth, parents, and 
healthcare affiliates) were initially analyzed separately, then 
subsequently compared and contrasted. All three coders have 
clinical experience working with TNB youth and include a 
white non-binary medical student, a white cisgender doctoral 
student, and a white cisgender pediatrician.

Results

Three main themes emerged in discussion with participants: 
(1) the importance and perceived effectiveness of par-
ent–child conversations about sexual health, puberty, and 
gender, (2) perceived barriers to parents accessing trusted 
sources of information, and (3) deficits in gender and sexual 
health knowledge relevant for TNB youth, with correspond-
ing desired curricular content for parents. Table 2 summa-
rizes themes and exemplar quotes.

Parent–Child Conversations

Every parent and youth participant described at least one par-
ent–child conversation about sexual health and puberty, with 
significant variation in the content covered and perceived 
effectiveness of the conversation. Participants characterized 
these conversations relative to whether or not the youth had 
already disclosed their TNB identity to their parent.

Every parent described some conversation prior to their child 
coming out as TNB, often before their child began puberty: 
“It’s important to start talking about their sexual health when 
they’re young and start to be curious about their bodies and 
why they have the parts that they do” (ID14). During these 
“pre-coming out” conversations about puberty, parents 
assumed their child would experience a puberty that was 
aligned with their sex assigned a birth (sometimes described 
by youth participants as “cisgender puberty”). In addition to 
verbal conversations, some parents recalled providing books, 
pamphlets, and other written materials to their child. Com-
mon goals described by parents during these conversations 
were approachability, honesty, use of clear and anatomical 
language, and using the child’s curiosity as a cue to offer 
further information. Several parents recounted teaching their 
children to use anatomical terms for their body parts. One 
parent shared, “We call body parts what they are, we didn’t 
come up with little nicknames for them” (ID12). Most parents 
tried to create a level of comfort that encouraged their child to 
approach them with questions and concerns: “It was always 
our goal with our children to establish a relationship where 
they could come to us with questions” (ID14).

Prior to their child coming out, parents focused on provid-
ing information about general sexual health topics, particu-
larly around the basics of puberty and anatomy, and occa-
sionally on topics related to pregnancy and STI prevention. 
None of the parent participants reported discussing gender 
identity with their children prior to the youth coming out as 
transgender. There was a thematic tension across interviews 
between parent and youth participant themes on this topic. 
Parents described aiming to present themselves as approach-
able for their children’s questions and concerns. In contrast, 
youth participants expressed a wide range of comfort levels 
when discussing sexual health topics with their parents.

Youth participants recounted that parent–child conversa-
tions were often a source of basic puberty education, though 
these conversations were often felt to be insufficient for their 
needs. One youth shared that they had “some fairly limited 
conversations about sex and puberty” with their parents 
(ID1). Many youth participants felt that their parents did not 
do an adequate job providing them with information. Others 
experienced general discomfort or embarrassment talking to 
their parents about puberty and sexual health. These youth 
shared that discussing sex with parents simply felt “weird,” 
whereas for others, undercurrents of chronic parent–child 
tension made openness on an intimate topic like sex unthink-
able. One participant summarized, “I didn’t have a very func-
tional relationship with much of my family, so they probably 
weren’t the best people to ask” (ID2). Most youth described 
obtaining the majority of their sexual health and puberty 
knowledge from peers and online sources, with few youth

Among youth who were out to their parents as transgender, 
many described having to teach their parents about gen-

situation usually described this as a positive, comfortable 
dynamic, and also believed that their child explicitly did not 
want to be taught by a parent:

I’ve let my child find [information] on their own, and 
whenever they want to share things with me, we talk 
about it…the conversations are started by the child, 
because that seems to work best…[My children] don’t 
really want me to teach them. They want to come into 
conversations with me as more of an equal having their 
own knowledge…they are, to some extent, part of a 
different culture than we are, and they like to educate 
us about that culture. That always goes better than me 
trying to hand them resources. (ID15)

ing to be the sole source of information for their parents on 
gender and sexuality-related topics. There was a tension 
between parents believing that it was most effective to let 
their child educate them about these topics, and youth wish-
ing their parents had sought out other sources of informa-
tion. One non-binary youth believed that parents should 
“look [information] up on their own after their kid comes 
out” and described feeling “upset” that all of their parents’ 
knowledge about transgender health and identity had to come 
from them (ID10). Multiple youth participants discussed the 
emotional labor that was inherent to educating their parents 
on these topics:

It's important for parents and other adults in children's 
lives to understand [transgender health], and how [par-
ents] can be supportive, so that youth don’t have to bear 
the burden of doing all the emotional labor of educating 
everyone in their lives when they’re still figuring this 
out. (ID3)

A healthcare affiliate emphasized that youth should not 
be responsible for educating their parents, because when 
parents are already informed, they are better able to fulfill 
their responsibilities as parents in sexual health discussions, 
such as talking with their child about setting boundaries in 
relationships and safer sex practices:

My goal with parents is to get them to a place of 
decreased intimidation about [transgender topics] and 
not relying on their kids to be the expert about being 
transgender. The kids are just being kids. They happen 

to be trans or gender nonconforming. Doesn’t mean 
they know the lay of the land. So I want parents to rec-
ognize that they still have a parental responsibility. And 
if their kids don’t know, it’s still their responsibility to 
step in as much as they can. (ID20)

Overall, youth, parents, and healthcare affiliates agreed 
that parent–child conversations around puberty, sexual 
health, and gender serve a dual purpose as an important 
means of (1) social support for TNB youth and (2) promotion 
of safety across multiple domains, including physical safety 
against STIs, unwanted pregnancy, and sexual violence, as 
well as emotional safety through healthy romantic relation-
ships. One healthcare affiliate emphasized the importance of 
parental confidence in topics about sexual health and gender 
identity in order to encourage safe and affirming romantic 
and/or sexual relationships for their child.

For parents, the more you step into this and the more 
confidence you have [in leading these conversations], 
the better you’re going to be able to serve your child. 
Hopefully, fit that into the same [conversations] that 
parents of [cisgender] kids also need to [have]: talk 
about safety and not just safety with respect to sex 
but safety with navigating relationships, safety from 
decreasing situations where sexual assault could hap-
pen, that kind of thing. (ID20)

Youth participants echoed many of these sentiments and 
believed that their parents would have been better able to 
support them had they sought out or had access to more 
transgender-specific sexual education resources. One youth 
shared that their parents “were the people I trusted most, and I 
wanted to talk to them, but they didn’t know anything either” 
(ID9). Parents, youth, and healthcare affiliates all believed 
that baseline parental knowledge about TNB sexual health 
and confidence played a role in the effectiveness of these 
conversations.

Barriers to Accessing Information

Youth, parents, and healthcare affiliates all discussed vary-
ing levels of concern about the reliability and accuracy of 
information they found online. Healthcare affiliates noted 
that youth tended to be more trusting of information they 
found online, whereas parents “tend to be pretty skeptical of 
all online sources” (ID17). This resulted in parents relying 
on their child as their primary source of information, which 
was coming primarily from online sources that the parent 
did not trust.

Parents who described seeking independent resources 
often struggled to find credible sources of information. This 
was particularly difficult for parents once their child began 

1 3 
Archives of Sexual Behavior (2023) 52:2185–2203 

2193

seeking medical interventions, such as hormone replacement 
therapy (HRT).

transition-specific concepts (e.g., HRT, binding) in order to 
support them throughout their transition.

When he started saying “I want to go on T [i.e., testos-
terone]; I want to have top surgery” then we were like, 
“Where’s the research?” And it was incredibly hard to 
find…I was literally at the library, trying to look up 
medical articles, and I can hardly read them. But I just 
wanted to know, what are the side effects, just kind of 
the basic stuff before I’d even gotten to talk to a doctor. 
(ID15)

One parent expressed concerns about relying exclusively 
on physicians, particularly in the context of information on 
fertility preservation. She recalled desiring information about 
HRT and the fertility “decisions you need to make together” 
(i.e., egg/sperm freezing), because “some doctors are better 
at talking you through all that than others…and you may end 
up talking to a doctor who kind of blows by that” (ID15). 
This parent also noted that because youth are “pretty adept 
at researching online,” they often have more information 
than the parent, which can create a knowledge imbalance. 
For example, in conversations about medical interventions 
the child is hoping to access, parents were concerned that 
their child may not share information about potential com-
plications or other aspects they know their parent would be 
apprehensive about.

Recommended Curricular Content for Parents 
of TNB Youth

Almost all participants agreed that TNB youth and their par-
ents have fundamentally different educational needs around 
the topics of gender and sexual health and believed it was 
important for separate resources to be specifically designed 
for parents of TNB youth. Participants recommended the 
following six content areas be included in a gender and 
sexual health curriculum aimed at parents of TNB youth: 
basic information on gender identity and trans-competence, 
diverse narratives of TNB experiences and identities, gen-
der dysphoria, non-medical gender-affirming interventions, 
medical gender-affirming interventions, and resources for 
peer support.

Participants discussed multiple reasons for educating 
parents separately from youth. Namely, for parents, con-
versations related to sexual health were often eclipsed by 
conversations about gender identity and safety of gender-
affirming interventions. Parents tended to be more concerned 
with long-term considerations of transitioning (e.g., fertility 
preservation; health risks associated with HRT; concerns 
about future desistence of TNB identity, or that identifying 
as TNB is a “phase”), whereas youth were more concerned 
that their parents understand the breadth of diversity within 
gender and sexuality and have a broad understanding of 

In addition, participants believed that separate youth and 
parent curricula would help parents process their fears and 
other emotions separately from their kids, as well as allow 
them to learn how to best support their child:

I had to work on a lot of shame in my own self. Even 
though I wasn’t—I really honestly had no problem with 
my kid being trans. I had to work on the grief of letting 
go of the future I had pictured my kid having. And it 
changed our relationship. I used to be in the little club 
of people known as moms who have daughters. I’m not 
in that club anymore, exactly. So, that kind of work, I 
would not want parents to be doing in front of their 
kids. That’s why I’m like, “They [i.e., parents and their 
TNB children] have separate needs.” (ID12)

Information on Gender Identity and Trans‑Competence

Almost all youth and parents described the need for a cur-
riculum to address basic concepts about gender identity and 
sexual orientation. Parents often described the revelation of 
learning that sex assigned at birth is a separate concept from 
one’s from gender identity, and different still from sexual 
orientation. While a number of parents believed they had a 
strong understanding of these concepts at the time of being 
interviewed for this study, they often expressed that having 
this information earlier would have been helpful to “give 
them all of the pieces so they can start to see how they fit 
together…sexuality, gender identity, [and] gender expres-
sion” (ID16).

Other parents expressed continued confusion about the 
differences between gender and sexuality, and discomfort 
with concepts related to TNB identities:

[Resources I’ve seen] don’t really talk much about the 
different genders that you could pick to be, or not pick 
to be, but that you could be. Like I know that you can 
be transgender, or you can be gay, or bi, or…Well, I 
guess, no, that’s different because your sexuality and 
your gender are different. And they don’t tell you that 
either. (ID13)

Many participants also felt it was important to consider 
how non-binary and intersex identities and experiences fit 
in their framework for understanding gender and “biologi-
cal” sex. A number of participants specifically identified 
knowledge deficits about non-binary gender identities and 
advocated for curricular inclusion of this population: “it 
shouldn’t make assumptions about two genders” (ID12). In 
addition, several participants explained how learning about 
intersex identities helped them to understand how even sex 
is not binary: “Not everyone is born completely female and 

1 32194

Archives of Sexual Behavior (2023) 52:2185–2203

completely male. I don’t think people understand that there 
are some people who are XXY…These are not even things 
that have ever come across their view of the world” (ID14).
One parent revealed the damaging impact of her anti-
transgender bias on her ability to have supportive conver-
sations with her child. Specifically, this parent described 
disagreeing with her transmasculine son about the validity 
of non-binary identities, which led to tense, unproductive 
conversations between them.

From the parent’s perspective [we get asked], “Will 
they change their mind once we start hormones?” 
[There] is this misconception that this young person–
how do they know what they want to be at this age? 
And again, “Will they change their mind? Because 
we’re human we always change our mind.” So I have 
to say that we don’t have a whole lot of evidence that 
people do change their mind; identity usually doesn’t 
change. (ID21)

Whenever I talk to my son, it sometimes can be difficult 
because I feel like he’s very judgmental of me…If I say, 
“it’s going too far to expect people to call somebody 
that is gender fluid ‘they’ or nothing at all, then how are 
you supposed to address that person?” And he thinks 
that is just wrong, and I’m just not right because I say 
that. And that makes me feel very judged. It makes me 
feel like he thinks I’m a bad person. It makes it very 
difficult [to have conversations]. (ID13)

Consistent with our previous findings, most parents rec-
ognized the importance of using gender-affirming and trans-
competent language when discussing anatomy and sexual 
health with TNB youth. One parent noted, “It seems [like] 
unnecessary, complicated language…[but] I think under-
standing that this is not just what people dismiss as politically 
correct language, this is part of someone’s identity that you 
have to respect” (ID15).

Beyond understanding basic concepts and terminology 
related to gender identity and sexual orientation, some par-
ents described being concerned that their child’s gender iden-
tity is a choice or could be a phase (“My husband wanted to 
know things like…‘what if my kid changes their mind?’”), 
while other parents expressed frustration that other adults 
disregard the validity of their child’s TNB identity.

I think the biggest [myth] is that people think this is a 
choice that a kid makes, to be trans…They’re thinking 
that you’ve got a teenager [that] just decided one day 
that they wanted to be trans. I think a lot of parents who 
don’t accept that their kid is trans, it’s because they feel 
that their child has decided they want to be this, and it’s 
just a fad that’s going to pass. I mean, I wondered that 
too when we first faced this, but I’ve since learned that 
no, that’s not the way it goes. (ID16)

This sentiment was strongly echoed by the youth par-
ticipants, who felt that parents should understand that their 
gender identity was not a choice. One youth stated that many 
of their family members believe that they could choose not 
to be TNB, which was very upsetting for them: “[My] fam-
ily members…think ‘you don’t have to choose to be this’” 
(ID10). This was also mentioned by healthcare affiliates, who 
regularly field questions about how often TNB youth “change 
their minds.”

Inclusion of Diverse Narratives

Youth and parents desired exposure to a diverse set of narra-
tives and representations of TNB individuals and their expe-
riences. Parents believed this could be reassuring to other 
parents, and potentially lessen concerns about obstacles and 
hardships their child may face. Youth believed the use of 
narratives and positive representations of TNB people would 
normalize the experiences of TNB people and expose parents 
to the broad range of identities and life paths that are possi-
ble for TNB people. For example, one parent described how 
personal story-telling has helped her build empathy, under-
standing, and hope for her child:

[When I hear] stories about people who don’t identify 
as one of the binary sexes, male or female, and these 
people sharing personal stories…[it] give[s] me insight 
as to how my child might be feeling. And also, it helps 
me understand better how to respond to people who 
don’t identify in the traditional way we’ve been taught 
to see gender. And I think that’s incredibly helpful too 
because…we’re not our sexuality. We’re people, and 
our sexuality is one part of our identity. And people 
sharing their stories about how it is to be seen as differ-
ent and how they perceive barriers, the things that make 
them sad, the things that cause them pain, and then 
how they triumph through those challenges and find 
people who support them. I really enjoy those stories 
because it gives me hope that my own child’s going to 
be okay. (ID15)

Another parent emphasized the importance of holistic rep-
resentation and inclusion of TNB people across life stages:

First of all, just feature trans kids, and trans parents, and 
trans everybody…It should have all that kind of–that 
lens of equity to look at the entire thing holistically. But 
it also should just normalize the experience. It should 
also leave a lot of spaciousness for the incredible diver-
sity of the experience. (ID12)

Some youth emphasized the importance of narratives that 
exemplify the difference between gender and sexual orienta-
tion (e.g., that a transmasculine person may identify as gay). 
One parent noted that in order to be a supportive parent, it 

1 3 
Archives of Sexual Behavior (2023) 52:2185–2203 

2195

was important for her to understand these differences and 
be comfortable with her child discovering new aspects of 
his identity.

I have a trans son, and I have no idea who he’s really 
attracted to. And I’ve asked him, but I’m not sure he 
really understands at this point. Parents need to under-
stand maybe that it is a fluid sort of thing for these kids, 
and maybe you just need to give it time until things sort 
out…We’re always taught the binary system that there 
are males and females, [and] parents are going to have 
a difficult time, I think, understanding the intricacies of 
the world in which that is not true. (ID16)

Gender Dysphoria

Most youth participants talked in detail about experiencing 
gender dysphoria and the impact it had on their well-being, 
both in general and specifically for their sexual health. The 
term “gender dysphoria” defines both a medical diagnosis, 
as well as an embodied experience, and can be described as 
an “incongruence” between one’s gender and sex assigned 
at birth and may be “associated with clinically significant 
distress or impairment in social, school, or other important 
areas of functioning” (American Psychiatric Association, 
2013). Importantly, not all TNB people experience distress 
related to incongruence between their assigned and identified 
gender, but some do, especially in the absence of gender-
affirming interventions that align their body more closely 
with their gender. For youth in our study, gender dysphoria 
was particularly relevant in the context of puberty, a time that 
many youth and healthcare affiliates described as a period of 
worsening gender dysphoria and heightened distress.

Youth participants felt that gender dysphoria was an 
important topic for their parents to learn about. One youth 
shared that they desired a curriculum that teaches parents in 
“how to affirm [their child] or how to help them with [gender] 
dysphoria” (ID11). Healthcare affiliates in particular believed 
that it was important for parents to understand that puberty 
can increase gender dysphoria for their children.

For a lot of people, the case is that puberty worsens 
gender dysphoria, right? So helping parents understand 
that and how that might fit into their child’s story when 
[parents say], “Oh, I don’t know how suddenly, two 
years ago, their grades dropped, and they got really 
upset, and they lost all their friends, and also puberty.” 
And I’m like, “Okay, how do we connect those dots?” 
Because if you’re not looking for it, you don’t. (ID17)

Only one parent participant explicitly referenced gender 
dysphoria, though many described interactions with their 
child that were likely related to gender dysphoria.

There’s also the gender dysphoria piece, so [that] I 
understand why [my son] wants to wear [a binder]…
something that makes really clear, this why your child 
is going to want to do it. I don’t think you can have 
a curriculum that doesn’t include [dysphoria], so that 
we [i.e., parents] realize it’s real and take it seriously. 
(ID15)

Non‑Medical Gender‑Affirming Interventions

Youth and parents advocated for the inclusion of basic infor-
mation about non-medical gender-affirming techniques, such 
as binding, packing, stand-to-pee devices, tucking, electroly-
sis, voice therapy, bras, make-up, and more (Table 3). In 
general, youth were fairly informed about what options were 
available to them (primarily through online research) and 
felt that their parents knew little about these topics. Some 
youth believed parental access to this information would be 
particularly important for ensuring the safety of their children 
when using these aids:

When I was binding unsafely, my mom didn’t really 
know about binding safety. If I said, “No, it’s fine,” 
she just had to take my word for it. Which was con-
venient for me, if I wanted to keep binding, but for 
safety reasons, I think it’s important that parents can 
access the information on their own, just because not 
everyone else is going to be upfront about it. And it’s

easier for my mom to point out to me that I need to 
stop binding because it's not safe than for me to make 
that decision on my own. (ID10)

One parent described learning about safety concerns 
around binding from her child’s physician and explained 
that understanding binding helped her comprehend her 
child’s desire for top surgery.

[I] didn’t realize until we went to speak with the doc-
tors at the gender clinic that some kids wore their 
binders 24 hours a day. Even just the amount of anxi-
ety my son can have over not having a clean binder 
available on Monday morning, that’s enough that you 
might not be able to go to school. And that sounds 
crazy to a [cisgender] parent, but it’s not…I think one 
reason that top surgery really makes sense to me is 
because the alternative is a binder. And the fact is, if 
you can move and breathe, you’re just a lot better off 
than if you can’t. I felt differently about [top surgery] 
after learning more about the binder. (ID15)

Supporting youth as they explore their gender presenta-
tion, particularly through clothing, was a common theme. 
One parent noted that parents should understand why attire 
matters so much to their TNB youth:

For a parent, [gender expression] can translate as 
unreasonable concern over clothing, which we think 
of, I think, as something teenagers are too obsessed 
about. But this is different…[for trans youth] this is 
not a status thing [or a] competing with my classmate 
thing. This is who I am. (ID16)

Medical Gender‑Affirming Interventions

Puberty blockers (gonadotropin-releasing hormone ago-
nists), HRT, and gender-affirming surgeries were discussed 
by all participants and identified as essential content to 
include in a curriculum for parents of TNB youth. Although 
not every TNB individual will desire all (or any) of these 
medical interventions, almost every participant believed 
they were essential topics about which parents should be 
familiar. Parents were more concerned about possible long-
term complications (health risks associated with HRT, fer-
tility preservation, surgical outcomes), whereas youth were 
more concerned that their parents be informed enough to 
support them as they navigated the medical system.

One parent described concerns that arose during the pro-
cess of their child starting testosterone therapy and devel-
oping clitoromegaly—a common and often desired effect 
of initiating testosterone:

Going through the consent form on [testosterone] and 
going through what the possible side effects are, we do 
kind of slide past what happens to your genitals when 
you’re on T. I mean, it was kind of mentioned, but I’m 
thinking: What are the ramifications of that? Are we 
going to need different kinds of underwear? Do you get 
very sensitive? Do you have pain? (ID15)

Parents believed it was important for other parents to have 
access to information on medical interventions so they can 
be on more equal footing with their children, who are often 
more aware of different intervention options, and thus be 
better able to make decisions together.

I think it would be really helpful just to have the basics 
of [HRT]…this is information the kid is likely to have 
well before the parent, and the parent will be catching 
up on. Having some basic information in there about 
how [exogenous hormones] work, and what poten-
tial ups and downs are, pros and cons, and things that 
you need to think about–decisions you need to make 
together. (ID15)

This informational imbalance between parents and youth 
was also observed by healthcare affiliates who noted that 
parents were often less informed than their child.

Often our teens’ questions are more detailed because 
they’ve done more research, so they’re like, “Well, 
what’s the difference between the estradiol patch form, 
or injection, or oral, or sublingual?” and parents are 
like, “What?” (ID17)

Upon first learning that their child was interested in HRT, 
many parents recalled having concerns and misinformation 
about the dangers of hormone therapy. Accurate information 
about HRT would help parents dispel myths about health 
risks.

I think the biggest [myth I heard] was about hormones 
being really dangerous. And it was interesting because 
I had been talking to friends my age who had been 
saying that they had heard anecdotally that there was 
a lot of organ failure in people our age who’ve been on 
hormones for 30 years, and that it was really hard on 
your liver and all this sort of thing. And when I started 
looking into the research, I did not find that, and then, 
when we talked to the doctors, they also said that that 
was not true....but I really believed that the side effects 
were a lot worse than any of the research has shown. 
(ID15)

Parents and healthcare affiliates both emphasized that fer-
tility concerns are often of primary importance to parents 
when considering HRT, while youth were perceived by both 
providers and parents as being less concerned with fertility.

1 3 
Archives of Sexual Behavior (2023) 52:2185–2203 

2197

Parents tend to be concerned with the long-term conse-
quences like fertility, which often teens are like, “I’ve 
already made decisions about that,” for better or for 
worse. And although we do have a lot of teens that 
acknowledge like, “Yes, that could change, and here’s 
what I know now,” teens are often more concerned with 
timeline. You are living in a body that is very uncom-
fortable, so of course, you’re like, “When can this [i.e., 
HRT] happen?” (ID17)

Some parents took the view that their adolescent children 
lacked the capacity to make an informed decision about fertil-
ity preservation and believed that having accurate informa-
tion would facilitate important conversations with their child:

A kid at 14 cannot decide if they want to have chil-
dren someday…So you have to be able to try to make a 
decision about how you’re going to plan for the future 
together, and those are hard conversations to have, but 
I think the more information you have, the better off 
you are. (ID15)

Few youth participants discussed fertility preservation or 
long-term outcomes of HRT during their interviews. Instead, 
most youth participants emphasized that if parents were more 
informed about the effects of HRT, they would better be able 
to support their child.

[Parents should have] information on how to be an ally 
and how to support your child if they’re going through 
[HRT]…A lot of parents just are completely at a loss on 
how to support their child…because they don’t have the 
information on how to do that and what’s going to hap-
pen. …I feel like it would be [great if a] resource [could 
explain] those changes, look at diagrams, talk about the 
changes, [explain] on how to be an ally, and how to sup-
port your child, and [say] “Here are the changes you’re 
going to see. Here are the things that are probably going 
to make you uncomfortable and how to come to peace 
with that.” How to be supportive. (ID9)

Regarding surgery, parents found that when they had 
more information about surgical options, they were able to 
be understanding about their child’s decisions and more sup-
portive overall. One parent described the topic of surgery 
coming up for the first time at a gender clinic appointment; 
their child had been afraid to mention it sooner for fear of 
“piling too much on [me] at once.” This parent believed that 
having “some basic information about [surgery] upfront 
would make sense” and also provide context for discussion of 
other non-medical interventions such as binding. The parent 
stated that they felt better about top surgery after “learning 
about it more and doing exactly what my kids do, which is 
going on Instagram and finding people who’d had top surgery 
and looking at the pictures they posted of themselves living 

their life without boobs and being very happy about it…At 
first I was really kind of worried. Now I’m thinking more 
about the aesthetics” (ID15).

Resources for Parental Peer Support

For some parents, peer support was cited as something that 
either has been or would have been tremendously positive 
for them. Parents found that peer support was helpful for 
seeking out advice, processing complex emotions, and feel-
ing less alone in the experience of parenting a TNB child. 
Many parents felt that this would be particularly helpful in 
the context of dealing with negative emotions such as guilt, 
grief, and shame—emotions that they did not want to process 
around their child.

…[T]here’s a place for [parents] to be validated that 
it’s a common experience to have grief. It’s a common 
experience to feel disoriented…and saying everyone’s 
experience is going to be different, but here are some 
things that other parents of trans kids have experienced 
that you might find reassuring to know that you’re not 
alone in this. (ID12)

Another parent (ID16) described a beneficial experience 
meeting other parents of TNB youth at a conference: “It was 
heart-wrenching to listen to these [parents’] stories. But it 
was very good. It was really therapeutic for me to really 
understand that I wasn’t alone.”

Several healthcare affiliates noted the importance of par-
ents having access to peer support. In addition to access-
ing support to process their negative emotions, this type of 
community can help strengthen parenting skills and facilitate 
increased parental confidence in leading conversations in top-
ics uniquely affecting transgender youth, such as issues of 
identity disclosure:

[It’s important to] help these caregivers of these kids 
feel more confident to step into conversations. Things 
like disclosure, and safety, and privacy…Families 
[must] work together and consider, “How do I navigate 
this? Do I not engage physically with somebody [in a 
romantic way]? People don’t know [about my transgen-
der identity], but maybe I need them to know.” All of 
these are worthy conversations [for parents] to have [in] 
a society that is not yet confident or familiar enough 
with the experience of trans kids. (ID20)

Discussion

Conversations between TNB youth and their parents about 
puberty, sexual health, and gender can be an important means 
of social support for TNB youth and also promote safety and 

1 32198

Archives of Sexual Behavior (2023) 52:2185–2203

healthy relationships for TNB youth. These conversations 
and their role in providing education and support to TNB 
youth may be increasingly important in light of expanding 
legislative attacks on the rights of transgender youth (Kidd 
et al., 2021). Parents, youth, and healthcare affiliates in our 
study all believed that baseline parental knowledge about 
TNB sexual health, and parental confidence in leading these 
conversations, plays a role in their effectiveness.

Notably, all participants agreed that parents have different 
informational needs than their TNB children and advocated 
for a curriculum tailored to parents of TNB youth. In parent 
interviews, conversations about sexual health were described 
as frequently being eclipsed by discussions of gender iden-
tity and safety of gender-affirming interventions. This was 
sometimes a source of tension, as parental focus was often on 
long-term considerations (e.g., fertility preservation, health 
risks of HRT), whereas youth were more focused on their 
parents understanding basic concepts about gender identity, 
sexuality, and transition-specific concepts (e.g., HRT, bind-
ing) in order to support them and help them navigate medical 
systems.

Our findings emphasize that greater efforts are required to 
meet the educational needs of parents of transgender youth. 
A lack of parent–child conversations, or conversations that 
youth believed were unsupportive, often led to feelings of 
resentment. These findings are reflected in the literature 
on the importance of parent-adolescent sexual communi-
cation, although almost all of the existing studies focus on 
non-LGBTQ youth. For example, one recent meta-analysis 
found that increased communication between parents and 
adolescents about sexual health is associated with increased 
use of contraceptives and condoms (Widman et al., 2016). 
Another study examining parent–child communication about 
sex for young men who have sex with men found an associa-
tion between comfort with parent–child sex communication 
and current PrEP use (Flores et al., 2020). This is particularly 
relevant given sexual health disparities faced by transgender 
youth, such as increased risk of acquisition of HIV and other 
STIs (Reisner et al., 2019). Though some parents attempted 
to address STI prevention in their parent–child conversations, 
they did so through an assumed cisgender/heterosexual lens, 
which may not address TNB youth’s specific experiences.

In our study, parent–child conversations about puberty 
and sexual health that took place prior to youth coming 
out reflected similar themes to those found in the literature 
related to non-LGBTQ youth (Flores & Barroso, 2017; Jer-
man & Constantine, 2010; Pariera, 2016). There was a wide 
range of styles of parental communication, perceived effec-
tiveness, and youth and parent comfort levels.

However, while parent-led conversations about puberty 
and anatomy were common for most of our study partici-
pants, the reported role-reversal in which youth teach their 
cisgender parents after coming out may be unique to sexual 

and gender minority youth. This is particularly important in 
light of the findings that LGBTQ youth have unique sexual 
educational needs and are often dissatisfied with the puberty 
and sexual health information available to them; therefore, 
parental conversations have the potential to fill in some of 
those gaps in school-based sources of sex education (Dewaele 
et al., 2017; Haley et al., 2019; Poteat et al., 2019; Savin-Wil-
liams & Diamond, 2000; Sexuality Information & Education 
Council of the United States, 2015).

Instead, many youth participants felt frustrated that they 
were constantly in the role of teacher when it came to dis-
cussions of gender with their cisgender parents, including 
during sexual education conversations. Interestingly, there 
was a disconnect between parental perceptions and youth 
experiences, in which parent participants often believed that 
youth preferred being in the role of teacher. Healthcare affili-
ates also echoed the importance of parents being able to pro-
ductively contribute to conversations with their TNB child, 
emphasizing that this would help parents feel more comfort-
able talking about general topics (e.g., healthy relationships 
and boundaries), as well as topics more specific to the TNB 
experience (e.g., when and how to disclose TNB identity to 
peers and partners). Parental support has also been shown to 
correlate with increased disclosure of transgender identity to 
healthcare providers, something that is essential to ensuring 
TNB youth are able to access affirming healthcare (Sequeira 
et al., 2020).

In general, participants believed that a sexual health cur-
riculum for TNB youth and their families should contain 
separate content for parents and youth because of different 
educational needs. This is an important finding, as there is 
limited research examining whether other groups of youth 
and their parents believe parents have distinct educational 
needs compared to their children. It is interesting that despite 
the study focus on sexual health, most themes raised by par-
ents and youth alike related to puberty, dysphoria, and medi-
cal/non-medical gender-affirming interventions. Based on 
this, we posit that in order for sexual health to be effectively 
discussed between parent and child, parents’ first need is to 
achieve a baseline level of knowledge and comfort related 
to discussing the above topics. In two-parent households, 
providing parents with a source of accurate information can 
also help ensure consistent messaging and support between 
both parents, as differing levels of parental support can be an 
additional stressor for TNB youth (Pullen-Sansfacon et al., 
2020; Wilson et al., 2016).

For most of our participants, conversations about sex-
ual health were often overshadowed by parental questions 
about gender identity and medical interventions. Thus, 
when identifying ideal content for parents of TNB youth, 
most respondents prioritized teaching the basic concepts of 
gender identity, sexual orientation, non-binary identities, and 
gender-neutral language. Educating cisgender parents about 

1 3

these topics may help to combat “gender-stereotypical atti-
tudes” toward parenting, which has been shown to be associ-
ated with increased behavioral and emotional challenges for 
gender non-conforming children (MacMullin et al., 2021). 
Dispelling the idea that transgender identity is a choice or 
phase was another recurrent theme for participants, one that 
parallels the finding that parents of LGBQ youth often also 
often believe that LGBQ identity is a phase (Burton & Loth-
well, 2012). While it is true that sexual orientation and gender 
identity may change and evolve over time, many participants 
took issue with the idea that their TNB identity was transient 
and that they would eventually identify as cisgender.

A number of youth and parents believed that inclusion of 
diverse narratives about TNB individuals would be a use-
ful curriculum feature. Youth were particularly interested 
in narratives that showed the range of TNB experiences, 
including examples of diverse and multiple marginalized 
identities and a range of life experiences. They believed this 
would help normalize TNB experiences and expose parents 
to the breadth of life paths possible for TNB individuals. 
Parents also believed narratives would help soothe some of 
their worries about their child’s future. These narratives can 
be useful for balancing an appropriate understanding of the 
specific challenges often faced by TNB youth (e.g., risk of 
bullying, mental health challenges) without catastrophizing 
their future. Studies have shown that parents of transgender 
youth require positive portrayals of transgender individu-
als and communities in order to soothe concerns about their 
child’s future as well as to inform parents that gender vari-
ance is part of the normal variety of life (Riley et al., 2013a, 
2013b). Including these stories would be an innovative way to 
expose parents to positive representations of TNB people and 
simultaneously challenge binary assumptions about gender 
and sexuality. These representations could come from indi-
vidual youth stories or other media sources, many of which 
emphasize the importance of story-telling and positive rep-
resentation of TNB youth (Meadows, 2018; Travers, 2018). 
Ultimately, access to this type of information could help 
lessen the burden on youth to teach their parents, something 
that can be particularly stressful if parents are still coming to 
terms with their child’s identity.

Healthcare affiliates and youth, in particular, advocated 
for a curriculum to include information about gender dys-
phoria, its relationship to the onset of puberty, and how to 
support a person experiencing dysphoria. Numerous studies 
have shown that in TNB youth with dysphoria, social support 
and/or access to medical interventions for TNB individu-
als who desire them is highly correlated with better mental 
well-being (e.g., decreased depression/anxiety, improved 
body image/satisfaction, self-reported quality of life) and 
decreased lifetime incidence of suicidal ideation (Cohen-
Kettenis et al., 2011; de Vries et al., 2011, 2014; Nakatsuka, 
2012; Tordoff et al., 2022; Turban et al., 2020). Thus, our 

study participants believed that this information would pro-
vide important context for the distress often experienced by 
youth during puberty and help parents understand why youth 
may desire access to gender-affirming interventions.

To complement this information, both parents and youth 
felt it was important for parents to learn about non-medical 
gender-affirming techniques (e.g., binding, tucking) and 
their relevant safety concerns. For example, a large study on 
binding experiences among adults who were assigned female 
at birth found that while participants overwhelmingly felt 
that binding improved their mental health, nearly all (97%) 
reported at least one negative physical health outcomes attrib-
uted to binding (Cohen-Kettenis et al., 2011). The most com-
mon reported outcomes were back pain, overheating, chest 
pain, shortness of breath, itching, bad posture, and shoulder 
pain; negative outcomes were associated with increased fre-
quency of binding (Peitzmeier et al., 2017). When parents 
are informed about these interventions, they can more easily 
understand why youth with gender dysphoria need access 
to them and may be better equipped to provide guidance in 
cases of unsafe implementation (e.g., sleeping in a binder).
Participants also thought it was important to address com-
mon parental concerns about medical gender-affirming inter-
ventions, including the long-term effects of exogenous hor-
mone use and the impact of medical interventions on fertility. 
Our findings related to differential parent and youth concerns 
about fertility are consistent with existing literature on TNB 
adolescents. For instance, one study assessing transgender 
youth and parent attitudes toward fertility preservation and 
HRT found that many youth wished to parent a child some-
day, but few explicitly desired a biological child (4%) (Strang 
et al., 2018). A significant portion of youth felt pressure from 
their family to have a biological child (25%) and many youth 
wondered (50%) or did not know (20%) if their feelings about 
biological children would change in the future. Parents were 
more concerned about their child changing their mind and 
later wanting biological children, and 21% stated that they 
would be disappointed if their child could not have biological 
children. Nearly all parent participants in this study empha-
sized the importance of learning how HRT may affect fertil-
ity. Another study assessing fertility decision-making among 
transgender young adults identified shortcomings in health-
care providers’ fertility counseling—such as information that 
was incomplete and affected patients’ decision-making satis-
faction (Chen et al., 2019). This further supports our finding 
that fertility education is important to parents of TNB youth 
and may assist parents in facilitating more informed conver-
sations about healthcare decisions and future fertility options 
with their child. It is also important to note that few insurance 
plans currently offer significant coverage for fertility-related 
services; therefore, there are many barriers around access to 
these services, particularly for youth and families with lower 
socioeconomic status (Kyweluk et al., 2019).

Finally, many parents and healthcare affiliates emphasized 
the importance of peer support for parents. Some partici-
pants believed that a dedicated educational curriculum for 
parents would facilitate protected space for them to process 
emotions such as grief and shame that may be harmful for 
their children to witness. This could be helpful to mitigate 
the long-term harms that have been well-demonstrated as a 
result of adverse parental responses when youth first come 
out (Newcomb et al., 2019, 2020; Saltzburg, 2004). Family 
rejection or perceived family rejection has been shown to 
correlate with higher rates of negative health outcomes as 
well as internalizing disorders (Klein & Golub, 2016; Olson 
et al., 2016; Valente et al., 2020).

Limitations

There were a number of limitations to this study. The sample 
size was small, and all youth and parent participants were 
white and resided in the Seattle-area, in a state where lit-
tle to no anti-trans legislation currently exists. Thus, data 
are likely not generalizable to other geographical locations 
or racially diverse populations. Additionally, most parent 
participants were generally supportive of their child and 
the youth participants had access to gender-affirming care. 
Therefore, our findings are likely not applicable for less sup-
portive parent populations or youth who do not have access 
to gender-affirming care. All parents interviewed were cis-
gender women, and it is possible/likely that interviews with 
parents of other gender identities would have generated dif-
ferent results. Future work should deliberately explore these 
perspectives. In addition, all parent participants were parents 
of TNB youth assigned female at birth, and we may have 
obtained significantly different responses from parents of 
TNB youth assigned male at birth. Transfeminine youth were 
underrepresented among youth participants, which likely 
influenced the topics of interest in participant interviews 
and limited generalizability of findings. However, a strength 
of this study is that it was not limited to parent perspectives; 
youth and healthcare affiliates provided insightful perspec-
tives on parents’ knowledge gaps, and these two groups are 
perhaps better equipped than parents themselves to identify 
such knowledge gaps. Put another way, it requires a degree 
of self-awareness to “know what you don’t know,” which 
parents may not always have. This makes the perspectives of 
youth and healthcare affiliates so valuable.

Additionally, due to the nature of agreeing to take part in 
this study, the sample of parents were likely more supportive 
of their TNB children, may have been more knowledgeable 
about sexual health and other relevant topics and likely had 
more access to gender-affirming healthcare compared with 
the broader TNB parent community; their opinions may 
therefore differ from parents who are less supportive, less 
knowledgeable, or who experienced less healthcare access. 

In spite of these limitations, we believe this paper represents a 
starting point in the exploration of a critical topic. Additional 
research is recommended to explore the needs of diverse par-
ents of diverse TNB youth, to confirm and/or expand upon 
themes detected in this study.

Conclusion

This study represents a first step toward exploring parent 
knowledge gaps regarding gender and sexual health for 
TNB youth, and identifying specific educational content 
deemed important by youth, parents, and healthcare affili-
ates to fill these gaps. Parents of TNB youth, TNB youth 
themselves, and medical providers all felt it was critical for 
parents of TNB youth to have access to information to help 
them support their child’s sexual health as they navigate the 
social, psychological, and medical aspects of transitioning 
to their affirmed gender identity. Findings specifically favor 
the development of a tailored educational curricula to equip 
parents in conducting informed, non-judgmental conversa-
tions about sexual health, as well as in more broadly support-
ing their children as they navigate the experience of being 
transgender or non-binary. These findings are critical given 
the increasing barriers that exist for TNB youth to access 
affirming sexual health information and care. Future research 
should expand this work to explore perspectives of a broader 
group of TNB youth and parents with a variety of genders and 
geographical, racial/ethnic, and socioeconomic backgrounds.
