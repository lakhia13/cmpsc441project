Hospitalization and Psychosis: Influences on the Course of
Cognition and Everyday Functioning in People with
Schizophrenia

Abstract

Long term institutional stay has decreased markedly in people with schizophrenia, although there
are still many individuals with a history of long-term institutional stay residing in the community.
In addition, although the average duration of acute admissions for schizophrenia is also
decreasing, there are indications that psychotic episodes leading to acute admissions are associated
with risk for cognitive and functional declines and changes in brain structure. In this paper we
review the literature on cognitive changes with aging and institutionalization in schizophrenia,
reaching the conclusion that the reasons for chronic institutionalization in the current include
largely include severe psychosis and aggressive behavior. Thus, these factors may be the operative
factor in the age-related declines in cognition and functioning reported in this population. We also
present evidence to suggest that these changes may be similar to those seen in younger patients
who experience repeated psychotic episodes leading to hospitalization. Our conclusion is that
there is minimal evidence that hospitalization, long or short, leads to cognitive and functional
changes, but rather that the reason for these hospitalizations may underlie cognitive and functional
declines. Prevention of relapse and discovering treatments to assist patients with resistant
symptoms may reduce the risk of cognitive and functional decline across the lifespan in people
with schizophrenia.

The Background Context

Long stay institutional treatment was the norm for people with schizophrenia for the first
part of the 20th century. Large hospitals were established in rural areas and patients
remained there for extended periods of time. Dramatic and pathetic pictures were
disseminated, showing disheveled and strange looking people, often assuming unusual poses
or grimacing and gesturing in incomprehensible ways. The fact that there were no treatments
that were effective for any of the symptoms of schizophrenia or other conditions led to

extended stays and a bleak future. Further, the concept was advanced that institutionalization
itself was partially or largely responsible for the behaviors seen on the part of these patients.

In the mid 1950s chlorpromazine was introduced for the treatment of people with
schizophrenia. As the first medication that reduced psychotic and disorganized symptoms, it
had an enormous and significant impact on lengthy hospital stays for schizophrenic patients.
There were wholesale discharges of patients from long-stay care and by the late 1970s the
remaining patients in long-stay care were those who were largely non-responsive to the
effects of antipsychotic treatments. Further, the entire inpatient treatment model for
schizophrenia has changed drastically, from stays that averaged 6–12 weeks for “acute
admissions” 25 years ago, to 5–7 day stays or even admissions that are not designated as
admissions because the patient stays in the emergency room for up to 72 hours.

As recently as the mid 1990s, however, there were still substantial numbers of long stay
psychiatric patients in several locations in the country. Both state and VA facilities had large
numbers of these patients, with many of these patients being over the age of 65 and often
never having recovered from their first psychotic episode, even they had been hospitalized
for 40 years or more (Davidson et al., 1995). These patients, by virtue of having remained
behind during several waves of deinstitutionalization efforts, manifested multiple significant
symptom features. In contrast to non-institutionalized patients, they had substantial positive
and negative symptoms (Davidson et al., 1995), had profound cognitive impairments
(Harvey et al., 1998), significant functional impairments (Harvey et al., 1997), and
substantial levels of aggressive and unpredictable behaviors (Bowie et al., 2001). Despite
their severe levels of impairment, many of these patients were ultimately discharged from
long stay care and moved to nursing home facilities (White et al., 1997), even at fairly
young ages (Adelsky et al., 2011). Some were, however, sent to community facilities that
had higher levels of opportunities for independence (Bowie et al., 2006). Several studies
have been conducted on the characteristics of these patients.

The Goal of This Review

The goal of this review is to present information about hospitalization in schizophrenia and
how it relates to the course of illness, assessment of patients, and general understanding of
schizophrenia. Changes in health care delivery have been substantial for people with
schizophrenia and it is not clear whether the illness has changed as much as the way we treat
it. Chronic hospital stays certainly appear to have the potential to lead to adverse impacts on
functioning, but in the current model of care, there is an increased risk for medication
nonadherence and psychotic relapses. It is not clear which has a worse long term impact.
Measurement of functioning was easier if patients were observed every day by patient care
staff; nowadays it is often a challenge to find someone who knows the patient. Overall, there
are several issues that have evolved in terms of the impact of hospitalization on the
symptoms and cognitive and functional capacity of patients with schizophrenia. It is
important to know whether being treated in a hospital, for either the short or long term, is an
antecedent or consequence of clinical symptoms, cognitive deficits, and disability. It is also
important to understand whether psychotic symptoms have a deleterious effect on other
aspects of functioning and whether the presence of continuous psychosis, in the presence or
absence of antipsychotic treatment leads to functional and cognitive deterioration. There are
several lines of research that address these questions, including longitudinal and cross-
sectional studies of individuals with schizophrenia who were previously or current
chronically institutionalized. Additional studies have examined the consequences of both
repeated psychotic episodes and continuous psychotic symptoms on cognition, functioning,
and brain structure.

In this paper, we review the relationship between hospitalization, both acute and chronic
several other features of the illness, including aggression and hostility, cognitive
impairments and functional capacity, and overall functional outcomes. We also elucidate
exciting new developments in the direct assessment of functional abilities and present data
of our own that addresses the validity of these assessment strategies in healthy older people.
Finally, we address whether institutionalization itself has a toxic effect on outcomes or
whether the contemporaneous causes of long-term hospitalization are the potential causal
factor for age-related changes in cognition, functional capacity, and everyday functioning.

Contemporary Reasons for Long Term Hospital Care

Studies of the characteristics of patients discharged from long-stay psychiatric facilities
provide some information about the transition from these long stay facilities. In a series of
studies of the characteristics of patients discharged from long-stay psychiatric care, White
and colleagues discovered several informative facts (White et al., 1997, White et al., 2006).
This study followed 551 older (mean age=76) long-stay (mean length of stay 34 years) for a
three year period and examined three different possible outcomes: staying in the hospital
(n=289, 53%), being sent to a nursing home (200, 36%), and being sent to a community
placement (62, 11%). Interestingly, greater disability or more severe cognitive impairments
did not differentiate patients who went to nursing home care from those who remained in the
hospital. In fact, the patients who remained behind were more symptomatic and more
aggressive than those who were discharged. In a later comparative study of patients
previously discharged to nursing home care compared to those who were still hospitalized,
similar findings were revealed in that patients who remained in long-stay psychiatric care
had more severe positive psychotic symptoms and less severe negative symptoms than those
who had been discharged to a nursing home. Also, in that study, nursing home patients had
more severe cognitive deficits and impairments in everyday living skills than patients still in
a hospital. As discussed below, the possibility exists that cognitive functioning declines in
older people with schizophrenia who have a history of extended institutional stay. As a
result, a cross-sectional study cannot really address the cognitive performance of these
nursing home residents at the time of discharge, which was up to 10 years previously.

Aggressive and disruptive behavior is a common antecedent to acute admission in the
current care environment. It is also a primary correlate of being difficult to discharge even
during times of high pressure to reduce inpatient census. For example, the White et al.
(1997) data just described cognitive impairments and hostility posed the greatest barriers to
discharge and in a systematic study of aggression at that research site Bowie et al. (2001)
found that the prevalence of aggression in long stay patients was equivalent to that seen in
acutely admitted patients admitted within the last 3 days in earlier studies. There is a large
literature on aggression as a precipitant of acute admissions and in long stay patients (See
Serper et al., 2008). Most studies find that deficits in frontal lobe function, measured either
with neurological or neuropsychological assessments predict aggression (Krakowski and
Czobor, 1997). Interestingly, several studies also show that negative symptoms are
associated with aggressive behavior as well (Krakowski, 2005). These negative symptom
correlate results have been interpreted in terms of frontal lobe dysfunction as alterations in
emotional functioning are common in individuals with frontal lobe damage.

The challenge of reducing aggression associated with cognitive deficits is challenging,
because of the lack of interventions that target cognition and the possibility that cognitive
functioning declines over time. Clearly, the prevalence of aggression in older
institutionalized patients is greater than in younger patients because not all younger patients
are hospitalized for aggressive behavior. In the sections below we will examine data on the
course of cognitive functioning in aging and evaluate whether there are changes over time.

Cognitive Changes as of Function of Aging in Schizophrenia

In the following sections, we review the literature on cognition and functioning in
schizophrenia, as is relevant to hospitalization and the reasons for hospitalization. We focus
first on research on cognitive and functional decline with aging in schizophrenia. These
studies have focused on the characteristics and course of cognitive impairments and have
compared individuals with an extended history of institutional stay to patients who lived
their whole lives in the community with only sporadic exacerbations. Then we discuss the
characteristics of cognition, functioning, and brain structure as a consequence of psychosis.
In this section we focus first on the impact on continuous psychosis in ambulatory and
hospitalized patients and then upon the consequences of repeated psychotic relapses on these
same variables.

There has been considerable debate as to whether patients with schizophrenia are more
generally susceptible to the effects of aging than the healthy individuals (Kirkpatrick et al.,
2008). Cross-sectional studies have been mixed. Some studies have indicated that the aging
effects associated with schizophrenia are no different than that observed aged healthy
individuals (Mockler et al., 1997, Eyler Zorilla et al., 2000, Hijman et al., 2003).
Conversely, other investigations have shown considerably more impairment than what
would be expected as a function of normal aging (Fucetola et al., 2000, Arnold et al., 1995).
Mixed results have also occurred in longitudinal studies with some investigations suggesting
no significant aging effects relative to healthy individuals (Heaton et al., 2001), while others
have either suggested worsening (Harvey et al., 2003, Friedman et al., 2001, Loewenstein et
al., 2010) or at least that certain subgroups of schizophrenia patients may be particularly
vulnerable to cognitive deterioration in certain domains as they age (Bowie et al., 2008;
Granholm et al., 2010).

In one large-scale (n=424) longitudinal (6-year) follow-up study, albeit without a
comparison sample of healthy controls, Harvey et al. (2003) examined changes in cognition
and observer-rated everyday functioning. The findings indicated that patients with higher
and lower baseline performance manifested equivalent and statistically significant cognitive
declines, but differences in decline on basic activities of daily living. Random effects
regression analysis indicated that functional changes were significantly correlated with
cognitive changes for the sample as whole and that cognitive changes were the best
predictor of changes in functional status over time. Baseline cognitive status was a not a
statistically significant covariate for functional change, nor was the course of negative
symptoms over the follow-up period. Cognitive change appeared very similar in magnitude
across older poor outcome patients with different baselines of cognitive impairment. In
contrast, functional decline was limited to patients with lower levels of functioning at
baseline. These findings suggest that cognitive thresholds for impairments in different
aspects of functional status may exist in patients with schizophrenia. Finally, the results
indicated a small, but nonsignificant, relationship with the course of psychosis over the
follow-up period. Thus, suggesting evidence of a “toxic psychosis” effect, an issue to be
returned to later in this paper.

One reason for these apparent discrepancies across studies is that aging effects may be quite
modest until persons have reached their 70s and beyond (Friedman et al., 2001). In the
Harvey et al. (2003) study, risk for functional decline was predicted by older age at the time
of assessment, which had a greater influence than age at onset. Further, the control samples
in many of these studies have both been younger than 65 years with very modest sample
sizes. Finally, comparing chronically institutionalized patients with schizophrenia over the
age of 65 with healthy control subjects (e.g., Friedman et al., 2001) may not control for
much, as the two subjects samples have lead entirely different lives.

We attempted to address these issues in a recent study with 226 community dwelling
schizophrenic subjects ranging in age from 40 years to 80+ years of age and over 800
normal elderly controls for comparison purposes (Loewenstein et al., 2010). We found that
the performance of healthy subjects age 70 years and older was far superior to the
performance of younger schizophrenic subjects aged 40–49 years on tests tapping memory,
executive function and psychomotor speed. In particular, age effects were most pronounced
for schizophrenia subjects who are 70 years or greater and age effects for schizophrenia
patients were much more pronounced relative to healthy normals on tests of verbal learning
and speed of processing measures. The finding that age influences cognitive decline for
schizophrenia patients was particularly profound on tests of speed of processing and verbal
memory are consistent with the literature showing that these tend to be the most persistent
deficits in schizophrenia (Aleman et al., 1999, Knowles et al., 2010), and the most robust
predictors of everyday functional disability in schizophrenia (Ojeda et al., 2008),
particularly for residential status (Shamsi et al., 2011, Leung et al., 2008).

Although cross-sectional, our recent findings (Loewenstein et al., 2010) have significant
implications for longitudinal research with institutionalized patients. First, although the life
expectancy is lower for schizophrenia patients than normal elderly, it is critical to study
patients aged 65 and older if one is going to discern the true effects of aging in
schizophrenia. Due to advances in medical treatment the number of older schizophrenic
patients will increase in the near future. However to truly discern the trajectory of cognitive
changes over time, there needs to be adequate samples of healthy normal subjects. It is also
important to have reliable and valid measures of cognitive and functional capacity in
patients with schizophrenia. This can be particularly challenging with older patients. These
issues are discussed in the following sections.

Assessment of Everyday Functional Outcomes and Functional Capacity in
Schizophrenia: Informant-Based Reports—It is quite common to base assessment of
functional ability of schizophrenic patients on reports from informants such as a relative or
friend or the patient themselves. While this is a well-accepted practice, it is increasingly
recognized that patients with severe mental illness or age-related cognitive disorders and
their informants may be inaccurate in their judgments regarding their own cognitive
performance, functional capacity, and everyday functioning (Lowenstein et al., 2001, Keefe
et al., 2006, Bowie et al., 2007, Goldberg et al., Sabbag et al., 2011). This may be due to
such factors as informant biases which may include denial, minimization or oversensitivity
to perceived impairments. Informants who are very depressed or anxious may over report
functional deficits. Other informants such as friends or more distant relatives may not have
ample opportunity to observe and interact with the patient to make valid functional
judgments. For example, we are finding that friends tend to overestimate the functional
abilities of patients (Sabbag et al., 2011). This overestimation may be a function of the fact
that friends may have limited opportunity to observe certain functional behaviors or in the
cases of homeless schizophrenic patients, may themselves prone to psychiatric illness.
Patients also tend to overestimate their functional abilities.

Ratings of everyday functioning on the part of high contact clinicians seem much more
related to other aspects of functioning than reports from other sources. Regardless of
whether the clinician informants see the patients every day as inpatients (Harvey et al.,
1998), provide outpatient case management services (Bowie et al., 2008), or are their
counselors in intensive rehabilitation services (Sabbag et al., 2011), these ratings have
shown convergent validity with performance-based measures.

Other Indices of Everyday Functioning—Other indices of everyday functioning can
include milestone achievements. This can include employment, the ability to function

residentially, and social outcomes. Measurement of milestone achievements may be more
complex than it appears, because of the intrinsic relationships between opportunities,
finances, and other constraints. It is actually easier to measure functional abilities in an
inpatient setting and our studies of the everyday adaptive functioning of people who are sent
to nursing homes (Harvey et al., 1998) suggests that everyday functioning of nursing home
referrals and state hospital patients are quite similar. Real-world milestone achievement can
be rare in people with schizophrenia and in a recent paper we (Harvey et al., in press) found
that 1). achievements of real-world milestones were very minimally related to each other
and 2). that achievement of multiple current functional milestones across employment,
residential independence, and social outcomes was very low at 6%. This low base-rate of
milestone achievement is one of the reasons that assessment of everyday functioning has
often relied on ratings of sub-threshold milestones: looking for a job; performing ADLs in a
supported environment, or socializing in groups.

There is a paucity of research on the longitudinal course of everyday functioning following
long hospitalizations. Such studies are challenging, because people discharged after a
particularly long stay may be elderly and likely lack resources, which leads to placements in
restrictive environments. There are longitudinal data available on the course of functional
capacity as described below, which is easier to measure because of reduced reliance on the
immediate residential environment.

Measures of Functional Capacity—As a result of the issues associated with informant
reports, there has been a greater reliance on performance-based measures than can provide
an objective assessment of functional capacities, i.e., the skills that are critical to the
performance of everyday living tasks. For example, one can objectively obtain data as to
whether the individual can pay a bill, manage and balance a checkbook, write a check, count
currency and make change for a purchase. This type of objective measurement of functional
capacity is now widely employed in the study of severe mental illness. Based on the findings
that these measures are highly and consistently related to cognitive functioning on the one
hand and everyday real-world functioning on the other, these measures and the skills they
assess have been proposed to be an important mediator of the influence of cognitive
functioning on real-world everyday outcomes (Bowie et al., 2006, Bowie et al., 2008,
McClure et al., 2007). In both schizophrenia and bipolar illness, performance on a measure
of everyday functional skills, the UCSD Performance based Skills Assessment (UPSA)
(Patterson et al., 2001) was the best predictor of real world outcomes in vocational and
residential domains, even when the influences of cognition and symptoms were considered
(Bowie et al., 2010, Mausbach et al., 2010). Measurement of possible changes in functional
capacity has also been suggested as a co-primary assessment in treatment studies aimed at
cognitive enhancement in schizophrenia (Green et al., 2011, Leifker et al., 2011).

The UPSA includes paper and pencil simulations of activities performed in everyday life
and includes: Communication (i.e., dialing the telephone to schedule a physician
appointment, obtaining and dialing a number from an information operator); Finance
(counting currency, making change, and paying a bill); Transportation (using a bus
schedule in planning a trip and understanding charges and obtaining information) and
Comprehension/Planning (reading and planning a recreational outing based on scenarios
about a trip to the beach on a hot sunny day and the zoo on a cold rainy day); and
Household Management skills (e.g., shopping for grocery items). Some versions of the
UPSA also include a medication management subtest and are referred to as the UPSA-II
(Green et al., 2011).

Overall, the convergence between measures of functional capacity such as the UPSA and
cognitive performance in people with schizophrenia has been quite strong. To date, at least

10 studies using 6 different cognitive assessment strategies have yielded correlation
coefficients ranging from r=0.6 to r=0.7 between total scores on three versions of the UPSA
and composite neuropsychological (NP) test scores. Further, studies examining the
correlations between individual neuropsychological test scores and scores on the UPSA have
correlations in the range of r=0.2 to r=0.4 (McClure et al., 2007). Thus, performance on tests
of cognitive ability is related to the ability to perform everyday living skills, with both
global impairments (i.e., composite scores) and specific ability domains are related to
performance.

Deterioration in Functional Capacity over time—As cognitive performance is highly
associated with measures such as the UPSA in people with schizophrenia, the question
arises as to whether changes in functional capacity would be similar to previously reported
declines in cognitive performance over time. In a study aimed at examining the direct effects
of a history of long-term institutional stay, Harvey et al (2010) followed 111 community
dwelling people with schizophrenia and 76 healthy controls for up to 45 months. The people
with schizophrenia ranged in their longest hospitalization from less than one month to over
36 years. Functional capacity was assessed with the UPSA and with the Social Skills
Performance assessment (SSPA) (Patterson et al., 2001). There were significant declines in
both functional capacity measures, but no time effects for neuropsychological performance
in the patient sample. The interaction of longest institutional stay and time was significant
for UPSA scores, meaning that patients with longer durations of institutional stay manifested
greater worsening over time. When current residential status (independent vs. supported)
was examined, the effect of institutionalization remained significant and current residential
status was not, arguing that current opportunities contributed to performance.

The fact that that HC participants manifested practice effects on both the SSPA and NP
assessment suggests that the modest worsening seen in NP performance on the part of the
older people with schizophrenia was even more significant. When compared to healthy
controls, patients with schizophrenia worsened by .15 SD on their NP performance across 1
or two reassessments, while the HC improved by .35 SD, suggesting an aggregate worsening
(decline plus lack of practice effects) of 0.5 SD in 45 months (p<.05). While not associated
with a history of institutionalization, this is still a substantial effect.

The Utility of the UPSA as a Measure of Functional Capacity in Non-Impaired
Adults—The UPSA has been used as a functional capacity measure in over 50 studies of
people with schizophrenia. Further, it has been endorsed as the best performance-based
outcomes measure for use in clinical treatment studies (Green et al., 2011). It has also been
used with minor modifications in studies of mild cognitive impairment and
methamphetamine abuse (Gomar et al., 2011, Henry et al., 2010). The psychometric
properties of the UPSA are good, and it appears sensitive to disability in a wide array of
pathological conditions

However, one of the criticisms of the UPSA is the concern about ceiling effects, both for
patients and for healthy, normal community-dwelling elders. In impaired populations with
considerable disability and cognitive impairments, global factors such as poor motivation
could produce the apparent association between cognitive abilities, both global and specific,
and UPSA scores. A similar relationship between performance based assessments of
cognitive functioning and functional capacity in community dwelling healthy people who
lack disability and severe performance deficits on cognitive measures would suggest a more
direct relationship between UPSA scores and cognitive abilities. Previous studies of healthy
people with the UPSA have not focused on specific abilities or have performed combined
analyses with healthy and impaired populations. In fact, in the multiple studies of functional
capacity with other assessment methods reviewed by Moore et al (2007), the majority of the

studies that examined the correlations between functional capacity measures and cognitive
performance used global cognitive assessments including the Mini-Mental State
Examination (MMSE) (Folstein et al., 1975) or the Mattis Dementia rating scale.

To address this issue, we examined a sample of healthy individuals on whom we previously
reported on the psychometric properties of the UPSA and composite NP performance
(Leifker et al., 2011). Specifically, we examined data regarding the extent to which
performance on the UPSA was related to neuropsychological measures of varying
component cognitive abilities. The sample included 89 cognitively normal individuals living
in the community (40 males and 49 females) 49–89 years of age who were recruited as
healthy controls for a longitudinal study of cognitive and functional decline in older people
with schizophrenia (see Leifker et al., 2010) for a more detailed description). All
participants had to demonstrate intact mental status as assessed by the Folstein Min-Mental
State Examination score of 26 or greater. Further, no subject met current or lifetime criteria
for either mood disorders or psychotic disorder by DSM-IV criteria (American Psychiatric
Association, 1994) and no subjects were receiving psychotropic medications for psychiatric
conditions.

All subjects were administered a cognitive assessment battery that measured episodic
memory measured by the five learning trials of the Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT)
(Spreen and Strauss, 1998), processing speed measured by the Trail Making Test (TMT)
(Reitan and Wolfson, 1993) Parts A and B, and Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale 3rd
Edition (WAIS-III) (Wechsler et al., 1997) Digit Symbol tests , working memory measured
with the WAIS-III Digit Span Forward and Backward tests, and executive functioning
measured by the Color, Word, and Color-Word Interference Conditions of the Stroop Color
Word Test (Golden, 1976). Also, to avoid restriction of range, raw rather than corrected
scores on the neuropsychological measures were employed in data analyses.

The mean age of the sample was 66.9 years (SD=10.9 years) with an average educational
attainment of 14.61 years (SD=2.4 years; 9–20 years). The average MMSE score was 28.58
(SD=1.3). The mean UPSA total score for the sample was 85.80 (SD= 7.8; range =60–100).
The mean for the Comprehension/Planning domain was 22.19 (SD= 1.8; range= 16.7–25.0);
the mean for the Finance domain was 22.04 (SD= 2.8; range= 11.4–25.0); the mean for the
Communication domain was 19.04 (SD= 4.0; range= 8.3–25.0) and the mean for the
Transportation domain was 22.38 (SD= 3.5; range= 12.5–25.0).

As depicted in Table 1, there were a number of statistically significant relationships between
neuropsychological test performance and total UPSA scores. Correlations between total
UPSA scores and neuropsychological tests such as Digit Symbol, Letter-Number
Sequencing and Stroop Color-Word Interference scores were found to account for 23.0 % to
28.1% of the total variance in UPSA total scores. Financial Skills were best predicted by
Trails B and Letter-Number Sequencing while Communication was best predicted by Trails
A, and RAVLT total learning. Transportation was best predicted by Stroop Color-Word
Interference and Digit Symbol. The UPSA Comprehension and Planning subscale was not
predicted at the corrected level of significance by any of the neuropsychological measures.

We regressed the UPSA total score on all of the neuropsychological test predictor variables
in the study and found that the neuropsychological variables accounted for 40.6% of the
total variability in functional capacity. Neither age or educational attainment or their
interactions with neuropsychological variables added significant explained variability to the
model.

Overall, we found considerable variability in performance on the UPSA as evidenced by the
wide range of scores for the UPSA and its subscales among cognitively normal adults living

independently within the community. For example, only 1 member of this sample of healthy
controls received a perfect total score on the UPSA. We also found strong associations
between scores on the neuropsychological tests and performance on the UPSA. The multiple
R2 of .40 is particularly impressive when one considers that imperfect reliability of any
psychometric instrument. We have previously shown that cognitive and functional capacity
performance accounts for a similar amount of explained variance in directly observed real-
world functional outcomes in Alzheimer’s disease (Loewenstein et al., 1995), schizophrenia
(Harvey et al., 2009), and bipolar disorder (Bowie et al., 2010).

Our data suggest that measures such as the UPSA are resistant to ceiling effects in healthy
adults and like psychiatric populations, specific types of neuropsychological test
performance are related to measures of functional capacity. Overall these findings suggest
that the UPSA can be used as a measure to reliably assess differences in functional capacity
between schizophrenia patients and non-impaired samples of older adults.

Data Regarding the NeuroToxicity of Psychosis

In addition to understanding the association of long-stay hospitalization and aging on the
cognitive, emotional and functional capacity of schizophrenic patients it is also important to
understand the impact of prolonged psychosis on functional outcomes. The notion that
antipsychotic treatment can alter the natural course of schizophrenia was introduced by
Wyatt (Wyatt, 1991), who reviewed data from studies of patients who experienced extended
periods of psychosis prior to their initial treatment with antipsychotic medications and
compared them to patients whose first psychotic episode received medication treatment. His
data suggested a disease modifying effect of antipsychotic treatment early in the course of
illness. While this concept has been the subject of much research and controversy, it seems
plausible that reduction of psychosis may have a beneficial effect. There are inconsistent
results regarding duration of untreated psychosis and lifelong functional outcomes. Many of
the inconsistent results may be due to research designs that are simply not adequate to
address the question of whether lengthy periods of untreated psychosis lead to poorer
outcomes, specifically in terms of very short durations of untreated psychosis examined in
the study. In the studies reviewed by Wyatt, many of the patients experienced decades of
untreated psychosis, while in many studies of first episode patients the duration of untreated
psychosis is measured in weeks or months.

There are two lines of research suggesting that psychosis, even in ambulatory patients, is
associated with deterioration in functioning and alterations in brain structure. One is the
longitudinal study of treatment refractory patients, who experience continued psychosis
despite adequate antipsychotic treatment. The second is the longitudinal study of early-
course patients across the course of multiple psychotic episodes. Both have suggested that
continuous psychosis or multiple psychotic episodes have adverse consequences.

In a four-year longitudinal study of brain structure using CT scan technology, Davis et al.
(1998) compared deteriorated, disabled patients who had experienced continuous psychosis
despite adequate treatment for at least 5 years to similar-aged patients who were treatment
responsive. Those patients who experienced continuous psychosis demonstrated longitudinal
ventricular enlargement that was greater in the left hemisphere than the right. Neither the
treatment responsive patients nor a sample of healthy controls demonstrated any ventricular
enlargement during this time frame. In addition, a single study of the correlation between
cortical changes and cognitive performance in chronic patients (Gur et al., 1998) found that
reductions in temporal and frontal lobe volumes were associated with greater cognitive
decline. These findings combine with studies of older patients with schizophrenia (Friedman
et al., 2001, Harvey et al., 1999; 2003) that have suggested that more severe psychotic
symptoms predict greater cognitive and functional decline over various follow-up periods.

Thus, persistent psychosis seems associated with progressive brain volume loss as well as
with cognitive and functional declines and losses in critical brain regions may be the
substrate for these changes.

The aforementioned studies are typically confounded by a series of issues, including
institutionalization, medication status, and critical differences in age and other
characteristics of the patient samples. The concept of schizophrenia as a chronically active
brain process starting at or before the time of the first episode was introduced by DeLisi et al
(1999). Reviews of the state of this research (DeLisi et al., 1999) reached the conclusion that
brain volumes do decrease progressively starting at the time of the first episode or before.
However, the data collected in a series of important studies in the Netherlands,
comprehensively assessing early and mid-course patients, addresses this issue quite
convincingly and thoroughly. Specifically, Kahn and colleagues in the Netherlands have
performed a series of important studies on patients with schizophrenia with 5-year follow up
methods, including a substantial number of patients identified and followed from the time of
their first episode. A sample of 96 patients with schizophrenia and 113 healthy controls were
followed for a 5-year period (Van Haren et al., 2007). During this time, patients were
followed clinically and their number of relapses was measured, with this number ranging
from 0 to 8. It was found that there was a statistically significant reduction in brain volume,
specifically in left frontal and temporal regions. Loss of frontal gray matter was also
significantly associated with the number of number of relapses experienced. Interestingly,
treatment with either clozapine or olanzapine attenuated those changes. This is s finding that
has been replicated elsewhere, suggesting that treatments that are effective for treatment
refractory patients, clozapine in specific, also appear to have neuroprotective effects.

In the subsample of 34 first episode patients in the study, several other additional findings
emerged (Cahn et al., 2006). Volume loss in the first year of illness was associated with 5-
year clinical and functional outcomes. Enlargement of the lateral ventricle predicted reduced
likelihood of independence in residence at the follow-up. This is an interesting parallel to the
findings of Davis et al.(1998) who found that patients with persistent psychosis and
disability also demonstrated longitudinal enlargements of the left lateral ventricle.

Duration of untreated psychosis at the time of the first entry into treatment was found to be
unassociated with 5-year volume changes (Boonstra et al., 2011) While DUP was related to
the severity of psychosis at baseline, intervening treatment events (including relapses)
accounted for more variance in cortical atrophy over five years than did DUP. In terms of
the clinical significance of these brain changes, van Haren et al. (2011) demonstrated that
the patients with the greatest cortical thinning over the 5-year follow-up period also had the
worst five year functional outcomes.

Conclusions

Hospitalization for people with schizophrenia is a consequence of several different
behavioral and social psychosocial factors. The characteristics and reasons for
hospitalization seem markedly different now than in 1900 or even in 1990. While it is
difficult to disentangle the consequence of the reasons for hospitalization from the effects of
hospitalization, most contemporary hospitalizations are extremely brief and the cause is
typically psychotic exacerbation or aggressive and hostile behavior. While some patients
historically experienced extraordinarily long stays, research on patients who were
discharged document continued worsening of impairments after discharge. This finding can
be interpreted as suggesting persistence of the poor outcome processes that led to extended
institutional stay.

A common factor possibly linking cognitive changes with aging and early in the course of
illness is psychosis. Either recurrent or persistent, there are indications that higher psychosis
doses, particularly if treated with conventional antipsychotic medications, are associated
with cortical deterioration with correlated functional impairments. Similar processes may be
responsible for the cognitive and functional decline seen in older institutionalized patients
who has an extended period of illness prior to the availability of any treatments. Finally, by
the time that people with schizophrenia have reached old age they have been exposed for the
most part to a lifetime of continuous or sporadic psychotic symptoms which may contribute
to the persistence of cognitive decline even in cases where the experience of psychosis is
still episodic.

Thus, these data suggest that continued efforts to engage people with schizophrenia in
treatment can serve to prevent cognitive and functional decline associated with psychosis.
Second, clozapine treatment has been shown in several studies to be associated with a
reduced risk of cortical degeneration and is well known to reduce psychosis in a proportion
of treatment-resistant patients. Finally, these data suggest that cognitive enhancing
treatments may require continued control of psychosis in order to be effective and to lead to
improved outcomes. Data to date suggests that these cognitive enhancement treatments are
not effective on psychosis, so further developments in the treatment of non-adherent and
treatment resistant patients seem required.
