Abstract

Previous studies of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and birth spacing had limitations; few 
examined phenotypic case subtypes or explored underlying mechanisms for associations and none 
assessed whether other (non-ASD) developmental disabilities (DDs) were associated with birth 
spacing. We assessed associations between inter-pregnancy interval (IPI) and both ASD and other 
DDs using data from the Study to Explore Early Development, a multi-site case-control study with 
rigorous case-finding and case-classification methods and detailed data collection on maternal 
reproductive history. Our sample included 356 ASD cases, 627 DD cases, and 524 population 
(POP) controls born in second or later births. ASD and DD cases were further sub-divided 
according to whether the child had intellectual disability (ID). ASD cases were also sub-divided 
by ASD symptom severity, and DD cases were subdivided by presence of some ASD symptoms 
(indicated on an autism screener). Odds ratios, adjusted for maternal-child sociodemographic 
factors, (aORs) and 95% confidence intervals were derived from logistic regression models. 
Among term births, ASD was associated with both IPI <18 months (aOR 1.5 [1.1–2.2]) and ≥60 
months (1.5 [0.99–2.4]). Both short and long IPI associations were stronger among ASD cases 
with high severity scores (aORs 2.0 [1.3–3.3] and 1.8 [0.99–3.2], respectively). Associations were 
unchanged after adding several factors potentially related to the causal pathway to regression 
models. DD was not associated with either short or long IPI—overall, among term births, or in any 
subgroup examined. These findings extend those from previous studies and further inform 
recommendations on optimal pregnancy spacing.

Lay Summary—We investigated whether the amount of time between pregnancies was 
associated autism spectrum disorder (ASD) or other developmental disabilities (DD) in children.

ASD was increased in second and later-born children who were conceived less than 18 months or 
60 or more months after the mother's previous birth. Other DDs were not associated with birth 
spacing.

Introduction

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is estimated to occur in 1–2% of U.S. children 
[Christensen et al., 2016; Blumberg et al., 2013]. While genetic factors are implicated in the 
etiology of ASD [Miles, 2011], the composite evidence supports gene–environment 
interactions [Kim & Leventhal, 2015]. ASD risk factors identified from epidemiologic 
studies include maternal-fetal health conditions, such as diabetes, preeclampsia, infection, 
and preterm birth, and maternal exposures such as medication use, environmental pollutants, 
and folic acid deficiency before and during pregnancy [Ornoy, Weinstein-Fudim, & Ergaz, 
2016]. Neurobiological studies also suggest that embryogenesis is a critical period for ASD 
exposures [Arndt, Stodgell, & Rodier, 2005]. Thus, investigation of factors related to early 
pregnancy might provide clues about the causes of ASD. Short birth spacing or inter-
pregnancy-interval (IPI), an established risk factor for adverse perinatal outcomes including 
preterm delivery, intrauterine-growth-restriction, and neonatal intensive care admission 
[Conde-Agudelo, Rosas-Bermúdez, & Kafury-Goeta, 2006; Conde-Agudelo, Rosas-
Bermúdez, Castaño, & Norton, 2012; Appareddy Pryor, & Bailey, 2016], is thus also of 
concern for potential longer-term child health effects, such as ASD.

Several studies report associations between ASD and short IPI [Cheslack-Postava, Liu, & 
Bearman, 2011; Dodds et al., 2011; Gunnes et al., 2013; Cheslack-Postava et al., 2014; Coo 
et al., 2015; Durkin, DuBois, & Maenner, 2015; Zerbo, Yoshida, Gunderson, Dorward, & 
Croen, 2015]. Some also report associations with long IPI [Cheslack-Postava et al., 2014; 
Coo et al., 2015; Durkin et al., 2015; Zerbo et al., 2015]. However, short IPI was variously 
defined as <9 to <24 months and several studies did not separate births after long IPI from 
the referent category. Few studies present data on IPI as a continuous variable to further 
inform the binary or ordinal IPI categories presented and only one study assessed a 
continuous IPI variable in a model that allowed for non-linear prediction effects [Gunnes et 
al., 2013]. However, that study was nonetheless limited in that estimates from the continuous 
IPI assessment were imprecise, especially for long IPIs.

Because previous studies were based on data from existing medical or administrative 
records, they were further limited in the data available for both pregnancy history and child 
developmental outcomes. In most studies, cases were limited to those who had accessed 
services and received an ASD diagnosis; in several studies, ASD case definitions were based 
on non-standardized administrative diagnostic coding, with the possibility of varying 
diagnostic rigor and possible mis-classification and selective ascertainment of the most 
severe cases. Data on maternal reproductive history from existing data sources is also often 
incomplete. For instance, many population-based registries do not include fetal losses at all

or do not include timing of fetal losses; thus, IPI was necessarily defined based only on 
previous livebirths. However, evidence supports treating stillbirths similar to livebirths in IPI 
calculations; short IPI after stillbirth has been linked to increased risks for preeclampsia, 
intrauterine-growth-restriction, preterm delivery, and perinatal and neonatal death [Bigelow 
& Bryant, 2015]. Previous studies were also limited in their ability to assess potential 
biologic mechanisms and phenotypic case subtypes. Moreover, the few studies that included 
assessments of DSM-IV ASD subtypes report inconsistent findings. Gunnes et al. [2013] 
reported that short IPI was associated with autistic disorder but not other disorders 
(Asperger's Disorder and pervasive developmental disorder–not otherwise specified [PDD-
NOS] combined); Zerbo et al. [2015] reported that both short and long IPI were associated 
with ASD regardless of subtype; and Cheslack-Postava et al. [2014] reported that short IPI 
was associated with autistic disorder and PDD-NOS but not Asperger's disorder and long IPI 
was associated only with Asperger's disorder. Nonetheless, Cheslack-Postava et al. [2014] 
also reported that IPI associations were similar for ASD cases with and without co-occurring 
intellectual disability (ID).

A few studies have reported associations between short IPI and developmental delay 
[reviewed in Conde-Agudelo, Rosas-Bermudez, & Norton, 2016]; however, various 
methodological limitations hamper interpretation of the findings. To our knowledge, no 
study has examined associations between IPI and ASD and non-ASD developmental 
disabilities (DDs) in the same study population. Thus, it has not been possible to assess 
whether associations reported between IPI and ASD might reflect a more general 
neurodevelopmental effect.

The Study to Explore Early Development (SEED), a large multi-site case-control study 
specifically designed to assess pre-conception and prenatal ASD risk factors, has several 
advantages over prior studies. Case finding included identification of young children with a 
range of developmental delays from numerous sources serving diverse population 
subgroups, thus casting a “wide net” to identify possible ASD cases (including yet 
undiagnosed cases) and a second non-ASD DD case group. Final case classification was 
based on in-depth standardized in-person developmental assessments administered by 
research-reliable clinical study staff, rather than reports of past diagnoses. Developmental 
assessment data also allowed us to systematically define various case subtypes. Exposure 
ascertainment was based on detailed maternal reproductive histories taken as part of a 
comprehensive maternal interview, which also included data on conditions possibly in the 
causal pathway of an IPI–ASD association.

Using SEED data, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of the association between IPI 
and ASD. We examined both short and long IPI, including assessments of an ordinal IPI 
variable that aligns with clinical guidelines and a continuous IPI variable evaluated using 
cubic spline analyses. We examined associations with non-ASD DDs in addition to ASD and 
also examined associations for several ASD and DD phenotypic subtypes. Finally, we 
assessed several factors possibly related to the underlying causal pathway.

Methods

SEED Methodology

Page 4

SEED was implemented in 2007 in six sites located in California, Colorado, Georgia, 
Maryland, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania. Institutional review boards at CDC and each 
site approved the SEED protocol.

Details of the SEED methodology were previously published [Schendel et al., 2012]. Each 
site followed a common protocol, including enrollment of three study groups: children with 
ASD, children with other (non-ASD) DDs, and children from the general population (POP). 
Children for the ASD and DD groups were identified from multiple special education and 
clinical sources that provide services to children with disabilities. Children recruited from 
each source were those with select special education or International Classification of 
Disease codes indicative of autism/ASD or other DDs often seen as precursor or co-
occurring diagnoses in children eventually diagnosed with ASD. POP children were selected 
from random samples of the birth certificates within a given site's defined study area.

Eligible children for the first phase of SEED were born between 2003 and 2006, lived in the 
respective site's study area both at birth and at study enrollment, and lived with a caregiver 
since 6 months of age who could provide legal consent and was capable of communicating 
in English (all sites) or Spanish (two sites). For 98% of children, the caregiver was the 
biological mother. Children were enrolled at 2–5 years of age.

Although children were initially identified as potentially being eligible for a given group—
ASD, DD, or POP—final study group classification was determined from standardized 
research developmental assessments [Wiggins et al., 2015]. Upon enrollment, all children 
were screened for possible autism characteristics through their caregivers' completion of the 
Social Communication Questionnaire (SCQ). Children with SCQ scores at or above the 
predetermined threshold of 11 were designated as potential ASD cases regardless of how 
they were initially identified. Additionally, all children who had a previous ASD diagnosis 
or autism special education classification were designated as potential ASD cases regardless 
of their SCQ scores. Children in all study groups were seen in person and administered a 
general developmental assessment, the Mullen Scales of Early Learning (MSEL). Children 
in the potential ASD group were additionally administered the Autism Diagnostic 
Observation Schedule (ADOS) and their caregivers were administered the Autism 
Diagnostic Interview - Revised (ADI-R). Final ASD case classification was based on ADOS 
and ADI-R scores. Children who had been designated as potential ASD cases, who did not 
meet the criteria for classification as an ASD case after the ADOS and ADI-R, received a 
final classification of either DD or POP depending on their original identification source 
(education/clinical source vs. birth certificate sample, respectively).

A wealth of data were collected from all study groups, including an extensive interview with 
the care-giver about family socio-demographics and, if the care-giver was the biological 
mother, her reproductive history and information about her pregnancy with the child.

Sample Selection

Page 5

Altogether, 3,200 children enrolled in SEED and completed sufficient assessments to receive 
a final classification of ASD, DD, or POP. Of these, 2,728 children had data on maternal 
pregnancy history; 2,725 also had data on potential confounders of interest. The sample for 
the current analysis was necessarily limited to second or later births (n = 1,507).

Birth Spacing

During the computer-assisted-telephone-interview, the biological mother was asked how 
many times she had been pregnant, and for each pregnancy, she was asked the outcome and 
date (exact date or month and year of outcome, year of outcome, or her age at outcome if she 
could not recall the date). Birth spacing or IPI was calculated as time in months from most 
recent date of birth (stillbirth or livebirth) preceding the index pregnancy to estimated date of 
conception of index pregnancy. Date of conception was calculated as date of index birth 
minus gestational age, obtained from birth certificate files. Our choice to calculate IPI as 
interval from most recent stillbirth or livebirth, but not most recent miscarriage, was based 
on previous studies that document adverse perinatal and infant consequences for pregnancies 
conceived within a short interval of a stillbirth, but few risks for pregnancies conceived 
within a short interval of a previous miscarriage [Bigelow & Bryant, 2015].

Statistical Analysis

We examined distributions of maternal reproductive history variables and potential 
confounders—maternal age and education at birth, maternal race-ethnicity, gestational age, 
and child sex—by case-control study group. Potential confounders were factors previously 
found to be associated with ASD and IPI [Bilder, Pinborough-Zimmerman, Miller, & 
McMahon, 2009; Schieve, Clayton, Durkin, Wingate, & Drews-Botsch, 2015; Thoma, 
Copen, & Kirmeyer, 2016; Appareddy et al., 2016]. We tested the significance of differences 
between ASD and POP groups and DD and POP groups with chi-square tests.

We assessed associations between ASD and DD and IPI in several sets of analyses.

Assessment of ordinal IPI variable—We initially computed unadjusted odds ratios 
(OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for associations between both ASD and DD (each 
compared to POPs) and IPI (<18 months or ≥60 months vs. 18–59 months). The IPI cut 
points were chosen based on review of previous IPI-ASD studies [Dodds et al., 2011; 
Gunnes et al., 2013; Cheslack-Postava et al., 2014; Coo et al., 2015; Durkin et al., 2015; 
Zerbo et al., 2015], published clinical recommendations [Bigelow & Bryant, 2015], and 
sample sizes of our study groups—overall and within subgroups of interest. We also 
subdivided the lowest IPI category as <12 months and 12 to <18 months and examined 
findings separately for these groups; as expected estimates were less precise for these 
smaller categories.

We conducted stratified analyses examining each potential confounder individually; the 
findings informed our final multivariable adjustment models. Because we observed notable 
differences in IPI associations within gestational age strata, we conducted adjusted analyses 
for the total sample and for the sample restricted to term births. Adjusted ORs (aORs) were

derived from ordinary logistic regression models that included IPI, child sex, maternal race/
ethnicity, maternal education at birth, and maternal age at birth as independent variables. 
While we also examined household income as a potential confounding factor, we did not 
include income in our final models to avoid reducing our sample size; 3–5% of mothers did 
not respond to the income question on the maternal interview. The aOR estimates derived 
from models with and without income were very similar; we thus present only the latter 
here.

We also assessed several factors possibly related to the underlying causal path between IPI 
and adverse neuro-development (i.e., potential mediator variables): (1) pregnancy planning; 
(2) maternal infertility disorder diagnoses; and (3) maternal hypertension or diabetes during 
pregnancy. We re-ran our logistic regression models among term births with each of these 
factors added. Data on pregnancy planning and infertility disorders were collected as part of 
the maternal telephone interview. The interview included a question on general pregnancy 
planning—whether before her pregnancy with the index child the mother was trying to get 
pregnant. Infertility was ascertained from a series of questions on whether before the index 
pregnancy a doctor or other healthcare provider ever told the mother it would be impossible 
or difficult to get pregnant—over-all and because of specific infertility-related disorders, 
including blocked or damaged fallopian tubes; PCOS or multiple ovarian cysts; diminished 
ovarian reserve because of advanced age, premature ovarian failure or a medical condition; 
endometriosis; uterine problem, such as fibroids; or a diagnosis of unexplained infertility. 
Women could respond affirmatively to more than one disorder. For this analysis, we created 
a single, “any maternal infertility disorder” variable. Multiple SEED instruments included 
information on hypertension and diabetes during pregnancy: the maternal telephone 
interview; prenatal care record abstractions (available for ∼70% of study participants); and a 
self-administered maternal medical history checklist form. A previous SEED analysis 
reported high agreement for medical record and self-reported data for both hypertension and 
diabetes (currently unpublished data). Therefore, we classified the mother as having each 
condition if it was reported in any of the three study instruments.

Assessment of ASD and DD subgroups—We assessed both ASD and DD within 
subgroups defined according to whether or not the child scored in the intellectual disability 
(ID) range (<70) on the MSEL, which was administered to all children during the in-person 
developmental assessment. We additionally examined ASD subgroups defined according to 
the severity of ASD symptoms. A calibrated ADOS severity score was calculated for all 
ASD cases based on the ADOS total score, ADOS language level, and child age at 
developmental assessment. The ten-point scale was dichotomized into ‘less severe’ (scores 
of 4–7) and ‘more severe’ (scores of 8–10). We also subdivided the DD group by whether 
the child had an indication of some autism symptoms, even though s/he had not met the 
ADOS and ADI-R criteria for classification as an ASD case. Autism symptoms were defined 
as SCQ score=>11. Separate regression models were run for each phenotypic subgroup. In 
each of these models, we compared IPI among children in a given subgroup (ASD with ID, 
ASD without ID, DD with ID, DD without ID, ASD with more severe symptoms, ASD with 
less severe symptoms, DD with autism symptoms, DD without autism symptoms) to the 
total POP group.

Assessment of continuous IPI variable—IPI was also analyzed as a continuous 
variable using logistic regression with restricted cubic splines to allow for nonlinear (log 
scale) risk relationships between IPI length and outcome odds. We specified 3 knots at 12, 
18, and 59 months, and specified 36-month IPI as the reference value. The covariates 
included in the multivariable logistic regression with restricted cubic splines were the same 
as those included in the multivariable categorical approach. The models with restricted cubic 
splines were compared to the models without splines using Likelihood ratio tests for testing 
non-linearity.

Results

In our sample, children with ASD and DD were more likely than children in the POP group 
to be male and to have been delivered preterm (Table 1). Their mothers were less likely than 
POP mothers to be Non-Hispanic white or to have completed college at the time of their 
births and were more likely to have had hypertension during pregnancy. Mothers of ASD 
children were also more likely than mothers of POP children to have had an infertility 
disorder diagnosis and were less likely to report trying to get pregnant. DD mothers were 
more likely than POP mothers to have had diabetes during pregnancy. Over two-thirds of 
ASD children and about one-fourth of DD children had ID. Close to 40% of ASD children 
had a high ASD symptom severity score and nearly 30% of DD children were classified as 
having some autism symptoms.

The ASD group had higher frequencies of both short and long IPI than the POP group (Fig. 
1) and the difference between the ASD and POP distributions was statistically significant (P 
= 0.005). The distribution of IPI in the DD group was not significantly different from the 
POP group distribution.

Both before and after adjustment, we observed positive associations between ASD and both 
short (<18 months) and long (≥60 months) IPI. Associations were more pronounced among 
term births (aORs 1.5 [95% CI: 1.1–2.2] and 1.5 [95% CI: 0.99–2.4] for short and long IPI, 
respectively) (Table 2). We could not assess adjusted associations between ASD and IPI 
among preterm births due to small sample sizes and instability of the regression model; 
however, unadjusted stratified analyses were suggestive of an effect modification between 
IPI and gestational age (P = 0.075 with positive associations between ASD and both short 
and long IPI among term, but not preterm births) (data not shown). Analyses of finer 
gradations of short IPI revealed that the magnitude of effects for associations between ASD 
and IPIs of <12 months and 12–18 months were similar. Addition of various mediator 
factors to regression models had minimal impact on effect estimates for either short or long 
IPI.

Associations were similar for ASD with and without ID (Table 3). Associations for “more 
severe ASD” were stronger than those observed for ASD overall. Conversely, associations 
between “less severe ASD” and either short or long IPI were attenuated and no longer 
statistically significant.

DD was not significantly associated with either short or long IPI in the total sample or 
among term births (Table 4). Although sample sizes were small and estimates were 
imprecise, there was also no association evident among preterm births (data not shown). 
Addition of mediator factors to regression models did not impact the findings. Additionally, 
there was no association between IPI and any of the DD case subgroups examined (Table 5).

The U-shaped association between ASD and IPI is more fully illustrated in the findings from 
the cubic spline analyses (Fig. 2). Likelihood ratio tests indicated that a restricted cubic 
spline model fit the data significantly better than the model without the spline for the total 
sample (P = 0.044, Fig. 2A), term birth sample (P = 0.005, Fig. 2B) and term birth sample 
with assessment of more severe ASD only (P = 0.011 Fig. 2C). The findings from the cubic 
spline model also suggest that the magnitude of the association between ASD and long IPI 
increases gradually after 59 months. Cubic spline models for the DD group did not fit the 
data better than models without cubic splines (P = 0.777 for total sample and P = 0.888 for 
term birth sample). The plots, which showed flat straight lines, indicated no association 
between DD and any level of IPI (Fig. 3).

Discussion

We found that in children born in 2nd or later term births, ASD was associated with 
pregnancy conception either <18 months or ≥60 months after the mother's preceding birth. 
Our cubic spline analyses confirmed this pattern of results and also suggested associations 
become stronger with IPI's beyond 60 months. We did not observe an association between 
ASD and IPI among preterm births, a finding we could not explore fully due to sample size 
constraints. However, one possible reason for this finding is that preterm birth posed a 
competing risk that masked associations with IPI.

While we observed similar findings for children with ASD plus ID and ASD without ID, we 
found that associations with both short and long IPI were primarily limited to ASD cases 
with a higher calibrated ADOS severity score, a measure of core ASD symptoms designed 
to limit influences from child demographics or non-ASD developmental outcomes, 
including ID [Wiggins et al., 2017]. Moreover, we found that non-ASD DD was not 
associated with either short or long IPI - overall, in term or preterm births, among subgroups 
with or without ID, or among subgroups with or without ASD symptoms reported. 
Altogether, these findings support the hypothesis that the ASD–IPI associations are unique 
to ASD rather than being reflective of a more general neurodevelopmental effect.

Our findings are consistent with several previous studies showing associations between ASD 
and short IPI [Cheslack-Postava et al., 2011; Dodds et al., 2011; Gunnes et al., 2013; 
Cheslack-Postava et al., 2014; Coo et al., 2015; Durkin et al., 2015; Zerbo et al., 2015] and 
the few studies that additionally demonstrated a U-shaped relationship between ASD and IPI 
[Cheslack-Postava et al., 2014; Coo et al., 2015; Durkin et al., 2015; Zerbo et al., 2015]. The 
findings from the few previous studies that assessed ASD diagnostic subtypes [Gunnes et al., 
2013; Cheslack-Postava et al., 2014; Zerbo et al., 2015] and ASD with and without ID 
[Cheslack-Postava et al., 2014] were inconsistent. In the current study, we were able to 
examine phenotypic subtypes more fully. The developmental assessment data we collected

allowed us to subdivide ASD cases based on the child's core ASD symptoms, rather than 
relying on a previous subtype diagnosis. As noted, this particular subdivision was more 
informative than that based on cognitive functioning.

There has been little study of other DDs and IPI overall and the few previous studies 
available must be considered cautiously, given methodological limitations. Thompson et al. 
[2003] examined a general developmental delay outcome, defined based on education 
eligibility data that encompassed a broad array of delay types and also included children 
deemed at risk for delay. They reported modest associations (most effect estimates <1.3) 
with low and high IPI. De Moura et al. [2010] reported an association between IPI <24 
months and suspected developmental delay at two years in a study of an urban Brazilian 
population; however, the outcome was defined based on Battelle Screening Developmental 
Inventory which has not been validated in a Brazilian population and given the young age of 
the cohort, might have selectively identified the most severe cases of DD. Pinto-Martin, 
Cnaan, & Zhao, [1998] reported an association between very short IPI (<6 months) and 
disabling cerebral palsy. Of note, none of the aforementioned studies defined cases of 
disability in a way that specifically excluded ASD; thus, it is not possible to determine if 
associations observed were related to ASD, which often co-occurs with other disabilities 
[Boulet, Boyle, & Schieve, 2009].

To our knowledge, no previous study of IPI has examined ASD and non-ASD DD 
associations in the same study population. SEED provided an opportunity to compare ASD 
and non-ASD DDs in a systematic manner with an in-depth case classification. While our 
DD group was a heterogeneous mix of disabilities with a range of severity levels, the SEED 
protocol included screening of all children enrolled in the study for autism symptoms with 
the SCQ and follow-up of those who screened positive, such that even children without a 
previous ASD diagnosis, were classified as an ASD case if they met study criteria on the 
ADOS and ADI-R. Thus, our DD group is unique in that we intentionally excluded children 
meeting ASD criteria from it; moreover, data from various developmental assessments 
allowed us to sub-divide the DD group based on both ID and autism symptomatology.

Possible hypotheses that have been put forth to explain associations between ASD and short 
IPI include nutrition depletion from the previous pregnancy, particularly folic acid depletion, 
which plays a key role in neuronal development and DNA methylation and is vulnerable to 
depletion by the end of a pregnancy [Shachar & Lyell, 2012; Conde-Agudelo et al., 2012], 
lingering maternal inflammation from the previous pregnancy [Shachar & Lyell, 2012; 
Conde-Agudelo et al., 2016; Cheslack-Postava et al., 2014], maternal stress that might be 
more common in pregnancies after short IPI [Shachar & Lyell, 2012; Conde-Agudelo et al., 
2016], an increased risk for maternal complications during pregnancies conceived after a 
short IPI [Cheslack-Postava et al., 2014], and unintended pregnancy and the consequent 
delays in various health behavior changes due to later recognition of pregnancy (e.g., 
smoking cessation, changes in medication use, initiation of folic acid supplementation) 
[Cheslack-Postava et al., 2014]. The trend toward delayed childbearing among U.S. women 
(i.e., first birth at age 35 or older) has also been associated with shorter IPI [Nabukera et al., 
2009]; this phenomenon might represent an intentional desire for short pregnancy spacing 
and it might also occur among women who have difficulty conceiving their first birth due to

an infertility disorder. The association between ASD and long IPI has been hypothesized to 
reflect an association between ASD and underlying sub-fertility [Conde-Agudelo et al., 
2016]; additionally some of the adverse impact associated with long IPI might be due to 
unintended pregnancy [Cheslack-Postava et al., 2014].

Previous studies of ASD and IPI were limited in their examination of potential causal 
pathways. Only a few studies included some analyses of potential intermediary variables 
beyond preterm delivery, and those studies were themselves limited. Dodd et al. [2011] 
included adjustment of a binary maternal condition variable in their analyses that was 
broadly defined to include pulmonary disease, heart disease, renal disease, or anemia. 
Durkin et al. [2015] included adjustment for gestational diabetes, but their data were from 
birth certificates, a source with only moderate sensitivity for diabetes [Devlin, Desai, & 
Walaszek, 2009]. Zerbo et al. [2015] adjusted for maternal use of antidepressants and 
maternal body mass index. We had data linked to several potential causal pathways—
pregnancy planning, infertility, and maternal pregnancy complications. Moreover, our data 
on pregnancy complications were more comprehensive than past studies and our data 
collection protocol, which included abstraction of prenatal care records for a subset of our 
sample, allowed us to validate maternal self-report data. Our findings from analyses that 
included potential mediator variables indicate that the associations we observed between 
ASD and both short and long IPI were not explained by unplanned pregnancy, maternal 
infertility disorders, or two common maternal antenatal complications, hypertension and 
diabetes.

Nonetheless, we lacked data to examine several other factors possibly related to the causal 
pathway, such as folic acid supplementation, folic acid levels early in pregnancy, and 
inflammatory markers in pregnancy. Given evidence linking ASD to variations in genetic 
pathways for folate metabolism [Frye, Slattery, & Quadros, 2017] and also immune function 
[Ansel, Rosenzweig, Zisman, Melamed, & Gesundheit, 2017], these two areas might be 
particularly important to examine in future studies. It is possible that certain pregnancies 
associated with ASD risk specifically are particularly vulnerable to the impacts of short 
pregnancy spacing on maternal nutritional stores and inflammation.

This study must be interpreted in the context of limitations. Because SEED sought to include 
mother–child pairs from diverse population subgroups, children were recruited from 
multiple clinical and education sources and population-based controls were sampled from 
birth certificates. One drawback to this approach is that a number of families initially 
targeted for potential recruitment could not be located. It is possible many of these families 
were ineligible for inclusion since our a priori eligibility criteria required both current and 
birth residence in the study catchment area. Still, we cannot rule out some selection bias in 
our sample. However, we conducted a detailed analysis of characteristics of responders and 
non-responders in the one site with data on all non-responders and found that while certain 
demographic factors were associated with nonresponse—younger maternal age and lower 
maternal education—other perinatal factors, including birth order, were not (unpublished 
data). We adjusted analyses for maternal age and education and we initially assessed all

associations within demographic strata. Additionally, we note that the proportions of short 
and long IPI among mother–child pairs in the SEED POP group are in line with expectations 
for US births with similar race-ethnicity and maternal education distributions [Gemmill & 
Lindberg, 2013; Copen, Thoma, & Kirmeyer, 2015].

Because we did not exclude children from the general population control group if they had 
evidence of disabilities, with the exception of those who met our ASD case definition, our 
associations could have been slightly attenuated, particularly for ASD and DD subgroups 
defined based on ID. However, we conducted sensitivity analyses in which we repeated ID 
subgroup analyses after excluding from the POP group children who had evidence of ID 
(2.8%) and the findings were very similar to those presented here (data not shown).

Despite limitations, this study has a number of important strengths including more rigorous 
case-classification than previous studies, which relied on existing medical and administrative 
records. Indeed, a prior SEED analysis suggests that reliance on existing clinical diagnoses 
data for ASD case classification in young children is subject to misclassification as a result 
of both under- and over-ascertainment; 17% of children enrolled in SEED who had a 
previous clinical ASD diagnosis did not meet SEED ASD-case criteria based on the ADOS 
and ADI-R and 15% of children who met SEED ASD-case criteria did not have a previous 
diagnosis reported [Wiggins et al., 2015]. Also, as discussed, the inclusion of a separate DD 
group and the wealth of developmental data collected using research reliable methods 
allowed us to examine associations with ASD alongside associations with non-ASD DDs 
and to subdivide both case groups into more homogenous subgroups. The in-depth SEED 
data collection protocol, which encompassed maternal reproductive history and pregnancy 
complications, allowed us to assess several important potential mediator factors that other 
studies could not and allowed us to define IPI more appropriately than past studies by 
including time since last stillbirth. We note however, that this was not a driving factor for the 
associations observed in this study; we conducted a sensitivity analysis in which mother–
child pairs with a previous stillbirth were excluded from our sample and observed 
comparable ASD–IPI associations as reported here (data not shown).

Our findings suggest ASD is increased in children born in second or later births after a short 
or long IPI. Additionally, the disparate findings between the ASD and DD groups and 
between ASD subgroups with high severity score versus lower severity score suggest that 
the underlying mechanism for the associations between ASD and birth spacing might be 
unique to autism rather than reflecting neurodevelopment effects more generally. Despite 
unanswered questions, these findings in concert with those from other studies can inform 
public health and clinical guidelines about optimal pregnancy spacing. Since pregnancy 
spacing is potentially modifiable, it is particularly important to more fully understand the 
underlying explanation for the ASD–IPI associations such that women can be fully informed 
of the potential risks associated with short and long IPIs.
