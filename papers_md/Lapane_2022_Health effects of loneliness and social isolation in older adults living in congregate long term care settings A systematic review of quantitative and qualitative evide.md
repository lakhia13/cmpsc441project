Abstract

Background:  Mounting evidence of loneliness and negative health impacts has placed loneliness 
among the “geriatric giants” in need of intervention by the healthcare system.

Objective:  To evaluate the literature regarding the health impact of loneliness among older adults 
living in congregate living settings (i.e., assisted living, nursing homes).

Materials and Methods:  Five databases were searched for quantitative and qualitative studies 
from January 1990 through August 2021. Methodological quality was assessed using modified 
criteria specific to quantitative and qualitative studies. Dual review assured the quality of the 
systematic review conduct.

Results:  Five qualitative, 3 mixed method, 19 cross-sectional, and 4 cohort articles were 
eligible. Despite different tools used to measure loneliness, loneliness appeared common among 
older residents in congregate living situations. In most studies, loneliness was associated with 
depression (regardless of scale used), albeit all but one came from cross-sectional studies. Few 
studies noted the association between loneliness and suicidal ideation and frailty. The three 
cohort studies that evaluated loneliness and mortality had mixed results. Resilience and activities 
appeared to mediate the association between loneliness and negative health outcomes and social 
support appeared to moderate associations.

Conclusions:  For older adults living in congregate long term care settings, loneliness is 
a common phenomenon, with cross-sectional studies suggesting links to depression, suicidal 
ideation, and frailty. Additional longitudinal studies to understand the impact of loneliness on 
health outcomes in older adults living in congregate settings are needed, as are rigorous evidence-
based interventions to address loneliness and mitigate its harmful effects during life’s final chapter.

INTRODUCTION

Page 2

Loneliness is a subjective emotional state that can include feelings of disconnectedness, 
psychological distance, isolation, or not belonging/not accepted.1 Some people do not feel 
lonely when alone, while others may feel lonely when surrounded by other people. The 
risk for loneliness among older adults living in nursing homes, assisted living, and other 
long-term care environments may be heightened when actual social relations fall short of 
what is desired.2,3 The social environment, perceived as friendly or hostile, can also have a 
powerful influence on loneliness.3 A meta-analysis on loneliness in residential and nursing 
care homes estimated ~61% of residents may be moderately lonely and ~35% severely 
lonely, with great variation in estimates across the studies with respect to geographic 
location, eligibility criteria, and sample size.4 Long-term care settings serving older adults 
vary widely across countries (e.g., size, staffing mandates, staffing turnover, who they serve 
given alternatives available that may allow people to age in place longer). Notably absent 
were studies from the United States. This review seeks to addresses this research gap.

Loneliness has been linked to physical and mental health in community-dwelling people. 
The association between loneliness and multiple health outcomes has been explored on a 
cellular level. Loneliness may impact the immune system promoting immune dysregulation 
and inflammation driven by excessive cytokine production.5,6 Dementia, cognitive decline, 
depression, anxiety, alcoholism, aggression, impulsivity, hypertension, obesity, stroke, and 
heart disease have been linked to loneliness.7,8,9 Loneliness interacts with depression to 
diminish overall well-being9 and has been associated with impaired sleep.10 In a national 
sample older adults in the US, loneliness predicted functional decline.11 Further, loneliness 
can be deadly, as it predicts suicidal ideation12 and death,11 with an estimated 26% increased 
risk of premature mortality.13 The extent to which findings in community-dwelling older 
adults hold for those living in congregate long term care settings is unclear.

Despite the accumulating evidence of the negative health impacts attributed to loneliness 
and the recognition that loneliness is among the “geriatric giants” in need of intervention 
by the healthcare system14, to our knowledge, the overall impact of loneliness on health 
outcomes in older adults living in congregate settings across methodologically sound 
studies is unknown. The need for research specifically in these congregate living settings 
is emphasized because residents are different than community-dwelling older adults. Despite 
living in congregate settings, they may be at heightened risk for negative health impacts of 
loneliness because of their aging-related changing composition of social networks, medical 
complexity including mental health conditions, and the nature of the nursing home setting 
(e.g., staffing turnover, short staffing, etc.). Therefore, the aim of this systematic review 
sought to address this research gap. We conducted an in-depth review of literature on the 
relationship between loneliness and health related outcomes among older adults living in

congregate settings. Among studies linking loneliness to health outcomes, we sought to 
describe the extent of loneliness among older adults living in congregate settings.

METHODS

This study was not considered human subjects research and as such did not require 
approval by the University of Massachusetts Chan Medical School Institutional Review 
Board. We structured our systematic review to be aligned with best practices outlined in the 
Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta Analyses (PRISMA).15,16 We 
considered both qualitative and quantitative studies that may increase our understanding of 
the association of loneliness on health outcomes in older adults living in congregate long 
term care settings. We searched five databases: CINAHL, Scopus, PsycINFO, MEDLINE, 
and Cochrane Reviews. Our search targeted articles published between January 1, 1990 
and August 31, 2021. The team developed lists of key words for three domains : 1) 
primary determinants of interest (e.g., social connectedness/isolation, loneliness), 2) primary 
outcomes (e.g., mortality, cognitive decline), and 3) setting (e.g., congregate living settings 
for older adults such as assisted living and nursing homes). We then worked with a research 
librarian to develop search algorithms and databases most relevant to these concepts. We 
restricted the studies to those published in English and studies on human subjects. From 
the broader search results, this study focused on sub-set of studies which evaluated the 
association between loneliness and health outcomes. We focused this review on older adults 
living in communal situations such as nursing homes, residential care homes, and assisted 
living. An author (CED) searched PROSPERO17 and Cochrane reviews to confirm that no 
systematic review had been conducted focusing on people living in these settings.

Search Algorithms

There were three domains that were combined to form the search algorithms: (1) 
setting- congregate living setting for older adults (i.e., nursing homes, assisted living); (2) 
determinants- factors associated with positive social interactions (e.g., friendship, social 
engagement, social interactions) OR factors associated with absence of social interactions 
(e.g., loneliness, social isolation), and (3) outcomes – health outcomes germane to older 
adults (e.g., quality of life, cognitive decline, mortality). The Appendix provides the search 
strategy applied.

Review Process

There were 3 phases of the review process: 1) review of titles; 2) review of abstracts; 3) 
review of full text. For each, two reviewers independently evaluated each potential article 
for inclusion. For the first phase, all studies that included the key terms for the primary 
determinants in the title were retained if the title also included terms for the setting (see 
Appendix). If either reviewer indicated that the title might suggest an eligible article, 
the article proceeded to the abstract review phase. Then, two reviewers read abstracts 
for potentially eligible articles (KLL and one other reviewer SK, EM, AB, or EL). Each 
independently made a recommendation for the article to proceed (or not) for full text review. 
A senior investigator (KLL) then compared the results for each abstract. If discordance was 
observed between the two reviewers, the abstract was re-read by KLL and a decision was

made. If needed, notes on abstracts with discordance were shared with reviewers to provide 
more clarity. If no doubt about the eligibility remained, the article proceeded to the full text 
review. If the article did not have an abstract, additional information was sought out by KLL 
to make the eligibility determination. The full text of articles making it through the title 
and abstract reviews were obtained. Of the full text articles obtained relating to loneliness, 
we checked the references of three review articles to see if there were additional articles 
that may be eligible for the review. At least two authors reviewed each potential article for 
inclusion/exclusion. Conflicts were resolved by the team of reviewers.

Extraction and Descriptive Synthesis

For the quantitative studies, data were extracted by one author (KLL) and cross-validated 
by one of the other authors. We included cross-sectional studies relating loneliness to 
health outcomes regardless of whether or not the authors considered loneliness as the 
dependent or independent variable owing to the concurrent nature of data collection. Data 
from the qualitative and mixed method studies were extracted by one author (CED) and 
cross-validated by another (EM). Discrepancies were discussed and conflicts resolved. Shell 
tables were developed to highlight the relevant information about the studies in a way to 
enhance the transparency and understanding of the included studies. Decisions regarding 
the salient items to include were informed by our study question and the methods used. 
The information for the overall descriptive table included: time frame of the study, setting, 
sample size, type of study (i.e., qualitative, mixed method, cross-sectional, cohort), and 
descriptive statistics (i.e., gender, age, marital status, race/ethnicity). For the quantitative 
studies, we extracted information regarding the scales and survey questions used to measure 
loneliness, the operational definitions of the health outcomes studied, covariates included in 
models, and if mediators/moderators were explored. We developed tables to facilitate the 
identification of similarities and differences in the definitions. We also summarized the main 
findings related to the loneliness-health outcome association under study. Because of the 
nature of the study, we did not extract information related to the source of study funding 
as we believed the topic was not likely to be influenced by the funding source. Based on 
the qualitative and very different quantitative studies included, we were unable to conduct a 
meta-analysis.

Quality Assessment on Included Studies

We evaluated the quality of eligible studies using different tools depending on the study 
design. For cohort studies, we used the modified Downs and Black criteria.18 For cross-
sectional studies, we used the Appraisal Tool for Cross-Sectional Studies (AXIS).19 By 
using these checklists, we were able to systematically evaluate the methodological quality 
of the eligible studies by examining reporting of the objectives, sample selection, external 
validity, and internal validity. The coding criteria included: 1) “0” if the article did not 
include any information addressing each issue, 2) “+” if deemed a study strength, or 3) “-” if 
considered a weakness. Three reviewers (EL, AB, YY) conducted individual assessment for 
each article, and discussed and resolved the discrepancies through team meetings.

For qualitative studies, we used the consolidated criteria for reporting qualitative research, 
COREQ20 (modified). We evaluated the qualitative and mixed method studies according to

three domains: research team and reflexivity, study design, and analysis and findings. Four 
items were assessed under the research team and reflexivity domain. Eleven items were 
evaluated under the study design domain. Articles were examined on 8 items regarding 
analysis and findings. Two reviewers (CED, EM) reviewed each article for the presence or 
absence of information and discussed discrepant rankings until consensus was achieved.

Quality Assurance of Systematic Review

Quality control procedures were built into each phase of the study. For example, the search 
terms were developed with input from the team and further assistance from the research 
librarian. All authors participated in developing the search terms. At least two authors 
reviewed titles, and full text to determine eligibility. Two reviewers evaluated and confirmed 
the data shown on the tables. Two independent reviewers conducted the quality assessments 
and resolved discrepancies through a discussion until consensus was achieved.

RESULTS

Search results

Figure 1 shows that 7,341 articles were identified using the search strategy described. After 
the title review, 6,383 articles were excluded. The remaining 958 articles proceeded to 
abstract review. During the abstract review phase, an additional 588 articles were excluded 
from further consideration. Of the remaining 370 articles undergoing full text review, 296 
were ineligible because these studies lacked information on loneliness. Of the remaining 74 
articles, we excluded 43 articles: review articles (n=4), did not include participants who were 
congregate care residents (n=1), were intervention studies (n=11), included only those who 
were community-dwelling or living independently (n=6), were quantitative studies lacking 
a measure of loneliness or social isolation (n=4), or did not attempt to link loneliness 
or social isolation to a health outcome (n=17). Of the remaining 31 eligible studies, 
five were qualitative studies,21,22,23,24,25 three were mixed method studies,26,27,28 19 were 
cross-sectional studies,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47 and four were cohort 
studies.48,49,50,51

Characteristics of Studies

The key characteristics of studies examining the association between loneliness or social 
isolation on health outcomes are shown in Table 1. Studies come from across the globe and 
are organized by study design, and by year within each study design. Three eligible studies 
were conducted in the United States, 12 studies were performed in the Asia-Pacific region, 
14 studies were conducted in Europe, and 1 was from Egypt.

Of the five qualitative studies, three used semi-structured interviews,21,22,23 one augmented 
semi-structured interviews with participant observation,24 and one augmented resident 
interviews with focus groups with direct care staff.25 The smallest study had 6 participants23 
and the largest 60 participants.21 Only two qualitative studies reported marital status 
(widowhood: > 70%).23,24 The three mixed method studies enhanced the qualitative 
data collected from in-depth interviews with survey data27,28 or record review and 
observations.26

For quantitative studies, 19 cross-sectional studies and four cohort studies were eligible. 
A repeated cross-sectional study had 1,563 participants in 2011 and 1,367 participants in 
2017.43 All but one29 cross-sectional study reported marital status. Of those reporting, all 
but three33,35,41 reported that more than half reported widowhood. The four cohort studies 
respectively had 6-months,50 1 year,48 3.6 years,51 and 5-years49 of follow-up. The smallest 
cohort study had 71 participants49 and the largest had 2,072 participants.51 Across all 
studies, the majority of participants were women (Range: 50.0%46 to 89.0%26), and the 
majority reported widowhood.

Summary of Quantitative Studies

Table 2 shows a summary of the 23 quantitative studies. With respect to loneliness, nine 
studies used some variant of the UCLA Loneliness scale,29,36,38,39,42,44,45,46,50 four used 
the 11-item Loneliness scale,30,31,41,48 one used a 6-item Loneliness scale,47 two used the 
Social Provisions Scale,32,49 one used the Friendship Scale,35 and the remaining used either 
a single question, information on social contact, or an unspecified question. Regardless of 
the loneliness measures used, the majority of studies that included metrics to describe the 
extent of loneliness in the sample showed that the phenomenon was common in congregate 
long term care settings.

While the specific outcomes of interest differed across the included cross-sectional studies, 
the most common outcome variables were depression, suicidal ideation, and frailty. A 
variety of scales were used for the studies that focused on depression as the outcome 
variable. These included the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS),30,31,32,34,35 structured 
clinical inventory for DSM (SCID),33 Hospital Depression Scale (HDS),39 Center for 
Epidemiologic Studies Depression (CES-D),50 and the Zung self-rated depression scale.29 
In all but one study that examined the association between loneliness and depression, 
estimates indicated a link between loneliness and depression. Only one group of participants 
in one study29 reported that loneliness was correlated with depression for short-term patients 
and long-term patients with Alzheimer’s disease, but not for long-term patients without 
Alzheimer’s disease. Only one cohort study evaluated depression as an outcome50 and a 
direct effect of loneliness on depression was reported (β=0.05; 95% CI: 0.01 to 0.42). 
Three studies examined suicidal ideation with two studies that used the Chinese version 
of the Beck Suicide Ideation Scale44,45 and one study that used item nine from the Beck 
Depression Inventory.38 These studies supported the association between loneliness and 
suicidal ideation, with two studies showing that loneliness influenced suicidal ideation 
indirectly through depression. In the two studies that used the FRAIL scale36,40 to measure 
frailty as an outcome variable, there was an association between loneliness and frailty, 
although in one study the confidence interval was wide and included no association. Three 
cohort studies evaluated death as an outcome with inconsistent findings. In one study,48 
loneliness was not associated with the risk of 1-year mortality, whereas two studies49,51 
showed that loneliness was associated with mortality.

Summary of Qualitative and Mixed Method Studies

The results from the extracted findings from the qualitative and mixed method studies are 
shown in Table 3. A variety of methods were used in the eight studies, with thematic

analysis most common. Common themes across the qualitative and mixed method studies 
emerged. With respect to contributors of loneliness in older adults living in congregate 
settings, findings across the studies noted similar issues: poor health (including dementia 
symptoms), loss of independence and autonomy, lack of privacy, loss of friends, and lack 
of social interactions. Common themes emerging from the studies relating to ways in which 
the residents ameliorated loneliness included acceptance of current life situation, activities, 
fostering meaningful relationships, having staff to help, family support, and religiosity.

Quality reporting and bias assessment

Table 4 shows the results of the evaluation of the quality of reporting of the qualitative 
studies. With respect to research team and reflexivity, of the eight studies, five reported 
who conducted the interviews,22,23,24,27,28 two mentioned the researchers’ credentials and 
their occupation at the time of the study,27,28 and none mentioned the characteristics of 
the interviewers. Regarding study design reporting, all mentioned what methodological 
orientation underpinned the study, all provided the number of participants and important 
characteristics of the sample, none of the studies mentioned if other people were present 
during the interviews, and none discussed data saturation. All but one study23 described 
how study participants were selected and five studies22,24,25,27,28 provided details regarding 
how the participants were approached. Two studies25,27 provided the number of participants 
who refused and the reasons for refusals. Four studies mentioned where the data were 
collected21,23,25,28 and five studies mentioned the duration of the interviews.21,22,25,27,28 
Three studies provided questions used in the interviews.21,23,25 All but two studies21,23 
included information on the number of coders used. Two studies provided information on 
the coding tree.25,28 Two studies included information regarding the software used.26,27 
All studies clearly presented major findings, included quotations to illustrate themes, and 
demonstrated consistency between the findings and the data provided.

Tables 5 and 6 show the results of the evaluation of quality of cross-sectional and cohort 
studies respectively. With respect to the cross-sectional studies, all but one study41 reported 
the study objectives, although for many estimating the association between loneliness and 
adverse health outcomes was not the primary focus of the paper. All but two studies29,41 
clearly described the study sample. Ten of the 18 studies did not report response rates; more 
than half lacked further consideration of the impact of non-response on the study findings. 
The majority provided clear operational definitions of loneliness and the health outcomes 
under study and most discussed the validity, reliability, or accuracy of the measures used. 
None provided distributions of potential confounders by the levels of loneliness in the 
sample. The majority described their analytic strategy, the main study findings, included 
estimates of precision and or p-values, and discussed the study limitations. Most studies 
considered and adjusted for potential confounders. All but one study29 reported funding 
sources, conflicts of interest, and ethics approval. With respect to the three included cohort 
studies, all clearly stated their study objectives, described the sample, described operational 
definitions of loneliness and outcomes of interest, but none provided distributions of 
potential confounders by levels of loneliness. None provided power analyses or sample 
size calculations. The three studies clearly described their analytic approach, main findings 
(including p-values and/or 95% confidence intervals), and limitations. One study48 lacked

DISCUSSION

This systematic review confirmed that loneliness was common among older adults living 
in congregate long term care living settings. We found that loneliness was associated with 
negative health outcomes including depression, suicidal ideation, and frailty for older adults 
in congregate living settings. While it is plausible for loneliness to cause depression (and this 
is supported by the qualitative and mixed method studies included in our review), the studies 
synthesized in this systematic review do not rule out the possibility of a bi-directional 
association as most used cross-sectional designs. Only three studies48,49,51 evaluated the 
impact of loneliness on mortality and findings were mixed. Suggestions on how to reduce 
loneliness in congregate long term care living settings for older adults included efforts 
by residents themselves as well as the facilities (e.g., staff engagement, organized social 
activities).

Regardless of the study location, design, or measures used to assess loneliness, our study 
found that most older adults living in congregate settings experienced at least some degree 
of loneliness. The findings from our review were consistent with estimates from a recent 
meta-analysis which estimated the prevalence of loneliness in residential and nursing care 
homes.4 In both the meta-analysis and our synthesis of quantitative and qualitative studies, 
loneliness among older adults living in congregate long term care settings was common. 
Loneliness among community-dwelling older adults ranges from 19% to 29%.52 Whether 
older adults entering nursing homes are already lonely while living in the community, 
or whether loneliness onset occurred concurrent or after admission to nursing homes is 
unknown. A recent study attributed nearly 20% of nursing home admissions to loneliness 
and noted that this modifiable risk factor for nursing home admission may be a target 
of intervention to delay time to admission.53 Among older adults living in rural areas of 
the US, people with high baseline loneliness scores were more likely to be admitted to a 
nursing home than those with lower loneliness scores.54 Losing self-determination due to 
institutionalization was strongly related to loneliness.55

We also found that loneliness was associated with mental health (e.g., depression, suicidal 
ideation) and physical health (e.g., frailty), albeit most studies were cross-sectional in 
nature. Among the cross-sectional studies, several studies reporting odds ratios showed large 
measures of association (odds ratios >2),30,33,34,37,42,43 whereas those reporting continuous 
measures of association showed modest, but statistically significant measures of association 
with unclear clinical relevance. One cohort study found a direct effect of loneliness on 
depression50, but the effect size was small (loneliness β=0.05; 95% CI: 0.01 to 0.42). With

was found in one study48, a small effect size was noted for the association between 
attachment and mortality (attachment HR: 0.95; 95% 0.91–0.99)49, and another found a 
gradient between frequency of loneliness and mortality (sometimes lonely HR 1.19, 95% 
CI 1.05–1.35; always lonely HR 1.28, 95% CI 1.06–1.55).51 Social connectedness, the

social connectedness leads to isolation59,60 and loneliness,61 proposed as the new “geriatric 
giants”62 in need of intervention by the health care system.63

While not explicitly a goal of the review, the synthesis of qualitative findings revealed 
insights about potential approaches to mitigating loneliness. Two targets for interventions 
emerged: 1) the residents themselves; and 2) the facilities. The synthesis of the qualitative 
and mixed method studies noted that residents did recognize their own agency in 
experiencing loneliness. Interventions to help residents through their transition to congregate 
living settings such as assisted living or nursing homes to prevent loneliness are needed. 
One such program, the Program to Enhance Adjustment to Residential Living (PEARL),64 
a simple, brief program based on self-determination theory, has been shown to reduce 
symptoms of depression in newly admitted residents.65 A recent systematic review to 
evaluate the extent to which video calls could help reduce loneliness in older people 
was inconclusive and called for more studies focusing on older adults and using 
rigorous methods.66 A meta-analysis attempting to quantify the impact of interventions 
specifically targeting loneliness (albeit in many different settings and populations) showed 
mixed results of interventions in nursing homes including group activities,67,68 animal 
assisted therapy,69,70,71 access to computers,72,73,74 and reminiscence therapy.75 While 
many activity-based interventions have been published, a synthesis of evidence-based 
interventions to address loneliness for older adults in nursing homes and assisted living 
is lacking.76 In response to the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic, congregated long term 
care living facilities around the world attempted and/or implemented innovative intervention 
strategies to alleviate loneliness in residents. An in-depth synthesis of the types and 
effectiveness of these interventions in congregate long term care settings through systematic 
review and meta-analysis is warranted. Given the different needs of older adults living in 
assisted living and nursing homes and innovations that may have been implemented in 
response to the COVID-19 pandemic, a systematic review and meta-analysis singularly 
focusing on older adults in congregate living settings is warranted.

Research implications

This systematic review identified two research gaps. First, only three eligible studies were 
conducted in the United States, with 11 studies conducted in the Asia-Pacific region. Given 
the cultural and societal differences in how older adults are viewed77 and differences with 
respect to what long term care living spaces are and when older adults enter them78, we 
question the extent to which findings from other parts of the world may be generalizable to 
older adults living in congregate settings in North America. We speculate that the reasons 
for the paucity of studies in North America may be related to lack of funding for research 
on this topic. Recent initiatives by the National Institutes of Health are likely to stimulate 
research in this space.79 Second, our systematic review revealed that longitudinal studies 
quantifying the association between loneliness and health outcomes for older adults living 
in nursing homes or assisted living are scant. Given the high prevalence of loneliness in 
these settings, that residents live in nursing homes is on average 2 years,80 and the mounting 
evidence from cross-sectional studies suggesting the contribution of loneliness to many 
adverse health outcomes, there is a pressing need for rigorous longitudinal studies to not

only quantify the association between loneliness and health outcomes, but also to identify 
factors that may mediate the negative impact of loneliness on health.

Strengths and Limitations: Our systematic review has many strengths. We used 
PRISMA guidelines15,16 to conduct this review. Working with a research librarian, we 
developed a list of key words associated with our domains of interest to cast a wide net 
in hopes that we would not miss articles related to loneliness or social isolation. Further, 
terminology used to identify congregate living settings for older adults was broad as terms 
vary across countries (e.g., care homes, residential care, skilled nursing facilities, nursing 
homes). Our comprehensive approach including searching five databases. We also applied 
dual review processes and dual evaluation of the quality and bias potential of included 
studies to bolster the rigor of our review. Despite these efforts, it is possible that relevant 
articles were missed. We were unable to conduct a meta-analysis given the heterogeneity of 
measures and statistical approaches used in the eligible articles.

CONCLUSIONS

Loneliness among older adults is a common phenomenon in congregate long term care 
living settings. Loneliness appears to be associated with depression, suicidal ideation, frailty, 
but the directionality of the associations remains unclear because most of the studies linking 
loneliness to health outcomes were cross-sectional. Longitudinal studies to understand the 
impact of loneliness on health outcomes in older adults in congregate long term care settings 
are needed, as are rigorous qualitative studies and research on evidence-based interventions 
to prevent loneliness, reduce loneliness, and mitigate the harmful effects of loneliness during 
life’s final chapter.

Highlights

•

•

•

•

Evidence linking loneliness and negative health impacts exists among older 
adults.

It is unclear if evidence extends to older adults in congregate living settings.

Loneliness is common among older residents in congregate living situations.

Loneliness was associated with depression, but most studies were cross-
sectional.

Longitudinal studies in older adults living in congregate settings are needed.
