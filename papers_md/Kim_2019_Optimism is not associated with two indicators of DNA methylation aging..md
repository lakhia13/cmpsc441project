ABSTRACT 

Evidence  indicates  associations  between  higher  optimism  and  reduced  risk  of  age-related  conditions  and 
premature  mortality.  This  suggests  optimism  is  a  positive  health  asset,  but  research  identifying  potential 
biological mechanisms underlying these associations remains limited. One potential pathway is slower cellular 
aging,  which  may  delay  age-related  deterioration  in  health.  Data  were  from  the  Women’s  Health  Initiative 
(WHI) (N=3,298) and the Veterans Affairs Normative Aging Study (NAS) (N=514), and included dispositional and 
explanatory  style  optimism  measures.  We  evaluated  whether  higher  optimism  was  associated  with  metrics 
suggestive of less cellular aging, as indicated by two DNA methylation algorithms, intrinsic (IEAA) and extrinsic 
epigenetic  age  acceleration  (EEAA);  these  algorithms  represent  accelerated  biologic  aging  that  exceeds 
chronological age. We used linear regression models to test our hypothesis while considering several covariates 
(sociodemographics,  depressive  symptoms,  health  behaviors).  In  both  cohorts,  we  found  consistently  null 
associations  of  all  measures  of  optimism  with  both  measures  of  DNA  methylation  aging,  regardless  of 
covariates considered.  For  example,  in  fully-adjusted models, dispositional optimism was not associated with 
either  IEAA  (WHI:β=0.02;  95%  Confidence  Interval  [CI]:-0.15-0.20;  NAS:β=-0.06;  95%  CI:-0.56-0.44)  or  EEAA 
(WHI:β=-0.04;  95%  CI:  -0.26-0.17;  NAS:β=-0.17;  95%  CI:  -0.80-0.46).  Higher  optimism was  not  associated  with 
reduced cellular aging as measured in this study. 

INTRODUCTION 

issues.  According 

Aging  and  age-related  health  conditions  have  become 
critical  public  health 
to  recent 
projections, the percentage of people aged >65 years in 
the  United  States  is  expected  to  increase  by  more  than 
60%  over  the  next  15  years  [1].  Growing  evidence 
suggests  that  higher  levels  of  optimism  are  associated 
with  reduced  risk  of  a  wide  range  of  age-related 
conditions such as cardiovascular events, lung function 
decline,  cognitive  impairment,  and  premature  mortality 
(including both overall mortality and deaths due to heart 
disease,  stroke,  or  cancer)  [2–11].  For  example,  in  a 
prospective study of 70,021 older women followed over 
8 years, women in the highest (versus lowest quartile of 
optimism  had  a  38%  reduced  risk  (95%  confidence 
interval [CI]: 0.50, 0.76) of heart disease mortality and a 
39%  reduced  risk  (95%  CI:  0.43,  0.85)  of  stroke 
mortality  after  adjusting  for  sociodemographic  factors 
[2].  Prospective  studies  in  other  cohorts  have  reported 
similar findings [5,12–14]. 

Optimism,  which  has  been  defined  either  as  the 
generalized expectation that good things will happen or 
according  to  the  ways  in  which  people  explain  the 
causes  of  good  and  bad  events,  may  therefore  be  a 
powerful,  positive  health  asset.  Biologic  mechanisms 
underlying the optimism-health associations are not yet 
well-established,  but  understanding  biologic  pathways 
could  point  to  novel  means  of  improving  health  in 
aging.  Given  the  broad  associations  between  optimism 
and  health  across  disease  endpoints,  it  is  possible  that 
optimism  is  related  to  systemic  processes  that  affect 
multiple outcomes. Given consistent findings with age- 
related diseases, one candidate process is slower cellular 

aging,  whereby  optimism  could  reduce  or  delay  age-
related deterioration in health.  

from 

clock”  derived 

Recent work has identified DNA methylation (DNAm) 
as a strong component of biologic aging, and developed 
“epigenetic  clocks”  designed  to  capture  methylation-
based  markers  of  aging.  Horvath  et  al.  proposed  an 
“epigenetic 
age-associated 
methylation  changes 
in  353  Cytosine-phosphate-
Guanosine  sites  (CpGs)  across  the  genome  that  are 
involved  in  important  biological  processes  (e.g.,  DNA 
replication  and  repair,  lipid  metabolism,  oxidative 
stress,  and  other  chronic  disease  related  processes) 
[15,16].  This  clock  score  is  well-validated  across 
multiple  cell  types  and  tissues,  and  in  epidemiologic 
studies it predicts cognitive function, lung function, grip 
strength,  and  premature  mortality,  among  other 
outcomes  [16–18].  Hannum  et  al.  also  derived  an 
epigenetic clock score in a slightly different way, lever-
aging DNA methylation in  blood at 71 CpG sites [15]. 
A  measure  of  methylation  age  acceleration  can  be 
derived using either of these scores to capture a positive 
difference  between  DNA  methylation  and  chronologic 
age. 

Prior  work  has  suggested  epigenetic  aging  might 
explain  observed 
relationships  between  negative 
psychological  factors  and  health.  For  example,  stress-
related epigenetic aging has been proposed as a possible 
explanatory  factor  linking  psychological  stress  and 
higher  risk  of  developing  age-related  diseases,  with 
several  studies  demonstrating  higher  levels  of  lifetime 
stress are associated with accelerated DNA methylation 
age  (DNAm)  [19,20].  While  less  work  has  examined 
positive  psychological  factors  in  relation  to  epigenetic

aging,  to  assess  potential  protective  effects  on  aging 
processes,  given  prior  findings  of  protective  effects  in 
relation to chronic disease outcomes, such relations are 
plausible.  Optimism  may  be  associated  with  a  slower 
rate  of  epigenetic  aging  if  it  either  reduces  stress 
exposure, or buffers its effects – although it is important 
to  note  that  optimism  does  not  simply  reflect  the 
absence  of  stress  and  in  fact  may  have  independent 
effects  on  biological  processes  [6].  Optimism  has  been 
characterized  as  an  asset  or  resource  that  people  can 
utilize  throughout  life  and  across  multiple  domains 
[11,21,22].  Generally,  psychological  health  assets  like 
optimism,  tend  to  be  stable  across  time,  although  they 
can be responsive to life changes such as unemployment 
or  divorce  [23],  or  to  interventions,  such  as  activities 
that promote psychological well-being [24–26].   

In  the  current  study,  we  sought  to  test  the  hypothesis 
that  higher  optimism  would  be  associated  with  metrics 
suggestive  of  less  cellular  aging,  as  indicated  by  two 
DNA methylation age algorithms, intrinsic (IEAA) and 
extrinsic  epigenetic  age  acceleration  (EEAA);  these 
algorithms  represent  accelerated  biologic  aging  that 
exceeds  chronological  age.  Intrinsic  epigenetic  age 
acceleration  captures  properties  of  aging  that  are 
independent  of  cell  type  and  organ  whereas  extrinsic 
epigenetic  acceleration  likely  reflects  both  epigenetic 
variation and age-related changes in cell distributions in 
blood [27]. We used data from two ongoing epidemio- 

logic cohorts that include women or men, the Women’s 
Health  Initiative  (WHI)  and  the  VA  Normative  Aging 
Study  (NAS).  Based  on  prior  work  we  identified 
relevant  covariates  for  consideration  including  socio-
demographic 
status,  and  health 
behaviors, which might confound or lie on the pathway 
between  optimism  and  DNA  methylation,  as  well  as 
depression, which is correlated with both optimism and 
DNA methylation profiles [28].

RESULTS 

Sample description 

The  WHI  sample  consisted  of  3,298  women  including 
1,665 Whites, 961 Blacks, and 561 Hispanics, and 111 
in  the  “Other”  race/ethnicity  category.  Chronological 
age  in  the  WHI  sample  ranged  from  50-79  years 
(mean=64). Most women were married (or in marriage-
like  relationships:  56%),  and  most  had  education  after 
high school (some college or an associate degree: 26%, 
or a college or graduate degree: 30%). The NAS sample 
consisted  of  514  men  (99%  White)  ranging 
in 
chronological  age  from  56-91  years  (mean=73).  Most 
men were  married (76%), and had either a high school 
degree  (20%)  or  college  or  graduate  degrees  (35%).

Optimism and DNA methylation age 

IEAA 

In WHI, when considering both dispositional optimism 
and  DNAm  age  as  continuous  variables,  we  observed 
no  association  of  optimism  with 
(mean 
difference,  β=0.07;  95%  CI:  -0.10,0.24;  Table  2); 
however,  we  did  observe  an  association  with  EEAA 
(mean  difference,  β=-0.35;  95%  CI:  -0.55,-0.13)  in 
unadjusted  models  such  that  higher  optimism  was 
associated  with  lower  DNAm  age.  In  models  that 
adjusted for basic confounders, we observed no relation 
of  optimism  to  IEAA  (β=0.02;  95%  CI:  -0.16,0.19; 
Table  2)  and  associations  with  EEAA  were  attenuated 
and no longer statistically significant (β=-0.06; 95% CI: 
-0.28,0.16).  After  further  adjusting  for  the  full  set  of 
covariates, associations were not meaningfully different 
(Table 2).  

When  evaluating  the  association  between  dispositional 
optimism  and  DNAm  age  in  NAS,  we  observed  a 
pattern  of  null  findings  in  unadjusted  as  well  in  all  the 
other  models.  For  example,  in  our  basic  adjusted 
models,  optimism  was  not  associated  with  IEAA  (β=-
0.06; 95% CI:  -0.55,0.42; Table 3) or EEAA (β=-0.23; 
95% CI: -0.83,0.38). 

We  also  evaluated  quartiles  of  optimism  in  relation  to 
both EEAA and IEAA, in the WHI and NAS. Findings 
were null in both cohorts for IEAA. In the WHI women, 
in  the  unadjusted  model,  individuals  in  the  lowest 
(versus highest) quartile of optimism had a lower mean 
EEAA  score  (β=-0.73;  95%  CI:  -1.32,-0.15;  Table  3). 
However,  this  association  was  no  longer  statistically 
significant after adjusting for additional covariates, and 
all findings with EEAA were null in the NAS.

Additional analyses 

In  both  the  WHI  and  NAS,  after  excluding  individuals 
with  depression,  associations  for  optimism  with  either 
IEAA and EEAA remained consistently null (Appendix 
A  1,  Table  S3  and  Table  S4).  Further,  no  statistically 
significant  associations  with  IEAA  and  EEAA  were 
evident  for  either  the  pessimism  or  the  optimism 
subscales.  Associations  between  the  explanatory  style 
optimism  and  both  IEAA  and  EEAA  were  also 
uniformly  null  in  all  models  (Table  4).  In  analyses 
stratified  by  race  in  WHI  (Black  and  White  women), 
associations  remained  consistently  null  across  strata 
(data not shown). Findings from analyses that included 
the  736  WHI  women  who  did  not  have  the  full  set  of 
covariates,  were  similarly  null  (data  not  shown). 
Finally,  in  WHI,  after  additionally  adjusting  for  case-
control status, WHI observational study membership, as 
trial  membership  findings  were 
well  as  clinical 
uniformly null across all models (data not shown). 

DISCUSSION 

We  examined  the  association  between  optimism  and 
epigenetic  age  acceleration  measured  by  DNA  methyl-
tion in two well characterized cohorts. We were able to 
examine  two  forms  of  optimism,  dispositional  and 
explanatory  style.  Regardless  of  which  measure  we 
considered  and  across  cohorts,  we  found  consistently 
null  associations  between  optimism  and  both  measures 
of  DNA  methylation  aging,  the  intrinsic  and  extrinsic 
epigenetic age acceleration measure. While we did find 
one  statistically  significant  association  between  the 
highest versus lowest quartile of dispositional optimism 
and  lower  EEAA  score  in  an  unadjusted  model,  it  was 
evident  only  among  the  women.  Thus,  we  remain 
cautious about interpreting this finding as occurring for 
reasons other than chance. Findings were unchanged in 
secondary  analyses  where  we  excluded  those  with 
depression,  separately  examined  the  optimism  and 
pessimism subscales of the LOT, or considered another 
validated  measure  of  optimism  (PSM-R)  available  in 
the men.   

There  may  be  several  explanations  for  these  null 
associations.  Our  specific  measures  of  epigenetic  age 
acceleration  may  not  be  as  relevant  for  optimism  as 
other formulations might be. The DNA methylation age 
measures  considered  here  reflect  underlying  aging 
processes  that  are  at  least  partially  under  genetic 
control,  and  are  more  weakly  associated  with  several 
lifestyle  factors  [27].  Pathway  analysis  suggests  the 
components  of  the  DNA  methylation  age  [16,18]  are 
enriched  for  immune  cell  trafficking  and  development, 
and  these  processes  may  not  be  strongly  influenced  by 
optimism.  Further  work  is  needed  to  evaluate  other 

potential  biologic  mechanisms  of  optimism,  both 
epigenetic and others, that may underlie the association 
of  optimism  with  health.  For  example,  one  recently 
developed  metric,  DNA  methylation  PhenoAge,  has  a 
stronger  association  with  lifestyle  and  wellness  factors 
than the IEAA or EEAA measures [29], and as a result, 
may be more strongly linked to optimism. It is possible 
that other age acceleration scores that capture processes 
more tightly linked to optimism will also be developed. 
Further,  although  we  did  not  observe  evidence  of  a 
direct  effect  between  optimism  and  DNAm  age,  future 
research  should  evaluate  if  optimism  might  moderate 
(or “dampen”) the effects of various stressors on DNAm 
age.  

With  increasing  availability  of  epigenetic  information, 
we  will  have  additional  opportunities  to  assess  if  the 
biologic  correlates  of  optimism  will  be  better  captured 
by  additional  epigenetic  metrics  of  aging  [29,30],  or  if 
specific  scores  are  less  effective  than  broader  agnostic 
analyses  of  the  epigenome.  Future  studies  that  have 
repeated  measures  of  DNA  methylation  aging  could 
also  provide  a  stronger  test  of  the  hypothesis  that 
optimism  influences  epigenetic  aging  by  evaluating  if 
optimism is associated with changes in the rate of DNA 
methylation  aging  over 
time.  However,  another 
plausible explanation for our null findings could be that 
the  biological  pathways  by  which  optimism  works  to 
reduce  risk  of  age-related  chronic  diseases  simply  do 
not  include  changes  in  DNAm  aging.  Assessing  these 
possibilities and alternative biological pathways for the 
observed  association  between  optimism  and  chronic 
diseases  of  aging  will  be  important  next  steps  for  this 
research. 

The current study has some limitations. Both optimism 
and DNA methylation were assessed at a single point in 
time.  Measurement  error  can  be  particularly  proble-
matic  in  studies  such  as  ours,  that  rely  on  a  single 
biomarker  measurement  [31],  which  likely  has  some 
random  variability.  Associations  were  cross-sectional 
and given the composition of each sample, findings may 
not  be  broadly  generalizable,  particularly  to  younger 
individuals.  Nonetheless,  this  study  has  important 
strengths.  We  used  two  large  and  richly  characterized 
cohorts and were able to assess associations in both men 
and women as well as adjust for potential confounders. 
Further,  two  forms  of  optimism,  dispositional  and 
explanatory style were assessed, with a commonly used 
validated  measure  dispositional  optimism 
in  both 
cohorts  and  a  validated  measure  of  explanatory  style 
optimism in the NAS. Findings were remarkably similar 
across  measures  and  cohorts.  In  conclusion,  we 
examined 
and 
epigenetic  aging  in  older  men  and  women  from  two 
long-running cohorts with large sample sizes and found

no 
associations  between 
optimism  and  intrinsic  or  extrinsic  epigenetic  age

not  specifically  associated  with  biological  mechanisms 
underlying  these  metrics  of  epigenetic  age  and  age 
acceleration.  It  may  also  be  that  the  combination  of 
genes  included  in  these  epigenetic  aging  scores  do  not 
well-reflect  the  biological  effects  of  optimism,  and 
analyses  of  other  clock  scores,  or  broader  agnostic  or 
pathway  analyses  of  DNA  methylation  could  yield 
greater  insight  into  biological  processes  underlying 
optimism.  

[32], 

identifying  novel  pathways 

Given  robust  and  consistent  findings  that  optimism  is 
associated  with  reduced  risk  of  developing  a  range  of 
age-related  diseases  as  well  as  overall  mortality,  and 
that  the  relationships  are  not  fully  explained  by  health 
behaviors 
to 
improving  health  in  aging  remains  an  important  goal. 
Our findings assess only one metric of epigenetic aging, 
but  new  methods  and  measures  for  assessing  these 
processes  are 
in  active  development  (or  recently 
available), suggesting continued effort to understand the 
range  of  epigenetic  and  other  underlying  biological 
mechanisms is warranted.  

MATERIALS AND METHODS 

Study Population 

Women’s Health Initiative 
The  Women’s  Health  Initiative  (WHI)  is  a  long-term 
study  focused  on  identifying  strategies  for  preventing 
major  chronic  diseases  in  postmenopausal  women. 
Starting in 1993, racially and ethnically diverse women 
aged  50-79  years  were  recruited  throughout  the  U.S. 
and entered either clinical trial(s) (WHI-CT; N=68,132) 
or  the  observational  study  (WHI-OS;  N=93,676).  Data 
were  collected  at  40  clinical  centers  throughout  the 
country.  At  baseline,  women  completed  self-adminis-
tered  questionnaires 
information  about 
including 
sociodemographic  factors,  psychosocial  characteristics, 
health  behaviors,  and  chronic  conditions.  Further,  after 
fasting  overnight,  they  visited  study  clinics  where 
certified  clinical  center  staff  collected blood  specimens 
and performed anthropometric measurements.  

The  present  study  draws  on  data  from  two  WHI 
substudies.  The  first  substudy  (Epigenetic  Mechanisms 
of  PM-Mediated  Cardiovascular  Disease  Risk  (EMPC; 
AS315;  n=2,200)  included  a  stratified  random  sample 
representative  of  the  larger  WHI  CT  population  [27].  
The second substudy (Integrative Genomics and Risk of 
Coronary Heart Disease and Related Phenotypes  in the 
Women’s Health Initiative; BAA23; n=2,107) examined 
genomic determinants of coronary heart disease (CHD), 

using  a  nested  case-control  design  (with  oversampling 
of  African  Americans  and  Hispanics)  in  the  WHI 
observational  study  and  CT  study  populations.  When 
data  from  both  substudies  were  combined,  there  were 
118  women  who  were  in  both  substudies;  thus,  only 
data  from  EMPC  was  used  when  overlap  existed 
(results were very similar when data from BAA23 were 
used  instead).  Further,  148  women  were  excluded 
because  they  had  missing  data  on  optimism  and  a 
further  7  were  excluded  due  to  missing  data  on  the 
DNA  methylation  measures.  Finally,  some  covariates 
were  assessed  only  at  baseline,  and  because  some 
women  had  their  blood  drawn  after  baseline  (n=736) 
they were excluded from primary analyses, resulting in 
a  final  analytic  sample  of  3,298  WHI  women.  In 
secondary  analyses,  we  evaluated  the  main  association 
of interest after including the 736 women, without fully 
control for covariates.  

(NAS) 

VA Normative Aging Study 
The  VA  Normative  Aging  Study 
is  a 
longitudinal  investigation  of  normal  aging  processes  in 
community-dwelling  men,  initiated  in  1963.  The  study 
enrolled healthy men aged 21 to 81 years who were free 
of  known  chronic  medical  conditions.  Men  provided 
information  on  demographic  factors,  medical  history, 
psychosocial  factors,  and  lifestyle  factors  on  a  regular 
basis. They were interviewed at the VA Boston hospital 
every  3-5  years,  and  also  participated  in  a  physical 
exam  and  laboratory  tests.  Blood  was  drawn  at  each 
physical  exam.  Eligibility  for  this  study  required 
continued  participation  as  of  the  time  when  DNA 
samples were first collected. Dropout has been < 1% per 
year  in  this  cohort.  Among  the  active  1,749  NAS 
participants  at  the  time,  DNA  samples  were  collected 
from 1999-2009 for 774 participants. Among these, we 
excluded  from  analysis  260  men  who  did  not  have  an 
optimism  measurement  before  a  DNA  sample  was 
taken. The final analytic sample included 514 NAS men 
with both DNA and measures of optimism.   

Because  restrictions  apply  to  the  public  availability  of 
these  data,  they  are  available  from  the  WHI  and  NAS 
study coordinators upon reasonable request.   

Measures 

Optimism assessment  
WHI:  In  WHI,  dispositional  optimism  was  assessed  at 
baseline using the Life Orientation Test-Revised (LOT-
R).  The  measure  has  demonstrated  good  discriminant 
and convergent validity, as well as good reliability [33]. 
Negatively  worded  items  were  reverse  coded,  and  then 
all items were summed to create a composite score that 
ranged  from  6  to  30,  with  higher  scores  indicating 
higher optimism. Following standard WHI protocol, the

the  LOT-R 

score  was  set  to  missing  if  study  respondents  were 
missing  any  of 
items.  To  facilitate 
comparisons  of  effect  sizes  across  studies,  we 
standardized  optimism  scores  (Mean(M)=0,  Standard 
Deviation(SD)=1).  Internal  consistency  reliability  was 
high  in  the  analytic  sample  at  baseline  (Cronbach 
α=0.75).  To  assess  the  possibility  of  discontinuous  or 
threshold effects, we also created quartiles of optimism 
based  on  the  score  distribution  in  the  sample.  Mean 
optimism  scores  by  quartile  were:  19,  23,  24,  and  27. 
Following prior work on dispositional optimism [34], in 
secondary  analyses,  we  also  evaluated  the  optimistic 
(Cronbach  α=0.77)  and  pessimistic  (Cronbach  α=0.74) 
subscales  of  LOT-R,  each  composed  of  three  items 
from the overall scale.  

NAS:  In  NAS,  dispositional  optimism  was  assessed 
using  both  the  Revised  Optimism-Pessimism  Scale 
(PSM-R) and the original Life Orientation Test (LOT). 
The LOT is the parent scale from which the LOT-R was 
largely  derived  and  includes  8  items  that  contribute  to 
the  scale  score.  Items  were  reverse  coded  as  necessary 
and  summed  to  create  a  composite  score  that  ranged 
from  7  to  32  in  this  sample,  with  higher  scores 
indicating  higher  optimism.  Again,  we  standardized 
optimism  scores  (M=0,  SD=1).  Internal  consistency 
reliability  was  high  in  the  analytic  sample  at  baseline 
(Cronbach  α=0.78).  We  created  quartiles  of  optimism 
based on the score distribution in the sample and mean 
optimism scores by quartile were: 16, 20, 22, and 26. In 
the  optimistic 
secondary  analyses,  we  evaluated 
(Cronbach  α=0.75)  and  pessimistic  (Cronbach  α=0.80) 
subscales  of  LOT,  each  composed  of  four  items  from 
the overall scale. 

Another  measure  of  optimism  based  on  explanatory 
style  was  assessed  using  the  PSM–R,  developed  and 
validated  by  Malinchoc,  Offord,  and  Colligan  [35,36]. 
This bipolar scale measures the way individuals explain 
the  causes  of  both  good  and  bad  events,  and 
characterized  explanatory  style  on  a  continuum  from 
optimistic  to  pessimistic,  by  using  263  items  selected 
from  the  revised  Minnesota  Multiphasic  Personality 
Inventory  (MMPI–2).  Following  the  scoring  algorithm, 
items  were  combined  into  a  composite  bipolar  score 
reflecting a more optimistic explanatory style at the low 
end of the continuum and a more pessimistic one at the 
high  end.  This  measure  has  predicted  reduced  risk  of 
heart  disease  and  slower  lung  function  decline  in  the 
NAS  cohort  [3,37].  Internal  consistency  reliability  was 
high  in  the  analytic  sample  at  baseline  (Cronbach 
α=0.78),  and prior  research demonstrates  this  scale  has 
high  test-retest  reliability  of  0.90  [36].  To  assess  the 
possibility of discontinuous or threshold effects, we also 
created  quartiles  of  optimism  based  on  the  score 

distribution  in  the  sample.  Mean  scores  by  quartile 
were: 58, 47, 41, and 32.

age  acceleration  score  (IEAA)  [16]  and  the  extrinsic 
epigenetic age acceleration score (EEAA) [15]. The two 
scores  were  calculated  identically  in  WHI  and  NAS 
based  on  scripts  developed  by  Horvath  the  IEAA 
variable  is  denoted  as  AAHOAdjCellCounts  and  the 
EEAA variable is denoted as BioAge4HAStaticAdjAge). 
Both 
represent 
accelerated  biological aging  that  exceeds  chronological 
age, with positive values indicating that epigenetic age 
is  higher  than  chronological  age.  Both  measures  are 
calculated  by  obtaining  the  residual  when  regressing 
DNAm  age  on  chronological  age.  Intrinsic  epigenetic 
age  acceleration  captures  properties  of  aging  that  are 
independent  of  cell  type  and  organ  whereas  extrinsic 
epigenetic  acceleration  likely  reflects  both  epigenetic 
variation  and  age-related  changes  in  cell  distributions 
in  blood  [27].  In  WHI,  the  correlation  between  IEAA 
and  EEAA  was  0.36  and  in  NAS  the  correlation  was 
0.32. 

Assessment  of  potential  confounders  and  other 
covariates  

WHI. Potential confounders included sociodemographic 
factors  and  depression.  Sociodemographic  variables 
were  obtained  from  the  baseline  questionnaire  and 
included  age  (continuous),  race  (White,  Black/African-
American,  Hispanic/Latino,  Other),  marital  status

$74,999,  $75,000+,  don’t  know).  Depression  status 
(yes/no)  was  defined  according  to  Burnam  Screening 
Algorithm questionnaire that includes 6 items from the 
Center  for  Epidemiologic  Studies  Depression  Scale 
(CES-D)  and  two  from  the  Diagnostic  Interview  Scale 
(DIS)  [39,40],  with  a  cutoff  of  ≥0.06  indicating 
depression  [39].    Health  conditions  were  self-reported 
(yes/no)  and  included:  hypertension,  high  cholesterol, 
cardiovascular  disease,  diabetes,  stroke,  cancer.  Height 
and weight were measured by trained staff and used to 
calculate  Body  Mass  Index  (BMI)  in  kg/m2.  and  then, 
three  BMI  categories  were  created  (<24.9,  25.0  to 
29.9,≥30.0).  Potential  confounding  or 
intermediate 
variables  included  the  following  health  behaviors,  all 
self-reported  on  the  baseline  questionnaire:  cigarette 
smoking  (never,  former,  current  smoker),  physical 
activity  (weekly  expenditure  of  metabolic  equivalent 
tasks (METs; <3 METs/week, 3-<9 METs/week, 9-<19 
METs/week,  18-<27  METs/week,  27+  METs/week), 
alcohol intake (non-drinker, current drinker), diet (122-

demographic variables were obtained from the baseline

included 
educational 
race/ethnicity 
(white/non-white), marital status (married/not  married). 
Depressive  symptoms  were  assessed  with  a  subscale 
from the Brief Symptom Inventory [42], with a cutoff of 
≥0.638  indicating  depression.  Information  about  health 
conditions was self-reported (yes/no), updated every 3-5 
years,  and  included:  coronary  heart  disease,  stroke, 
diabetes, and cancer. BMI in kg/m2 was calculated from 
weight and height measured by study staff (<24.9, 25.0-
29.9,  ≥30.0).  Further  variables  included  the  following 
health  behaviors  (updated  every  3-5  years),  which 
could  be  confounders  or

smoking  status  (current,  former,  never),  physical 
activity  (created  based  on  questions  asking  about

Statistical analysis 

intermediates 

In  primary  analyses,  we  considered  optimism  as  a 
continuous  standardized  variable,  where  associations 
represent the change in DNAm age as a function of a 1 
standard  deviation  increase  in  optimism,  and  also 
evaluated optimism categorized into quartiles (based on 
the  sample-specific  distribution  of  scores).  All  models 
were run separately  within  each cohort. Several sets of 
models  were 
least  square 
tested  using  ordinary 
regression.  The  first  model  did  not  adjust  for  any 
covariates.  The  second  model  added  basic  potential 
confounders  including  race,  education,  income,  marital 
status,  chronic  conditions,  and  depression.  A  third 
model  further  added  variables  that  could  be  potential 
confounders  or 
including  physical 
activity, smoking, BMI, diet, and alcohol consumption.  
We conducted several secondary analyses. First, to test 
potential  residual  confounding  due  to  depression,  we 
excluded 
levels  of  depressive 
symptoms.  Second,  to  evaluate  whether  associations 
differed  by  the  optimism  or  pessimism  subscale,  we 
separately  evaluated  these  two  subscales.  Third,  to 
evaluate  the  consistency  of  results  across  different 
measures  of  optimism,  we  conducted  analyses  in  NAS 
using  the  PSM-R  instead  of  the  LOT.  Fourth,  In  WHI 
we  conducted  stratified  analyses  in  Black  and  White 
women. Fifth, we evaluated findings after adding to our 
sample 736 WHI women who had blood draws after the 
baseline  assessment,  and  who  did  not  have  full 
covariate  data.  Finally,  to  evaluate  potential  con-
founding  caused  by  case-control  status  (CHD-no  CHD 
over follow-up), WHI observational study membership, 
or  clinical  trial  membership  (hormone  therapy  (HT), 
dietary  modification  (DM),  or  calcium  and  Vitamin  D 
supplementation  (CaD)),  we  adjusted  for  all  of  these 
factors in the WHI cohort.
