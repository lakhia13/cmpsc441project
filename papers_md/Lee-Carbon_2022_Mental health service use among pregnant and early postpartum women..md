Abstract
Purpose  To explore the proportion and characteristics of women with a mental disorder who have contact with mental health 
services during pregnancy and the postnatal period in a maternity service in London.
Methods  Data from the WEll-being in pregNancy stuDY (WENDY), a prospective cohort study, were used. Women were 
recruited at their first appointment for antenatal care and assessed for mental disorders using the Structured Clinical Inter-
view DSM-IV Axis I/II Disorders for Research. Clinical, sociodemographic and psychosocial characteristics were collected. 
Mental health service use data were collected for the period from study entry to 3 months postpartum.
Results  Two hundred women met diagnostic criteria for a mental disorder. Fifty-five (34%) of these had at least one con-
tact with mental health services. Moderate depression (OR 7.44, CI 2.03–27.28, p < 0.01), severe depression (OR 10.5, CI 
2.68–41.12, p < 0.01), past psychiatric hospital admission (OR 3.76, CI 1.05–13.44, p < 0.05), symptoms of anxiety (OR 
3.95, CI 1.86–8.37, p < 0.001) and perceived low levels of social support (OR 0.43, CI 0.18–1.01, p = 0.05) were associated 
with an increased likelihood of contact with mental health services in univariate analyses. However, only moderate (OR 5.92, 
CI 1.31–26.78, p = 0.02) and severe depression (OR 6.04, CI 1.08–33.72, p = 0.04) remained significant in the multivariate 
regressions analyses.
Conclusion  Only a third of women with a diagnosable mental disorder at their first antenatal appointment had any contact 
with mental health services during pregnancy or up to 3 months postpartum. Further research is warranted to elicit perinatal 
women’s views about the potential barriers to accessing professional mental health care.

Introduction

Estimates suggest that up to one in five women experience 
a mental disorder during the perinatal period, that is, dur-
ing pregnancy and the first 12 months following childbirth

[1].  However,  globally,  there  is  a  disparity  between  the 
underlying prevalence of perinatal mental disorder and the 
proportion of women who access mental health services; 
significant numbers of perinatal women are not receiving 
the mental health treatment they need [2]. Indeed, one study 
reports that only 35% of women who met diagnostic criteria 
for depression accessed professional treatment during the 
perinatal period [3].

The burden of untreated perinatal mental disorders can be 
observed at several levels. Psychiatric illness is one of the 
leading causes of maternal morbidity and mortality, with 
several links made between mental disorders during preg-
nancy and obstetric complications, impaired parent–infant 
bonding, delayed child development and paternal psycho-
logical distress [4–7]. Moreover, on a societal level, esti-
mates suggest that poorly managed and untreated perinatal 
mental disorders in the UK [8] costs £8.1 billion for each

1-year cohort of birth [9]. Given the ramifications of unmet 
need, national guidelines in the UK (National Institute of 
Care and Excellence- NICE) recommend that mental health 
services promote equal access to care by offering timely and 
evidence-based mental health screening and treatment dur-
ing the perinatal period [NICE, 10].

Standardised screening tools, such as the Whooley ques-
tions, are recommended for screening symptoms of depres-
sion and the Generalised Anxiety 2 Scale was previously 
recommended to screen for anxiety [11]. A positive screen 
on either instrument indicates an elevated probability of 
caseness, i.e. of mental disorder and warrants further assess-
ment [12], with referrals being made to appropriate services, 
in accordance with the woman's needs. Psychotropic medi-
cation, talking therapies and care coordination are some of 
the interventions clinicians can employ to support perinatal 
women manage specific mental disorders [11].

To further promote equity in access, regional coverage of 
specialist (secondary care) perinatal mental health services 
within the UK has expanded; in 2018, 24% of areas in the 
UK still lacked services compared to the 50% in 2015 [13, 
14]. The unprecedented expansion in services warrants an 
evaluation of the patterns of mental health services con-
tact during the perinatal period. To the best of the author’s 
knowledge, there are no quantitative-based published find-
ings, conducted in the UK, which has explored this research 
area (Lee-Carbon, Doctoral Thesis). Research conducted 
internationally indicates that perinatal women who, before 
pregnancy, had a mental disorder or contact with mental 
health services were more likely to have contact again dur-
ing the perinatal period [3, 15–23]. Such patterns may occur 
because women with these prior experiences are more astute 
to recognising symptoms of mental disorder and, particu-
larly among those with a serious mental disorder (e.g. psy-
chosis), may continue care with the same mental health-care 
provider during pregnancy [16, 22].

The international body of research suggests that women 
experiencing financial stress (e.g. material deprivation and 
the scarcity of money to pay for treatment or transporta-
tion) or from an ethnic or racial minority backgrounds are 
less likely to have contact with mental health services com-
pared to those without this sociodemographic profile [15–17, 
23–33]. The practical concerns regarding the affordability of 
health care, language barriers to communicate with mental 
health services, perceptions of mental health services and 
the role of stigma are some of the explanations to describe 
this pattern of contact with mental health services [17, 26, 
34].

Some findings may not be generalisable to the UK given 
the variations in health-care provision and public health 
spending investments. The international body of literature 
also  has  some  methodological  limitations:  for  example, 
measuring the intention to seek professional help as opposed 

to measuring actual contact with mental health services. 
Moreover, research has heavily relied upon screening tools 
to identify perinatal mental disorders, which lack the accu-
racy and specificity of a structured interview (i.e. the Struc-
tured Clinical Interview for DSM Disorders) or clinician 
diagnoses using international criteria (DSM or ICD) [12]. 
Collectively, such approaches make it challenging to identify 
the level of unmet need among a cohort of perinatal women.
Information on who does and does not contact mental 
health services in the perinatal period within the UK context 
could inform health-care commissioners of the unmet men-
tal health needs as services expand and provide guidance 
to non-mental health professionals (e.g. midwives, health 
victors, obstetric gynaecologists) involved in the woman’s 
care throughout the perinatal period about women most at 
risk of not contacting mental health services. However, the 
limitations of previous research are likely to bias the find-
ings. A study addressing this issue, but improving on the 
methodology by utilising a clinician-administered diagnostic 
assessment is needed.

This study sought to explore contact with mental health 
services during pregnancy and up to 3 months postpartum 
among a cohort of women who met diagnostic criteria for a 
mental disorder in their first trimester of pregnancy.

Specifically, we aimed to:

(1) identify the proportion of women who had contact 
with any type of mental health service,
(2) describe the type of mental health services women 
had contact with,
(3) explore the clinical, sociodemographic and psycho-
social factors associated with contact with mental health 
services during the study period.

Methods

Study design and ethical approval

Secondary analyses were conducted on an existing dataset: 
a cohort study called the WEll-being in pregNancy stuDY 
(WENDY) [12]. The WENDY Study was granted ethical and 
governance approval from the Research Ethics Committee 
(reference: 14.LO.0075) on 14/02/2014. Ethical approval 
was sought from King’s College London to address the spe-
cific research objectives of the current study; the Psychiatry, 
Nursing and Midwifery Research Ethics Panel approved the 
application on 28/02/2019 (reference: LRS- 18/19–8451).

Participants and procedures

Recruitment for the WENDY Study was based in South 
London and took place between 10 November 2014 and 

1 3

2231

30 June 2016. Women were asked the Whooley questions 
by their midwife. Women who had a  negative  Whooley 
status (unlikely to have major depression) were randomly 
invited to participate 1:4, then 1:6, compared to those with 
a positive Whooley status (an indicator of major depressive 
symptoms) who were all invited. Women were approached 
by a researcher to discuss participation in the study, either 
at their antenatal booking appointment or shortly thereafter 
via telephone (approximately, 10–12 weeks gestation) [12]. 
Where applicable, interpreters translated the study aims 
and gained informed consent, to support women who may 
otherwise encounter language barriers to participate in the 
study. Written informed consent was gathered at the baseline 
research interview.

During the baseline research interview (mean gestation 
14-weeks), conducted within 3 weeks of the woman’s ante-
natal booking appointment, participants underwent a diag-
nostic clinical interview and completed sociodemographic 
and standardised self-report measures which were translated 
if necessary [12]. Participants were followed up twice; 28 
weeks gestation and 3 months postpartum) to explore con-
tact with mental health services.

Women were excluded if they were under the age of 16, 
did not complete the Whooley questions or terminated their 
pregnancy before the baseline research interview. A detailed 
description of the methodology of the WENDY Study is 
published elsewhere [12].

Women were excluded from the current study if they 
were participating in the ‘Antenatal guided self-help for 
women’ (DAWN) randomised controlled trial (part of the 
same programme of work as the WENDY Study) explor-
ing the efficacy of a guided self-help intervention to treat 
mild–moderate  symptoms  of  depression  [35].  This  is 
because randomisation to the DAWN intervention involved 
treatment by mental health services.

Measures

Measure of perinatal mental disorders

The Structured Clinical Interview DSM-IV Axis I/II Disor-
ders for Research (SCID I/II R) is a researcher-administered 
semi-structured interview used to assess the presence of a 
mental health disorder [36]. The following modules were 
administered by researchers at the first research appoint-
ment: mood episodes, mood disorders, anxiety disorders, 
eating disorders (SCID I) and the subsection for border-
line personality disorder (SCID II). Researchers undertook 
formal training to administer the interview, and in cases of 
ambiguity, a consensus diagnosis was achieved under the 
supervision of the study principal investigator, a psychiatrist 
[12]. For data analytical purposes, participants were grouped 
in one of the two following categories:

  (1)   ‘SCID-positive women’—women who met criteria for 

any current mental disorder.

  (2)   ‘SCID-negative women’—women without a current 

mental disorder.

For  descriptive  purposes,  diagnoses  were  defined  as: 
‘Depressive  Disorder’  (major  depression);  ‘Any  Anxi-
ety Disorder’ (panic, agoraphobia, social, specific, obses-
sive–compulsive, generalised, post-traumatic stress, and 
acute stress disorders, as per DSM-IV guidelines); ‘Any 
Eating Disorder’ (atypical anorexia, bulimia, binge eating, 
purging, and non-specified); ‘Bipolar Disorder’ (manic or 
hypomanic); ‘Mixed Anxiety and Depression’; ‘Borderline 
Personality Disorder’ and ‘Comorbid Condition’ (which 
includes a combination of 2 or more of the aforementioned 
categories).

Service use measure

A modified version of the Adult Service Use Schedule (AD-
SUS) was used to collect information on the use of health 
and social care services. The AD-SUS was collected to allow 
an economic evaluation to be conducted within the WENDY 
Study, not for exploring contact with mental health services 
during pregnancy as it is used here. It was developed for use 
in a range of adult mental health populations [8, 37, 38] and 
was modified for the purpose of this study to cover antenatal 
services as well as general health and social services, both 
for the mother and the infant. The AD-SUS was completed 
by research assistants in an interview with participants at 
28 weeks gestation and 3 months postnatally. The 28 weeks 
gestation AD-SUS covered the period from the antenatal 
booking appointment (baseline) to the 28 -weeks gestation 
follow-up interview. The AD-SUS at 3 -months postnatal 
covered the period from the date of the 28 -weeks gestation 
interview to the 3 month postnatal interview.

Participants were asked to report any contacts with a 
range of health and social care services, including all mental 
health services. Specifically, questions in the AD-SUS that 
focused on mental health services were as follows:

  (1)   Have you had any contact with any of the following 

community services:

(i)   psychological therapies/talking therapies low 
intensity: groups, workshops and guided self-
help (written materials with regular support on 
the phone or face to face)?

(ii)   psychological therapies/talking therapies (IAPT) 
high intensity: counselling CBT or other ther-
apy, weekly face to face individual sessions?

(iii)   community psychiatric nurse?
(iv)   clinical psychologist/counsellor?

1 3

Social Psychiatry and Psychiatric Epidemiology (2022) 57:2229–2240

(v)   community psychiatrist?
(vi)   perinatal psychiatric/home treatment team?

  (2)   Have you had any outpatient appointments for your 

mental health?

  (3)   Have you been admitted to hospital for your mental 

health?

Answers were dichotomised to ‘yes’ or ‘no’. An answer 
of yes to one or more of the above questions was classified 
as a ‘contact’ with mental health services. Participants 
were considered not to have contacted mental health ser-
vices if they responded ‘no’ to all the above questions. 
Contact types were grouped into three categories: primary 
care (low- and high-intensity IAPT); secondary care (com-
munity psychiatric nurses, clinical psychologists or coun-
sellors, community psychiatrists, perinatal psychiatrists 
or home treatment teams); and inpatient services (hospital 
stays for mental health).

Independent variable measures

Clinical, sociodemographic and psychosocial information 
was collected at the baseline interview.

Three clinical measures were used to explore clinical 

symptoms including:

  (1)   The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) 
is  a  ten-item  self-report  questionnaire  developed 
to measure the presence and severity of depressive 
symptoms during the perinatal period [39]. In this 
study, the symptom severity scale was used to catego-
rise no or minimal (scores 0–6), mild (scores 7–13), 
moderate (scores 14–19) and severe (scores 20–30) 
symptoms  [40].  Additionally,  the  threshold  score 
of 13 or above (which identifies those with elevated 
depressive symptoms) was applied.

  (2)   The Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-2) is a 
two-item self-report scale to screen for common anxi-
ety disorders including post-traumatic stress disorder 
(PTSD), generalised, panic and social anxiety [41]. 
The GAD-2 has a sensitivity rating of 86% and speci-
ficity of 83% when screening for generalised anxiety 
disorder, and for any anxiety disorders ratings are 65% 
and 88%, respectively, using the threshold of three or 
above [41].

As part of the baseline interview, researchers collated 
the remaining clinical information: ‘history of psychi-
atric admission’ and ‘history of deliberate self-harm or 
attempted suicide’ with answers limited to ‘yes’ or ‘no’. 
Sociodemographic information including age, employment 

status, ethnicity, household income, the highest level of 
education, immigration status and living arrangements 
were also collected as categorical variables.

Psychosocial information was derived from the Social 
Provisions Scale (SPS). This 24-item self-report question-
naire was developed to examine the responder's experi-
ence of social provision [42]. Participants rate their cur-
rent relationship experiences on a scale ranging between 
1 “strongly disagree” to 4 “strongly agree”. The scores 
are totalled, and higher scores indicate greater perceived 
social support. The questionnaire has been used in perina-
tal research and has shown good reliability and construct 
validity [42,  43]. The current study generated quartiles 
from the total SPS score to characterise the level of per-
ceived social support as reported in [44]. To do this, a total 
score was calculated and ascendingly ordered; participants 
with total scores at the lower end of the scale scores (25% 
or lower) formed the bottom quartile indicating low lev-
els of perceived social support. Those scoring in the top 
three quartiles were considered to have higher levels of 
perceived social support.

Statistical analysis

STATA version 15.1 was used to conduct analyses.

Women  with  missing  data  were  also  excluded  from 
the main analysis. Key sociodemographic and baseline 
clinical characteristics for those with and without miss-
ing data were explored descriptively using frequencies 
and percentages to assess for any biases between the two 
groups. The proportion of women who reported contact-
ing mental health services between the antenatal book-
ing appointment and 28 weeks gestation and between 28 
weeks gestation and 3 months postpartum, and overall, 
and the types of services that women reported using were 
explored with frequencies and percentages. Where women 
accessed more than one service, the service which pro-
vided care for the highest level of need was reported in 
the order inpatient, outpatient and primary care (i.e. if a 
patient contacted community and inpatient mental health 
services, then ‘inpatient service’ was recorded as the type 
of service accessed). Bivariate logistic regressions were 
used to test the relationship between mental health service 
use (yes/no) and baseline clinical, sociodemographic and 
psychosocial characteristics. Statistically significant vari-
ables (p value < 0.05) were included in a multiple regres-
sion analysis.

Results

Sample

A total of 545 participants were recruited to the WENDY 
Study. Of these, 42 were also recruited and randomised to 
the DAWN trial and were thus excluded from the current 
study. Of the remaining 503 participants, 494 undertook 
the full SCID IV assessment with 40% (n = 200) meeting 
SCID criteria for a mental disorder and hereafter referred 
to as ‘SCID-positive’ participants.

Data availability

Of the 200 participants with an SCID-positive diagno-
sis, 58.5% (n = 117) had complete data on the measures 
required for the final multiple regression analyses. Table 1 
describes the sociodemographic and clinical characteris-
tics of those with complete and those with incomplete 
data.  Notable  differences  included  ethnicity,  academic 
attainment, relationship status, income, GAD-2 symptoms, 
depressive disorder, insecure immigration and first lan-
guage. Women who identified as being from a Black back-
ground, low education attainment (secondary education or 
lower), on the lowest income bracket (up to £5,475), not 
in a relationship, being in insecure immigration status, 
having English as a second language, GAD positive or 
diagnosed with a depressive disorder were more likely to 
have incomplete data. In comparison, women from a White 
background or earning £61,000 or more were more likely 
to have complete data. The reduced data availability from 
women from low-income and marginalised backgrounds, 
or those presenting with depression or increased anxiety 
may indicate some biases.

DSM‑IV diagnoses

DSM-IV diagnoses are presented in Table 1 and Fig. 1. 
Of the 200 included participants, 36% (n = 72) met the 
criteria for more than one DSM-IV mental disorder and 
were therefore categorised within the ‘comorbid’ group. 
Of those within the comorbid group, 17% (n = 12) met the 
criteria for borderline personality disorder with depression 
or anxiety and 14% (n = 10) of participants with an eating 
disorder and depression or anxiety. Women with a single 
DSM-IV diagnosis most commonly met the criteria for a 
depressive disorder (32.5%, n = 65).

Contact with mental health services and type 
of services used

Types of mental health services accessed by participants 
over  the  28  weeks  gestation  and  3  months  postpartum 
time periods are reported in Table 2. Thirty-four percent 
(n = 55) of women with an SCID diagnosis at baseline had 
contact with mental health services over the whole follow-
up period, 23% (n = 40) between baseline and 28 weeks 
gestation and 24% (n = 40) between 28 weeks gestation 
and 3 months postpartum. Of those who had contact with 
mental health services over the course of the study period, 
7.3% (n = 4) had contact with inpatient mental health ser-
vices as their highest level of care, 69.1% (n = 38) had 
contact with secondary mental health services as their 
highest level of care and 23.6% (n = 13) had contact with 
primary care mental health services only. Very few partici-
pants (6.3%, n = 3) accessed more than one type of mental 
health service; those who did, all accessed secondary and 
inpatient mental health services.

revealed that perceived social support, EPDS category (mild, 
moderate, severe), past psychiatric admission and GAD-2 
status were all significantly associated with mental health 
service contact (Table 3).

The odds of women with moderate or severe symptoms of 
depression accessing mental health services were 7.44 (CI: 
2.03–27.28, p < 0.001) and 10.5 (CI: 2.68–41.12, p < 0.001), 
respectively, as measured by the EPDS, compared to women 
with no or minimal symptoms. Women who scored posi-
tively on the GAD-2 questionnaire (i.e. presenting with 
symptoms of anxiety) were at increased odds (OR: 3.95, CI: 
1.86–8.37, p < 0.001) of contacting mental health services 
compared to those who were GAD-2 negative, indicating 
a positive association between contact with mental health 
services amongst women who self-reported higher levels of 
anxiety symptoms. Women who had previously experienced 
a psychiatric admission were at higher odds (OR 3.76, CI: 
1.05–13.44, p < . 05) of contacting mental health services 
during the study period when compared to those without a 
psychiatric admission in their lifetime. Also, women who 
scored in the top three quartiles on the social provision scale, 
and therefore had higher levels of perceived social support, 
were at lower odds (OR 0.43, CI: 0.18–1.01, p = 0.05) of 
contacting mental health services when compared to women 
in the bottom percentile. This indicates that women who 
perceived greater levels of social support were significantly 
less likely to contact mental health services during the study 
period when compared to women who perceived compara-
tively low levels of social support.

There were some between-group differences in employ-
ment status and contact with mental health services. Indeed, 
women not in employment were more likely (OR 1.88, CI: 
0.94–3.70,  p = 0.07)  to  have  contact  with  mental  health 

services, when compared to employed women; though this 
difference was not statistically significant. There were also 
between-group differences in the number of children women 
had and contact with mental health services. Women with 
more than one child were slightly more likely (OR 1.84, 
0.96–3.56, p = 0.07) to have contact with mental health ser-
vices when compared to women with one child, though the 
differences were non-significant.

Multiple regression analyses

Multiple regression analyses were conducted to explore the 
relationship between key independent variables that were 
significant in the univariate model (EPDS category, history 
of psychiatric admission, GAD-2 and social provision), and 
the outcome variable in one regression model. Table 4 indi-
cates that moderate (OR = 5.92, CI: 1.31–26.78, p = 0.02) 
and severe depression (OR 6.04, CI: 1.08–33.72, p = 0.04), 
as measured by the EPDS, remained the only significant 
predictors of mental health services use.

Discussion

This study found that only 34% of women who had a diag-
nosable mental disorder in the first trimester of pregnancy 
had contact with mental health services from antenatal book-
ing to 3 months postpartum. These findings are comparable 
to those reported in another study in the USA who report, 
among their cohort of perinatal women with or without any 
type of diagnosed perinatal mental disorder, 38% visited 
mental health services during the study period [32].

This study also found of those who did have contact, that 
the majority of women had contact with secondary mental 
health services, which may reflect the investment and expan-
sion in specialist secondary care perinatal mental health ser-
vices in the UK over recent years [14]. It was beyond the 
scope of the study to assess whether participants received 
the appropriate level of care according to their needs or 
whether the care was effective.

In relation to factors associated with the use of mental 
health services, this study found that moderate or severe self-
reported symptoms of depression as reported by the EPDS 
were predictive of contact with mental health services and 
this variable maintained significance in the multiple regres-
sion. These findings are corroborated by other research that 
indicates increased severity in perinatal depressive symp-
toms is associated with help-seeking behaviours [45–47]. 
One study conducted in Israel reported that the odds of 
using  professional  psychological  services  increased  by 
45% of every additional point on the EPDS [47]. Increased 
symptom severity may also suggest a greater impact on daily 

functioning, thus potentially exposing the need for profes-
sional help to both health-care professionals and patients 
alike.

There is also evidence from this study that self-reported 
and elevated anxiety symptoms, low social support, or a his-
tory of psychiatric admission have a direct and positive rela-
tionship with contact with mental health services, although 
only in univariate analyses.

Our findings indicate that women who perceived high 
levels of social support were less likely to have contact with 
mental health services. Those who perceive high levels of 
support from their social networks may feel that their emo-
tional needs are being met and may not desire support from 
professional services. However, some findings indicate that 
women who do not perceive encouragement to access men-
tal health treatment from their partner or family, are more 
likely to identify barriers and have low intention to engage 
in treatment [48, 49]. Further research is warranted on the 
potential role of stigma and perceptions of mental health 
services during the perinatal period amongst women and 
family members more broadly.

A positive association between past mental disorders and 
perinatal mental health services use has been documented in 
studies conducted outside of the UK [15–17]. Past psychi-
atric admission may speak to the presence and severity of 
mental disorder before pregnancy; those who had a signifi-
cant mental disorder to warrant hospitalisation before preg-
nancy could be more astute in recognising relapse in mental 
state and thus may be more likely to seek help or be offered 
it [17]. Within the context of expanding perinatal mental 
health services, further research could explore whether preg-
nant women previously admitted to a psychiatric ward are 
prophylactically referred to secondary care mental health 
services for monitoring.

This study did not identify any differences in the demo-
graphic characteristics between those who did and did not 
have contact with mental health services. Demographic fac-
tors such as young maternal age, ethnic or racial minority 
status and low income have frequently been reported as bar-
riers to perinatal access to mental health services in similarly 
designed studies conducted outside of the UK [15, 32, 46]. 
One explanation for the difference is that our study was con-
ducted in a diverse inner-city setting and, in accordance with 
their participation in the study and the prospective study 
design, all women underwent a diagnostic assessment and 
were signposted to services if warranted. Qualitative find-
ings in the UK suggest that the level or confidence in basic 
mental health training and maternal demographics (e.g. level 
of deprivation or education, and ethnicity) may influence 
maternity staff’s decision to administer mental health screen-
ing assessments during routine antenatal appointments [50, 
51]. If women with demographics typically underrepre-
sented in mental health services are not screened during 
their standard perinatal appointments, it may delay or act as 
a barrier to accessing mental health services. A study in the 
USA suggests that when perinatal women are universally 
screened and offered an accessible mental health programme 
tackling barriers which women from an ethnic minority or 
low-income encounter, demographic disparities in service 
uptake dissipate [31].

Strengths and limitations

The current study has several strengths, including being one 
of few published findings that explore patterns of access to 
mental health services based on a moderately large sample 
size within the UK, with a diverse sample that was repre-
sentative of the local population [12]. These approaches 
enhance  the  generalisability  of  the  findings  to  the  local 
region particularly as a robust diagnostic assessment was 
used to identify a current mental disorder. Where needed, 
language  interpreters  were  used  to  enable  non-English 
speaking women to participate, and the prospective nature 

of the study design enabled us to make inferences regarding 
the direction of associations.

However, limitations must also be considered. Mental 
health diagnosis was measured once in the first trimester and 
not assessed at later points. Thus, some women could have 
recovered sufficiently to not need contact with mental health 
services meaning our estimate of the number of women who 
need contact with mental health services could be overesti-
mated. Conversely, some women could have developed men-
tal health difficulties after the first trimester of pregnancy or 
in the postpartum period and this is not detected in the study. 
Further, in the measurement of perinatal mental disorders, 
only the mood, anxiety and eating disorders section of the 
SCID I were used and the borderline personality disorder of 
the SCID II were used. This means that women with psycho-
sis spectrum disorders, other personality disorders and other 
disorders will have been misdiagnosed as having no mental 
health condition. Moreover, since the primary purpose of 
the original study was to identify women with depression 
(this is a secondary data analysis of another study), the sam-
pling strategy focussed on interviewing all women who were 
screened as positive for depression on the Whooley ques-
tions, and 1:4–1:6 of women who screened negative on the 
Whooley questions, it is likely that depression would be the 
most highly detected diagnosis and may be over represented 
in this study.

Also to consider is that all women who underwent a diag-
nostic assessment were signposted to services if warranted. 
This could have artificially increased the number of people 
in contact with mental health services, making our findings 
an overestimate. As the recruitment period of 2014–2016 in 
this study overlaps with the expansion of perinatal mental 
health services within the UK between 2015 and 2018, the 
estimates of service use from this study may no longer be 
accurate. Further, we measured contact with mental health 
services rather than treatment, or appropriate treatment, 
meaning that our estimate of the number of women who 
need mental health services input and received it could be 
underestimated. Additionally, we were not able to account 
for women who may have had their mental health treated by 
their GP since data was not collected on the reason for con-
tacts with GPs, making it impossible to assess the propor-
tion that were for mental health reasons compared to other 
reasons. In relation to this, the AD-SUS was not created 
specifically with this paper in mind, hence we had to make 
assumptions about the classification of certain mental health 
contacts. For example, counsellors were included as second-
ary care, but it is possible they were seen in primary care 
settings. Clinical psychologists can be primary care or sec-
ondary, e.g. they may work in IAPT but we chose to include 
them here in secondary care as we believed clinical psy-
chologists seen in IAPT would be more likely to be reported 
as “IAPT” (high-intensity) services by the participants. In 

1 3

2239

terms of analysis, only 58.5% of women with a SCID posi-
tive diagnosis had full data allowing them to be included 
in the multiple regression, and there were some differences 
between the group with and without complete data. This 
could have biased the results of the regression analyses. 
Additionally, no corrections were made for multiple testing.

Conclusion

Just over one-third of women who met diagnostic criteria 
for a mental disorder in the first trimester of pregnancy 
sought professional help in the subsequent year. The find-
ings emphasise the importance of universal mental health 
screening throughout the perinatal period to help detect 
those with or at most risk of developing a mental health 
disorder, and clear referral pathways to promote service use 
when needed. Findings from this study suggest that among 
women with a diagnosed perinatal mental disorder, those 
who indicate moderate to severe depressive symptoms on the 
EPDS are at increased odds of having contact with mental 
health services during pregnancy and up to 3 months post-
partum. Considering this relationship, further psychoedu-
cation might be indicated for health-care professionals and 
families alike, to raise awareness of the gravity and variation 
of perinatal mental disorder particularly when women do 
not self-report high depressive symptoms. Further research 
is warranted to understand the mental health outcomes and 
experiences of women who have contact with mental health 
services during the perinatal period to bring further context 
to this discussion.
