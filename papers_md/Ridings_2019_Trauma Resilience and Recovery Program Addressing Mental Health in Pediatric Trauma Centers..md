Abstract

Objective Approximately 225,000 children sustain injuries requiring hospitalization annually.
Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression are prevalent among pediatric patients and
caregivers post-injury. Most U.S. trauma centers do not address patients’ mental health needs.
Better models of care are needed to address emotional recovery. This article describes the engage-
ment and recovery trajectories of pediatric patients enrolled in the Trauma Resilience and
Recovery Program (TRRP), a stepped-care model to accelerate emotional recovery following hospi-
talization. Methods TRRP is designed to (a) provide in-hospital education about post-injury emo-
tional recovery and assess child and caregiver distress; (b) track mental health symptoms via a 30-
day text-messaging program; (c) complete 30-day PTSD and depression phone screens; and (d)
provide evidence-based treatment via telehealth or in-person services or referrals, if needed. All
154 families approached were offered TRRP services, 96% of whom agreed to enroll in TRRP. Most
patients were boys (59.8%), and average age was 9.12 years [standard deviation (SD) ¼ 5.42]. Most
injuries (45.8%) were sustained from motor vehicle accidents. Results
In hospital, 68.5% of care-
givers and 78.3% of children reported clinically signiﬁcant distress levels. Over 60% of families en-
rolled in the texting service. TRRP re-engaged 40.1% of families for the 30-day screen, 35.5% of
whom reported clinically signiﬁcant PTSD (M ¼ 13.90, SD ¼ 11.42) and/or depression (M ¼ 13.35,
SD ¼ 11.16). Most (76%) patients with clinically signiﬁcant symptomology agreed to treatment.
Conclusions Our intervention model was feasible and increased reach to families who needed
services. Efforts to improve follow-up engagement are discussed, as are initial successes in imple-
menting this model in other pediatric trauma centers.

More than 20 million children experience uninten-
tional injuries annually, with approximately 225,000
children sustaining injuries so severe they require hos-
pitalization (Centers
and
Prevention, National Center for Injury Prevention and

for Disease Control

Control, 2012). In addition to the physical and medi-
cal burdens incurred, mental health difficulties such as
posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression
are prevalent in this population post-injury, with 20–
30% of pediatric traumatic injury (PTI) patients

reporting mental health symptoms and/or decreased
quality of life up to 1-year post-injury (De Young,
Kenardy, Cobham, & Kimble, 2012; Kassam-Adams
& Winston, 2004; Kassam-Adams, Bakker, Marsac,
Fein, & Winston, 2015; Kassam-Adams, Marsac,
2013; Zatzick &
Hildenbrand, & Winston,
Grossman, 2011; Zatzick et al., 2006). Children’s
untreated PTSD and depression are major risk factors
for deficits in other domains, including physical recov-
ery, social functioning, and quality of life (Bryant
et al., 2010; Fakhry et al., 2017; Zatzick et al., 2007).
Assessment and treatment of these difficulties are par-
ticularly important among PTI patients given their po-
impacts on social, cognitive, and emotional
tential
development and academic functioning.

Caregivers are a key source of support for children
following PTI, and caregivers’ own emotional health is
strongly correlated with children’s outcomes (Brown,
De Young, Kimble, & Kenardy, 2018; Hall et al., 2006;
Young et al., 2003). Significant depressive and/or PTSD
symptoms have been found in 20–40% of caregivers of
children with traumatic injuries, with caregiver symp-
toms being inversely related to children’s emotional re-
covery (Kassam-Adams et al., 2015; Meiser-Stedman,
Yule, Dalgleish, Smith, & Glucksman, 2006; Nugent,
Ostrowski, Christopher, & Delahanty, 2007). Highly
distressed caregivers may demonstrate avoidance behav-
iors (e.g., avoid talking to their children about the event
and avoid trauma reminders) and/or reinforce children’s
maladaptive
following pediatric
trauma and potentially maintain children’s trauma-
related symptoms (Kichline, Kassam-Adams, Weiss,
Herbers, & Marsac, 2017). Thus, it is increasingly im-
portant to identify and treat mental health difficulties
not only among PTI patients but also among their
caregivers.

coping strategies

Most U.S. trauma centers do not address patients’
mental health needs after traumatic injury (Fakhry
et al., 2017; Love & Zatzick, 2014), and even fewer
trauma centers adequately monitor and address the
mental health needs of PTI patients and their care-
givers. Access to and quality of trauma care nation-
wide has improved over the years. However, most of
this progress has occurred in trauma centers during
the acute recovery phase, with reduced mortality rates
in trauma centers compared to non-trauma centers
(Celso et al., 2006; MacKenzie et al., 2006; Pracht
et al., 2008). Still, much of the focus of trauma centers
is on patients’ physical recovery, with little effort dedi-
cated to mental health recovery despite calls to imple-
ment a trauma-informed approach in pediatric
healthcare networks (Marsac et al., 2016). Better
follow-up care is imperative for PTI patients, and has
potential to save billions of dollars each year in medi-
cal expenses and lost productivity and vastly improve
functioning (Graves, Rivara, & Vavilala,
overall
2015; Zonfrillo, Spicer, Lawrence, & Miller, 2018).

In an attempt to meet this need, in September 2015
we developed and implemented the Trauma Resilience
and Recovery Program (TRRP) in a Level I trauma
center and state-verified pediatric trauma center in the
southeastern U.S. to address mental health recovery
for traumatic injury patients using a stepped model of
care. Stepped models of care have the advantage of be-
ing cost-efficient because delivery of each step of care
is determined by need. TRRP is rooted in cognitive be-
havioral principles based on evidence that injured
trauma survivors may respond to cognitive behavioral
therapy (CBT) with early, secondary prevention strate-
gies demonstrating value for this population (Roberts,
deRoon-Cassini, & Brasel, 2010; Rothbaum et al.,
2012; Rothbaum et al., 2014; Zatzick et al., 2013;
Zatzick et al., 2004). The purpose of this article is to
introduce this stepped care service model and describe
the engagement and short-term recovery trajectories
of PTI patients enrolled in TRRP clinical services dur-
ing the first 2 years of the program.

Description of TRRP Service
Step 1: Patient Recruitment, In-Hospital Education,
and TRRP Enrollment
A customized electronic medical record report is gener-
ated daily from the trauma registry of a Level I trauma
center in the southeastern U.S. that identifies patients
who have been admitted following traumatic injury.
The trauma center admits over 2,500 trauma patients
annually and initiated 1,640 trauma annual activations
in recent years. Hospitalized patients are approached
by TRRP staff when they are medically stable, alert,
and oriented. Average length of hospital stay is approx-
imately 2–4 days. Inclusion criteria were children ages
0–17 who were admitted to the trauma center due to
traumatic injury. Exclusion criteria included (a) hospi-
tal admission due to self-inflicted injuries, (b) injuries
resulting from child maltreatment (due to other services
already in place for such patients), and (c) patients
whose medical difficulties preclude them from partici-
pation (e.g., communication or cognitive deficits) as
reported by the medical trauma team in the electronic
medical record. Certified medical interpreters were uti-
lized to assist in communicating with non-English
speaking

Once approached, patients and their caregivers are pro-
vided brief ((cid:2)10 min) verbal education related to child

Ridings et al.

Contact information is also gathered from interested
patients and/or caregivers for a 30-day follow-up men-
tal health screening. A 30-day time period is used to al-
low for patients’ natural psychological recovery and to
allow them to monitor their symptoms to determine if
intervention is indeed necessary after 30 days. Baseline
information is gathered from patients regarding care-
giver and child peritraumatic stress symptoms, as ele-
vated peritraumatic distress is associated with increased
risk for PTSD and related psychological difficulties
(Gorman, Engel-Rebitzer, Ledoux, Bovin, & Marx,
2014).

Step 2: Tracking Emotional Recovery
“Watchful waiting” (i.e., symptom self-monitoring) is
an evidence-based approach to monitoring emotional
recovery following a stressor, and is recommended as
a frontline intervention during the first 30 days follow-
ing a traumatic event [e.g., National Collaborating
Centre for Mental Health (UK), 2005; Post & Van
Stone, 2008]. Watchful waiting provides patients with
better insight into their mental health symptoms, may
improve engagement in mental health follow-up, and
also allows providers to track day-to-day symptom
changes (Bakker, Kazantzis, Rickwood, & Rickard,
2016; Bunnell et al., 2019). The second step of our
this approach
TRRP intervention model utilizes
through a text message service, which was initiated
roughly halfway through our evaluation period (i.e., it
was offered to 65 of 154 patients) as a result of an on-
going quality improvement initiative after TRRP be-
gan. Patients seen in hospital are given the option to
enroll in the text message service. Enrolled patients or
caregivers receive one text daily for 30 days asking
them to track their or their child’s symptoms. Each
text consists of 1 item drawn from a set of 10 items (6
of which were modeled after the Kessler-6; Kessler
et al., 2010) that is sent on a rotating schedule, with
questions addressing psychological distress, avoid-
ance, intrusive thoughts, worry, and sleep difficulties.

Step 3: 30-Day Brief Mental Health Phone Screen
Approximately 30 days post-injury, patients (ages 6–
17) and caregivers (all child ages) are contacted for a
brief telephone screening ((cid:2)30 min) by trained bache-
lor’s and master’s level staff. Once patients are briefly
re-oriented to TRRP via telephone, they are adminis-
tered psychometrically validated measures assessing
symptoms of child PTSD and depression (children
ages 6–17 only) and caregiver distress (described be-
low). For children below the age of 6, only caregivers
complete a distress screen. Patients who screen posi-
tive for PTSD or depression advance to Step 4 of the
intervention. Patients or caregivers who endorse symp-
toms of PTSD or depressive symptoms but do not
screen positive for probable PTSD or depression are

offered brief coping strategies (e.g., breathing skills,
brief behavioral parent training, and emotion expres-
sion) over the phone to maintain emotional recovery.
They are encouraged to contact the clinic if future
services are needed.

Step 4: Comprehensive Diagnostic Assessment and
Delivery of Best Practice Treatment
TRRP clinic staff offers direct services or referrals for
mental health assessment and treatment to patients
who screen positive for PTSD or depression at Step 3.
Some families receive outside care, others receive face-
to-face services through our program, and still others
receive home-based telemental health services. TRRP
clinicians are licensed mental health professionals (i.e.,
licensed professional counselors) or are master’s level
and predoctoral clinical psychology interns supervised
by a licensed clinical psychologist. When families re-
ceive formal mental health treatment at Step 4 that is
delivered by TRRP clinicians, the most common best-
practice interventions delivered to them include
trauma-focused CBT (Cohen & Mannarino, 2008;
Cohen, Mannarino, & Deblinger, 2012) for children
and prolonged exposure (Foa, Chrestman, & Gilboa-
Schechtman, 2008; Powers, et al., 2010), cognitive
processing therapy (Resick, Monson, & Chard, 2007;
Resick & Schnicke, 1993), and brief behavioral acti-
vation treatment for depression (Lejuez et al., 2011)
for caregivers if needed. The initial assessment and
treatment sessions range from 60 to 90 min depending
on the treatment, and the length of treatment varies
depending on the presenting problems, but typically
lasts about 8–12 weeks. Treatment delivered by TRRP
clinicians is delivered in-person or via telehealth
depending on patient preference. Referrals are pro-
vided to established mental health service organiza-
tions within patients’ communities for many families.
These referrals may occur for a variety of reasons
(e.g., geographic proximity for families that prefer
face-to-face services, long wait-list, family lives out of
state, families are experiencing difficulties such as sub-
stance abuse and serious mental illness).

Each step of this clinical service is offered to all
trauma-activated patients (excluding those who did
not meet our inclusion criteria) who have been admit-
ted to our Level I trauma center following PTI. The
remaining sections describe our methodology, enroll-
ment and treatment procedures, and the engagement
and short-term recovery trajectories of PTI patients
enrolled in the TRRP program.

caregivers enrolled in TRRP over the first 2 years of
state-verified pediatric
clinical operations at our
trauma center. In consultation with CTSA and IRB, it
was concluded that this project was not considered
“research” and therefore not under the purview of the
IRB, because the goal was to improve our ability to
identify and address the mental health needs of high-
risk pediatric patients who were previously not receiv-
ing any screening or treatment. As such, patient
outcomes beyond the 30-day screen were not systemat-
ically tracked, and adverse events were not systemati-
cally tracked; however, to date no adverse events have
been reported to the TRRP team. Chi-square tests of
independence were conducted to examine associations
between group membership (e.g., treatment acceptors
and refusers) and categorical variables (e.g., race, eth-
nicity, and age) and independent mean T-tests were
used to examine group differences on continuous vari-
ables (e.g., PTSD severity). Due to the nature of the de-
scriptive analyses and examination of engagement, for
the majority of the descriptive analyses only cases with
complete data were included. For the remainder of the
analyses, listwise deletion was used for missing data.
All analyses were conducted using SPSS 24.0.

Procedures
Step 1: In-Hospital Education and TRRP Enrollment
TRRP staff members attempted to approach all admit-
ted patients identified through the trauma registry.
However, a number of patients were discharged be-
fore staff could visit them. When this occurred, letters
were mailed to these patients to orient them to our
services and inform them that they would be contacted
in approximately 30 days via phone to assess their

reached in-hospital and multiple caregivers were avail-
able, families were asked to identify the primary care-
giver to complete the questionnaires and enroll
in
follow-up services through TRRP, if interested.

Measures. The Peritraumatic Distress Inventory,
Caregiver and Child Versions (PDI; Brunet et al.,
2001; Guardia et al., 2013), were used to assess dis-
tress among caregivers of traumatically injured chil-
dren, as well as child distress levels for children aged
6–17 years. This 13-item scale has a cutoff score of 14
(Guardia et al., 2013) used to identify clinically signifi-
cant distress following traumatic injury. Past research
suggests that the PDI-Caregiver and Child versions
have adequate internal consistency and predictive va-
lidity (Bui et al., 2011). Cronbach’s alpha in the cur-
rent patient population was 0.73 and 0.80 for the
caregiver and child versions, respectively.

Step 2: Tracking Emotional Recovery
Families offered the text messaging service included
some caregivers of younger children (<12 years)

reporting on their child’s symptomatology. TRRP staff
used clinical judgment (e.g., developmental level, care-
giver distress, etc.) and discussed with TRRP staff to
obtain consensus when determining whether to offer
this service to families of young children. For adoles-
cents ages 12–17, youth reported on their own symp-
toms if they had their own phone, or the caregiver
could enroll on their behalf if they did not have their
own phone. Patients who enrolled received one text
per day over a period of 30 days and each message
asked patients to rate the extent to which the child
had experienced a particular symptom or behavior
during the previous week. A total of 10 questions (see
Supplementary Appendix) were administered sequen-
tially over three, repeating 10-day blocks such that
each question was administered once per 10-day block
for a total of three administrations.

Measures. A total of 10 questions were adminis-
tered via the text message system on a rotating basis
over a 30-day period which included six questions
from the Kessler-6 (K-6; Kessler et al., 2002) that as-
sess feelings of nervousness, hopelessness, restlessness/
fidgetiness, depression, worthlessness, and perceived
effort burden. Four additional questions were devel-
oped for the service to assess worrying, avoidance, dis-
tress relating to reminders of their traumatic injury,
and sleep quality. Each question asked patients to in-
dicate how much of the time the child experienced the
emotion/behavior during the past week by responding
via a 5-point Likert scale (1 ¼ All to 5 ¼ None).

Steps 3 and 4: 30-Day Brief Mental Health Phone
Screen and Comprehensive Diagnostic Assessment
and Delivery of Best Practice Treatment
Patients were called approximately 30 days post-
injury. Three attempts were made to reach the patients
and caregivers via phone, and voice messages were left
for those who could not be reached. If there was diffi-
culty reaching patients after three attempts, a letter
was sent requesting a phone call. All families, regard-
less of child age, were called at 30 days and caregivers
were screened. However, only children ages six and
older received PTSD and depression screens, as these
measures are not validated for younger children.
Whereas most of these assessment and treatment refer-
rals were for the children who sustained the traumatic
injury, a number of these referrals were also for care-
givers to help with issues such as parenting following
pediatric injury and/or their own distress related to
their child’s injury. Children and/or caregivers who
screened positive for depression and/or PTSD were of-
fered a referral to complete a comprehensive diagnos-
tic assessment with a TRRP clinician or were offered a
treatment referral to a local community mental health
center based on patient preference, presenting needs,
and other factors.

Measures. The Child PTSD Symptom Scale, Child
and Caregiver Versions (CPSS; Foa, Johnson, Feeny, &
Treadwell, 2001), includes 26 items assessing PTSD di-
agnostic criteria and severity in youth ages 6–17.
Generally, a clinical cutoff of 15 is used to indicate
probable PTSD in children and adolescents. The CPSS-
Child and Caregiver forms have both demonstrated
strong psychometric properties and adequate reliability
in previous work (Hawkins & Radcliffe, 2006). The
Cronbach’s alphas were 0.91 and 0.92 for the child and
caregiver versions,

Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale for Children
(CESD; Faulstich, Carey, Ruggiero, Enyart, &
Gresham, 1986) is a 20-item measure assessing depres-
sion in children ages 6–17. A cutoff score of 15 suggests
clinically significant depressive symptoms in youth. The
CESD has been found to have good test–retest reliabil-
ity,
internal consistency, and concurrent validity
(Faulstich et al., 1986). The CESD demonstrated ade-
quate internal consistency (Cronbach’s a ¼ 0.79). The

2003) measure of psychological distress (e.g., “How
much of the time today did you feel hopeless?”) that is
given to caregivers to assess their own distress levels at
30 days. Scores of above 13 indicate severe psychologi-
cal distress, scores between 8 and 12 indicate moderate
distress, and scores under 7 represent low psychological
distress (Furukawa et al., 2003; Kessler et al., 2002;
2003). The K6 demonstrated adequate internal consis-
tency (Cronbach’s a ¼ 0.86).

Child Demographics
Since the launch of this program in September 2015,
301 pediatric patients were eligible for TRRP enroll-
ment at the time of hospitalization. One-hundred and
eighty patients (59.8%) were boys, and the average
age was 9.12 years [standard deviation (SD) ¼ 5.42].
Patients’
composition was 44.8% Black
(n ¼ 135), 41.8% White (n ¼ 126), 10.0% biracial or
“other” (n ¼ 30), 1.7% Pacific Islander (n ¼ 5), 1.3%
Asian (n ¼ 4), and 0.3% American Indian/Alaska
Native (n ¼ 1). The majority of patients (92.0%;
n ¼ 277) described their ethnicity as “non-Hispanic.”
Most injuries were sustained from motor vehicle acci-
dents (45.8%; n ¼ 139), falls (10.3%; n ¼ 31), pedes-
trians struck by automobiles (8.3%; n ¼ 25) and
gunshot or stab wounds (8.6%; n ¼ 26). See Table I
for patient and caregiver characteristics. See Figure 1
for patient flow through each step.

Step 1: In-Hospital Education and TRRP Enrollment
The total number of trauma activation patients identi-
fied under the age of 18 was 315, 301 of whom were

eligible to be approached in the hospital between
September 2015 and June 2017. The 14 ineligible
patients included children who had severe brain dam-
age as a result of their injuries or suspected child abuse
patients, and would, therefore, be unable to complete
the stepped-care program. Overall, 271 pediatric
patients were enrolled in TRRP (90.0% of eligible
patients). We approached 154 (51.2%) pediatric in-
jury patients while in the hospital, 147 (95.5%) of
whom agreed to enroll in TRRP services. An addi-
tional 147 eligible patients were discharged before we
could approach them in the hospital due to limited
staffing (i.e., 8 a.m.–5 p.m., Monday–Friday). Most of
these patients (n ¼ 124) were sent a letter to orient and
enroll them in our services unless the patient decided
to opt out of services. We did not institute the dis-
charge letter practice until after the first 23 patients
were discharged before contact.

At the time of hospitalization, primary caregivers’
average level of distress was 20.47 (median ¼ 20.00,
SD ¼ 9.51) and children’s average level of distress was
22.80 (median ¼ 22.00, SD ¼ 10.79). Of the 55 care-
givers who completed the PDI, 68.5% (n ¼ 38)
reported clinically significant distress (i.e., PDI > 14).
Additionally, 78.3% (n ¼ 36) children who completed
the PDI

Step 2: Tracking Emotional Recovery
The 30-day text-messaging service was offered to 65
families enrolled after June 2016 when the text-
messaging service was initiated. Eighty-two families
were seen prior to the initiation of this service, and,
therefore, were not offered the service. Of the 65 fami-
lies offered the service, 40 families enrolled (61.5%).
Reasons for declining the service included loss or dam-
age to the phone during the injury-related incident,
lack of a phone with text message capabilities, and
lack of interest in the service. There were no statisti-
cally significant difference between those who ac-
cepted the text-messaging service and those who did
not on either
peritraumatic distress
[t(29) ¼ 0.38, p ¼ .71] or child peritraumatic distress
during the in-hospital visit
[t(23) ¼ 0.41, p ¼ .69].
There were also no significant differences between
those who agreed to the service and those who did not
on race [v2(10, 299) ¼ 10.77, p ¼ .38], ethnicity [v2 (4,
300) ¼ 1.93, p ¼ .75], sex [v2 (2, 300) ¼ 1.10, p ¼ .59],
age [t(59) ¼ 1.59, p ¼ .12], or trauma type [v2 (20,
301) ¼ 13.90, p ¼ .84]. Among the families who en-
rolled in the service, 5 (12.5%) did not receive the ser-
vice due to technical difficulties; 57% of the families
that received the messages responded, whereas 43%
did not. More than one-fourth (28.6%) responded to
at least half of the messages. The average number of
responses was 12.84 (SD ¼ 12.07).

Step 3: 30-Day Brief Mental Health Phone Screen
Among 147 pediatric patients reached in hospital, 59
(40.1%) were re-engaged 30 days. Among the 124 pe-
diatric patients who were discharged before we could
approach them, but were sent discharge letters
(n ¼ 124), 34 (27.4%) engaged 30 days post-injury.
There were no statistically significant differences in
caregiver distress during Step 1 between screen com-
pleters and non-completers [t(44) ¼ 1.07, p ¼ .29].
Similarly, there was no significant difference in child
peritraumatic distress between those who completed
[t(37) ¼ 0.65,
the screen and those who did not
p ¼ .52]. There were also no significant differences be-
tween race [v2 (5, 257) ¼ 1.68, p ¼ .89], ethnicity [v2
(2, 257) ¼ 2.12, p ¼ .35], sex [v2 (2, 257) ¼ 1.03,
p ¼ .31], age [t(256) ¼ 1.91, p ¼ .06], and engagement

in the 30-day screen. There was, however, a significant
association between trauma type and 30-day engage-
ment [v2 (10, 258) ¼ 18.92, p ¼ .04], suggesting that
trauma type interacts with engagement at 30 days. It
appears upon a retroactive examination of the cells
that gunshot victims were less likely to be re-engaged
at follow-up. Additionally, of the 40 families who en-
rolled in the text-message program, 20 (50.0%) were
re-engaged for the 30-day screen, whereas 4 of the 15
(26.7%) families who did not enroll
in the text-
messaging service were re-engaged at 30 days. There
was a significant interaction between agreeing to the
text-message service and 30-day call completion [v2
(1, 65) ¼ 10.37, p ¼ .001].

Of those screened at 30 days (n ¼ 93), 33 (35.5%)
children exceeded clinical thresholds for depression

Discussion

The purpose of this article was to present findings
from PTI patients enrolled during the first 2 years in
the TRRP, an innovative, interdisciplinary program
targeting identification, screening, symptom tracking,
follow-up assessment, and referral for evidence-based
mental health services for traumatic injury patients
hospitalized at a Level 1 Trauma Center. Overall,
results suggested that implementation of this program
is feasible, and that TRRP has increased reach to fami-
lies who previously were not receiving trauma center
mental health services. To date, we have provided psy-
choeducation to and enrolled over 95% of the PTI
patients approached in the hospital. Although not all
PTI patients were approached about the text messag-
ing self-monitoring service due to age, of
those
approached, over 60% engaged in the service. We
reached about 40% of patients at the 30-day phone
screen, 35.5% of whom demonstrated positive screens
for depression and/or PTSD, thereby emphasizing the
unmet emotional health needs of this population. The
majority of patients (75.8%) with clinically significant
emotional health difficulties agreed to treatment refer-
rals, with nearly half reporting a preference for
telehealth-based options.

Despite persistent efforts to contact and re-engage
families at 30 days, we were unable to reach over half
of families who enrolled in TRRP at the hospital.
While this is consistent with previous literature dem-
onstrating difficulties engaging families in follow-up
services (Dishion & Patterson, 1996; Gopalan et al.
2010; Mckay et al., 1998; Shaw et al., 2006), this also
suggests that efforts should be directed at increasing
engagement with this population. This is particularly
true given the high rates of positive depression and/or
PTSD screens among PTI patients (35.5%), as well as

Trauma Resilience and Recovery Program

the elevated levels of distress among caregivers both in
hospital (68.5% reached clinical significance) and at the
30-day telephone follow-up (33.7% reached clinical sig-
nificance). In response to these attenuated engagement
rates, our team is currently in the process of integrating
a brief, tailored, in-hospital risk reduction session for
children and caregivers reporting higher peritraumatic
distress symptoms to prevent secondary trauma symp-
tom development and to promote service engagement.

such as

Brief interventions targeted to patients and care-
givers who endorsed symptomatology, including psy-
choeducation, the introduction of coping strategies
(e.g., relaxation), and brief exposure, may not only
promote engagement in follow-up but also reduce dis-
tress and promote natural recovery. Early intervention
approaches,
the Multi-tier Approach to
Psychological
Intervention after Traumatic injury
(Hunt, Chesney, Brasel, & deRoon-Cassini, 2018),
can be adapted for PTI populations and have great po-
tential to strengthen engagement and follow-up for
families at higher risk for symptom development. Our
team is working to adapt this model for our PTI popu-
lation and to examine its feasibility, acceptability, and
impact on engagement and outcomes.

These relatively high rates of mental health symptoms
and distress levels among children and their caregivers
also highlight the importance of implementing routine
screening and referrals in pediatric trauma centers na-
tionally. Across Level I and Level II trauma centers in
the U.S., less than 50% of all patients are screened for
suicidality, 25% for depression, and 7% for PTSD
symptoms (Love & Zatzick, 2014). Failure to screen
traumatic injury patients for mental health difficulties
leaves up to 90% of those with post-injury PTSD or de-
pression without adequate care to address these and re-
lated needs (Fakhry et al., 2017). Evidence-based,
stepped-care emotional health services are needed in
trauma centers to evaluate and support emotional diffi-
culties among PTI patients. These approaches are cost
efficient because multiple levels of intervention are deliv-
ered only to patients with unmet needs.

Furthermore, in addition to traditional barriers (e.g.,
stigma, cost, time commitments, and transportation),
families affected by PTI experience unique challenges
such as numerous competing time demands (e.g., medi-
cal appointments, physical recovery, and academic chal-
lenges) as well as mobility difficulties post-injury
(Branas, 2005; Chandra et al., 2008; Fakhry et al.,
2017; Wiseman, Foster, & Curtis, 2013). Home-based
telehealth services have the potential to address many of
these barriers (Acierno et al., 2017). TRRP attempts to
reduce barriers to care for families who need it most by
offering direct clinical services via telehealth modalities.
This is particularly true for various racial and cultural
groups who often face significant barriers to receiving
mental health care (Priester et al., 2016). With over half

of our current sample reporting African American or bi-
racial race, it is critical to ensure that trauma-focused
interventions like TRRP are designed to increase reach
and promote engagement among different racial and
cultural groups. Technology-enhanced mental health
resources have great potential to mitigate these barriers
and reduce access disparities through various platforms
such as telemental health, technology-mediated self-
help,
symptom tracking, and mobile applications
(Ralston, Andrews, & Hope, 2019). TRRP leverages
technology at multiple steps to increase ease of access to
services which may reduce health disparities.

Successful implementation of a stepped-care mental
health service embedded within trauma centers requires
coordinated services provided by interprofessional
teams to comprehensively address patients’ needs. In
our own work, partnerships between pediatric trauma
surgery, mental health, and nursing have been essential
for facilitating access to patients and successful pro-
gram implementation. This may require ongoing educa-
tion for nurses, residents, and surgeons about common
emotional and behavioral health difficulties among PTI
patients and their caregivers, in addition to the impor-
tance of routine screening and service referral for those
who need it. This education should also include the im-
portance of trauma-informed care (TIC) for this popu-
lation to build provider competence in delivering TIC
and enhancing provider knowledge regarding the po-
tential impacts of trauma on patients, families, and staff
(Bruce et al., 2018; Substance Abuse and Mental
Health Services Administration, 2015). It is also impor-
tant to provide assessments and referrals for caregivers
of PTI patients given the potential negative impacts of
caregiver distress on child emotional health recovery
(Brown et al., 2018; Hall et al., 2006; Young et al.,
2003). Ongoing education regarding impacts of care-
giver distress on child outcomes should be embedded in
interprofessional team trainings to emphasize care-
givers’ important roles in traumatically injured child-
ren’s overall recovery.

Limitations
The TRRP service model provides screening and fol-
low-up care for patients who previously did not re-
ceive any mental health services (Fakhry et al., 2017).
As a novel clinical service, the model has evolved
somewhat since the initiation of the program because
we have made continuous efforts to better meet pa-
tient needs. This approach differs from a more proto-
colized, systematic evaluation of an intervention in a
research study. The information presented in this man-
uscript is therefore limited by these changes and incon-
sistencies overtime,
including initiation of TRRP
components (e.g., discharge letters and SMS program)
months after initial implementation, lack of data on

iterations,

resulting in patients not being contacted for follow-
up. However, these program changes may present op-
portunities to compare engagement outcomes across
major
resulting in significant
improvements to the program. An additional limita-
tion is that we do not include data on patient satisfac-
tion or cost-effectiveness. However, as an evolving
clinical service designed to improve patient care and
program scalability, our team is beginning to track
these variables to better meet patients’ needs.

Future Directions
TRRP uses a stepped-care intervention model to meet
patients’ needs in a cost-efficient way, guided by the
evidence base and best practices in trauma care. As a
result of our successful implementation of this pro-
gram in our trauma center, we have partnered with
three additional Level I/II trauma centers in the state
to implement TRRP directly in their trauma centers.
We have completed qualitative interviews with key
stakeholders (e.g., trauma medical directors, program
managers, social workers, and patients) to assess best
strategies for implementing TRRP at each center.

We have identified a set of priorities designed to
better serve our PTI population as we disseminate and
implement TRRP in additional trauma centers. One
major priority is the need to tailor each step of our
clinical service to meet the needs of specific popula-
tions, such as rural families with reduced service ac-
cess, gunshot victims who may require unique
approaches to education and service engagement and
treatment, and traumatically injured children under
age 12 and their families, for whom most intervention
elements may need to be caregiver-driven. We have
taken initial steps to address the needs of pre-
adolescent children by conducting semi-structured
qualitative interviews with caregivers to inform plans
to develop a scalable, technology-enhanced resource
for caregivers of young PTI patients to better meet
their needs in a way that is cost effective and accept-
able to other pediatric trauma centers. We will con-
tinue focusing efforts on decreasing barriers and
strengthening facilitators to TRRP implementation to
bring this service to scale across the trauma system
and increase awareness of its potential to provide im-
proved follow-up care for families impacted by PTI.
