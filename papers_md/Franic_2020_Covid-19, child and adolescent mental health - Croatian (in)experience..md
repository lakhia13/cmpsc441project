The Covid-19 pandemic has caused unseen socio-economic changes all over the world, where enormous efforts are being made to
preserve lives and maintain functional health systems. A secondary concern is to mitigate the severe economic consequences of the
crisis. Different approaches have been adopted with varying outcomes and experiences. But regardless of the different approaches
taken, one thing is common for all societies during this pandemic: fear and anxiety. This fear extends from concerns about the
present situation, for the health and well-being of family members and loved ones from Covid-19 infection, to fears relating to
how long the crisis will last, to the potential economic consequences of the pandemic (perhaps not seen in our lifetimes) and
the ultimate fear of future uncertainty. Across the world, health systems are being faced with unprecedented challenges. At their
core, these challenges are the same: how to beat Covid-19. Certainly, there are differences in how individual systems are organized
and how they address the main issues arising from the pandemic while not forgetting the ongoing healthcare needs of the general
population. In this paper, we share some perspectives from Croatia regarding Child and Adolescent Mental Health services
(CAMHs) in these extraordinary circumstances. We give our personal insights on deficiencies in Child and Adolescent Mental
Health Services prior to the arrival of Covid-19, which have contributed to difficulties in mitigating and managing the ongoing
crisis.

Key words: Child and adolescent mental health, corona, Covid-19, Croatia.

The first case of Covid-19 in Croatia was confirmed on
25 February 2020. Epidemiologically, it was traced to
Milan, and to the Atalanta vs Valencia Champions
League football match. This was later proclaimed to
be a ‘biological bomb’ which brought infection to
Bergamo, probably the worst affected city in the world.
A subsequent cluster was also traced to Italy. At the
time of writing this paper, Covid-19 infection has
spread across all counties in Croatia with a total of
1832 cases, 39 deaths and 615 recovered patients. The
mean age of all those infected is 50, and the majority
of deaths were cases with comorbidities in older age.
The youngest victim was 55 and the youngest infected
person is a 4-month-old baby. These numbers, in the
context of the time period and overall population, are
very good. Croatia has had 446 cases and 9 deaths
per million, placing it in fourth place (with Poland) in
the EU, behind Slovakia, Latvia and Bulgaria. The epi-
demiological curve was sharp (20–30% daily rise) for a
period of 4–5 days only and is now almost flat with sev-
eral days of reductions in the number of new cases. Up
to now a maximum of 39 ventilators (of the total of 800
available) were required daily (Worldometer, 2020).

The pandemic has caused unseen socio-economic
changes in Croatia. Having witnessed the outbreak in
Italy, Croatia had time to introduce counter measures.
These counter measures were stepwise from the quar-
antining of passengers from high-risk regions to full
lockdown. All of this happened in less than 3 weeks.
The speed of the response may indeed be a legacy of
our history since the quarantine is a Croatian invention.
Throughout its history, Dubrovnik was ravaged by
numerous diseases, with leprosy and plague posing
the largest threats to public health. In Venice, all ships
arriving from infected ports were required to sit at
anchor for 40 days (quaranta giorni) before landing, a
practice that eventually became known as quarantine
(derived from ‘quarantino’, the Italian word for a
40-day period). Unlike Venice, Dubrovnik chose a differ-
ent approach, being the first Mediterranean port to
sequester people, animals and merchandise coming
from infected areas by sea or land, keeping them sepa-
rate from the healthy population, while Venice stopped
all ships and trade, halting life in the city. In 1377,
Dubrovnik issued a decree according to which ‘risky’
people and goods needed to spend 40 days at one
of the nearby islands before entering the city. It was
the first such decision in the world and quarantine is
now widely considered a Dubrovnik invention (Henry,
2013). Furthermore, Andrija Stampar, the ‘father of

2

public health and prevention’ and founder of the World
Health Organisation (WHO), came from Croatia: ‘All
our efforts will fail until everybody enjoys the benefits
of hygienic culture’ (Brown, 2006).

Currently in Croatia all citizens who are not classi-
fied as essential workers are required to remain at
home. They are not legally forbidden to go out, but it
is strongly recommended not to do so. All public events
and gatherings of more than five persons are prohibited
and museums, theatres, cinemas, libraries and reading
rooms are closed. Exhibitions, shows and fairs, con-
certs, weddings and religious ceremonies are sus-
pended. Most retail outlets are closed except for those
selling food and hygiene items, pharmacies, gas sta-
tions, baby equipment and pet food. Play-grounds
and public squares are closed and are under police or
civil protection task-force supervision to prevent gath-
ering and to supervise physical distancing. Travelling
between municipalities is allowed only under specific
circumstances and with appropriate e-passes. The
crossing of all borders is prohibited or restricted for
all Croatian citizens. Only emergency and front-line
essential services are allowed to work onsite and face
to face. Everything else has either been suspended or
transferred to working from home. Even schools are
online with additional backup on several national
TV channels and all materials made available on
YouTube. This has resulted in increased self-isolation
and the cutting off of the majority of face to face contact.
It is also recommended not to visit older relatives unless
for the purpose of delivering food and other necessary
supplies.

Other countries took different approaches resulting
in different outcomes and experiences, but regardless of
the measures taken, one thing is common for all nations:
fear and anxiety. People have many fears relating to the
present situation: they fear for the health and well-being
of family and loved ones regarding covid-19 infection;
they fear the length of time the pandemic will last; they
fear the economic fallout from the crisis (perhaps unlike
anything seen in our lifetimes) and they fear the uncer-
tainty of the future. All these factors are related to the
mental well-being of the population, mental health care
and mental health outcomes.

In addition to the numerous changes outlined above,
health professionals are faced with unprecedented chal-
lenges. These challenges, although manifold, boil down
to the same thing: how to beat Covid-19 (virology, epi-
demiology, infectiology, ICU staff and many others).
The differences are found in how systems are organized
and in how they address the main issue while, at the
same time, maintaining the healthcare needs of the gen-
eral population. Mental health care and Child and
Adolescent Mental Health (CAMH) are fundamental,
not only because of ongoing care needs, but also due

to the probable psychological consequences of the
pandemic. It is unquestionable that such sudden and
unprecedented change will have some impact on the
future psychological status of individuals and of society
as a whole. Of course, it is impossible to predict the
nature of such change. Unfortunately, it is anticipated
that this will be a traumatic process. Needless to say,
Croatia has some experience of trauma. It is not that
long since it was engaged in a war which had a deep
impact not only on those soldiers directly exposed to
the fighting, but also on their offspring in the form of
transgenerational transfer (Frani´c et al. 2012). This
might direct CAMH professionals not only toward
the mental health needs of children and adolescents,
but also of parents caused by the Covid-19 crisis to
address possible mental health issues.

The organization and training of CAMH services in
Croatia are detailed elsewhere (Signorini et al. 2017;
Russet et al. 2019). In short, they are insufficient for
the approximately 900,000 children and adolescents
up to age of 19 in Croatia. Care is free of charge as it
is for adult mental health patients. The overall health
system in Croatia is publicly funded and free of charge
for all, based on fixed contributions from the salaries of
all employees. Only a small number of private health
facilities exist, mainly in highly profitable services such
as plastic surgery, ophthalmology and dental medicine.
CAMH services are affiliated mainly with four univer-
sity hospitals, three of which have inpatient units. There
is one standalone Psychiatric Hospital for Children and
Youth in Zagreb (PHCY).

There are no community-based psychiatry outpa-
tient services. They are instead affiliated to five hospi-
tals and two additional CAMH outpatient centres. Of
course, there are some individual practices (public
and private) across the country, but again not enough.
According to the draft Strategic Plan of CAMH devel-
opment in Republic of Croatia 2019–2023, the target
number of CAMH psychiatrists is 120. According to
the same source, at present the total number of beds
in the whole country is 66 with an additional 100 places
in daily accommodation. The number of CAMH con-
sultants is 44 with 22 trainees. To put this into context,
the number of adult psychiatrists, adjusted according to
the number of citizens and prevalence of mental disor-
ders is 150–200, which is three to four times more than
in CAMHs.

In short, we faced the Covid-19 crisis with already
insufficient resources. To compound this situation,
many health facilities have been intentionally sacrificed
in the re-organization necessitated by the virus.
The Croatian approach is to have separate Covid-19
hospitals which has resulted in the reduction of all
elective so-called cold programmes. Both adult and
CAMHS psychiatric services are regarded as cold.

Furthermore, many wards were removed reducing
existing capacities. Since the capacity of adult psychia-
try is large enough, somehow, they compensate for this.
For CAMHs, it was a completely different story. The
services in the University Hospital in Split are com-
in
pletely shut down and the University Hospital
Osijek has lost half of its capacity to adult psychiatry.
This was complicated further by that we had a virus
outbreak in the biggest, standalone PHCY and patients
were discharged or removed to adult wards. If that
was not enough, the University Hospital in Zagreb was
lost due to an earthquake in the city on 22nd March,
the biggest since 1880. Thousands of buildings were
damaged, including numerous hospitals. In addition,
people left their homes for 2 days breaking physical
distance and isolation recommendations.

The catalogue of these events has been described as
our Pearl Harbour, but we as professionals have some-
how managed to regroup and jointly our CAMH soci-
eties wrote and published guidelines regarding CAMH
and Covid-19 on the website of European Child and
Adolescent Psychiatry (ECAP). This includes a range of
advice from practical guidelines on how to manage pos-
sible Covid-19 infected children, advice to affected
families to recommendations on how to manage with
anxiety and other possible consequences of the pan-
demic in the general population of children and adoles-
cents. Also, during this period, we had lot of media
exposure on the topic of mental health, and finally on
an individual level we managed to introduce new
methods not used before such as telepsychiatry and
videoconferencing. The response to such innovation
has been surprisingly good. As a service, we had little
availability (expect for emergencies) for several weeks.
People who were desperate in seeking help for their
children and adolescents were willing to accept help
on this basis. Of course, it was biased by the fact that
availability and contact were on a voluntary basis. It
is not clear according to Croatian law whether we are
allowed to discharge such proactive outreach, but since
extraordinary times deserve extraordinary measures
we are working on the edge of normal ethics consider-
ations and GDPR rules. As we did not previously have
such IT practices, we did not have consent for this
approach. We have put ourselves at some risk for the
sake of our patients who were completely lacking
any professional support. So far, feedback has been
positive and we have not been subject to litigation.
Things are slowly going back to normal or as close to
normal as possible.

In Croatia, CAMH professionals have been con-
fronted not only by significant obstacles caused by
the Covid-19 pandemic but also by the erratic and cata-
strophic organizational changes which have ensued.
These did not consider CAMH services in Croatia as

equal, despite the number of young and vulnerable
patients requiring ongoing services. We are now on
the journey of returning to the level of care as it previ-
ously was but with different means and in unusual
times. Fortunately, the initial impressions suggest that
the children are much more resilient and less anxious
about the changes than parents or professionals.

To conclude, this crisis has facilitated new forms of
professional help and treatment for which we were not
prepared, but we have been forced to improvise. Our
first impressions have shown that we, as well our
patients, have adapted positively to such novel clinical
techniques. Bearing in mind the pre-existing deficien-
cies in CAMHs and in the healthcare system overall,
such new techniques may indeed be helpful when the
crisis has passed. When that time comes, we expect to
see an increased number of children with psychological
consequences related to the Covid-19 crisis. We need to
prepare now to ensure that the best care and treatment
will be delivered at this time.
