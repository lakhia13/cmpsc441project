INTRODUCTION

B iomedical models of human health and disease

have been enhanced by decades of sustained
research into the social determinants of physical and
mental health, though social inﬂuences on health and

disease often receive less attention in healthcare prac-
tices. Over the 20th century, factors such as socio-eco-
nomic position,
sexual
race/ethnicity,
orientation, and others have populated the literature
with every increasing evidences of their importance
on health.1 Signiﬁcant disparities in mortality were
found for different occupations, as well as for

gender,

different education and income strata. Many com-
mentators noted that these inequities in health were
often avoidable, arising from the circumstances in
which people grow, live, work, and age, and the sys-
tems put in place to deal with illness. These circum-
stances, in turn, are shaped by political, social, and
economic forces.2

experiences

Toward the end of the century, the importance of
“social connections”, the quantity, quality, and bene-
ﬁts of human relationships, became a major focus of
the empirical research into the social determinants of
health. Within this extensive literature, social isolation
and loneliness (SI/L), representing both objective and
subjective
social disconnection,
of
emerged as two key constructs impacting human
health. SI/L are particularly relevant to the physical
and mental health and longevity of older adults
because circumstances of aging, such as relationship
losses, medical morbidities, and functional declines,
are predisposing factors. Furthermore, the impacts of
SI/L on the health and longevity of older adults are
substantial. For example, meta-analyses have found
that social isolation or loneliness in older adults is
associated with a 50% increased risk of developing
dementia,3 a 30% increased risk of incident coronary
artery disease or stroke,4,5 and a 26% increased risk of
all-cause mortality.6

In 2018 the AARP Foundation commissioned the
National Academies of Science, Engineering and
Medicine (NASEM)
to stand up a committee to
research and develop a report on SI/L in persons 50+
years of age.1 Emphasis was placed upon the role of
the healthcare system in addressing this fundamental
public health problem.

The committee released the report as the Corona
Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic was begin-
ning to spread to North America (https://www.nap.
edu/catalog/25663/social-isolation-and-loneliness-
in-older-adults-opportunities-for-the, accessed Febru-
ary 27, 2020). This pandemic focuses sharply on the
critical issues faced by older adults with SI/L as a
result of social distancing instructions to the general
public. Healthcare professionals soon recognized the
negative consequences of this isolation and the poten-
tial for increased loneliness across all age groups, but
especially among already isolated older adults.7,8

In this review of the NASEM report, the authors,
both members of the committee, assess central ﬁnd-
ings and conclusions from the report as well as how

these ﬁndings may be applied to older adults during
these unprecedented times. We begin our discussion
with a review of deﬁnitions and how they may be
appropriately categorized and measured to further
explore the relation between these social determi-
nants of health and their health outcomes. Next we
brieﬂy present the frequency and distribution of SI/L
and why SI/L places the elderly at special risk. We
follow with a discussion of risk and protective factors.
We provide an overview of current measures of SI/L
and emphasize the need to develop short assessment
tools which can be placed in the electronic health
record. Then we review the rapidly expanding litera-
ture documenting the adverse health consequences of
SI/L with special attention to all-cause mortality, car-
diovascular disease and stroke, minor and major neu-
rocognitive impairment (dementia), depression and
suicidal ideation and self-harm, anxiety, and quality
of life (QoL). Then we provide a short overview of the
emerging literature which informs us of potential
mechanisms whereby SI/L lead to adverse health
outcomes. The remainder of this review is devoted to
interventions in which health and mental health pro-
fessionals can be involved, often as the leading edge
of care.

DEFINITIONS

Social connection is an overarching term that
encompasses other commonly used terms describing
structural, functional, and quality aspects of human
relationships and interactions. Social isolation is the
objective lack or limited extent of social contacts with
others, for example, marital status, living alone or
with others. Loneliness is the perception of social iso-
lation or the subjective feeling of being lonely.1 The
committee recognized a clear distinction between SI/
L. Persons who are socially isolated may not be lonely
(those who are naturally “loners” for example). In
contrast, persons with many social connections may
feel lonely (lonely in a crowd−−a distinction dating
back 70 years).9 Social support is a frequently used
term in scientiﬁc studies over many years and refers
to the availability of resources, such as informational,
tangible, and emotional support from others in one’s
social network.10 In the NASEM report and in this
paper we focus upon SI/L.

Epidemiology

In a 2020 report from the National Health and
Aging Trends Study, prior to the COVID outbreak,
investigators found that 24% of community−dwelling
adults age 65 and older in the United States (approxi-
mately 7.7 million people) were socially isolated and
4% (1.3 million people) were severely socially iso-
lated.1,11. Using data from the nationally representa-
tive U.S. Health and Retirement study, Perissinotto
et al. found that 43 percent of Americans aged 60 and
older reported feeling lonely. Among this sample,
13% reported that
occurred
these
“often.”1,12 The AARP foundation undertook a sur-
vey and found that 35% of adults age 45+ in the
United States reported feeling lonely.1,13

symptoms

The sizable burden of SI/L among older Ameri-
cans should come as no surprise. Putman,
in his
widely distributed book, Bowling Alone in 2001,
described the decline in all forms of in person inter-
course and how this disrupts civil engagement across
age groups.14 Though loneliness appears to be most
prevalent among American adults under the age of
50,15 it is notable that older adults in the ninth and
10th decades of life also experience high rates of both
severe SI/L.11 Older adults are more susceptible to
adverse health consequences of loneliness and isola-
tion (due to generally poorer health).

Adults in later life who are socially isolated are
typically among the oldest old, unmarried, male,
have low educational attainment and low income.11
Social isolation, deﬁned as physical isolation, reduced
size and diversity of social network or less frequent
contact with family and friends, increases the risk of
loneliness.13 Individuals who identify as LGBTQ or
other groups in our society who tend to be marginal-
ized are also more likely to report that they are
lonely.13 Although prevalences vary across studies, in
part due to different methods of measurement, the
consistent ﬁnding is that both loneliness and social
isolation are pervasive and signiﬁcant problems
across all age groups.

Additional Risk Factors for SI/L

The committee recognized many risk factors for
SI/L yet from the beginning we emphasized that risk
can be bidirectional. For example, psychiatric condi-
tions such as depressive and anxiety disorders can

Donovan and Blazer

lead to social withdrawal and loneliness16−20, and
reciprocally, social isolation, and loneliness can also
lead to
and
anxiety.16,18

signiﬁcant depression

clinically

Cross-sectional and longitudinal studies provide
evidence for the reciprocal impacts of SI/L with anxi-
ety and depression disorders that may compound
over time.21 Cross-sectional studies have frequently
found associations of loneliness or lower measures of
relationship quality and support with high depres-
sion.21−23 Close relationships and social support may
be deﬁcient or experienced as inadequate in those
who are depressed because of the distress and disabil-
ities
imposed by their depressive state. Some
depressed older adults experience broad deﬁcits in
social connectedness, including high loneliness, low
social support, and fewer social connections.24,25
Other older adults with clinical depression or general-
ized anxiety report high levels of loneliness unrelated
to structural measures of social network or support.25
−27 In these cases, loneliness may reﬂect cognitive
biases that appraise social interactions more nega-
tively or perceive relationships as less rewarding.1
Personality traits such as low extraversion and high
neuroticism have been shown to increase the risk of
loneliness and moderate the risk of loneliness among
older adults with depression and anxiety.1,27−30 The
committee noted that while SI/L are frequently asso-
ciated with depression and anxiety, SI/L are vali-
dated constructs that are distinct from psychiatric
nosology and are also commonly experienced by
older adults without psychiatric disorders.

Other individual factors include living alone, inad-
equate family relations or support, caregiver burden,
disruptive life events (such as a move to a different
residence), bereavement (perhaps the most signiﬁcant
immediate cause of SL/L), illness and poor health
and functional disability (which limits a person’s abil-
ity to socialize), sensory deprivation (such as hearing
loss), and retirement.

Risk factors for SI/Lin older adults also include
cognitive deﬁcits and dementia.31,32 Societal factors,
such as availability of public transportation, may also
contribute to SI/L. North Americans are independent
by nature and have gravitated to the idea of aging in
place.33 Aging in place may be both a risk and protec-
tive factor for SI/L. A private home can provide a
sense of comfort and security yet also been a hazard if
functional disabilities disrupt usual household

routines. Residents in rural areas are more likely to
confront challenges seeking home-based services.
Older adults in long term care may also be isolated,
especially during a challenge such as COVID-19
which restricts access to family members.

Measurement

A variety of measurement scales have been devel-
oped to assess SI/L and related structural, functional,
and quality aspects of social connection.34 Most of
these scales are self-report questionnaires that have
been designed and implemented for research pur-
poses. The committee emphasized that researchers
and healthcare practitioners should rely on validated
measurement scales to assess SI/L. At the same,
improved methods and tools are needed to capture
newer modes of social interaction and communica-
tion and to leverage information technology and pre-
dictive analytics. Established measurement scales for
the assessment of SI/L and social support are summa-
rized below. Representative scales are shown in
Figure 1.

The Berkman-Syme Social Network Index is a
widely-used scale measuring level of social isolation
or integration based on four domains: marital status,
frequency of contact with other people, participation
in religious activities, and participation in other com-
munity groups. 35 This scale was recommended for
inclusion in electronic health records by an Institute
of Medicine committee in 2014, for the purpose of
identifying socially isolated older adults in healthcare
practices.36 In research studies and in clinical applica-
tions, a variety of scoring approaches have been used.
Building on the Berkman-Syme Social Network
Index, the Lubben Social Network Scale was devel-
oped for use in older adults and to focus in greater
detail on level of social
integration with family
and friends. Ten item and six item versions of this
scale have been published.37−39 Social isolation has
also been measured using the ﬁve item Steptoe
Social
Isolation Index, which queries marital/
cohabitation status, monthly contact (face to face,
telephone, and email/writing) with children, other
family or friends, and group participation. Individ-
uals scoring 0 on 2 or more items are identiﬁed as
socially isolated (Fig. 1).40

The Revised UCLA Loneliness Scale is a validated
20-item questionnaire that is a standard scale for mea-
suring perceived loneliness.41 An abbreviated version
of this questionnaire, the Three-Item UCLA Loneli-
ness Scale, is widely used in research studies and for
clinical identiﬁcation of lonely older adults (Fig. 1).42
The de Jong Gierveld Loneliness Scale is an 11-item
self-administered questionnaire that is another well-
established scale for measuring perceived loneli-
ness.43 This scale has also been adapted to a shorter,
six item version, with subscales for emotional loneli-
ness (a perceived lack of intimate relationships) and
social loneliness (a perceived lack of broader social
relationships).44

The Duke Social Support Index is a multidimen-
sional scale measuring social network, social interac-
tions, perceived, and instrumental social support.
Eleven item and 23 item scales are widely used.45

The Relationship of SI/L With Adverse Physical
and Mental Health Outcomes

Social isolation has been associated with a signiﬁ-
cantly increased risk of premature mortality from all
causes based on research studies spanning over
40 years. The excess mortality atrributable to social
isolation risk rivals the impact of physical risk factors
such as obesity and smoking.1,10,35,46 The evidence
establishing loneliness as a risk factor for premature
mortality is not as extensive, yet is mounting.12,47
Although SI/L often co-occur, their combined and
interactive effects on health outcomes have rarely
been studied. Holt-Lunstad et al.48 performed a com-
prehensive meta-analysis of 148 prospective studies
that measured both SI/L as well as a combined, mul-
tifaceted measure of social connection. Complex
measures of structural components of social connec-
tion which included marital status, network size, and
network participation had the strongest effect sizes
compared to unidimensional measures. Over an aver-
age follow up period of 7.5 years, participants with-
out strong social connections experienced 50% greater
odds of mortality.48

SI/L have been found to increase the risk of devel-
oping coronary artery disease and stroke independent
of traditional cardiovascular disease risk factors, in
studies.4,49 Meta-analysis
numerous
found these risks to be increased by nearly one-third.4
Low social connectedness has also been associated

longitudinal

with higher healthcare utilization and worse progno-
ses for patients with cardiac disease. Low social sup-
port was associated with increased rates of hospital
readmission and mortality following myocardial
infarction.50 In patients with heart failure, higher per-
ceived loneliness was associated with more frequent
ambulatory and emergency room visits and hospital
admissions.51 Vascular pathology and morbidity
associated with SI/L are likely to contribute to the
onset and disease course of other late-life conditions
such as geriatric depression and neurocognitive disor-
ders.

Longitudinal studies provide evidence for both SI/
L as antecedent risk factors for incident depression or
worsening late-life depression in older adults.16,52,53
Notably, a study of over 11,000 older U.S. adults
found that lower frequency of in-person social con-
tacts was related to higher rates of depression over
2 years.54 Lower frequencies of telephone, written or
email contacts were unrelated to future depression,
pointing to a speciﬁc salutary impact of in-person
contacts. Despite these well-documented associations,
it is important to note that loneliness and clinical
depression are distinct entities. Major depression is
characterized by core deﬁcits, either diminished inter-
est and pleasure or depressed mood, as well as symp-
toms such as loss of appetite, sleep problems, and
difﬁculty concentrating. Loneliness and social with-
drawal are not diagnostic features of depression,
although they may be associated symptoms. It is
likely that SI/L inﬂuence each other and depression
pathogenesis in multifaceted ways. Some observa-
tional data suggest that loneliness predisposes to
avoidance of others, social isolation and subsequent
depression.16,18 Other evidence supports that social
isolation is an initial state that can precede loneliness,
low perceived social support, and depression onset.21
SI/L have been associated with suicide for all
ages.1,55 As would be expected, depression is the
most relevant cause for suicide, yet loneliness and
social isolation have been found to be independent
contributing factors to increased risk of suicide
attempts. Social disconnection has been associated
with stress, suicide ideation, and self-harm in older
adults. For example, elders who experience poor
social relations and are mistreated are at greater risk
for suicidal ideation.1 In a study of over 60,000 older
adults, increased loneliness was among the primary
motivations for self-harm.1,56

Am J Geriatr Psychiatry 28:12, December 2020

1237

Social Isolation and Loneliness in Older Adults: Review and Commentary

SI/L can also lead to an increased risk for anxiety
disorders which have often been linked with depres-
sion in empirical studies.16,19 In one study of over
1,000 individuals who were followed over 6 months,
earlier loneliness positively predicted future states of
social anxiety. In addition, earlier social anxiety was a
predictor of future loneliness, a bidirectional relation-
ship.19 In the Irish Longitudinal Study on Aging of
over 5,000 participants, the relationship between lone-
liness and generalized anxiety was bidirectional, but
stronger when loneliness was the origin.16 However,
social isolation was a unidirectional predictor of gen-
eralized anxiety.16

The committee documented that high levels of
loneliness, a low frequency of interaction with family
and friends, and low levels of participation in com-
munity based groups (such as religious gatherings
and civic clubs) increased the risk of cognitive decline
and incident major neurocognitive
impairment
(dementia).1 In a meta-analysis performed in 2015,
Kuiper et al.3 found an increased risk of dementia to
be associated with high levels of loneliness, infre-
quent social contacts and low-level group participa-
tion.3 These social
factors increased the risk of
dementia by approximately 50%. Similarly, in a sub-
sequent meta-analysis, investigators found that living
alone, having a limited social network, or a low fre-
quency of social contact increased the risk for demen-
tia.1,57 Notably, SI/L have been found to be
independent risk factors with a cumulative effect on
cognitive decline and dementia risk in some studies,
suggesting both shared and distinct mechanisms.1,23
Social interactions are thought to enhance cognitive
capacity through activation and maintenance of the
efﬁciency of brain networks.1,58 In addition, among
cognitively normal adults, increased perceptions of
loneliness have been associated with higher levels of
brain amyloid and regional accumulation of tau pro-
tein, linking loneliness with pathological changes of
early Alzheimer’s disease.1,59,60

Though SI/L have been found to increase the risk
for speciﬁc psychiatric disorders and their consequen-
ces (such as suicide), social isolation also has been
associated with a decreased QoL, such as measures of
a person’s overall physical and mental health, satis-
faction with life and “happiness,” and perceived
ﬁnancial adequacy.1 In one study, social isolation had
a signiﬁcant,
independent and negative effect on
health related QoL (a more narrow approach to QoL

which includes perceived physical and mental
health).61 Less work has been performed regarding
the role of loneliness. Yet it stands to reason that both
severe and moderate loneliness reduce the physical
and mental QoL among older adults.

Mechanisms

The committee report summarized key mediators
(mechanisms or pathways) which link SI/L with
health outcomes. Three categories of mediators were
grouped according to behavioral, psychological, and
biological mechanisms. These mechanisms and inter-
relationships are depicted in Figure 2.

SI/L have been linked to adverse health outcomes
via lifestyle or health-related behaviors. The quality
and quantity of social relationships may exert favor-
able or unfavorable inﬂuences on health behaviors
and health outcomes. A meta-analysis of patient
adherence to medical treatment found that greater
structural, functional, and quality measures of social
connection were associated with better adherence,
with the strongest effect for social support.62 Greater
social support has also been strongly associated with
favorable sleep outcomes,63,64 whereas loneliness has
been associated with increased sleep fragmentation,
poorer sleep quality and consequent metabolic, neu-
ral, and hormonal dysregulation.1,4,65−68 A study
examining the association of greater loneliness with
cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and migraine among
8,600 older adults found signiﬁcant mediation effects
attributable to behavioral variables such as poor
sleep, physical inactivity, and daily smoking.69

Psychological and stress-related mechanisms are a
second category of mediators contributing to the
health impacts of SI/L. Relationships with others are
important to adapt to life stresses through practical
guidance and aid (informational and tangible sup-
port) and emotional forms of social support. Social
support has been shown to attenuate the physiologi-
cal stress response, such as reducing blood pressure
and the inﬂammatory response, in numerous studies
(as reviewed in NASEM report).1 Conversely, an
absence or low level of support heightens physiologic
responses to stress.70 As previously noted, SI/L have
been associated with greater likelihood of developing
anxiety and depressive symptoms and conditions16,54
which, further, inﬂuence physiologic stress responses
and health outcomes.

Donovan and Blazer

Biological studies investigating associations of SI/
L with poor health outcomes implicate cardiovascu-
lar, neuroendocrine and inﬂammatory pathways, par-
ticularly in conditions of heightened stress. SI/L are
associated with elevated vascular resistance and
blood pressure as well as higher rates of metabolic
syndrome.71−73 Meta-analyses have found loneliness
to be associated with exaggerated blood pressure and
inﬂammatory reactivity to acute stress.70 Social isola-
tion has been associated with higher resting heat rate,
higher systolic blood pressure, and unfavorable cho-
lesterol parameters in response to stress.74,75 Strong
evidences from both experimental and observational
studies indicate that low social support, loneliness,
and social isolation are associated with acute and
chronic elevations in blood pressure and heart rate
(as reviewed in the NASEM report).1

The relationship of social bonding and social isola-
tion to hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activity in
humans and animals has been extensively studied
and reviewed.76,77
In studies of older adults,

loneliness has been associated with lower cortisol out-
put78 and lower cortisol response to stress.79 In an
experimental paradigm of acute stress, loneliness was
associated with both low cortisol reactivity and
greater interleukin-6 and monocyte chemotactic pro-
tein 1 in older women, suggesting dysregulation of
both neuroendocrine and inﬂammatory processes.79

Eisenberg et al.80 have comprehensively reviewed
evidence for the reciprocal nature of social behavior
and inﬂammatory processes.80 Research in both ani-
mals and humans has shown transient and sometimes
long term activation of inﬂammatory processes in
response to a range of social stressors such as social
separation or loss, social defeat, and social exclu-
sion.80 These studies include research in socially iso-
lated older adults showing higher levels of circulating
the inﬂammatory marker,81−83
C-reactive protein,
and higher levels of the clotting factor ﬁbrinogen, a
biomarker of inﬂammation and cardiac risk.84 Loneli-
ness has also been associated with higher levels of
interleukin-6, ﬁbrinogen, and C-reactive protein in a

mid-life sample.85 Loneliness has been associated
with greater expression of pro-inﬂammatory genes in
older adults,86 an effect that was downregulated by
mindfulness-based stress reduction in a randomized
controlled trial.87

The Role of the Healthcare Sector in Addressing
the impacts of SI/L in Older Adults

The committee developed ﬁve broad goals for the
healthcare sector to address SI/L in older adults.
These goals were, Goal 1: develop a more robust evi-
dence base on effective assessment, prevention, and
intervention strategies; Goal 2:
translate current
research into healthcare practices; Goals 3 and 4:
improve awareness and strengthen ongoing educa-
tion and training; and Goal 5: strengthen ties between
the healthcare system and community-based net-
works and resources. Speciﬁc recommendations to
advance these goals were formulated and are detailed
in the full report.

Interventions

The committee report included a compilation of 92
published interventions for SI/L in older adults and
48 unpublished interventions that were identiﬁed by
outreach to community organizations. These inter-
ventions were heterogeneous with respect to the tar-
get older adult population (general older population,
health condition focus, vulnerable group, and resi-
dential setting), the level of intervention (one-on-one,
group, and community-based), and the type of inter-
vention (intentionally addressed SI/L, general social
engagement, or environmental change/new resource
(e.g., transportation). A limited number quantiﬁed
the impact of interventions on SI/L, few used a ran-
domized-controlled or quasi-experimental methodol-
ogy and most studies involved convenience samples
that did not speciﬁcally target the most socially iso-
lated or lonely older adults.

Findings from seven published reviews of inter-
ventions for SI/L were reported and summarized.
Across these reviews, the most effective interventions
were those that speciﬁcally targeted social isolated or
lonely individuals, had a sound theoretical basis,
used a multileveled approach, and involved active
engagement of the participant. There were inconsis-
tent ﬁndings regarding greater effectiveness for group

compared to one-on-one interventions.
Individual
reviews highlighted particular effectiveness of psy-
choeducational approaches and social skills train-
ing,88,89 the need to better understand mechanisms
(such as maladaptive thinking) underlying SI/L90,91
and the need to incorporate and evaluate technology
in future interventions.89

The committee report further summarized indirect
and direct interventions for SI/L relevant to the
healthcare system. Indirect interventions for SI/L in
older adults address underlying conditions or risk fac-
tors such as hearing aids or cochlear implants to miti-
gate the impact of hearing loss on SI/L. Examples of
other indirect interventions include enhancing physi-
cal mobility or access to transportation. SI/L may also
be addressed indirectly by providing resources or sup-
port for older adults who have recently relocated or
who are bereaved. Social prescribing is a common
practice in which practitioners help patients access
nonclinical sources of support within the community.
This may be either an indirect or direct means of reduc-
ing SI/L, either by facilitating patient engagement in
voluntary organizations and community groups
broadly or by facilitating speciﬁc referrals to commu-
nity organizations which directly address SI/L.

Psychotherapeutic approaches to reduce SI/L have
included cognitive behavioral therapy and mindful-
ness-based approaches, with some studies showing
efﬁcacy for reducing loneliness and improving social
interactions. Research suggests that lonely individuals
interpret social interactions more negatively92 and are
more likely to perceive social threat93 compared to
those who are not lonely. Lonely individuals have also
been found to score lower on tests of executive func-
tion compared to their nonlonely peers.94 It is hypothe-
sized that these cognitive-emotional biases may lead to
a cycle of worsening withdrawal and loneliness.

Mann et al.95 reviewed 10 published randomized
controlled trials examining cognitive approaches to
improving loneliness and other aspects of social con-
nection in nongeriatric samples who were affected by
a range of mental health conditions. Two online CBT
(Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) therapies for depres-
sion (one with added motivational training and one
with added brief advice) were associated with reduc-
tions in both depression and loneliness ratings at 12
months. Other trials within this review showed mixed
or null effects on loneliness or social support out-
comes.

The committee report also noted that a smartphone
based training in mindfulness techniques of awareness
and acceptance was associated with reductions in
daily loneliness ratings compared to a control group in
a nongeriatric sample.96 Additionally, a recent study
published after the release of the NASEM report com-
pared a 5-week, tele-delivered behavioral activation
intervention for homebound lonely older adults to a
tele-delivered friendly visit and found greater
improvements in social interaction, perceived social
support, and loneliness in the tele-delivered behav-
ioral activation group at 6 and 12 weeks.97

There is currently no evidence for the use of phar-
macologic interventions to reduce loneliness or isola-
tion. The potential use of selective serotonin reuptake
inhibitors, neurosteroids, or oxytocin to reduce anxi-
ety and fear and promote social afﬁliation has been
proposed as possible therapeutic avenues based pri-
marily on animal data.93

The Role of Technology

Technological applications relevant

to SI/L in
older adults range from established tools such as
social media groups and video-conferencing to more
advanced artiﬁcial language and virtual reality func-
tions designed for older adults. Established tools
allow for greater connection through video-mediated
visits and engagement in virtual communities. Artiﬁ-
cial intelligence applications are designed to provide
companionship or support function via social robots,
conversational agents, or through virtual reality sys-
tems which facilitate reminiscence with familiar expe-
riences or engagement with new stimulations. In
evaluating technological interventions for SI/L, ques-
tions of accessibility, acceptability, cost, and feasibil-
ity need to be addressed.1 The committee emphasized
that while new technologies have the potential to pos-
itively impact the health of older adults, potential
harms also need to be considered, particularly in the
areas of privacy, informed consent, and autonomy.1

CONCLUSION

The world has changed since the release of the
National Academies report in early 2020 because of
the COVID-19 pandemic. SI/L are now everyday con-
cerns for populations worldwide and are a special

Donovan and Blazer

burden for older adults. Older adults are at high risk
for morbidity and mortality due to COVID-19 and,
on that basis, are likely to experience prolonged isola-
tion. In communities where “stay-at-home” instruc-
tions have been imposed, older persons, especially
those in residential or long term care facilities, may be
restricted from interacting with spouses, family and
friends who live within or outside these communities.
Thus while social isolation during COVID-19 can be
life-saving, it also deprives older adults of fundamen-
tal human needs for companionship and community.
Many older adults do not have access to email, social
media, or video-conferencing which has been widely
implemented to compensate for the lack of in-person
social contacts. Furthermore, the adequacy of these
is unstudied and their advantages
technologies
maybe offset by missing aspects of human interaction
such as touch and three-dimensional perspective.
Reliance on technology solutions places a higher bur-
den on those who lack access, such as older adults
who are socioeconomically disadvantaged or those
with cognitive impairment or sensory impairments.
During this historic pandemic, decades of social epi-
demiologic research inform us that the health protec-
tive beneﬁts of social distancing must be balanced by
the human needs for sustaining social relationships.
This report is a valuable resource to advance collec-
tive action and solutions during the period of
COVID-19 and beyond.
