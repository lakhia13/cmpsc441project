Pathophysiology and Treatment of
Bipolar Disorder

Bipolar disorder (BD) is a mood disorder that affects millions worldwide and is associated
with severe mood swings between mania and depression. The mood stabilizers
valproate (VPA) and lithium (Li) are among the main drugs that are used to treat BD
patients. However, these drugs are not effective for all patients and cause serious side
effects. Therefore, better drugs are needed to treat BD patients. The main barrier to
developing new drugs is the lack of knowledge about the therapeutic mechanism of
currently available drugs. Several hypotheses have been proposed for the mechanism
of action of mood stabilizers. However, it is still not known how they act to alleviate
both mania and depression. The pathology of BD is characterized by mitochondrial
dysfunction, oxidative stress, and abnormalities in calcium signaling. A deﬁciency in
the unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway may be a shared mechanism that leads
to these cellular dysfunctions. This is supported by reported abnormalities in the UPR
pathway in lymphoblasts from BD patients. Additionally, studies have demonstrated that
mood stabilizers alter the expression of several UPR target genes in mouse and human
neuronal cells. In this review, we outline a new perspective wherein mood stabilizers
exert their therapeutic mechanism by activating the UPR. Furthermore, we discuss
UPR abnormalities in BD patients and suggest future research directions to resolve
discrepancies in the literature.

INTRODUCTION

Bipolar disorder (BD) is a mood disorder that is characterized by moods alternating between
mania and depression (Baldessarini et al., 2020). BD aﬀects 2% of the population and is associated
with a high rate of suicide (Gonda et al., 2012; Baldessarini et al., 2020). While there is no single
biological marker correlated with BD, there is strong evidence of heritability, and multiple genes
have been found to be linked to increased risk for the disease (Grande et al., 2016; Stahl et al., 2019).
Environmental factors also play a role in the onset of the disease (Vieta et al., 2018). Lithium (Li) and
valproate (VPA) are among the primary drugs used to treat BD (Geddes and Miklowitz, 2013). Yet,
these drugs are not eﬀective for all patients and can cause serious side eﬀects, including hepatoxicity,

UPR Deﬁciency in BD

renal toxicity, teratogenicity, cognitive impairment, hair loss,
and weight gain (Dreifuss et al., 1987; Pijl and Meinders, 1996;
Mercke et al., 2000; Yonkers et al., 2004; Gitlin, 2016). Therefore,
better drugs are needed to treat BD patients. However, the
mechanism of action of BD drugs is not known, which hinders
the development of eﬀective drugs with minimal side eﬀects.

Many studies have aimed to characterize the cellular eﬀects
of BD drugs in order to improve our understanding of
their therapeutic mechanism, and numerous cellular targets
including the neurotransmitter and
have been proposed,
neuromodulator systems, neuronal plasticity pathways, and myo-
inositol metabolism (Berridge, 2014). Studies have also suggested
that the unfolded protein response (UPR) pathway may be part
of the pathophysiology of BD and that mood stabilizers could
exert their therapeutic mechanism by activating the UPR (Wang
et al., 1999; Bown et al., 2000; Chen et al., 2000; Kakiuchi et al.,
2003; Shao et al., 2006; Kim et al., 2009; Pfaﬀenseller et al.,
2014; Bengesser et al., 2016). The pathophysiology of BD is
associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and
abnormalities in calcium signaling, and the UPR plays a role in all
of these pathways (Berk et al., 2011; Callaly et al., 2015; Vincenz-
Donnelly and Hipp, 2017; Harrison et al., 2019). Therefore,
deﬁcient UPR activation could be a common mechanism
underlying the array of cellular dysfunctions associated with BD.
In support of this, several studies have reported a deﬁciency
in UPR activation in lymphoblasts from BD patients (Table 1),
as well as altered expression of UPR target genes following
treatment with BD drugs (Table 2).

In this review, we highlight the existing data regarding
UPR activation by mood stabilizers, discuss UPR abnormalities
in BD patients, and suggest
future research directions to
clarify conﬂicting ﬁndings obtained from diﬀerent studies. We
analyze several mechanisms that could explain how mood
stabilizers activate the UPR, focusing on a novel hypothesis
wherein myo-inositol depletion serves as the mechanistic trigger
for UPR activation.

THE UPR PATHWAY

The UPR is a stress response signaling pathway that
is
conserved from yeast to mammals (Foti et al., 1999). The
UPR has a dual function, as it promotes homeostasis and
cell survival under mild ER stress but can lead to apoptosis
and cell death under intense, persistent stress (Chan et al.,
2015; Hiramatsu et al., 2015). Various stressors activate the
UPR, such as the accumulation of unfolded proteins in the
ER lumen,
lipid disequilibrium, calcium imbalance, nutrient
limitation, and oxidative stress (Kaufman et al., 2002; Yan
et al., 2008; Gardner and Walter, 2011; Hou et al., 2014; Krebs
et al., 2015). The UPR activates downstream signaling cascades
that induce genes functioning in protein folding, degradation,
and translation arrest to reduce the protein load in the ER
(Perri et al., 2015).

In yeast, UPR activation is mediated by IRE1, a type-1
(Figure 1;
transmembrane kinase,
Yamamoto et al., 2004; Korennykh et al., 2009). Activated

IRE1 is the only UPR branch that

is conserved from
yeast to mammals (Yamamoto et al., 2004; Korennykh et al.,
2009). Similar to yeast, upon ER stress, mammalian IRE1
is activated by autophosphorylation (Yamamoto et al., 2004;
Korennykh et al., 2009). It catalyzes the splicing of a 26 bp
intronic region of XBP1 mRNA to form spliced XBP1 (sXBP1),
which is translated to an active transcription factor (Calfon
et al., 2002; Hiramatsu et al., 2011). sXBP1 translocates to the
nucleus and activates UPR target genes that contain conserved
in their promoters.
ER stress
These are similar to UPREs in yeast and include genes that
function in protein folding, lipid metabolism, and ER-associated
degradation (Yamamoto et al., 2004; Korennykh et al., 2009;
Piperi et al., 2016).

In addition to IRE1, mammals have two additional UPR
branches: activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) and protein
kinase RNA (PKR)-like ER kinase (PERK) (Figure 1; Perri
et al., 2015). ATF6 is a member of the basic leucine zipper
transcription factors (Wang et al., 2000). Under
family of
translocated to the Golgi apparatus,
ER stress, ATF6 is

to
become an active transcription factor (Figure 1; Wang et al.,
2000). Active ATF6 translocates to the nucleus and activates
downstream target genes that function in protein folding and
maturation, including glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78),
glucose-regulated protein 94 (GRP94), and calreticulin (Schardt
to
et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2016). ATF6 and XBP1 act
restore cell homeostasis and promote cell survival under
ER stress (Yamamoto et al., 2004; Yoshida et al., 2006;
Dadey et al., 2016).

PERK, a third branch of the UPR, functions to reduce the
load of translated proteins that enter the ER and increases
cell death under persistent ER stress (Lin et al., 2009; Kilberg
et al., 2012). Following ER stress, PERK is oligomerized
and activated by autophosphorylation (Harding et al., 2000).
Active PERK phosphorylates eukaryotic translation initiation
factor 2α (eIF2α) (Harding et al., 2000). Phosphorylated eIF2α
inhibits eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2B (eIF2B) and
decreases the assembly of the 43S initiation complex (Harding
et al., 2000). This leads to translation arrest of most mRNAs
while selectively allowing translation of speciﬁc proteins, such
as activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) (Harding et al.,
2000). ATF4 regulates the expression of genes that function
in amino acid metabolism and oxidative stress (Harding
et al., 2003). Furthermore, ATF4 activates the transcription
factor CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein homologous protein
(CHOP), which plays a role in programmed cell death under
persistent ER stress (Harding et al., 2000).

ABNORMALITIES IN THE UPR PATHWAY
IN BD

Several studies have reported a deﬁciency in UPR activation
in lymphoblasts from BD patients (Kakiuchi et al., 2003;
Kim et al., 2009; Pfaﬀenseller et al., 2014; Bengesser et al.,
2016). Lymphoblast cells from BD patients have been used
in many studies to characterize the pathology of BD, as
access to live human brain tissue is not possible (Viswanath
et al., 2015). An early study showed that the XBP1 single-
nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) –116C→G is associated with
an increased risk of developing BD (Kakiuchi et al., 2003).
However, other studies failed to conﬁrm the association of
this SNP with BD (Hou et al., 2004; Kakiuchi et al., 2004).
Additional work demonstrated that deﬁcient UPR activation
is caused by reduced transcription of the UPR target genes
XBP1, GRP94, and CHOP in lymphoblast cells from BD patients
after treatment with the ER stressors thapsigargin (TG) and
tunicamycin (Tun) (So et al., 2007; Hayashi et al., 2009; Bengesser
et al., 2018). This deﬁciency in UPR activation aﬀects the
ability to adapt to changes in the cellular environment, such
as the accumulation of misfolded proteins in the ER,
lipid
overload, or changes in nutrient availability (Xu et al., 2005;
Mandl et al., 2009). An inability of cells to adapt to ER stress
results in increased cell death, and this has been demonstrated
to occur in BD patient lymphocytes following treatment with
Tun (Pfaﬀenseller et al., 2014). Increased neuronal cell death
and neurodegeneration have been previously reported in BD

patients (Karabulut et al., 2019; Gokcinar et al., 2020). Therefore,
future studies
should investigate whether ER stress and
deﬁcient UPR activation contribute to the neurodegeneration
observed in BD patients.

MOOD STABILIZERS ALTER THE
EXPRESSION OF UPR TARGET GENES

Studies have suggested modulation of the UPR pathway as a
therapeutic target of mood stabilizers. VPA and Li increase
the expression of the UPR chaperones GRP78, GRP94, and
calreticulin in rat brain samples and cultured rat cells (Table 2).
In this way, VPA has been shown to protect cells from diﬀerent
stress situations by inducing the UPR (Zhang et al., 2011; Li et al.,
2017). For example, VPA protects SH-SY5Y cells from ER stress-
induced apoptosis following treatment with TG by increasing
the pro-survival protein GRP78 and reducing the pro-apoptotic
protein CHOP (Li et al., 2017). Similarly, VPA protects cells
from ischemia-reperfusion injuries in rats by attenuating the
increase in CHOP levels (Zhang et al., 2011). However, certain
studies have also demonstrated no eﬀect on the UPR pathway by
mood stabilizers. Although VPA increases GRP78 protein levels
in HEK293 cells, neither VPA nor Li has a signiﬁcant impact
on the expression of GRP78 in Neuro-2a cells (Kakiuchi et al.,
2003, 2009; Shi et al., 2007). Additionally, VPA and Li do not
increase XBP1 expression in SH-SY5Y and lymphoblastoid cells
(Kakiuchi et al., 2003). Nonetheless, there is strong support for

UPR Deﬁciency in BD

FIGURE 1 | The mammalian unfolded protein response pathway. The UPR is activated upon ER stress caused by the accumulation of unfolded proteins in the lumen
of the ER. UPR activation is mediated by three branches: PKR-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK), inositol-requiring kinase 1 (IRE1), and activating
transcription factor 6 (ATF6). PERK and IRE1 are activated by autophosphorylation. Active PERK phosphorylates eIF2α, which inhibits overall protein translation,
while selectively promoting the translation of activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4). Active IRE1 splices an intronic region from XBP1 mRNA (HAC1 in yeast) to form
sXBP1, which is translated into an active transcription factor. ATF6 is translocated to the Golgi, where it is cleaved and further translocated to the nucleus. ATF6,
sXBP1, and ATF4 activate downstream signaling cascades that increase the expression of genes that function in restoring ER homeostasis or inducing cell death
under persistent ER stress.

UPR activation by mood stabilizers in the majority of mammalian
studies conducted to date.

Several mechanisms could explain how mood stabilizers
activate the UPR. The ﬁrst mechanism is through myo-inositol
depletion and subsequent upregulation of ceramide levels.
Abnormalities in myo-inositol levels have been observed in the
brains of BD patients, and myo-inositol depletion has been
hypothesized as part of the therapeutic mechanism of mood
stabilizers (Shimon et al., 1997; Silverstone et al., 2005; Berridge,
2014). Studies have also reported alterations in the lipid proﬁle,
including changes in ceramide levels, in BD patients (Schwarz
et al., 2008; Huang et al., 2018; Brunkhorst-Kanaan et al.,
2019). An elegant study in yeast connected these observations
and introduced a novel mechanism of UPR activation by the
mood stabilizer VPA (Jadhav et al., 2016). Using yeast deﬁcient
in myo-inositol synthesis, Jadhav et al. (2016) demonstrated
that depletion of intracellular myo-inositol by VPA upregulates
ceramide levels and activates the UPR (Figure 2). In this study,
it was shown that ceramide activates the UPR by inducing
nutrient stress through the downregulation of plasma membrane
amino acid transporters (Jadhav et al., 2016). It has also been
shown that ceramide can activate the UPR pathway in human
cells by inhibiting ER calcium uptake, suggesting that these
ceramide-regulated mechanisms may work in tandem to induce

the UPR following treatment with VPA (Liu et al., 2014). VPA-
mediated activation of the UPR leads to increased expression
of ER chaperones in yeast, including KAR2, the homolog of
mammalian GRP78 (Jadhav et al., 2016). Upregulation of UPR
chaperones indicates a protective eﬀect of VPA. Therefore, myo-
inositol depletion and UPR activation may be part of the same
therapeutic mechanism employed by this drug. There is strong
support for mood stabilizers leading to myo-inositol depletion in
mammalian cells (Ye and Greenberg, 2015; Yu et al., 2017; Saiardi
and Mudge, 2018). Additionally, it was shown that an increase
in ceramide levels can activate the UPR pathway (Senkal et al.,
2011; Liu et al., 2014). Future studies should characterize whether
myo-inositol depletion activates the UPR in mammalian cells and
whether this is dependent on an increase in ceramide levels.

A second mechanism is through inhibition of histone
deacetylases (HDACs) (Shi et al., 2007). Support
for this
mechanism comes from a study showing that VPA, a known
HDAC inhibitor,
increases GRP78 expression, while VPA
derivatives lacking the ability to inhibit HDACs do not increase
GRP78 expression (Shi et al., 2007). In agreement with this,
HDAC1 has been shown to bind to the promoter of GRP78
and repress its expression, suggesting that VPA may act at the
transcriptional level to promote UPR activation by preventing
repression by HDACs (Baumeister et al., 2009).

UPR Deﬁciency in BD

FIGURE 2 | VPA induces the UPR pathway in yeast by increasing intracellular ceramide levels. VPA-mediated myo-inositol depletion results in elevated ceramide
levels. Elevated ceramide results in the downregulation of amino acid transporters and subsequent UPR activation due to starvation stress. Figure adapted and
modiﬁed from Jadhav et al. (2016).

A third potential mechanism for UPR activation by mood
stabilizers is through upregulation of the wolframin gene (WFS1)
(Kakiuchi et al., 2009). WFS1 functions in mitigating ER stress,
and WFS1 knockdown results in compensatory upregulation of
GRP78, CHOP, and XBP1 in β-cells (Kakiuchi et al., 2009). In
support of this mechanism, VPA has been shown to increase
the expression of WFS1, leading to its dissociation from, and
subsequent activation of, the ER chaperone GRP94 (Kakiuchi
et al., 2009). Collectively, these studies support a protective role
for the mood stabilizer VPA in the context of ER stress and
highlight the possibility that VPA may act through more than one
route to enhance the UPR response.

Regulation of the UPR pathway is linked to various aspects of
brain function, and dysregulation is associated with the pathology
of neurological disorders. GRP78 is an essential chaperone and
a master regulator of the UPR, which functions in neuronal
development (Weng et al., 2011). Abnormalities in GRP78
levels are associated with various neurological disorders such
as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases (Weng et al., 2011;
Casas, 2017; Enogieru et al., 2019). Under normal conditions,
GRP78 binds to the three UPR stress sensors, PERK, ATF6,
and IRE1, and prevents their activation (Gong et al., 2017).
However, under ER stress, GRP78 is released from these sensors
by binding to unfolded proteins, resulting in sensor activation
(Gong et al., 2017). Studies have suggested a role for the
UPR in memory regulation, brain aging, neurotransmission,
and in maintaining synaptic plasticity and structure in the
central nervous system (Nosyreva and Kavalali, 2010; Freeman
and Mallucci, 2016; Martínez et al., 2016; Miranda et al.,
2020). Therefore, regulation of the UPR pathway may play

a signiﬁcant role in the pathophysiology and treatment of
neurological disorders.

CONCLUSION

The UPR pathway may play a signiﬁcant role in the pathology and
treatment of BD, a severe mood disorder that disrupts the lives of
patients and their families (Gonda et al., 2012; Baldessarini et al.,
2020). Li and VPA are two of the primary drugs used to treat BD
patients (Geddes and Miklowitz, 2013). However, their eﬃcacy
is not universal, and they can cause serious side eﬀects (Dreifuss
et al., 1987; Pijl and Meinders, 1996; Mercke et al., 2000; Yonkers
et al., 2004; Gitlin, 2016). The therapeutic mechanism of these
drugs is unknown, which poses a challenge for developing better
and more eﬀective medications. Several studies have suggested
that a deﬁciency in UPR activation is connected to BD pathology
and that mood stabilizers may activate the UPR pathway as part
of their therapeutic mechanisms (Tables 1, 2).

There are multiple mechanisms

that could potentially
underlie UPR activation by mood stabilizers, including HDAC
inhibition, upregulation of WFS1, and myo-inositol depletion
(Shi et al., 2007; Kakiuchi et al., 2009; Jadhav et al., 2016).
While these mechanisms are not mutually exclusive, the myo-
inositol depletion mechanism is currently the best supported
for several reasons. Studies have rigorously demonstrated that
BD drugs induce myo-inositol depletion in both yeast and
mammalian cells, and myo-inositol is known to be especially
essential for brain function, where the concentration can reach
levels 20 times higher than in the blood (Vaden et al., 2001;

UPR Deﬁciency in BD

Ye and Greenberg, 2015; Bizzarri et al., 2016; Jadhav et al.,
2016; Yu et al., 2017; Saiardi and Mudge, 2018). To date, the
most complete mechanistic study of UPR activation by mood
stabilizers provides strong evidence for a causative link between
VPA treatment, myo-inositol depletion,
increased ceramide
levels, and UPR activation in yeast (Figure 2) (Jadhav et al.,
2016), and this is further corroborated by studies showing that
myo-inositol and ceramide levels are aberrant in BD patients
(Shimon et al., 1997; Silverstone et al., 2005; Schwarz et al., 2008;
Brunkhorst-Kanaan et al., 2019). However, this mechanism has
yet to be tested in mammalian cells, and it is within reason to
speculate that HDAC inhibition and WFS1 upregulation could
also contribute to the therapeutic mechanism of VPA.

Several

limitations and discrepancies in the studies in
Tables 1, 2 warrant further investigation. First, the small sample
size in many of these studies decreases the statistical power of
the results due to variations among individuals and populations
(So et al., 2007). Thus, there is a need to characterize the UPR
pathway in larger, more diverse populations of BD patients.
Diﬀerences in the disease stage between patients may also
contribute to this variability, with advanced stages reported to
have a higher deﬁciency in UPR activation (Pfaﬀenseller et al.,
2014). However, a challenge in resolving this issue is that BD is a
psychiatric disorder with no unique biological marker that allows
accurate characterization of the disease and its severity (Sigitova
et al., 2017). Conducting large-scale genome-wide association
(GWA) studies may aid in identifying biological markers for
BD (Chuang and Kuo, 2017). The third limitation is that UPR
deﬁciency has mainly been characterized in lymphoblast cells
from BD patients despite the fact that BD is a neuronal disorder.
To address this issue, postmortem studies should be used to
investigate whether UPR activation is impaired in brain tissue
from BD patients. Another fundamental challenge is that BD
patients are often treated simultaneously with multiple drugs,
making it challenging to separate UPR phenotypes associated
with the disease itself vs. those resulting from mood stabilizers
or other medications (Pfaﬀenseller et al., 2014). This matter
could be addressed by characterizing the UPR pathway in BD
patients who are not treated by mood stabilizers. However, a
caveat to this is that recruiting untreated BD patients may pose

- BiP and CHOP gene expression- and XBP1 splicing analysis in peripheral

both logistical problems (e.g., small sample sizes) and ethical
dilemmas, as the disease is associated with high rates of suicide,
especially in untreated patients (Gonda et al., 2012; Baldessarini
et al., 2020). Therefore, the best strategy to clarify existing
data is to focus research eﬀorts on collecting and analyzing
larger, more diverse data sets, identifying biological markers
for BD, and utilizing postmortem studies to investigate UPR
activation in the brain.

Uncovering the role of the UPR in the pathophysiology
and treatment of BD would facilitate the development of more
eﬀective drugs to treat this debilitating and widespread disease.
Additionally, to characterize the extent of UPR deﬁciency in BD
patients, studies should investigate whether downstream targets
of UPR activation are also impaired in BD patients. For example,
a deﬁciency in UPR activation may lead to abnormalities in
lipid metabolism, mitochondrial function, protein secretion, or
calcium signaling (Gong et al., 2017). Therefore, drugs could
be designed to target speciﬁc signaling branches of the UPR
pathway or act to resolve the downstream deﬁciencies of UPR
activation. These drugs could be chemical chaperones such as 4-
Phenylbutyric acid (PBA), which alleviates ER stress by assisting
protein folding in the ER, and is already approved by the FDA
to treat urea cycle disorder (Roy et al., 2015). Ultimately, speciﬁc
and eﬀective drugs with fewer side eﬀects will reduce the severity
of this disease and improve the lives of BD patients.
