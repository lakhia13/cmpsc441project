Abstract: Perinatal mental health problems are linked to poor outcomes for mothers, babies and
families. In the context of Low and Middle Income Countries (LMIC), a leading risk factor is gender
disparity. Addressing gender disparity, by involving fathers, mothers in law and other family
members can signiﬁcantly improve perinatal and maternal healthcare, including risk factors for poor
perinatal mental health such as domestic violence and poor social support. This highlights the need
to develop and implement gender-transformative (GT) interventions that seek to engage with men
and reduce or overcome gender-based constraints. This scoping review aimed to highlight existing
gender transformative interventions from LMIC that speciﬁcally aimed to address perinatal mental
health (partner violence, anxiety or depression and partner support) and identify components of
the intervention that were found to be useful and acceptable. This review follows the ﬁve-stage
Arksey and O’Malley framework and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-
Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) checklist. Six papers that met the inclusion
criteria were included in the review (four from Africa and two from Asia). Common components
of gender transformative interventions across studies included couple-based interventions and
discussion groups. Gender inequity and related factors are a strong risk for poor perinatal mental
health and the dearth of studies highlights the strong need for better evidence of GT interventions in
this area.

Keywords: perinatal mental health; gender transformative interventions; scoping review; LMIC

1. Introduction

Research and policies related to perinatal mental health have demonstrated how
poor mental health both in pregnancy and postpartum is prevalent in the form of anxiety
and depression, and may inﬂuence pregnancy outcomes and the health of the foetus and
infant [1,2]. Untreated depression during pregnancy is also associated with a risk for suicide
especially in those with a severe problem or when there is associated partner violence [2–4].
When studied through a socio-cultural context, women generally have reported high
levels of anxiety, depression and higher levels of trauma during pregnancy as well as the
postpartum period [5–7]. Rates of anxiety and depression in pregnancy from Low and
Middle Income Countries (LMIC) range between 9–65% [8], indicating the importance of
addressing mental health outcomes during pregnancy as well as post-pregnancy in the
region [9].

Some of the well-established risk factors for poor perinatal mental health, partic-
ularly anxiety and depression, are related to gender inequity, especially in LMIC set-
tings. These include partner violence (Intimate partner violence (IPV), Domestic violence
(DV) and Gender-based Violence (GBV)), younger age, poor social support, low educa-
tion and male infant preference [10–12]. Other gender-based risk factors include low

autonomy and decision-making power, lack of control over resources, low education and
poverty [12], power dynamics within family [13], gender-based stigma and discrimina-
tion and inequitable spousal relationships [14,15]. Multiple reviews [16,17] and a recent
report [7] using a decision tree analysis from 48 LMIC countries reported that gender-
related factors play a strong role in perinatal mental health problems such as anxiety and
depression, including in the South Asian context [18].

A few interventions for perinatal health in general that have addressed gender-related
factors and focused on enhancing support systems for pregnant women or addressing
gender inequity in the family have found improvement in rates of postpartum depression as
well [19–21]. When speciﬁcally looking at interventions, literature suggests how addressing
gender gaps with regards to perinatal health programs and policies can be an active agent
of change in addressing low mobility, female genital mutilation, unintended pregnancy
and increased preference for a male child [22].

Yet, different research reviews related to gender-based violence, and family and repro-
ductive health have notably overlooked the practical ways of overcoming gender inequality
to improve perinatal mental health [23]. Gender-based interventions in perinatal health may
be gender intentional, gender accommodative or gender transformative. Gender intentional
means identifying and understanding gender inequalities [24]. Gender-accommodating
interventions seek to compensate for gender norms and ideally decrease existing inequali-
ties; however, they are not aimed at role-reversal or changing gender norms [25]. Gender
transformative interventions, on the other hand, are interventions that create opportunities
for individuals to actively challenge gender norms and address power inequities between
persons of different genders [26]. Principles of Gender Transformative Approach (GTA) go
beyond improving healthcare systems and access for women alone but also include men,
children and other family members to promote better health for communities, as a whole.
However, while risk factors have been studied, gender-accommodative or transformative
interventions have not been designed from a curative or a preventative lens [27]. Fathers
have been involved at best as only one part of an intervention and these too have not
addressed gender transformation [28–30]. Since gender transformative interventions aid in
bridging the gender gap [26,27,31,32], it is necessary to develop interventions for perinatal
mental health with a Gender Transformative (GT) lens, especially in countries with a large
gender equity gap. This is especially true for the more prevalent perinatal mental health
concerns such as depression and anxiety which are driven by a host of psychological and
social risk factors.

Presently, there is meagre evidence based data on perinatal mental health interventions
that are gender-transformative in LMIC countries. To examine available evidence as well
as highlight the various components of the intervention and to encourage research in this
area, this review attempts to (a) review the literature on GT interventions that have been
implemented in LMIC, and have addressed perinatal mental health directly or indirectly,
(b) describe components of these interventions and (c) based on this, provide a framework
of action and recommendations for designing gender transformative intervention for
perinatal mental health care, speciﬁcally for early identiﬁcation and treatment of perinatal
anxiety and depression in the community.

2. Method

This scoping review was conducted by utilising the framework developed by Arksey
and O’ Malley’s [33] that included ﬁve stages, namely (1) identifying the research question
that was broad in nature, (2) identifying relevant studies, a process that remains compre-
hensive and strategic, (3) select studies based on inclusion/exclusion criteria, based on
familiarity with literature, (4) charting data related to key themes and issues and lastly,
(5) collating, reporting and summarising the results which could be descriptive, thematic
and/or numerical in nature [34]. The ﬁndings are reported according to the Preferred
Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Re-

views (PRISMA-ScR) checklist [35]. The sixth stage of a scoping review—stakeholder
consultation—is an optional element and was not included in this review.

2.1. Identifying the Research Question

The research question for this scoping review was “what is known about gender
transformative interventions that address perinatal mental health in Low and Middle
Income Countries?” The speciﬁc research questions for the present reviews were as follows:
(1) What are the objectives and purpose of developing gender transformative interventions
for perinatal mental health in the context of the LMICs? (2) What are the components of
these interventions (3) What are the kinds and contexts of male-involvement/engagement
in these gender-transformative perinatal mental health interventions? and (4) What are the
outcomes for perinatal mental health following these interventions?

2.2. Identifying Relevant studies

The following electronic databases were searched for English language publications
between 2012 and present: PubMed, PsycInfo, Scopus, Web of Science. Journals were
inclusive of Sage Publications, SpringerLink, Taylor and Francis, Wiley Online, and Oxford
University Press. Other databases searched include Google Scholar. The authors also
manually searched the reference lists of included papers, reports and other reviews to
identify further eligible papers or studies.

A comprehensive search using keywords included Gender transformative interven-
tions LMIC; Gender transformative interventions for maternal healthcare; Gender transfor-
mative interventions for perinatal healthcare and Gender transformative interventions for
perinatal and maternal mental health. The speciﬁc search terms for studies included Perina-
tal OR mental health outcomes OR antenatal OR pregnancy OR childbirth OR postpartum
OR postpartum depression OR maternal OR perinatal partner support OR involvement of
fathers OR mental health outcomes OR perinatal IPV OR perinatal GBV [in title, abstract,
keywords] AND male engagement interventions OR family interventions AND LMIC/Low
and Middle income countries (in all).

2.3. Study Selection (Inclusion and Exclusion)

The inclusion and exclusion criteria were developed by the authors and are shown in
Box 1. The search period ranged from studies published between the years of 2012–present.
A longer time period was utilised to map the scope of literature owing to the limited number
of studies that focused on gender transformative interventions that speciﬁcally focused
on maternal or perinatal mental health and wellbeing. Moreover, to ensure a rigorous
search, data from grey literature were also included. A quality assessment of the studies
selected was carried out by two senior researchers (PS, VS). studies that developed gender
transformative interventions inclusive of a component that targeted males or extended
family members’ involvement were reviewed.

Additionally, systematic reviews of interventions that targeted prevention or reduction
of violence against women, girls or mothers were also included in the review. Since maternal
and child’s health and wellbeing are strong predictors of mental health [36,37], psychosocial
interventions that were gender-transformative and addressed maternal health and care
were also included. Inclusion criteria consisted of studies conducted in the LMIC region;
countries belonging to LMIC were classiﬁed according to the Society for the Study of
Human Biology [38]. For the current 2022 ﬁscal year, low-income economies are deﬁned as
those with a GNI per capita, calculated using the World Bank Atlas method, of USD 1045 or
less in 2020 (World Bank Country and Lending Groups, 2020) [36]. The following exclusion
criteria were applied: study location not in LMIC, not relating to perinatal period, not
relating to mental health and not relating to maternal mental health.

2.4. Charting the Data

Data were extracted according to the PRISMA-ScR [37,39] checklist [35]. The primary
objectives, study characteristics (author, year, country/region and outcome measures),
study population, components of interventions, primary outcomes and aspects of male
engagement were tabulated in line with the research questions.

2.5. Reporting the Results

Using a narrative approach, these interventions were critically analysed by VS, AR
and PC and reported in terms of intervention characteristics, risk of bias/methodological
quality, categorisation of outcomes and identiﬁcation of gaps in evidence as previously
noted in scoping reviews that focused on GT interventions [40]. A total of 6 studies were
then ﬁnalised and analysed descriptively to understand GT in perinatal care and GT in the
context of LMIC.

3. Results

From the search process, 16 studies were identiﬁed since they met the inclusion
criteria. However, 10 studies were excluded because 7 studies focused on gender but not
on the gender “transformative” aspect and did not assess mental health outcomes and
3 studies did not assess perinatal mental health conditions. Figure 1 illustrates the PRISMA
ﬂowchart of our search strategy. Table 1 highlights the data summary obtained from the
6 studies and additionally displays the study characteristics, study population, components
of interventions, primary outcomes and aspects of male engagement.

equity (FP + GE) counseling sessions. A desk-sized
CHARM ﬂipchart was used by village health
providers to provide men and couples with pictorial
information on family planning options, barriers to
family planning use including gender
equity-related issues (e.g., son preference), the
importance of healthy and shared family planning
decision-making, and how to engage in respectful
marital communication and interactions (inclusive
of no spousal violence in the men’s sessions).

Primary Outcomes (With Data if Possible)

•

•

Compared to the control group, pregnant women in the
intervention group reported: less past-year physical and
sexual IPV, greater attendance and male accompaniment
at antenatal care (61.17%).
Pregnant women (79.15%) and men (57.71%) in the
intervention group reported: less child physical
punishment.

•

• Women reported greater modern contraceptive use and
less dominance of men in decision-making (56.08%).
However men’s level of participation in childcare
between the intervention group and control group
remained the same.

•

•

The primary outcomes are to engage men for more
gender equality, expecting a positive effect of this
combined intervention on the household economy, on
child nutritional status, on the use of reproductive health
services including family planning, and on reducing
sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV).

3.1. Article Characteristics

The six ﬁnalised studies ranged primarily between 2015–2022, although the study
attempted to include studies over a period of 15 years (refer to Table 1). Only one study
was conducted in 2008 [41]. The results were further indicative of how there were very
few studies that focused on understanding perinatal mental health by implementing gender
transformative interventions. All the six studies included men and women/husbands and
wives. One study focused on women and husbands as well as extended family mem-
bers [41]. All the interventions included a male engagement component in the intervention.
All the interventions were mostly conducted in rural or semi-urban areas.

Most of the identiﬁed studies utilised group discussions as the basis to facilitate critical
dialogue and awareness regarding gender roles and mental health. In the Bandebereho
couples’ intervention, from Rwanda, small groups of critical reﬂection and dialogues
were initiated with couples and men [44]. Similarly, the Counseling Husbands to Achieve
Reproductive Health and Marital Equity (CHARM) intervention implemented in Maha-
rashtra, India, also involved sessions based on gender and culture for individuals to explore
how gender roles inﬂuenced wellbeing for mothers [23]. Two studies in Zimbabwe and
Congo [42,45] addressed how developing positive models of masculinity can decrease
gender disparity by initiating men’s groups and engaging in group discussions. Study
designs ranged from randomised controlled trials [23,42,44,45] to pre and post evaluation
designs [23,44]. In the following sections studies are presented thematically based on their
objectives and primary outcomes. Overall, the studies highlighted the need to address
perinatal mental health concerns through the involvement of other family members or
husbands through a gender-transformative lens.

3.2. Program Evaluation

This section reports practical aspects of the interventions (Table 2) and important
components of GT interventions that were designed, namely, to decrease gender-based
violence, improve maternal mental health, and improve couples’ relationships.

A successful couples’ intervention designed by Doyle et al. [44], implemented in
Rwanda, focused on engaging men and their partners in a participatory group session
consisting of critical reﬂection and dialogue. Addressing power relations in the com-
munity demonstrated substantial improvements with respect to marriages and modern
contraceptive uses. Therefore, while it did not address perinatal healthcare directly, the
couple-focused interventions had longer term implications with respect to perinatal and
maternal mental health [47]. The intervention induced a signiﬁcant positive impact on
maternal health by reducing instances of physical and sexual IPV. It also increased male
accompaniment to antenatal care and decreased dominance of men in decision-making chal-
lenging existing gender norms. Components of intervention involved training community
volunteers (local fathers) to co-facilitate sessions on pregnancy, family planning and marital
communication. Sessions involved ice-breakers, group activities, games and media such as
cartoons and short ﬁlms [48] However, the research was implemented only for 12 months,
leading to an unsustainable effect. This explains why despite greater male involvement,
women’s time spent on labour at home remained the same. Moreover, since behavioural
changes were self-reported there is a risk of participants (both men and women) providing
desirable answers.

A similar and older study from India targeted young married women, their husbands
as well as family members to address and modify gender norms [41]. The study attempted
to address communication and decision-making in the family by empowering women and
creating supportive social structures by providing interventions to husbands and mother-in-
laws through the First Time Parent Project in rural West-Bengal and Gujarat. Components
of intervention included education and counselling sessions for young married women,
training, outreach programs and workshops for husbands and mothers-in-law as well as
developing support groups for women. While the study did not address maternal mental
health directly, it addressed risk factors for poor maternal mental health since primary

outcomes involved decreased gender-based violence and improving support in homecare
practices. The study did not however ensure follow-ups and therefore, the effectiveness of
the intervention remains unclear. The study however provided insightful recommendations
that included allying inﬂuential members of a family within the interventions as well as
creating a support network for different groups of mothers, such as those trying to conceive,
delay the ﬁrst pregnancy and new mothers.

Raj et al. [23] conducted a randomised controlled trial evaluation in India, across
50 geographic clusters in rural Maharashtra, which primarily focused on gender equity
and family planning for men and couples. Based on the baseline scores of contraceptive
behaviours and IPV attitudes, a CHARM intervention, comprising three sessions of family
planning, gender-equity for couples was utilised. Sessions involved discussing gender-
equity through pictorial ﬂipcharts that addressed family planning, barriers to family
planning and respectful marital communication. Results indicated that contraceptive
communication increased and decreased intimate partner violence amongst couples was
reported at an 18-month follow-up. While GT interventions have shown their efﬁcacy
across countries, in LMIC, since resources are low, it is imperative to note that investment
interventions such as home visiting programs need to be maximised to prevent IPV or child
maltreatment [48].

Another intervention that was targeted for women, children and men/fathers/co-
parents in Mutasa district, Zimbabwe, used community-based training and discussion
groups that addressed services for mothers, HIV transmissions and engaging in problem-
solving therapy. Results indicated that addressing gender inequality improved maternal
mental health [46]. The interesting aspect of this program included creating and implement-
ing educational and outreach programs that encouraged “male champions”. Separate tools
were prepared for men and women participants. Interventions for women were delivered
by local female village health workers through Participatory and Learning Action (PLA) cy-
cles. For men, interventions involved male project members discussing gendered-division
of labour, safe sex and men’s contribution in care-seeking behaviour. The intervention
successfully integrated gender equality and male engagement, leading to increased couples
communication, reduced maternal workload and increased nutrition during pregnancy,
another paramount implication included increased value of girl children.

Along the lines of men’s involvement, the study by Bapolisi et al. [45] focused on
investigating the impact of men’s involvement on women’s health and child nutrition.
The primary focus in this study was to engage men for more gender equality, expecting a
positive effect of this combined intervention on the household economy, on child nutritional
status, on the use of reproductive health services including family planning, and on re-
ducing sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV). The intervention in the aforementioned
study involved developing positive masculinity by engaging men using a peer-based
approach. Reﬂective conversations were conducted through Gender-Dialogue Groups
(GDGs) facilitated by both one male and one female, trained as gender-based violence ﬁeld
agent and economic recovery ﬁeld agent. Men were encouraged to adopt attitudes and be-
haviours that promoted women’s economic empowerment as well as reduced gender-based
violence. The study provided insightful implications regarding gender-power dynamics
on both household as well as community levels. It can further be noted that through
participatory interventions, mental health services inclusive of antenatal care, maternity
and family planning can be improved through male-involvement.

A recent study that contributed towards the current limited literature, was Comrie-
Thomson et al.’s [46] trial on implementing a gender-synchronised intervention. Gender-
synchronised interventions are conceptualised as programs that employ multiple strategies
to change community norms related to gender as well as engage men to achieve gender
equality and improve health [49]. As a part of the intervention, women participated
in PLA cycles conducted through monthly one hour group discussions, facilitated by
female village health workers in a central community location. Men, on the other hand,
participated in monthly one-hour group discussions, facilitated by the male project staff
member in men’s workplaces or a central community location. Group discussions rooted in
problem-solving therapy, focused on topics such as home care practices during pregnancy
along with various gender-related challenges women faced. Results indicated that women
reported decreased postnatal depression scores and care-seeking as well as relationships
signiﬁcantly improved.

However, the aforementioned GT interventions particularly focused on prenatal, ma-
ternal care and personal empowerment. Alternatively, it is indicative of how programs
and interventions should focus more intentionally on postnatal mental health care, particu-
larly gender-intentional postpartum family planning interventions to ensure antenatal and
intrapartum care that were earlier provided remained sustainable and effective. By imple-
menting these interventions, it can be inferred that perinatal mental health will signiﬁcantly
improve eventually decreasing mental health concerns such as anxiety and depression.
Possible adverse events that have to be considered includes increased tension in parent
relationships and familial relationships due to changed expectations and behaviours [50].
Therefore, developing GT interventions to explicitly address power dynamics, values and
norms throughout perinatal, prenatal and postnatal maternal health as well as mental
health remain a necessity to improve quality of care sustainably.

4. Discussion

Due to limited studies, the review could not identify major contexts in which GT
interventions were designed. However, it was vastly noted that GT interventions had mul-
tifold implications with respect to improvement on mental health, maternal mental health,
decreased IPV and GBV and improved couples’ relationships and homecare practices. It
was previously noted that gender related factors seem to play a strong role in mental health
problems in pregnancy and the postpartum especially in the LMIC region [51]. Therefore,
this review speciﬁcally identiﬁed key program components that may have contributed to
positive mental health outcomes as well as improvement in social and partner support and
decrease in IPV or DV, factors that have a strong link with depression and anxiety in the
perinatal period.

Similar to previous reviews and studies, the results in the present paper indicate
how main components of interventions to improve maternal mental health consist of
quality time with the infant, group sessions with husbands or family members, counselling
sessions and psychoeducational sessions [2,52]. Interventions are further indicative of
how addressing gender disparities can signiﬁcantly lead to positive outcomes. Moreover,
apart from addressing maternal care speciﬁc to infant care, it also becomes necessary to
address the general wellbeing of mothers through empowering GT interventions. These
results demonstrate how development of gender transformative interventions is necessary
to improve mental health outcomes long term, amongst mothers [53].

In programs that focused on fatherhood, targeting men, fathers and husbands, inter-
ventions mostly focused on educational sessions on gender-roles [44,54] indicating that
addressing gender roles and norms was an important component of GT interventions
as highlighted by studies previously [30,51]. Recent studies have highlighted the neces-
sity of male engagement in maternal and perinatal healthcare [25,44]. Moreover, ﬁndings
accordingly highlighted that GT interventions which focused on fatherhood helped in trans-
forming harmful masculine norms which underpin gender-based violence. While these
interventions aim for men to increase their involvement in their partner’s pregnancies and

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 12357

13 of 16

accompany them to health services, it is necessary to note that increasing male engagement
as a strategy should include ethical considerations to ensure men do not assume the stance
of “protecting” and “looking after” women which in turn can cause power imbalance and
gender disparities.

Furthermore, fatherhood programs when designed from a systemic lens can signif-
icantly support and protect women, families and children from violence. In support, a
systematic review of male engagement in GT interventions for women in the community
highlighted that 11 out of 12 GT interventions revealed a signiﬁcant change in men’s atti-
tudes towards gender norms, establishing gender equality [31]. This is suggestive of the
need to develop and design more GT interventions that focus increasingly on the aspect of
male engagement. However, this study did not focus on women in the perinatal period.

Further, the aforementioned studies do not acknowledge the structural norms that in-
ﬂuence masculinity and how norms related to masculinity are also changing [31]. Moreover,
while the results are indicative of group education, community outreach and mass-media
campaigns are all effective program interventions, none of the studies focus on evaluating
long-term change. It remains unclear how family members, caregivers, and men will
continue to succeed in sustaining their short-term change in the absence of contextual and
structural changes.

To achieve long-term, sustainable change, community-level interventions need to be
accompanied by policies that support the changes men undergo through GT interventions.
Future recommendations for gender transformative interventions include taking a more
relational perspective that attempts to integrate men and boys with efforts to empower
women without adapting the attitude of “saving women and families” since it was noted
that many men engaging in activism for equality or trials that promote equality are not
disconnected from an inherent saviour complex [51].

Studies could also focus on developing strategies that address change at the level of
families and communities leading to sustainable changes through involvement of other
family members, which also result in sustainable and lasting effects. Additionally, fu-
ture studies could focus on programmatic efforts on gender barriers that accompany life
stages, that range from helping newly married couples with no children to delay in their
ﬁrst pregnancy. Developing GT interventions for speciﬁc groups such as those facing peri-
natal loss and adolescent mothers is needed. GT studies need to provide more information
about how men were encouraged to participate in these trials and stay engaged through
the course of multiple sessions, which components were preferred by the groups and
whether the gender of the facilitators made a difference and if groups should be men only
or combined. This information will enable future researchers to help in better planning of
future GT intervention studies for perinatal mental health including deciding the “dose” of
the intervention in addition to the methods.

Moreover, some reports [55,56] focusing on male engagement in perinatal mental
health, from High Income Countries, have used technology such as SMS and other online
tools. Countries in the LMIC region also reported using technology to improve perinatal
mental health [57–59]; however, the interventions did not include a male engagement
component. It is possible that technology-based interventions can increase accessibility as
well as be useful in involving difﬁcult-to-engage men.

5. Limitations

It is necessary to remain cautious while interpreting the ﬁndings of this review because
the evidence is limited due to the small number of studies that were identiﬁed. Moreover,
since the synthesised studies were not methodologically similar, the ﬁndings of the current
review cannot be generalised. Our ﬁndings and recommendations are partially informed
by the studies and their limitations, also accounted for, in our analysis. Moreover, given
the sensitivity and stigmatised nature of these issues, consideration must be given to the
presence of social desirability bias which may have inﬂuenced disclosure and involvement
of participants in the programs. Future research may examine the dose or the optimum

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 12357

length of the intervention itself and on whether treatment gains are maintained over longer
follow-up periods.

6. Conclusions

Our review has highlighted a need for GT interventions that focus on male engagement,
family members and community as a whole. Our review also highlights the methodological
strengths and deﬁcits in existing interventions, paving the way for future research to
address these limitations and mindfully develop programs that yield effective maternal
health outcomes. Lastly, by emphasising programs implemented in the LMIC region, our
review addresses the need to develop shared goals that address gender-based violence,
cultural norms and family dynamics since perinatal and maternal mental health outcomes
cannot be improved in isolation.
