Abstract
Purpose of Review  Women are twice as likely to develop post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) compared to men after a trau-
matic experience. The purpose of this mini review was to explore recent research on biological contributors to this sex difference.
Recent Findings  We identified 51 studies published since 2019. Studies found that beyond the influence of sex on the 
prevalence and symptoms of PTSD, there is evidence for and against sex-based differences in genetic and epigenetic factors 
(n = 8), brain structure and function (n = 11), neuroendocrine and inflammatory responses (n = 5), and in the role of sleep on 
emotional memory processing (n = 1). Sex differences were also observed in recovery and during PTSD treatment (n = 16). 
Finally, there is emerging evidence of sex-differentiated risk for medical and psychiatric comorbidities in PTSD (n = 10).
Summary  Rapid advances are being made using integrated multidisciplinary approaches to understand why females are at 
a heightened risk for developing PTSD.

Introduction

Biological sex influences risk of post-traumatic stress disor-
der (PTSD) following trauma exposure through potentially 
complex and varied biological and non-biological (e.g. psy-
chosocial and environmental) mechanisms. PTSD is two 
to three times more common in women than in men [1, 2]. 
This sex bias likely emerges in adolescence [3, 4] and is 
attenuated in older age [5]. As well as differing prevalence 
rates, men and women also differ in the types of symptoms 
reported, with women reporting higher levels of intrusive

and avoidance symptoms compared to men [6]. Historically, 
hormonal factors have been emphasised as one of the most 
potent putative mechanisms for the sex differentiation in 
PTSD. However, the last decade has seen a rapid increase 
in our understanding of possible sex differences in genetic 
susceptibility and resilience to development of PTSD after 
trauma [7••]. Over the past 3 years, there has also been 
increasing research attention on a range of other biological 
contributory factors and new evidence has emerged in rela-
tion to sex differences in treatment response to and recovery 
from PTSD. We synthesise the state of this evidence in this 
mini review focusing on the evidence for sex differences in 
(1) genetic and epigenetic factors; (2) other biological factors 
including (i) brain structure and function, (ii) immunologi-
cal, neuroendocrine, and neuropeptide responses, and (iii) the 
role of sleep; (3) rates of recovery and response to treatment; 
and (4) medical and psychiatric comorbidities, in PTSD.

Methods

Database  searches  were  conducted  in  PubMed  and 
PsychINFO  for  peer-reviewed  journal  articles  examin-
ing potential contributors to variance in PTSD, focusing 
specifically on biological sex-based influences. Search

terms included “PTSD” OR “posttraumatic stress disor-
der” AND “sex” OR “sex characteristics” OR “sex differ-
ences”. Studies focusing on gender roles or non-biological 
contributors to PTSD were not included, as this area has 
been recently covered elsewhere [8]. Studies also needed 
to have included both a biological male and female group; 
non-binary subjects were not included. Filters included 
“Humans” and searches were carried out from 2019 to 
December 2022. A total of 1533 articles were identified 
which were then screened for eligibility though title or 
abstract screening. The majority of articles were excluded 
at this stage (n = 1418). Only articles including human sub-
jects (> 18 years) exposed to trauma and that examined the 
effects of sex related influences on PTSD were included. 
Of the remaining 115 articles, a further 64 were excluded 
after  reading  the  full  text,  including  review  article(s), 
preclinical animal models of PTSD, non-biological con-
tributors to PTSD (i.e. the role of gender); prevalence and 
symptoms of PTSD, or studies of children/adolescents. An 
overview of the 51 included studies is presented in Table 1 
with specific studies highlighted in the sections that follow.

Genetic and Epigenetic Factors

Eight studies were identified with relevant genomic evi-
dence. In the largest sex-stratified genetic study of PTSD 
to date, a genome wide association study (GWAS) of a 
multi-ethnic cohort (~ 30,000 PTSD cases and 170,000 
controls)  found  significant  single  nucleotide  polymor-
phism (SNP) heritability of PTSD in females, (h2
SNP = 0.
10, P = 8.03 ×  10−11), while male heritability was not dif-
ferent from zero (h2
SNP = 0.01, P = 0.63) [9]. However, sex 
differences in heritability differed among subsets of data, 
which were attributed to diverse populations with differing 
traumatic experiences. For example, a higher prevalence of 
combat trauma among males versus females may explain 
the observed lower heritability estimates in males overall. 
Additionally, sex differences in specific risk loci were iden-
tified, with an additional three independent genome-wide 
significant loci found in men, but not women.

Genome wide gene-by-environment interaction stud-
ies (GEWIS) take a hypothesis-free approach to assessing 
genetic interactions with environmental variables. Leverag-
ing data from the UK Biobank cohort, one study conducted 
a multivariate GEWIS of suicidality [10]. Sex-stratified 
GWEIS identified one independent suicidality risk loci in 
females and three in males. All risk loci showed robust 
evidence for interaction with a PTSD diagnosis or a PTSD 
risk score across sexes. Additional driving environments 
differed between females and males, with female risk loci 

interacting with post-traumatic stress symptoms and male 
risk loci interacting with physically violent trauma.

Large scale transcriptomic approaches can be utilised to 
explore mechanisms through which genetic variants may 
exert effects. A study of post-mortem tissue from 143 indi-
viduals with PTSD compared to age and sex matched con-
trols applied differential gene expression and network analy-
sis of four prefrontal cortex subregions [11]. Sex-specific 
transcriptomic signatures were identified across all regions 
of the prefrontal cortex, and females with PTSD showed 
more differentially expressed genes relative to controls (69 
modules) than their male counterparts (59 modules). In addi-
tion, GABAergic signalling genes including ELFN1, SST, 
and PNOC were significantly downregulated in females, 
but not males. In a second study of this sample, the authors 
conducted exploratory co-expression network analysis to 
assess PTSD-specific neuropeptide signalling pathways. A 
total of three PTSD-associated networks contained neuro-
peptide related genes: two in females only and one within 
the full sample [12].

We  found  two  small  studies  examining  sex-specific 
epigenetic modifications in PTSD. First, a candidate gene 
methylation study examined oxytocin receptor gene (OXTR) 
methylation levels in police officers with (n = 31) and with-
out PTSD (n = 36) [13]. Evidence was found for elevated 
OXTR DNA-methylation in females with PTSD, suggest-
ing  decreased  central  and  peripheral  oxytocin  function-
ing, whereas PTSD-status was not associated with DNA-
methylation in males. Additionally, increased methylation 
observed in PTSD females was predictive of higher symp-
toms  of  anhedonia  and  amygdala  reactivity  in  response 
to emotional faces, but these associations did not survive 
correction for multiple testing. Second, a study combining 
two civilian cohorts (n = 483, including 277 with lifetime 
PTSD) harnessed methylomic profiles from peripheral blood 
to differences in leukocyte composition (i.e. proportions of 
peripheral immune cell subtypes) in association with PTSD 
[14•]. Higher monocyte proportions were observed in males 
in association with lifetime PTSD, independent of current 
PTSD status, suggesting a trait like alteration. This effect 
was not observed in females, and PTSD was unrelated to 
other leukocyte proportions. Further research on methyl-
omic profiles in women and men with PTSD will shed light 
on  sex  differences  in  peripheral  immune-neuroimmune 
mechanisms.

The role of genetics in wider PTSD linked outcomes has 
also been explored. Transcriptome-wide association studies 
(TWAS) detect genes in which cis-regulated expression is 
associated with a trait of interest and explore the mecha-
nisms by which risk variants exert effects. One recent PTSD 
TWAS used brain and non-brain transcriptomic imputation 
to impute genetically regulated gene expression using data 
from  70  ancestry-specific  cohorts  (29,539  PTSD  cases,

166,145 controls) [15]. Two study-wide PTSD associations 
were identified, both of which were stronger in males than 
females.  This  included  downregulation  of SNRNP35  in 
the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in European cohorts and 
upregulation of ZNF140 in whole blood in European mili-
tary cohorts.

Finally, Muniz Carvalho et al. [16] combined GWAS 
summary statistics from large cohorts of European and Afri-
can ancestry to estimate sex-specific genetic correlation of 
PTSD with multiple indices of body size and composition 
[16]. Causal inference methods were then applied to sig-
nificant genetic overlaps to test for putative causal effects. 
Evidence was found for sex-specific causal networks that 
linked anthropometric traits to PTSD, and in general these 
effects were found to be stronger in females than males. In 
the European female sample, fourteen anthropometric traits 
(including those related to BMI and adiposity measures) 
were found to have a putative causal effect on PTSD. In 
contrast, no evidence of causality for anthropometric traits 
on PTSD was found in the European male sample.

To conclude, there are multiple lines of emerging evi-
dence for sexual dimorphism in the genetic architecture 
of risk and resilience to PTSD. To date, studies have been 
relatively underpowered, and it is likely additional sex spe-
cific risk loci will be identified as sample sizes for GWAS 
increase. Currently there is limited evidence regarding epi-
genetic modifications between sexes in PTSD, and the ini-
tiation of large-scale epigenome-wide association studies is 
warranted.

Other Biological Factors

Brain Structure and Function

PTSD is often associated with anatomical and functional 
alterations in three main areas involved in threat neurocir-
cuitry — the amygdala, hippocampus, and the anterior cin-
gulate cortex (ACC), including longitudinal prediction of 
PTSD by lower hippocampal [17] and ACC volumes [18] 
measured shortly following trauma. We identified eleven 
recent neuroimaging studies that have examined sex differ-
ences in brain structure and function due to PTSD.

A single recent longitudinal study examined PTSD risk 
based  on  brain  structure  in  females versus  males  (total 
n = 94) [19 •]. Intriguingly, results indicated that greater 
right rostral ACC thickness 1-month post-trauma predicted 
PTSD symptom severity at 6 months in females, an effect 
not found in males. This effect was attenuated but still sig-
nificant when adjusting for PTSD symptoms at the time of 
scan, trauma type, and exposure to prior traumatic events. 
Follow-up  analyses  showed  that  right  rostral  ACC  was

positively correlated with avoidance symptoms in females 
(r(27) = 0.37, p = 0.04) but not males (r(44) = 0.04, p = 0.79).
Two cross-sectional studies examined sex differences in 
cortical thickness in relation to PTSD. First, in a large mul-
ticentre study from the ENIGMA-PGC PTSD Consortium 
(total n = 3397), no PTSD diagnosis x sex interactions were 
detected in relation to cortical thickness [20]. In a follow-
up study by the same group, it was suggested that it may be 
important to examine cortical regions within the context of 
structural networks and that cortical regions are affected, 
albeit not significantly, in a coordinated manner by PTSD. 
Females with PTSD had a greater mean structural covari-
ance in cortical thickness based atrophic networks, indicat-
ing that regions most affected by PTSD are modified in a 
systematic way in females only [21].

Structural MRI in combination with machine learning 
was used to examine the possible effect of PTSD on brain  
predicted age difference (brain PAD; brain age − chronological  
age) [22]. Analysis of data from the ENIGMA-PGC PTSD 
Consortium  (n = 2229;  aged  18–69  years)  revealed  that 
males, but not females, with PTSD exhibited higher brain 
PAD,  indicative  of  accelerated  brain  aging.  However, 
this effect was further qualified by age, with PTSD being 
associated with higher brain-PAD relative to controls in 
younger males. Among older males, control versus PTSD 
status was unexpectedly associated with relatively higher 
brain aging. Given evidence that PTSD is associated with 
reduced lifespan [23], such observations warrant further  
examination.

Sex-based alterations in white matter (WM) organization 
have also been examined in relation to PTSD, but studies 
have been limited and have been inconclusive. However, two 
recent studies are consistent in reporting no sex differences 
in white matter tracts due to PTSD. In a recent large multi-
cohort analysis of >3000 individuals, no sex effects were 
found on diffusion metrics of fibre tracts in PTSD patients, 
with disrupted WM organisation observed in the tapetum 
region of the corpus callosum among patients overall [24]. 
Similarly, another recent study which used a tract-profile 
quantification machine learning approach to evaluate WM 
microstructure also found no sex-based effect on diffusion 
metrics between non-comorbid patients with PTSD (n = 77) 
and trauma-exposed non-PTSD controls (n = 76) [25].

Since disruption of glutamatergic synaptic strength may 
be a neuroimaging marker of PTSD severity, one small study 
utilised [1 13C]-acetate magnetic resonance spectroscopy 
(MRS) to examine glutamatergic synaptic strength (meas-
ured as the energy-per-cycle [EPC]) in the prefrontal cortex 
(n = 34) [26]. Patients with PTSD were found to have 28% 
reduction in prefrontal EPC relative to controls, indicating 
reduced prefrontal neurotransmission; however, no signifi-
cant sex effects were detected.

Three studies used functional MRI to investigate sex-
based differences in PTSD in brain network topological 
architecture [27] and resting-state functional connectivity 
(FC) of the hippocampal subfields [28] and amygdala sub-
nuclei [29]. In the first study, comparing Chinese parents 
with PTSD following the loss of an only child (n = 51) to 
similarly bereaved parents with no PTSD (NPTSD, n = 93) 
and non-bereaved controls (n = 50), a PTSD x sex interac-
tion was observed in the nodal centralities (efficiency and 
degree) of the right parahippocampus [27]. Using a graph-
theory based approach, regional activation was lower in male 
PTSD parents, compared with NPTSD parents, but higher 
in female PTSD parents than in female NPTSD parents. The  
increase  of  nodal  centralities  in  the  parahippocampus 
in PTSD females may promote fear conditioning in non- 
threatening  contexts  while  interfering  with  normal  fear 
extinction processes, although additional studies are needed 
to test this hypothesis. In a follow-up study of the same cohort 
(total n = 135), lost only-child without PTSD female partici-
pants also displayed lower right hippocampal CA3 subfield 
and thalamus functional connectivity (RCA3-RT FC) relative 
to female patients with PTSD [28]. This implies that lower FC 
may be a protective factor among women who have lost their 
only child, as they do not go onto develop PTSD. The same 
effect was not found in men. In the third smaller study of US 
veterans (n = 38), sex differences were observed in basolat-
eral amygdala (BLA) resting state connectivity, which were 
associated with self-report scores of depression, anxiety, and 
aggression [29]. However, conclusions with respect to PTSD 
are substantially limited by the fact that all participants had 
comorbid PTSD/MDD.

Finally, the effects of intranasal oxytocin — a potential 
treatment target for PTSD — were examined in one study to 
measure changes in brain connectivity in response to implic-
itly presented facial affect cues in individuals with and with-
out PTSD (total n = 34) [30]. Although some evidence was 
found of sex differences in neural responses to oxytocin, 
these were unrelated to PTSD status.

In sum, neuroimaging studies of PTSD have been rela-
tively  small,  particularly  in  examining  neurobiological 
predictors for identification of individuals at future risk of 
PTSD. Due to the nature of trauma research, and without 
scans collected pre-trauma, it is also difficult to determine 
causal influences. Large multi-study findings have begun 
to reveal some null-findings regarding sex-effects, particu-
larly in differences in brain structure, but the application 
of other sensitive techniques to assess tissue microstructure 
should be considered. More consistent effects have emerged 
with regards to sex differences in functional connectivity and 
which are often further associated with PTSD symptoms. 
Further study is needed to examine how neurotransmitter 
systems contribute to sex differences in stress reactivity.

Immunological, Neuroendocrine, and Neuropeptide 
Responses

Early-after-trauma  immunological  and  neuroendocrine 
changes have been examined as putative biomarkers of the 
development of PTSD [31]. Five studies were identified 
which examined sex-related immunological and neuroen-
docrine responses.

In a prospective study of trauma survivors recruited from 
an emergency department (n = 376), immediate inflamma-
tory responses were a significant mediator in the relationship 
between sex and probability of showing a “non-remitting” 
PTSD  trajectory  over  12  months  [32•].  Specifically,  an 
indirect pathway from sex to PTSD was identified, whereby 
men who had higher inflammatory cytokine levels ~ 3 h 
after trauma (i.e. greater inflammation) had a lower risk of 
developing PTSD symptoms over time. In post hoc analyses, 
this indirect effect was contingent upon oestradiol concen-
trations, a sex steroid known to impact pro-inflammatory 
cytokines, with higher levels of oestradiol being protective 
against the probability of developing PTSD in men. In the 
same sample, oestradiol, testosterone, and cortisol concen-
tration did not predict non-remitting PTSD risk in either sex, 
while progesterone predicted probability of developing non-
remitting PTSD in men only. The number of participants 
with non-remitting PTSD in the sample was small, meaning 
replication of these observations is desirable.

The second study accounted for circadian profiles whilst 
examining PTSD in relation to inflammation, given that 
sleep disturbances and cytokine elevations are linked [33]. 
Overnight levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including 
interleukin—6 (IL-6) and tumour necrosis factor- α (TNF-α), 
were measured in patients with chronic PTSD (n = 44) and 
matched controls (n = 49) while recording sleep polysomnog-
raphy (PSG). Surprisingly, cytokine levels were not higher 
in those with PTSD at any single time point. However, over-
night TNF-α trajectories differed by sex, such that TNF-α 
peaked in men with PTSD, but not women with PTSD, at 
the end of the sleep cycle, suggesting sex differences in 
the time course of pro-inflammatory overnight activity in 
PTSD. Given that the sample consisted of physically healthy, 
younger adults with less severe PTSD symptoms, replication 
in a more generalizable sample is warranted.

Fear conditioning and fear extinction are strongly regu-
lated by circulating reproductive hormones (e.g. oestrogen). 
The third study examined the effect of sex, PTSD severity, 
and commonly used hormonal contraceptives (HC) on these 
processes, in trauma-exposed men and women with and 
without full or partial PTSD (total n = 81). Women on syn-
thetic oestradiol in the form of HC demonstrated enhanced 
acquisition of fear conditioning and enhanced extinction of 
fear as compared with women not on HC and men [34]. 
No  PTSD  effects  were  identified.  Nevertheless,  as  fear 

extinction is a foundational mechanism of exposure-based 
treatment for PTSD, these findings have potential implica-
tions for the treatment of PTSD in women with low circulat-
ing oestradiol levels.

Finally, the functioning of the HPA axis and hypotha-
lamic neuropeptides (e.g. neuropeptide Y and oxytocin) has 
been examined in two recent studies. First, lower oxytocin 
levels were found in PTSD patients (n = 26) relative to con-
trols (n = 26), with no sex differences reported in this small 
study [35]. Second, while a strong association was found 
between female sex and higher NPY levels, sex specific 
NPY differences in individuals with PTSD have not yet been 
established [36].

Role of Sleep

Sleep disruption in PTSD has been documented in previous 
studies to differ by sex, with greater rapid eye movement 
sleep (REM) displayed in women with PTSD compared 
to controls [37, 38]. However, the mechanisms underlying 
these sex differences are poorly understood.

A single recent study was identified which examined 
the role of sex in relation to the sleep-emotion processing 
relationship [39]. Using a fear-potentiated startle and nap 
sleep protocol in trauma-exposed participants with varying 
PTSD severity (total n = 46), higher safety learning predicted 
increased REMS and increased REMS predicted more rapid 
extinction learning overall. However, the safety signal learn-
ing effect on subsequent REM was explained by a robust 
effect in males only. Given that REM sleep predicted greater 
extinction learning and is critical for sleep-dependent emo-
tional information processing suggests that males may ben-
efit from the increased REM response, but females do not. 
However, the potential for type 1 and type II errors should 
be considered given the sample size for considering interac-
tion effects.

Rates of Recovery and Response 
to Treatment

Sixteen recent studies have examined sex differences in 
recovery, both observationally and in the course of treat-
ment for PTSD.

Four  studies  examined  sex  differences  in  the  natural 
recovery of symptoms. In their meta-analysis of longitudinal 
observational studies including 16,484 adults, Diamond and 
Airdrie [40•] identified female sex as being associated with 
higher initial levels of PTSD following trauma, but also with 
stronger recovery in the first 6 months. Sex explained 36.8% 
of the variance in PTSD prevalence change between 1 and 
6 months, with this effect being attenuated but still observ-
able when adjusting for initial symptom levels. Consistent 

1 3Current Psychiatry Reports (2023) 25:233–245 

241

with these observations, a latent class analysis of emergency 
department patients (n = 554) identified resilient, recovery, 
chronic symptoms and delayed onset PTSD trajectories over 
a 12-month follow-up period, with the recovering trajectory 
being more prevalent among women and delayed onset of 
PTSD being more prevalent in men [41].

Two of these studies have examined PTSD recovery in 
more chronic populations. First, a cross-sectional analysis of 
adults with lifetime PTSD from a nationally representative 
US survey (n = 1997) found extremely similar rates of remis-
sion based on the absence of past-year diagnosis for women 
(25.3%) and men (24.3%) [42]. Duration of PTSD could not 
be established in this dataset. Second, a study of US veterans 
used an accelerated longitudinal design using 5-year follow-
up coupled with reported time since index trauma to estimate 
recovery trajectories across a 20-year window [43]. There 
was no evidence of sex differences in either overall PTSD 
prevalence or recovery trajectories. The study oversampled 
for veterans with a PTSD diagnosis (75% of sample), which 
likely captured a relatively chronic sample and may have 
diminished capacity to capture sex differences.

Sex differences in response to interventions were also 
reported in four studies. In the first study of 10,234 US vet-
erans, compared to men, women had a greater likelihood 
of clinically meaningful improvement with fewer sessions 
of prolonged exposure (PE) although the effect was small 
(HR: 1.13; 95% CI: 1.02–1.25) [44]. Median number of PE 
sessions received in this study was 2, with 40.5% showing 
clinically meaningful improvement. The second study of US 
veterans focused on those receiving at least 8 sessions of 
cognitive processing therapy (CPT) or PE (n = 9711). Here, 
adjusted analyses found a 4.4% greater decrease in wom-
en’s symptom scores compared to men for CPT only (mean 
symptom reduction across treatments approximately 17%) 
[45•]. A third US veteran study examined intensive treat-
ments for PTSD, including inpatient, day hospital, and resi-
dential programs, with a mean length of stay of 42 days. 
Analysis of data for 3370 veterans found greater symptom 
reduction in females versus males although the effect size 
was small (Cohen’s d = − 0.29) [46]. Finally, in a study of 
948 patients diagnosed with PTSD following mixed trau-
mas, female sex was associated with greater response to care 
received in Danish public outpatient clinics [47]. Care pack-
ages could vary in terms of the type of psychotherapy pro-
vided, the level of training of the provider, and the delivery 
mode, and the outcomes in the study must be considered in 
the context of low rates of PTSD remission overall (18.8%).
Additional evidence suggests that considering wider thera-
peutic outcomes may be important during the course of treat-
ment. Glassman and colleagues examined change in quality 
of life (QOL) following cognitive processing therapy in two 
randomized controlled trials with all female (n = 126) and 
all male (n = 125) participants [48]. In the female sample, 

reductions in depressive symptoms were strongly associated 
with QOL improvements [B = − 1.15 (95% CI: − 1.71, − 0.60), 
whereas reductions in trait anger predicted increased QOL in 
males [B = − 0.55 (95% CI: − 0.90, − 0.19)] (reductions in 
PTSD were not associated with QOL change in either sex). 
Although these findings highlight potentially important clini-
cal targets for PTSD interventions that differ by sex, conclu-
sions are limited by the fact that the male sample comprised 
of veterans, whereas veterans formed a minority of female 
participants.

Three  studies  have  examined  the  effect  of  biological 
intervention in recovery by sex. One record-based review 
found  no  evidence  of  sex  effects  in  symptom  reduction 
among 6879 US veterans following an adequate course of 
medication  [49].  However,  mean  reduction  in  symptom 
scores in this population was modest (approximately 10%). 
By contrast, a multi-country study of 390 adults with PTSD 
to mixed traumas found both robust symptom reductions 
over a 12-week course of paroxetine or sertraline (mean 
symptom score decline of 48%, 58.5% responders) and evi-
dence of sex differences in recovery, with females showing 
stronger recovery than males [50]. Finally, an analysis of a 
mixed trauma population (total n = 327) treated with stellate 
ganglion blockage (i.e. using local anaesthetic proximal to 
the stellate ganglion to achieve inhibition of sympathetic 
activity to the brain) found no evidence of sex differences in 
response, with 69.7% of patients achieving at least a 20 point 
symptom reduction on the PTSD Checklist overall [51].

A  final  area  of  investigation  in  terms  of  treatment 
approaches has been to consider sex differences in engage-
ment and provision, with four studies identified. In 7218 US 
veterans with PTSD, females were more likely than males to 
initiate individual psychotherapy within 6-months of diagno-
sis (52.3% versus 40.1% of men; OR 1.37) and more likely 
to complete an adequate course (17.7% versus 10.8%; OR 
1.41) [52]. Notably, the sex difference in initiation of treat-
ment was evident at older but not younger ages. In addition, 
a longitudinal study of 1200 US veterans (704 women; three 
assessments conducted across 8 months) found that females 
had higher PTSD symptoms and also higher levels of men-
tal health service use than males (34.5% for female versus 
27.6% for male veterans). Moreover, both sexes reported 
poorer intimate relationship functioning in association with 
higher PTSD symptoms, but poorer relationship functioning 
at T2 provided an indirect pathway from T1 symptoms to T3 
treatment access in males only [53].

Conflicting findings have also been reported. A study 
of 95 veterans and first responders found that females were 
more likely to drop out of a residential treatment for PTSD 
(r = 0.270; overall dropout rate 59%). The number of females 
in this sample was small (n = 13) [54]. Finally, an analysis of 
prescribing patterns for 877,785 US veterans receiving treat-
ment for PTSD in 2019 (13.5% women) found that women 

1 3242 

Current Psychiatry Reports (2023) 25:233–245

were slightly more likely than men to receive antidepressants 
recommended for PTSD (adjusted OR = 1.07), but were also 
more likely to receive medications recommended against use 
for PTSD, including benzodiazepines (adjusted OR = 1.62), 
anticonvulsants (aOR = 1.41), and antidepressants recom-
mended against use for PTSD (adjusted OR = 1.26), in analy-
ses adjusted for comorbidities and other confounders [55•].
In sum, recent studies of recovery from PTSD provide 
relatively robust evidence of stronger female versus male 
recovery in the first 1–2 years post-trauma, but not over 
longer timescales. We found consistent evidence of greater 
PTSD symptom reduction in women versus men with PTSD 
following psychotherapy for PTSD, even accounting for fac-
tors such as baseline severity. Where reported, effect sizes 
for sex were small, and the majority of treatment outcome 
studies examining sex differences have been conducted in 
veteran samples, with a dearth of data in civilian samples. 
By contrast, limited evidence was found for sex differences 
in responses to biological interventions. There was some 
evidence of greater female engagement with treatment but 
findings here were mixed.

Medical and Psychiatric Comorbidities

PTSD  is  associated  with  non-communicable  diseases, 
including cardiovascular disease (CVD), type-2 diabetes [56, 
57], and dementia [58••]. Recent evidence from 10 studies 
provide insight into possible sex differences underpinning 
these associations.

In a 13-year prospective study of nearly 1 million young-
and middle-aged US veterans, PTSD was a stronger risk 
factor for ischemic stroke in men relative to women [59] 
even when adjusting for established stroke risk factors, psy-
chiatric comorbidities, and healthcare utilisation (adjusted 
HR: 0.63; 95% CI, 0.47–0.86). Three studies have directly 
assessed the mechanisms by which PTSD may interact with 
sex in CVD risk. In a prospective study, sex differences in 
multiple domains of autonomic functioning were reported 
in a recently traumatised sample (total n = 192) [60]. Two 
weeks post-trauma, men were more likely to meet the crite-
ria for hypertension (45% versus 21%) compared to women, 
reflected by higher systolic, but not diastolic, BP. In addi-
tion, during the extinction phase of a fear conditioning para-
digm, HR was significantly higher in women with PTSD 
(M = 78.5) compared to men with PTSD (M = 67.7), whereas 
high frequency heart rate variability was significantly lower 
in women with PTSD (M = 5.41) compared to men with 
PTSD (M = 6.49), indicating lower parasympathetic control 
in women during fear learning. In contrast, a cross-sectional 
study of nearly 3000 trauma-exposed men and women [61] 
reported that men with PTSD had a lower risk of hyper-
tension  when  measuring  each  component  of  metabolic 

syndrome, which survived adjustment for additional factors 
such as cancer, angina, stroke, and thyroid disease (adjusted 
OR = 0.54, 95% CI = 0.31–0.92). For women, PTSD was 
associated  with  metabolic  syndrome  overall  (adjusted 
OR = 1.53, 95% CI = 1.01–1.95) and the prevalence of the 
high-density lipoprotein cholesterol component (adjusted 
OR = 1.98, 95% CI = 1.04–2.12), indicating that the rela-
tionship between PTSD and metabolic syndrome may be 
confined to women. Finally, a small cross-sectional study 
(n = 61) found sex differences in the association between 
subclinical PTSD symptoms and subclinical atherosclerosis 
in young adults [62]. In men, PTSD symptom severity was 
associated with increased aortic stiffness, indicative of vas-
cular damage which may contribute to the increased risk of 
CVD. In contrast, women with greater symptoms were more 
likely to have peripheral vasomotor dysfunction, which can 
contribute to conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, and 
hypercholesterolemia [63].

In the first meta-analysis of global longitudinal evidence 
on  PTSD  and  dementia  risk  (k = 8,  n = 1,693,678),  the 
authors found that people with PTSD had a 61% increased 
risk of developing all-cause dementia [58••]. This risk was 
higher in studies that included ≥ 50% females (pooled haz-
ard ratio [HR] = 1.97, 95% CI 1.25–3.11) compared with 
studies with < 50% female participants (pooled HR = 1.62, 
95% CI 1.43–1.85). In addition, a population-based cohort 
study based in Israel examined sex differences in Parkin-
son’s  disease  (PD)  risk  in  patients  with  (n = 8336)  and 
without (n = 8336) PTSD [64]. Overall, patients with PTSD 
had a 48% increased risk for developing PD (adjusted HR 
1.48 [95% CI, 1.10–1.99]). Sex and age stratified analysis 
indicated that the risk of developing PD is greater in male 
patients who received a diagnosis of PTSD at the age of 
72 years or older (adjusted HR 1.95 [95% CI, 1.16–3.28]).

Given observations that PTSD is associated with immune 
dysregulation and inflammation, it is unsurprising that a 
bidirectional  relationship  with  infectious  disease  has 
also been reported. In a longitudinal nationwide cohort 
study of all residents of Denmark diagnosed with PTSD 
between  1995  and  2011  (n = ~ 30,000),  the  association 
between PTSD and some infections (e.g. urinary tract and 
viral infections) was found to be stronger among women, 
whereas  other  associations  were  stronger  among  men 
(e.g. skin infections) [65].

Three studies have also provided sex-specific differ-
ences in psychological comorbidities in association with 
PTSD. In a subsample of 9447 US service members with 
PTSD,  83%  of  individuals  with  PTSD  had  at  least  one 
comorbid condition [66]. Women with PTSD were more 
likely to have depressive, generalised, or other anxiety dis-
orders, with largest effect sizes for eating (OR: 12.6, 95% 
CI 7.9–20.1) and personality disorders (OR: 3.0, 95% CI 
2.6–3.4). In contrast, men with PTSD were more likely to 

1 3Current Psychiatry Reports (2023) 25:233–245 

243

have a diagnosis of PTSD with comorbid alcohol and drug 
use disorders, with traumatic brain injury almost six times 
more prevalent and insomnia over twice as common in men 
compared to women. Given that sleep disturbances have 
a more prominent effect on suicidal ideation in men with 
PTSD compared to women (total n = 822 inpatients) sug-
gests that it may be especially important for men to undergo 
empirically supported treatments for insomnia [67]. Finally, 
a longitudinal study of US veterans (n = 1243) found evi-
dence that PTSD symptoms predicted future illicit drug use 
problems among men, whereas drug use problems predicted 
future PTSD symptom severity among women [68]. Thus, it 
was concluded PTSD severity should be monitored as a risk 
factor for future drug use in men, whereas women’s drug 
use should be monitored as a particular risk factor for the 
increasing severity of PTSD symptoms.

Overall, these studies present a complex picture of pos-
sible sex-specific effects in the PTSD-disease pathway. Men 
appear to have heightened risk for cardiovascular disease 
possibly through PTSD-related changes to blood pressure, 
whereas women may be more at risk for dementia and met-
abolic syndrome. Further exploration that includes poten-
tial differential biological and behavioural (e.g. health risk 
behaviours) pathways is warranted.

Conclusions

Various sex-related biological factors contribute to the differ-
ences in PTSD risk, clinical presentation, comorbidity, treat-
ment response, and retention in care. Over the last 3 years, 
evidence has emerged on specific biological mechanisms 
that may be driving sex-related patterns in individuals with 
PTSD. The majority of studies identified in this review, how-
ever, were conducted in high-income countries; biological 
contributors and consequences of adult PTSD will addition-
ally need to be examined in low-to-middle income country 
settings [69]. Few studies have also been primarily designed, 
and statistically powered, to investigate sex differences in 
PTSD. Future studies should adopt an integrated, multi-level 
biological system approach to investigate the association of 
epigenetic, genetic, and gene expression signatures in PTSD 
(e.g. genes underpinning hypocortisolaemia in PTSD), bio-
chemical assays of circulating sex hormones and other HPA 
axis markers, coupled with assessments of clinical presenta-
tion, course, and treatment response and recovery in females 
and males. This will be the next step in parsing out func-
tional mechanisms that could represent sex-selective targets 
for therapeutic interventions in PTSD.
