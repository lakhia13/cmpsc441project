ABSTRACT
Introduction  Chronic pain (CP) is one of the most 
frequently presenting conditions in health care and 
many patients with CP report mental fatigue and 
a decline in cognitive functioning. However, the 
underlying mechanisms are still unknown.
Methods and analysis  This study protocol describes 
a cross- sectional study aimed at investigating the 
presence of self- rated mental fatigue, objectively 
measured cognitive fatigability and executive functions 
and their relation to other cognitive functions, 
inflammatory biomarkers and brain connectivity in 
patients with CP. We will control for pain- related factors 
such as pain intensity and secondary factors such as 
sleep disturbances and psychological well- being. Two 
hundred patients 18–50 years with CP will be recruited 
for a neuropsychological investigation at two outpatient 
study centres in Sweden. The patients are compared 
with 36 healthy controls. Of these, 36 patients and 36 
controls will undergo blood sampling for inflammatory 
markers, and of these, 24 female patients and 22 
female controls, between 18 and 45 years, will undergo 
an functional MRI investigation. Primary outcomes are 
cognitive fatigability, executive inhibition, imaging and 
inflammatory markers. Secondary outcomes include 
self- rated fatigue, verbal fluency and working memory. 
The study provides an approach to study fatigue and 
cognitive functions in CP with objective measurements 
and may demonstrate new models of fatigue and 
cognition in CP.
Ethics and dissemination  The study has been 
approved by the Swedish Ethics Review Board (Dnr 
2018/424- 31; 2018/1235–32; 2018/2395–32; 2019–
66148; 2022- 02838- 02). All patients gave written 
informed consent to participate in the study. The study 
findings will be disseminated through publications 
in journals within the fields of pain, neuropsychology 
and rehabilitation. Results will be spread at relevant 
national and international conferences, meetings and 
expert forums. The results will be shared with user 
organisations and their members as well as relevant 
policymakers.

STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS OF THIS STUDY
 ⇒ A large cross- sectional multicentre study including 

200 patients and 36 controls.

 ⇒ Studying fatigue in chronic pain with objective neu-
ropsychological measurements as well as biomark-
ers and brain imaging is an innovative approach to 
finding  underlying  pathophysiological  mechanisms 
in this condition.

 ⇒ The  patients  are  consecutive  clinical  patients  cur-
rently being evaluated for pain rehabilitation, which 
means that the results from the study are clinically 
generalisable.

 ⇒ A  study  limitation  is  the  small  size  of  the  control 
group;  however,  the  size  of  the  control  group  is 
adapted for comparison of the results from the func-
tional MRI examination and blood sampling.

Trial registration number  NCT05452915.

INTRODUCTION
Pain  is  one  of  the  most  frequently  presenting 
conditions in healthcare. When pain has been 
present for 3 months, it is classified as chronic. 
In chronic pain (CP), the central nervous system 
(CNS) is affected by an imbalance in the ascen-
dent and descendent tracts. This facilitates the 
pain and impedes pain inhibition. This, in turn, 
leads to plastic changes in the CNS, which are 
shown as increased sensitivity to pain and other 
stimuli, depression and fatigue.1–3

Fatigue is a common report across CP condi-
tions,  not  least  in  widespread  pain,4–9  and  it  is 
often  reported  to  be  one  of  the  most  burden-
some  symptoms.10  Fatigue,  however,  is  difficult 
to  investigate  because  it  is  subjective  in  nature 
and the definition of the concept is indistinct.11 
Fatigue  is  usually  measured  by  questionnaires, 
but when using questionnaires, the results often

interfere with other psychological conditions, for example, 
depression,12  sleep  disturbances13  or  pain.14  As  depression 
and  sleep  disorders  are  common  in  patients  with  CP,  it  is 
difficult  to  determine  whether  the  fatigue  seen  in  these 
patients is primarily related to pain or whether it is secondary 
to depression,15 which incites a general attitude that fatigue 
among patients with CP is due to sleep disorders and depres-
sion.16 Still, fatigue can, but need not, be linked to impaired 
cognitive  functioning.17  Cognitive  aspects  of  fatigue,  cogni-
tive  fatigue,  is  a  state  where  a  cognitively  demanding  task 
gives  rise  to  a  mental/subjective  experience  of  fatigue  and 
has  often  been  used  synonymously  with  mental  fatigue.18 
However,  it  is  still  a  subjective  experience.  Some  cognitive 
aspects of fatigue can also be measured on a functional level 
as cognitive fatigability, defined as performance decline on 
attention- demanding tasks.19–21

It is well established from studies with self- reported data and 
cognitive tests that patients with CP are severely bothered by 
cognitive impairment,22–24 not least patients with generalised 
pain.25 Also, there are several studies showing an association 
between pain and deficits in attention, memory, processing 
speed and executive function.22 26 It is important to separate 
self- reported symptoms from functional disabilities on objec-
tive tests since, as noted above, self- reports can be influenced 
by psychological well- being.27

Impaired cognitive ability in CP has been explained either 
by  ‘limited  resources’  that  is,  that  the  pain  competes  for 
limited attentional resources in the brain,25 28 or by neuro-
plastic changes, where impaired cognitive ability in patients 
with  CP  is  supposed  to  be  caused  by  neurodegenerative 
processes. In CP, the CNS is affected by an imbalance in the 
brain’s pathway system, which leads to plastic changes in the 
brain.1 In particular, pain activates areas of the brain that are 
important for attentional functions, which may explain why 
many patients with CP experience attention deficits.22

In patients with acquired brain injuries and other neuro-
logical conditions, self- rated fatigue has been associated with 
impaired  attention29  and  slower  processing  speed.30  Fati-
gability  in  cognitively  demanding  tasks  has  been  shown  in 
patients with mild traumatic brain injury,31 multiple sclerosis32 
and hormonal conditions,33 34 thus constituting an objective 
measure of cognitive fatigue. In acquired brain injuries and 
other  neurological  conditions,  cognitive  fatigue  has  been 
associated  with  dysfunctions  in  the  corticostriatal  networks 
in  the  basal  ganglia.35–38  The  relation  between  fatigue  and 
attention deficits in CP has not yet been pinpointed in the 
literature,  and  cognitive  fatigability  has,  to  our  knowledge, 
not been studied in patients with CP. It cannot be ruled out 
that fatigue in CP and neurological conditions might share 
underlying  mechanisms,  and  that  objectively  measured 
cognitive fatigability could be an objective marker of cogni-
tive fatigue also in CP.

As fatigue is an indistinctive report with multifactorial 
origin,  the  importance  of  a  standardised  taxonomy  has 
been  emphasised  to  clarify  and  improve  the  assessment 
and reporting of fatigue.11 Correlations between depres-
sion  and  self- rated  fatigue  are  seen  in  several  studies 
regardless  of  the  underlying  medical  condition.12  39  40 

2

Finding  methods  to  capture  fatigue  without  the  result 
being  affected  by  depression  are  important  to  disen-
tangle  other  possible  underlying  causes  of  fatigue  and 
thereby enable effective treatment. In previous studies on 
patients with brain injuries, cognitive fatigability has not 
been affected by depression.41 42 By combining self- rating 
measures and fatigue measures not related to depression 
but rather with functional networks in the brain31 or with 
results  on  cognitive  tests,41  a  clearer  picture  of  possible 
underlying causes of fatigue can be obtained and in the 
long run also what treatment should be recommended.

Functional  MRI  (fMRI)  may  reflect  increased  or 
decreased  neuronal  activity  in  the  brain  as  changes  in 
neuronal activity are linked to changes in regional blood 
flow  and  blood  oxygen  level  dependent  (BOLD).  With 
different fMRI techniques, it is possible to study whether 
discrete  cerebral  dysfunctions  can  be  linked  to  self- 
perceived  fatigue  and  cognitive  fatigue/fatigability  on  a 
group  level.  Fatigue  among  patients  with  brain  injuries 
has been linked to specific networks for attention in the 
brain, involving frontosubcortical regions.43–45 Möller and 
Nordin have shown that fatigue in mild traumatic brain 
injury is related to altered connectivity in the brain45 and 
that  different  neural  networks  are  related  to  subjective 
compared with objective measures of fatigue.31 Whether 
similar patterns can also be seen in patients with pain and 
fatigue  needs  to  be  investigated.  Connectivity  changes 
have also been seen in CP, and patients with different pain 
conditions  show  connectivity  changes.46  These  studies 
have  not  included  fatigue  and  fatigability  and  have  not 
used task- fMRI in the scanner.

Since  chronic  low- grade  inflammation  is  thought  to 
play a major role in the onset of CP and some previous 
studies  have  shown  elevated  levels  of  inflammatory 
biomarkers in patients with chronic generalised pain and 
neuropathic  pain,47–50  the  immunological  biomarkers 
in  the  present  study  are  being  investigated  to  improve 
knowledge on underlying mechanisms, which may lead to 
future potential diagnostic markers. A low- grade systemic 
inflammation  may  be  related  to  fatigue  and  cognition 
as  previous  studies  have  suggested  an  upregulation  or 
dysregulation  of  components  in  the  immune  system  in 
patients with chronic fatigue syndrome,51 52 and Wåhlén 
et  al  have  reported  significant  correlations  between 
immunity proteins and psychological distress in patients 
with fibromyalgia.53 As an answer to the activation of the 
immune  system  activation  in  central  immunocompe-
tent  cells  such  as  microglia  and  astrocytes  are  initiated, 
resulting in a production of pro- inflammatory cytokines 
in the CNS that promotes a change in behaviour response 
characterised by decreased mood, increased anxiety, pain 
sensitivity,  etc.  Previous  studies  have  investigated  single 
inflammatory markers and reported inconsistent results.

There is, thus, a need for increased knowledge about the 
association between CP, cognition and fatigue and possible 
underlying  pathophysiological  mechanisms.  To  improve 
diagnostic and prognostic models, we aim to investigate the 
coexpression  profile  of  inflammatory  biomarkers  and  by

ways that might be activated in cognitive fatigue.

Objectives
The primary aim of the study is to investigate the presence 
of self- rated mental fatigue, objectively measured cogni-
tive  fatigability  and  executive  functions  and  how  these 
are  related  to  other  cognitive  functions,  pain- related 
factors, inflammatory biomarkers and brain connectivity 
in patients with CP.
1.  Do patients with CP show more pronounced self- rated 
mental  fatigue  and  cognitive  fatigue  compared  with 
healthy controls?

2.  Are the different fatigue measures related to cognitive 
functions  such  as  process  speed  and  attention  func-
tions?

3.  What is the relationship between (a) cognitive impair-
ments, as measured by several different cognitive tests, 
(b)  mental  fatigue  as  measured  by  Multidimensional 
fatigue  inventory- 20  (MFI- 20)  and  visual  scale  on  fa-
tigue (VAS- f) or (c) cognitive fatigability as measured 
by  Wechsler  Adult  Intelligence  Scale- III  (WAIS- III) 
Coding and

and are they affected by covariates, such as sleep 
disorders and degree of depression/anxiety?
4.  Is  there  an  association  between  immunological  bio-
markers  and  (a)  cognitive  functions,  (b)  mental  fa-
tigue and (c) cognitive fatigability?

5.  Does  the  connectivity  in  the  brain  of  female  patients 
with CP differ from healthy controls at rest as well as 
during activity while performing a vigilance task?

Register  for  Pain  Rehabilitation  (SQRP)  (http://
www.ucr.uu.se/nrs/).  Information  about  medication, 
possible  trauma  and  background  information  and 
degree of sick leave will be obtained from the medical 
record.

Questionnaires from SQRP
 ► EuroQoL five dimensions questionnaire55
 ► Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale56
 ► Insomnia Severity Index57
 ► Multidimensional Pain Inventory58
 ► Screening on physical activity by the National Board 

of Health and Welfare.59

Other questionnaires
 ► VAS- f

 ► VAS- f and pain before and after the fMRI scanning
 ► MFI- 2060
 ► Pain  level,  experienced  during  the  neuropsycholog-
ical  examination,  will  be  rated  (0–10)  at  the  end  of 
the session.

Neuropsychological tests
 ► WAIS- III  Digit- Symbol- Coding  (Coding)  measures 
psychomotor  speed  and  incidental  memory.  The 
higher values the better results.61 The Coding subtest 
from  WAIS- III  will  be  used  instead  of  WAIS- IV  as 
the  former  has  been  validated  for  measuring  fatiga-
bility.33 42

 ► WAIS- IV Matrix reasoning measures logical reasoning 
and premorbid cognitive level. The higher values the 
better results.62

 ► WAIS- IV  Digit  Span  measures  verbal  attention  span 
and  working  memory.  The  higher  values  the  better 
results.63 64

 ► Delis- Kaplan  Executive  Function  Scale  Color- Word 
Test and Word Fluency Test measure different aspects 
of  executive  functioning.  For  the  Color- Word  test, 
lower values represent better results and for the Word 
Fluency Test, higher values represent better results.65
 ► Ruff  2  &  7  measures  automatic  visual  scanning  and 
complex  selective  attention  and  processing  speed. 
The higher values the better results.66

 ► MapCog  Spectra  is  a  newly  developed  attention  test 
that  is  administered  via  an  iPad.  The  MapCog  test 
records  and  analyses  the  occurrence  and  frequency 
of  attentional  lapses  and  compares  these  to  stand-
ardised  norms.  The  standardisation  is  based  on  a 
healthy  reference  group,  n=313,  aged  8–87  years. 
The test has a sensitivity of 95.8% and a specificity of 
96% for identifying individuals with attention deficit 
disorder. The test is easy to perform (5–10 min), the

Table 1  Outcome measures

Primary outcome measures

Description

1. Fatigability from WAIS- III 
Coding

2. D- KEFS Color- Word Test

3. Fatigability on e- prime 
vigilance task in the fMRI 
scanner

The subject must fill in the blank spaces with the symbol which is paired to the number during 120 s. 
Cognitive fatigue is assessed by subtracting the number of digits produced in the first 30 s from the 
number of digits produced in the last 30 s during the full 120 s period. A non- ascending score (<0) 
is considered an indicator of cognitive fatigue. Both the total value and the difference between the 
production between 0–30 s and 91–120 s are measured, and a dichotomised variable (non- ascending 
value) will be used.

Inhibition of over- learnt verbal responses. The test has four conditions: (1) naming colours (red, blue, 
or green, (2) reading colour words printed in black, (3) naming the colour of the words red, blue, or 
green written in a different colour than is the written word, which means inhibition of an over- learnt 
function of reading the word; (4) repeatedly switching between naming colours and reading out the 
printed words as quickly as possible, while at the same time, the person needs to keep track of 
clues that indicate rule change. Contrast scores are used to examine the performance of the more 
complex tasks 3 and 4 and the basic tasks 1 and 2. Faster time represents a better result.

The participants are instructed to push a button as quickly as they can when a set of four zeroes 
appears in a red rectangle and do nothing if other numbers appear. After each response, visual 
feedback of the reaction time is displayed. If the participant reacts to a false stimulus or if the 
response time exceeds 1 s the feedback ‘false answer’ or ‘no answer’ is displayed. The stimuli are 
presented at random intervals. The results are divided into quintiles and the mean reaction time is 
calculated for each quintile.

4. Task- fMRI

BOLD signal changes during the e- prime vigilance task.

5. Resting- state fMRI

Changes in functional connectivity after performance of the e- prime vigilance task.

6. Inflammatory markers

Omics analyses will be used in this study. Omics studies are mainly exploratory and hypothesis- 
generating, that is, which proteins, metabolites, and lipoproteins are identified cannot be determined 
in advance. Exploratory targeted analyses using panels of cytokines and chemokines and 
neuroinflammation will be used in combination with omics.

Secondary outcome measures Description

1. MFI- 20

The MFI- 20 consists of five scales, based on different modes of expressing fatigue. Each scale 
contains four items for which the person has to indicate on a seven- point scale to what extent 
the particular statement applies best. 'General fatigue' includes general statements concerning 
a person’s functioning. 'Physical fatigue' refers to the physical sensation related to the feeling of 
tiredness. 'Reduced activities' measures reduction in activities and 'Reduced motivation' is lack of 
motivation. 'Mental fatigue' measures cognitive symptoms related to fatigue. Some sentences are 
inverted and need to be rescored. On each scale, higher values represent higher levels of fatigue.

2. Visual Analog Scale of 
Fatigue

Measurement of self- rated current fatigue level. Ranges from 0 (corresponding to no fatigue) to 100 
millimetres (corresponding to the worst possible fatigue).

3. D- KEFS Word Fluency Test

The test measures expressive language skills, initiative, and working memory and consists of three 
different conditions: verbal phonological fluency1 where the test person for 60 s produces as many 
unique words as possible that begin with a given letter; category fluency2 where the test person for 
60 s per category produces as many unique words as possible in two given semantic categories 
and; category change fluency3 where the test person produces as many unique words as possible in 
60 s and switches between two specified semantic categories every other time. The more words, the 
better performance.

4. WAIS- IV Digit Span forward 
and backward repetition 
(Attention span and working 
memory)

The test person must repeat numbers that the leader reads out. The number of digits is increased by 
one unit every two times. The test person repeats the numbers in the same order (forward repetition) 
or reverse order (backward repetition). Forward repetition measures auditory attention span and 
short- term memory, while backward repetition measures auditory working memory. Both the total 
number of digits and the difference between forward and backward repetition are measured.

data processing is automatic, the results are objective 
and  there  are  no  learning  effects.  The  lower  values 
the  better  results.67  We  also  measure  fatigability  by 
comparing the results at the end of the test with the 
beginning of the test.

For all tests, mainly raw score scores will be used in the 

analysis.

DATA COLLECTION AND MANAGEMENT
Recruitment
The pain rehabilitation unit at the Department of Reha-
bilitation Medicine at Danderyd University Hospital and 
the  Department  of  Pain  Rehabilitation,  Pain  Center  at 
Umeå  University  Hospital  offer  team  assessment  and 
evidence- based team- based multimodal rehabilitation for 
patients with complex CP (>3 months). To receive reha-
bilitation at the clinics, a referral including a pain assess-
ment is required. Information about the study is sent to 
the referred patients at the same time as the call for the 
initial assessment.

At the time of the team assessment, the patient is asked 
orally  by  the  team  nurse  if  the  testing  psychologist  may 
contact the patient to inform them about the study. The 
patient’s  consent  is  logged,  and  a  log  is  made  of  the 
number  who  say  yes  and  the  number  and  gender  and 
age  of  those  who  say  no.  No  personal  data  other  than 
gender and age will be registered for those who say no. 
The purpose of the log is only to be able to assess gener-
alisability  based  on  the  proportion  who  have  agreed  to 
participate in the study.

The  testing  psychologist  then  calls  the  patients  and 
inform them about the study and if the patient agrees, 
an appointment is made for neuropsychological assess-
ment. In connection with the assessment, the psycholo-
gist ensures that they have understood the information 
about  the  study  and  that  participation  is  voluntary, 
inquires  about  whether  they  have  further  questions 
and  collects  the  signed  consent  form.  Female  patients 
who are investigated in Umeå are asked if they want to 
participate in the fMRI study. The patients are assessed 
by an independent psychologist, who does not treat the 
patients clinically.

The  study  patients  will  be  compared  with  healthy 
controls. Healthy controls will be recruited through adver-
tising among hospital staff. Matching on a group level will 
be done regarding age, gender and level of education.

Imaging
In  a  3- tesla  MR  scanner,  conventional  anatomical  MRI 
sequences  will  be  analysed  as  well  as  sequences  for 
detailed  anatomical  assessment.  We  use  an  established 
measurement paradigm that has previously been used on 
healthy subjects68 and patients with mild traumatic brain 
injury.69

All participants are examined with fMRI during a 20 min 
vigilance  (reaction  time)  task  (e- prime),  where  fatigue 
is  measured  by  recording  mean  reaction  time/quintile. 
BOLD  resting- state  fMRI  examination  is  performed 
before and after the task. In addition, the MRI protocol 
will include standard clinical protocols that include high- 
resolution  T1- weighted  sequences  and  high- resolution 
T2- weighted  scan  (Fluid- attenuated  inversion  recovery 
(FLAIR)). All structural images are reviewed by a radiol-
ogist  to  screen  for  incidental  findings  within  the  brain. 
The investigation is non- invasive and takes about 60 min.

Blood sampling
Venous blood samples (10–20 mL) are collected in P100 
tubes  from  BD  diagnostic,  containing  a  protease  inhib-
itor cocktail that prevents protein cleavage/degradation 
from each subject. The blood samples are centrifuged to 
remove red blood cells. The plasma fraction is transferred 
to a new tube, portioned and stored at −86°C until anal-
ysis at the PAINOMICS lab in Linköping, Sweden.

Plasma  samples  will  be  analysed  using  antibody- based 
methods such as multiplex technology (Meso Scale Diag-
nostics,  Rockville,  MD).  Instrument,  MSD  Technology 
platform,  which  is  a  multiplex  instrument,  which  can 
analyse up to 92 different substances (cytokines, chemo-
kines,  growth  factors  and  metabolic  proteins)  in  one 
go.  Omics  analysis  consisting  of  proteomics,  metabolo-
mics  and  lipoprotein  profiling  will  be  used  to  identify 
other  inflammatory  markers  than  those  analysed  by  the 
antibody- based (targeted analysis) method.

Data management
All data materials will be recorded with a participant ID 
and  will  be  unidentifiable  for  those  who  do  not  have 
access  to  the  code  key.  In  the  statistical  processing,  the 
participants  will  be  coded.  The  code  key  is  stored  sepa-
rately  from  the  data  and  only  pseudonymised  data  will 
be  shared  between  the  two  sites.  Deidentified  data  will 
be  electronically  stored  on  the  server  at  the  two  sites 
and will be deleted 10 years after the project has ended. 
The final data set will be available to researchers actively 
contributing  to  statistical  analyses  and  publications. 
Data entry will be controlled by initial exploratory anal-
yses,  including  range  checks,  to  promote  data  quality. 
Regarding biological specimens, the samples of blood will 
be centrifuged and plasma will be aliquoted and stored at 
the  Linköping  University  Hospital,  with  special  notifica-
tion to the biobank. The samples will be blinded before 
analysis. This study has an exploratory character as we use 
proteomic  methods,  and,  therefore,  samples  (that  are 
not thawed) will be stored for future analysis according to 
approved ethical application.

Sample size
Power  calculation  on  the  primary  fatigue  measure,  the 
WAIS- III  Coding  Test:  for  a  mean  difference  between 
patients and controls of 2.5, and SD of 3.0, and an alpha 
level  of  5%  (two- sided)  and  strength  of  80%,  a  group 
of  24  participants  in  each  group  is  a  sufficiently  large 
sample.70 This size also holds for the fMRI substudy as an 
earlier  study  on  mild  traumatic  brain  injury  has  shown 
that  10  patients  in  each  group  were  sufficient.45  The 
biomarker  data  will  be  analysed  using  multivariate  data 
analysis (MVDA). Algorithms for sample size calculations 
using  MVDA  do  not  exist.  MVDA  is  designed  to  handle 
a  few  subjects,  low- to- variable  ratios  and  multiple  inter-
correlated  variables.  Based  on  our  previous  biomarker 
study,48 71 the sample size in this study will be sufﬁcient to 
detect a difference between groups.

Information on participants will be handled by healthcare 
professionals  adhering  to  Swedish  Law  ensuring  confi-
dentiality and data protection by coding individual partic-
ipants’ collected data. Results and data will be presented 
at  a  group  level  in  publications,  rendering  the  identifi-
cation  of  individual  patients  impossible.  All  data  will  be 
stored  in  accordance  with  the  General  Data  Protection 
Regulation. The data for participants from the Stockholm 
area will be stored in a password- protected project server 
at  Danderyd  University  Hospital  and  for  patients  from 
the  Umeå  region  at  Umeå  University.  Data  will  not  be 
accessed by unauthorised persons.

Data analysis
For  all  study  questions,  descriptive  statistics  will  be 
used  to  depict  demographics,  injury  characteristics, 
results on neuropsychological tests and psychological 
screening  instruments.  Multiple  linear  and  logistic 
regression  will  be  used  to  detect  any  interaction 
effects.  Parametric  methods  such  as  independent  t 
test,  one- sample  t  test  (comparing  with  standardised 
test  norms),  Pearson  correlation  and  multiple  linear 
regression)  will  be  used  when  data  are  normally 
distributed  and  non- parametric  methods  (Man- 
Whitney  U- test,  Spearman  correlation,  χ2,  logistic 
regression) when data are skewed or on interval level 
or  lower.  Missing  data  will  be  listed  as  data  loss.  The 
significance level will be set to <0.05 (two- tailed).

Concerning study question 4, data from omics and 
targeted  analysis  will  be  analysed  using  advanced 
MVDA  using  SIMCA- P+.  This  is  the  recommended 
method in omics since it accounts for multicollinearity 
problems and missing data when the number of vari-
ables  exceeds  the  number  of  observations.72  MVDA 
will  be  used  for  the  analysis  of  the  biomarkers.  Prin-
cipal  component  analysis  (PCA),  orthogonal  partial 
least  squares-  discriminant  analysis  (OPLS- DA)  and 
OPLS  regression  will  be  applied  for  analysis  of  the 
biomarkers  and  their  ability  to  differentiate  between 
groups  and  their  correlation  with  clinical  character-
istics  and  outcomes.  PCA  is  an  unsupervised  analysis 
that  reduces  the  dimensionality  of  data  and  extracts 
and  displays  systematic  variation  in  the  data  matrix. 
Outliers will be identified using score plots in combi-
nation with Hotelling’s T2 test (the distance from the 
origin  in  the  model  plane  for  each  selected  observa-
tion) and DModX (the distance of the observation to 
the  X  model  plane).  The  values  that  are  larger  than 
the  95%  confidence  limit  are  considered  suspicious 
and  the  values  larger  than  the  99%  limit  should  be 
considered strong outliers.73

OPLS- DA will be used to identify biomarkers respon-
sible  for  group  separation.  The  OPLS- DA  model 
reveals variables as loadings and the higher the value 
of a loading, the more important it is for the model, 
for example, group separation. This can be measured 
as  a  variable  influence  on  projection  (VIP)  values. 

Open access

The  p(corr)  is  the  loading  of  each  variable  scaled  as 
a correlation coefficient (ranging from −1 to +1). An 
absolute p(corr) of >0.4–0.5 and VIP >1.0 are consid-
ered  significant.72  Another  model  diagnosis  parame-
ters that are considered are R2 value—which describes 
the  ‘goodness  of  fit’,  that  is,  the  fraction  of  the  sum 
of squares of all the variables explained by a principal 
component. The Q2 value describes the ‘goodness of 
prediction’, that is, the fraction of the total variation 
of  the  variables  that  can  be  predicted  by  a  principal 
component  using  a  cross- validation  method73  and 
cross- validated analysis of variance (CV- ANOVA). The 
R2 must not differ more than 0.2–0.3 compared with 
Q2  and  CV- ANOVA  <0.05  is  considered  a  significant 
model.

Regarding  study  question  5  analysis  of  fMRI  data  will 
be done with special software for MRI analysis, developed 
at  Oxford  University  (http://www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/). 
The resting state data will be analysed using FSL (http://
www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl) tools such as MELODIC to iden-
tify  spatial  and  temporal  components  by  independent 
component analysis at the group level. All relevant prepro-
cessing  steps  will  be  performed,  such  as  motion  correc-
tion, registration to a standard template and filtering of 
low- frequency drifts. Group differences between patients 
and controls will be analysed using FSL dual regression. 
The  fMRI  data  will  be  analysed  using  both  MELODIC 
and FEAT, which is an FSL tool based on general linear 
modelling  performing  multiple  regression  on  the  fMRI 
data and the functional paradigm.

For study question 6, multiple linear and logistic regres-

sion will be used to detect any interaction effects.

Plans for communicating important protocol amendments to 
relevant parties
Important protocol modifications will be reported to the 
Ethics  committee  in  Sweden  and  amendments  will  be 
made to the trial registry ( Clinicaltrials. gov).

Patient and public involvement
None.
