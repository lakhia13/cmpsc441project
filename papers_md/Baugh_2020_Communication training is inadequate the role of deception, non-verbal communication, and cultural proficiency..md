ABSTRACT
In  this  commentary,  we  argue  that  the  limited  experiential  exposure  of  medical  students  to 
different  cultures  makes  the  instruction  devoted  to  communication  skills  inadequate.  The 
relationship  of  these  dynamics  to  honesty  in  clinical  encounters  is  explored.

Absent significant experiential exposure to differing group cultures to counter the natural 
tendency  to  favor  one’s  own,  discrimination  prevails.  Knowledge  or  awareness  of  cultural 
differences  does  not  necessarily  equate  to  communication  proficiency.  Critically,  interactions 
based  on  lived  experience  offer  a  deeper  knowledge  and  understanding  of  culturally  mean-
ingful  nuances  than  that  imparted  through  other  formats.  Medical  students’  lack  of  experi-
ential  exposure  to  different  cultures  results  in  communication  miscues.  When  the  stakes  are 
high,  people  detect  those  miscues  diminishing  trust  in  the  doctor-patient  relationship. 
Greater  experiential  cultural  exposure  will  enhance  the  facility  and  use  of  culturally  specific 
communication cues. At its core, the requisite transformation will require medical students to 
adapt  to  other  cultures  and  greater  representation  by  marginalized  and  stigmatized  popula-
tions not only among the studentry but staff and faculty. The time is now to ensure that the 
physicians we produce can care for all Americans. What cannot be taught must be identified 
by  the  selection  process.  Competence  with  half  the  population  is  a  failure  for  American 
medicine.

Healthcare  systems  of  every  society  have  an  interest 
in  improving  the  capacity of  their  physicians  to deli-
ver  culturally  competent  care.  The  United  Nations 
has  recognized  addressing  the  inequalities  faced  by 
marginalized  populations  as  part  of  its  Sustainable 
Development Goals [1]. Atop these pressures, forcibly 
displaced  populations  have  increased  dramatically 
since  2012.  Populations  under  the  mandate  of  the 
United  Nations  Refugee  Agency  expanded  by  over 
70%  during  that  period  [2].  Of  these,  one  study 
found  that  over  20%  of  such  vulnerable  populations 
had given up seeking medical care entirely due to the 
difficulties  they  encountered,  attesting  to  the  impor-
tance  of  culturally  sensitive  care  [3].  From  1980  to 
2000,  diversity  increased  on  average  across  even  the 
relatively  homogenous  countries  of  the  OECD  [4].

In spite of this evident need, our provision of care 
leaves  much  to  be  desired.  Marginalized  groups  are 
more likely to experience culturally insensitive health 
care  and  dissatisfaction  with  their  healthcare:  health-
care  experiences  that  have  been  linked  to  poorer 
health  outcomes  [5].  Studies  of  vulnerable  popula-
tions  from  Australia  [6],  Uganda  [7],  to  the  U.S 
[8,9]. have identified racism and culturally insensitive 
care  as  a  major  cause  of  dissatisfaction  with  the  care 

they receive and under-utilization. This commonality 
is  in  part  due  to  cross-cultural  communication  defi-
ciencies.  In  this  commentary,  we  argue  that  the  fail-
ure  of  communication  that  underlies  these  issues  is 
rooted  directly  in  changing  demographics  and  the 
attitudes  of  physicians.  We  argue  that  optimal  cross- 
cultural  communication  comes  from  within  where 
knowledge of cultural differences and modes of com-
munication  are  present  with  the  desire  to  communi-
cate  effectively.

Socialization  during childhood imparts values and 
social tendencies [10] that guide behavior later in life, 
despite  one’s  education,  later  experiences,  and  chan-
ging life circumstances [11]. The resilience of biogra-
phical  and  cultural  teachings  represents  a  special 
challenge  to  physicians.  To  function  effectively  they 
must  routinely  interact  with  patients  from  different 
backgrounds and cultures. The challenges are similar 
regardless  if  physicians  are  caring  for  indigenous, 
religious  minorities,  LGBTQ+,  physically  disabled, 
immigrant,  or 
socioeconomically  disadvantaged 
populations.  Like  most  countries,  in  the  U.S.,  75%- 
80%  of  the  medical  students  from  the  top  two  quin-
tiles  of  parental  income  in  America  [12].  Students 
lack  cross-cultural  exposure  due  to  self-

imposed  residential,  economic,  and  cultural  segrega-
tion [13–15]. In the absence of significant experiential 
exposure [16,17] to different cultures, the tendency to 
favor one’s own predominates [17–19]. The failure to 
have had meaningful intercultural exposures presages 
a negative effect on intercultural attitudes with diver-
sity  exposure  [20].  Accordingly,  about  20%  of  medi-
cal  students  have  worse 
implicit  biases  against 
marginalized  populations  after  medical  school  than 
before despite  our educational efforts  [21].  The chal-
lenges in inspiring such candidates to adopt the pro-
fessional  standard  of  compassionate  regard  for  all 
patients  are  evident.  Growing  wealth  inequality  will 
only make the situation worse. Absent a socially ver-
ified  shared  reality,  the  interpretation  of  cultural 
information  correctly  is  unlikely  to  provide  a  basis 
for  effective  communication  [22].

Communication,  a  fundamental  pillar  of  human 
social  interaction  and  the  practice  of  medicine, 
requires  speaker-listener  alignment.  Effective  com-
munication  between  two  people  requires  the  overlap 
of  verbal  and  non-verbal  cues  which  might  be  either 
culturally  specific  or  general.  Healthcare  should 
aspire  to  something  higher  still:  the  creation  of 
a  shared  reality  between  the  physician  and  patient. 
Absent a socially verified shared reality, the interpre-
tation  of  cultural  information  correctly  is  unlikely  to 
provide  a  basis  for  effective  communication  [23].  In 
this model, physician-patient dyads adopt a common 
view  of  a  subject  that  both  facilitates  action  and 
builds  trust  between  them  [23].  Cultural  influences 
arising  from  not  only  nationality,  migration  status, 
race,  ethnicity,  language,  or  religion,  but  also  age, 
gender  identity,  sexual  orientation,  socioeconomic 
status,  and  educational  attainment  make  culturally 
derived communication signals inherently more com-
plex reflecting  the many nuances between the sender 
and  recipient  [24].  Both  the  aspiration  to  shared 
reality and the complexities inherent within medicine 
make  the  sole  reliance  on  culturally  general  non- 
for  success. 
verbal  signals  an  unlikely  strategy 
Because  most  non-verbal  communication  is  uncon-
scious [25], providers can default to signals they may 
not be aware of. This transition may or may not be in 
alignment  with  their  intended  message.

By  contrast,  medical  school  communication  skills 
training  focuses  primarily  on  culturally  generic  sig-
nals  like  facing  the  patient  or  preferring  sitting  to 
standing  when  conducting  the  patient  interview. 
Knowledge  acquisition  and  performed  behaviors  are 
stressed [26]. But these techniques do not consistently 
foster  a  translation  of  learned  interpersonal  compe-
tencies  to  actual  performance  [27–30]  and  often  do 
not  lead  to  sustainable  competences  [28,29].  Such 
a focus even if successful presumes underlying empa-
thy for the target group. Where patient and physician 
populations are very similar, this assumption is likely 

sound.  However,  different  dynamics  may  operate 
when 
traditionally  marginalized  populations  are 
under  consideration.  Here,  a  divergence  between  the 
theoretical  capacity  to  practice  empathetic  behaviors 
and  their  daily  performance  may  become  apparent 
[29,31,32].

there  has  also  been 

This  present  system  incentivizes  the  performance 
of  communication  without  interrogating  or  addres-
sing underlying  attitudes. None  of  the  popular  inter-
ventions  offers  a  sustained  modification  of  the  likely 
biases  from  biographical  experiences  and  learnings. 
We  simply  teach  people  to  behave  in  a  way  they  do 
not  feel:  a  form  of  ruse.  Some  argue  our  efforts  to 
teach  empathy  or  communication  skills  explicitly 
encourage  artificiality  [33].  Such  criticisms  are  not 
new  [34,35].  Reductionist  approaches  may  also 
impede  the  development  of  true  communication 
expertise  even  when  specific  universal  recommenda-
tions  are  retained  [29].  Beyond  bias  against  margin-
alized  populations,

reckoning  with  the  way  the  most  common  concep-
tions of physicians’ professional identity conflict with 
in  the  reflection  and  feedback 
full  engagement 
needed  to  address 
interpersonal  communication 
competence.  The  deep-seated  defensiveness  of  stu-
dents  towards  learning  from  their  mistakes  or  their 
departures from professional ideals [36] frustrates the 
educational  effort.  Worse  still,  for  a  fraction  of  stu-
dents  that  adopt  recommendations  despite  all  the 
above  obstacles,  dissonance  develops  between  the 
negative beliefs they hold about certain patient popu-
lations  and  the  more  egalitarian  views  their  formal 
instruction  encourages.  This  deceptiveness  has  con-
sequences as both a shortcoming for both the ways it 
limits  the  effectiveness  of  communication  and  the 
extent 
it  as 
to  which  patients  can  appreciate 
dishonest.

Meaningful  use  of  culturally  specific  signals  is 
more  than  just  awareness  that  such  things  exist.  It 
involves  recognition  of  the  signal’s  meaning  within 
the broader context of the communication. Models of 
shared  reality  suggest  that  this  goal 
is  seldom 
achieved  when  the  speaker  is  only  responding  to 
external  pressures  like  a  desire  not  to  appear  biased. 
Subtle  but  definite  differences  in  emotional  expres-
sion are evident across cultures. While some nonver-
bal  behaviors  appear  universally  desired  in  clinical 
environments,  others  show  significant  cultural  varia-
tion  [24,37].  Hence,  cultural  novices  are  unlikely  to 
be cognizant of the range of cultural nuances and are 
likely  to  struggle  to  relate  in  cross-cultural  contexts 
[19,38]. When cultural uncertainty is present, stereo-
types are often substituted for knowledge and applied 
to  stigmatized  and  marginalized  patients  [39]. 
Neither  patients  nor  providers  can  take  the  most 
from  an  encounter  when  they  miss  these  signals  the 
other  may  have  sent.  Violating  cultural  norms  of 

behavior in cross-cultural interactions impact patient 
expectations  during  doctor-patient  interactions  [40] 
and  likely  result  in  incomplete  understandings, com-
promise empathetic accuracy [41] as well as the doc-
tor-patient  relationship  [40,42].  The  more  familiar 
and  accurate  people  become  with  specific  cross- 
cultural  emotional  and  nonverbal  communication 
cues  [43],  the  better  physician-patient  communica-
tions. Summarily, what the patient does not correctly 
receive,  identify,  or  understand  from  the  physician, 
diminishes 
the  physician-patient 
interaction.

the  quality  of 

that  despite 

The  damage  to  the  physician-patient  relationships 
incurred  by  the  current  approach  depends  to  some 
extent  on  the  patients’  ability  to  perceive  dishonest 
communication.  Incongruent  nonverbal  behavior  or 
communication underlies most lie detection [44]. For 
example,  there  are  detectable  differences  in  facial 
muscle  activation 
for  nonverbal  signaling  with 
a  sincere  smile  compared  to  a  false  one  [45]. 
Whether  through  failure  to  appreciate  or  reflect  cul-
turally  expected  cues,  patients  likely  appreciate  phy-
sicians’  nonverbal  incongruences  with  suspicion  and 
may  judge  them  as  signs  of  dishonesty.  Medical 
encounters,  which  can  feature  life-altering  diagnoses 
or  decision-making,  represent  high-stakes  situations 
that  make  detection  of  insincerity  and  falsehoods 
more  likely  [46,47].  A  study  of  informed  consent 
found 
identical  content,  African 
American  patients  rated  the  quality  of  communica-
tion  as  overall  much  poorer  than  did  non-Hispanic 
Whites  [48].  Such  results  demonstrate  the  possibility 
of divergence between verbal content and non-verbal 
communication  and  intent.  Patients  confronted  with 
making  a  judgment  about  the  sincerity  of  a  smile 
make  a  risk  assessment,  often  informed  by  their 
prior  history  of  experiences  with  the  physician  and/ 
or  his  culture.  Their  willingness  to  accept  the  risks 
they  perceive  from  a  physician  is  cumulative  with 
each  miscues  tipping  the  scales  further  depending 
on  the  patient’s  personality,  outlook,  and  perceived 
ability  to  weather  the  consequences  [49].  Regardless 
of  underlying  intention,  perceived  insincerity  regis-
ters  as  a  threat;  these  are  more  memorable,  salient, 
and  motivating  to  the  patient  than  subsequent  inter-
pretations  [50,51].  Deceptions,  real  or  imagined, 
damage  doctor-patient  relationships,  and  compro-
mise  care  [52].

Apart from limited didactic and haphazard clinical 
instruction typically with no follow-up, the remaining 
medical  school  opportunities  are  experiential.  The 
underlying  assumption  is  that  culturally  specific  sig-
nals will be acquired through the practice of medicine 
by  clinical  exposure  to  diverse  patients  during  train-
ing.  These  experiences  are  often  filtered  through 
a  bias-condoning  hidden  curriculum,  have  limited 
duration  or  consistency.  Further,  we  have  not  yet

succeeded  in  controlling  cultural  microaggressions 
against our diverse learners [53–55], let alone making 
it a suitable environment for students to expand their 
ability  to  communicate  with  marginalized  groups. 
The  net-effect  of  diversity  exposure  on  attitudes  via 
contact is positive, but only when meaningful ties are 
established  [20].  When  this  is  difficult,  as  seen  in 
segregated school systems or when individuals other-
wise fail to build cross-cultural contacts it diminishes 
cross-cultural trust [56].,Unfortunately, many health-
care encounters more closely mirror these conditions 
for  failure  than  those  for  success.  Consequently, 
structured  clinical  activity  does  little  for  students’ 
understanding  of  stigmatized  and  marginalized  peo-
ple  nor  does  it  spur  the  development  of  the  desired 
communication  skills  [57,58].  This  array  of  factors 
against  curricular  efforts  means  none  are  likely  to 
redress  the  communication  deficits  or  the  presence 
of  outgroup  bias.  The  gaps  in  the  current  approach 
are  evident.  The 
inter-personal  communications 
instruction  provided  in  medical  school  inadequately 
prepares  students  for  the  present  and  future  cultural 
diversity they will encounter. Once upon a time, lim-
ited  exposure  was  more  serviceable  because  the 
broader  society  was  more  homogenous.  That  is  no 
longer the case. We assume students have had diverse 
communicative  experiences  to  draw  on  when  the 
greater  likelihood  is  that  they  do  not. We  trust  com-
munication  skills  will  develop  with  clinical  exposure 
without evidence that they can. We stress reductionist 
strategies,  where  concepts  are  eschewed  in  favor  of 
specific  behaviors  like  sitting  during  a  patient  inter-
view. These approaches are short-sighted in that they 
homogenize, failing to account for the differences not 
only between but within cultures. The result is at best 
ineffective.  What  drives  the  development  of  human-
ism  is  authentic,  unique,  and  participatory  experi-
ences  [59].  The  amount  and  quality  of  interactions 
needed  to  achieve  that  goal  are  dependent  on  intrin-
sic  predispositions,  biographical  experiences  and 
teachings,  and  cultural  learnings  of  each  individual. 
But an instructional program that fails to provide any 
at all misses the mark. Whether failing to incorporate 
these experiences or building capacity without evalu-
ating  underlying  belief  structures,  the  persistent  lack 
of  an  over-arching  strategy  in  medical  school  com-
munications training  renders  it  a  bridge  to  nowhere.
Alternative tactics are imaginable. Interactions that 
are  experiential  yield  greater  gains  than  lectures  or 
other  passive  learning  formats  [60].  Students  acquire 
cultural  fluency  more  slowly  in  small  doses  (e.g., 
medical encounters) than those who spend significant 
time  immersed  the  different  culture  [10].  Contact 
between  members  of  different  groups  in  general, 
increases  understanding  and  sensitivity  while  redu-
cing  intergroup  bias  [61,62]  leading  people  to  view 
each  other  as  more  similar  reducing  outgroup  bias

[63].  The  greater  and  the  more  extensive  the  prior 
exposure to and interaction with another culture, the 
less  unconscious  bias  [64],  even  if  limited  to  a  short 
engagement  with  exemplars  of  diverse  social  groups.
In  other  cases,  existing  approaches  could  be

for  more  success.  Medical 
courses are offered in many schools, acknowledging 
the  relationship  of 
to  culture  [65]. 
However,  this  has  limited  accessibility  for  those 
without  previous  understanding,  and  limited  value 
for  those  who  only  memorize  a  few  phrases.  By 
contrast,  the  way  an  interpreter  is  utilized  can 
increase  both  the  empathy  observed  and  the  infor-
mation  exchanged  in  a  medical  encounter  [66,67]. 
Perhaps  the  more  fruitful  path  is  instruction  on 
how  to  work  with  interpreters  to  achieve  these  out-
comes.  Or  consider  the  case  of  immersion  experi-

ences  and  dedicated  clinics 
populations.  While  global  health  experiences  can 
be  helpful,  the  medical  problems  of  marginalized 
populations  are  local,  not  global.  Although  mean-

Germany or Turkey, the advantages of greater inter-
actions  with  the  local  Turkish  population  make 
local  sites  favored.  The  potential  differences  in  the

immigrant 
populations  and  mean  the  experiences  that  animate 
behavior  and  communication  in  one  locale  will  not 
be  the  same  as  that  which  motivates  in  other 
regions  or  countries.  The  common  through  line  in 
the  most  effective  exercises  is  either  developing  or 
capitalizing  on  experiential  understanding  and 
learning.  Whether  such  activities  are  scalable  for 
an  entire  medical  school  class  is  unproven.  Most 
likely,  the  bulk  of  such  experiences  may  have  to  be 
gained  outside  of  medical  school.

experiences 

global 

The idea that the rich tapestry of national cultures, 
each  with  its  own  cultural  and  contextual  nuances 
can  ever  be  reduced  to  a  few  rote  universal  gestures 
is  simply  misguided.  Unlike  the  past  when  many  of 
the patients were culturally like the practitioners who 
care  for  them,  increasingly  the  opposite  is  true. 
Medical  schools  must  act  affirmatively  to  redesign 
communications  training  in  a  way  that  is  cognizant 
of  these  weaknesses  or  use  different  selection  factors 
for its students. We must move beyond miming tech-
niques as communication training to a more fulsome 
contemplation  of  the  underlying  drivers  of  bias, 
ingroup/outgroup  classification,  and  their  resolution 
for  effective  communication.

The  time  is  now  to  ensure  that  the  physicians  we 
produce  can  communicate  effectively  with  all  of 
society.  Greater  experiential  exposure  to  the  rich 
diversity  of  local  cultures  will  likely  need  to  take 
place  before  medical  school.  The  distance  to  go 
before  our  graduates  can  provide  quality  care  to 

local  patients  with  whatever  differences  in  back-
grounds  that  are  likely  to  exist  is  still formidable.
