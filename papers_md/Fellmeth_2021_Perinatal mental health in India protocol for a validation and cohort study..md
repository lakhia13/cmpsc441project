Background Common mental disorders (CMD) are among the largest contributors to global maternal morbidity and mortality. Although

research on perinatal mental health in India has grown in recent years, important evidence gaps remain, especially regarding CMD. Our study

aims to improve understanding of CMD among perinatal and non-perinatal women of reproductive age across two settings in India: Bangalore

(Karnataka) and Tanda (Himachal Pradesh).

Methods The study is embedded within the Maternal and Perinatal Health Research Collaboration India (MaatHRI). This mixed-methods

observational study comprises three consecutive phases: (i) focus group discussions and individual interviews to explore women’s knowledge

and seek feedback on CMD screening tools; (ii) validation of CMD screening tools; and (iii) prospective cohort study to identify CMD incidence,

prevalence and risk factors among perinatal and non-perinatal women. Results of the three phases will be analyzed using inductive thematic

analysis, psychometric analysis and multivariable regression analysis, respectively.

Conclusion Improving understanding, detection and management of CMD among women is key to improving women’s health and promoting

gender equality. This study will provide evidence of CMD screening tools for perinatal and non-perinatal women in two diverse Indian settings,

produce data on CMD prevalence, incidence and risk factors and enhance understanding of the specific contribution of the perinatal state

to CMD.

Introduction

Globally, common mental disorders (CMD) including depres-
sive and anxiety disorders are one of the largest contributors
to maternal morbidity and mortality.1 A disproportionate bur-
den of perinatal CMD is borne by low- and middle-income
countries (LMIC).2 In India, persisting stigma towards men-
tal disorders, socio-economic deprivation, intimate partner
violence, traditional conﬁnement practices after childbirth
and women’s low status in society act as risk factors for the
development of mental disorders for many women.3 The
prevalence of perinatal depression in India has been estimated
at 22%, though estimates are subject to signiﬁcant hetero-
geneity based on the tools used, sample size, study population
and location.4,5 Fewer studies have focused on anxiety. One

recent study estimated a prevalence of generalized anxiety
disorder of 23% among perinatal women in a tertiary care

hospital in South India.6 Additionally, an estimated 7.6% of
women in India experience suicidal ideation in pregnancy—
an important contributor to maternal mortality across low-,
middle-and high-income settings alike.7

Although research on perinatal mental health in India has
important evidence gaps remain.8
grown in recent years,
Firstly, few studies have assessed the psychometric validity of
screening tools for perinatal CMD in India.4,9 Screening tools,
which have been translated from other languages and cultural
settings but have not been validated locally, may be unreliable
when used in Indian contexts.10 For instance, optimal cut-
offs may vary across settings and especially when used in
populations living with chronic stress or in conditions of
poverty.11 Validation studies should examine whether screen-
ing tools perform differently in the antenatal and postnatal
periods, their reliability among low literacy populations, and
any differences according to whether tools are self-completed
or questions are read out by interviewers. Secondly, there
is a need to broaden the focus of current evidence. For
example, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and anxiety
disorders including panic disorder and phobias in the perinatal
period have been relatively under-researched in India as else-
where globally. Similarly, somatization disorder—a common
expression of emotional distress among women in India—
has not been sufficiently studied among pregnant or postpar-
tum women and represents a further gap. Certain groups—
notably rural and marginalized populations, those living in
low-income settings and those with low levels of literacy—
are among the most vulnerable to experiencing CMD. Yet the
voices of these women are seldom heard: these groups remain
under-represented and efforts must be made to render future
research more inclusive.5 Thirdly, systematic studies to assess
the prevalence of CMD antenatally are needed: many post-
natal mental disorders have their onset during pregnancy, and
few studies assess the problem in a prospective manner from
early pregnancy through to the postpartum period. Much of
the burden could be averted through effective detection and
management of CMD antenatally. Finally, there is uncertainty
regarding the extent to which perinatal CMD is associated
with the perinatal state per se, as few studies have directly com-
pared perinatal and non-perinatal women of reproductive age
from the same setting.

Addressing these evidence gaps is essential to improve
understanding of perinatal CMD in India, facilitate diagnosis
and be better positioned to offer appropriate support and
treatment to women. Screening for perinatal mental disorders
should occur in maternal health and obstetric settings by
healthcare workers including midwives, nurses and primary
care doctors. In order for screening initiatives to be scalable,
tools should therefore be reliable, simple and quick to admin-
ister and have established cut-offs to facilitate stepped-care

treatment. Managing perinatal CMD can also improve child
outcomes, particularly in LMICs where associations between
maternal mental disorders and adverse infant outcomes are
exacerbated by exposure to additional socio-economic adver-
sities.12 The need to identify effective means of detection and
management of CMD among women in India has become
increasingly urgent in light of the COVID-19 pandemic,
which has disproportionately impacted upon women and
heightened levels of anxiety and other mental disorders.13

Aims and objectives

This protocol outlines our study on perinatal mental health in
two sites in India. Our study aims to improve understanding
of CMD among perinatal and non-perinatal women in India,
with the long-term goals of developing reliable detection
methods to enable early identiﬁcation, referral and support
for women with CMD. The research questions and objectives
the study seeks to address are listed in Table 1. The study will
assess the following types of CMD: depressive disorders, anx-
iety disorders, PTSD, somatization disorder and suicidality.
The study objectives will be achieved using a mixed-methods
observational design comprising three consecutive phases:
(i) qualitative study, (ii) validation study and (iii) prospective
cohort study, as described in further detail below.

Methods

Setting and participants
This study is embedded within the Maternal and Perinatal
Health Research Collaboration India (MaatHRI), a col-
laboration between the National Perinatal Epidemiology
Unit (NPEU), University of Oxford and ﬁfteen hospitals
across ﬁve states in India.14 The study will be conducted
by the Departments of Clinical Psychology and Psychiatry,
National Institute for Mental Health and Neuro Sciences
(NIMHANS), Bangalore, Karnataka; and Dr Rajendra Prasad
Government Medical College (DRPGMC), Tanda, Himachal
Pradesh. At each site, perinatal women (women who are
currently pregnant or up to 12 months post-partum) and
non-perinatal women (women who are not currently pregnant
and have not given birth within the last 12 months) aged 18-
45 years who are willing and able to participate will be invited
to participate.

individual interviews and focus group discussions (FGD) to
seek feedback on selected CMD screening tools and explore
knowledge around CMD. Participants will ﬁrst complete an
individual interview. Women will be shown a selection of
CMD screening tools and asked for their views on these tools,
including their thoughts on the wording of the questions, the
response scales and the perceived user-friendliness of the
tool. Next, participants will
join an FGD during which
the screening tools will be discussed further. Any preferences
for certain tools will be explored. We will conduct separate
FGD with pregnant, post-partum and non-perinatal women
in order to elicit views speciﬁc to each of these groups.
FGD participants will be recruited from the same settings
as participants of the following two phases. CMD screening
tools will be selected though discussion between study
investigators including psychiatrists and clinical psychologists
with extensive experience of conducting mental health
interviews with local communities. We will also consult the
published literature and consider the results of a systematic
review of validated CMD screening tools in perinatal women
in India, conducted by members of the study team.9 Potential
screening tools under consideration are listed in Table 3.
Tools, which are not already available in Hindi, Urdu or
Kannada, will be translated following WHO guidelines for the
translation and adaptation of instruments, including forward-
translation and back-translation by a panel of mental health
specialists ﬂuent in Hindi/Urdu/Kannada and English.18

Sample size

We will include 24–32 women per study site in Phase 1. At
each site, we will conduct a minimum of two FGDs with

perinatal women and two FGDs with non-perinatal women.
Each FGD will include 6–8 women. The number of FGDs
was determined by evidence suggesting that more than 80%
of all themes to emerge from group discussions are discov-
erable within two to three focus groups.24 If data satura-
tion has not been achieved, a third FGD will be conducted.
A maximum of eight participants per group provides optimal
data richness, facilitates group moderation, identiﬁcation of
individual voices within the group, seeking of clariﬁcations
and exploration of differences in opinions.25

Analysis

Audio recordings of individual interviews and FGDs will be
transcribed verbatim and translated into English. Inductive
thematic analysis of the data will be conducted using the
six consecutive phases described by Braun and Clarke
(2006): familiarization with the data, generation of initial
codes, search for themes, review of themes, deﬁnition and
naming of themes and production of the report.26 A ‘buddy
system’ will be used whereby one researcher will analyze
and code data ﬁrst. A ‘buddy’ will use the codes identiﬁed
by the ﬁrst researcher and apply these to a sample of the
transcripts to check the reliability of coding and enhance
consistency. The ‘one sheet of paper’ (OSOP) method of
analysis will be used to help with the grouping of issues
arising from the data into broader themes.27 Analyses
will be conducted using NVIVO qualitative data analysis
software.28 Results of this qualitative phase will be used to
inform the selection of tools for Phase 2 and the collection
of data on potential risk factors and confounders for
Phase 3.

Phase 2: validation study
Phase 2 is a cross-sectional validation study. We will use Phase
1 outcomes to select CMD screening tools to be formally
validated against a gold standard. In accordance with WHO
guidelines for the translation and adaptation of instruments,
we will conduct pre-testing and cognitive interviewing of
the tools.18 Cognitive interviews will be conducted with a
small group of participants who will be asked to complete
the screening tools. An interviewer will then go through
each item of the screening tools with the participant to
explore how they interpreted each question. This will help
us to understand whether translated screening tools have
been clearly and appropriately translated and assess whether
semantic equivalence has been maintained. Any necessary
modiﬁcations will be made to ensure the tools are culturally
appropriate.18 Next, we will conduct the main validation

component. This will
involve a larger group of partici-
pants. Each participant will be asked to complete a socio-
demographic questionnaire, a number of CMD screening
tools and ﬁnally a diagnostic interview administered by a
trained clinician. The CMD screening tools will be selected
on the basis of Phase 1 results. The Mini-International
Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI),29 which has been widely
used in India and will allow for direct comparison with the
National Mental Health Survey of India,30 will be used as
the diagnostic interview. The MINI will be conducted by an
interviewer who is blinded to screening tool results.

Sample size

At each site, ten women will be included in cognitive inter-
views and a minimum of 150 pregnant, 150 postpartum
and 150 non-perinatal women will be included in the main
validation component. These are the minimum sample sizes
recommended to reliably determine psychometric properties
and assess the validity and reliability of screening tools.31,32

Analysis

Results of cognitive interviews will be in the form of inter-
viewer notes. These will be discussed with expert colleagues
and feedback will be used to develop ﬁnal, translated versions
of the screening tools. In the main validation component,
women diagnosed with CMD on diagnostic interview will be
considered a ‘true’ case. Mean scores on screening tools will
be compared between women with and without true CMD
to test the construct validity of screening tools.33 Sensitivity,
speciﬁcity, positive and negative likelihood ratios and the
proportion of true cases correctly identiﬁed will be calculated

PERINATAL MENTAL HEALTH IN INDIA: PROTOCOL FOR A VALIDATION AND COHORT STUDY

ii39

for each cut-off value of the screening tools. Accuracy of
screening tools will be evaluated using a receiver operating
characteristic (ROC) curve, and reliability will be assessed
using Cronbach’s alpha. Youden’s index, the value at which
[(sensitivity + speciﬁcity)—1] is maximized, will be used to
identify the point of optimal balance between sensitivity and
speciﬁcity and thus be recommended as a cut-off for use
in the local population. Data will be analyzed separately for
pregnant, post-partum and non-perinatal women. Statistical
analyses will be conducted using STATA.34

Phase 3: cohort study
Phase 3 will be a prospective cohort study. At each study
site, we will recruit (i) perinatal women (‘exposed’ group) and
(ii) non-perinatal women (‘unexposed’ group). Women in the
perinatal group will be asked to attend in early pregnancy
(estimated gestational age (EGA) <20 weeks);
in late
pregnancy (EGA >28 weeks); at three months post-partum;
and at six months post-partum. Non-perinatal women will
be followed-up at the equivalent time intervals. At each
visit, participants will be asked to complete CMD screening
tools, which will be selected on the basis of Phase 2 results.
Any woman who screens positive on any screening tool will
require further clinical assessment; those conﬁrmed as having
a mental disorder will be offered treatment and follow-up as
appropriate. The cut-offs for each screening tool used in this
phase will have been determined during the validation study.
At the ﬁrst visit, participants will also be asked to complete a
socio-demographic questionnaire, which will include data on
potential confounders as identiﬁed by reviewing the existing
literature.

Sample size

We calculated that a minimum sample size of 1166 (583
perinatal and 583 non-perinatal) women at each site is
required to demonstrate a 10% difference in the prevalence
of CMD between perinatal and non-perinatal women.35 This
assumes: best-estimate CMD prevalence of 10.7% among
non-perinatal women36 and 20% among perinatal women;5
5% level of signiﬁcance; 80% power for a two-sided test; 85%
retention rate over the study period; and a design coefficient
of 1.29.37 Sample size was based on prevalence calculations
because this is the primary outcome. Furthermore, this
sample size is larger than what is required for risk factor
analysis; our target sample size allows for multivariable
regression models with up to 20 exposure variables.

Analysis

The presence of a mental disorder will be deﬁned by scores
above the cut-off on CMD screening tools. Point prevalence,
period prevalence and incidence of CMD will be estimated

in perinatal and non-perinatal groups as follows. Prevalence
and incidence of CMD will be presented separately for each
type of CMD (e.g. incidence of anxiety; prevalence of depres-
sion) and as a composite measure (e.g. prevalence of CMD).
Univariable logistic regression analyses will be performed to
calculate odds ratios to identify factors associated with CMD.
Potential associated factors will be selected a priori on the
basis of evidence from existing studies. Variables with P-
values <0.10 will be included in a multivariable model built
using forward-stepwise approach. We will use linearized or
robust standard errors to adjust for clustering at the village
level. If there is missing data, a complete case analysis will be
conducted. Statistical advice will be sought during the analysis
stage of the research as required.

Recruitment and consent
Participants will be recruited from community settings in
areas served by the two host institutions. These will include
women living in low-income settings in both urban and
rural areas. Recruitment at each site will be carried out by a
study team of research nurses who will liaise with Accredited
Social Health Activists (ASHAs), Auxiliary Nurse Midwives
(ANMs) and Anganwadi workers at urban and rural sub-
centres and health and nutrition (Anganwadi) centres. Non-
perinatal women will be recruited through the same procedure
as well as through ‘snowballing’, by asking perinatal women
to identify any friends, relatives or neighbours who are of
reproductive age and living in the same communities who are
not currently pregnant and have not given birth within the
past 12 months. Printed information sheets will be available,
but as this is a low-literacy population and based on the prior
research experience of the study team in similar communities,
verbal explanations will form the main mode of information
giving. Verbal explanations will detail the nature and purpose
of the study; what the study will involve for the participant
including the number and duration of visits required; the
implications and constraints of the protocol; what the data in
the study will be used for and any potential risks involved in
taking part. It will be clearly stated that participants are free to
withdraw from the study at any time, for any reason, without
prejudice to future care and with no obligation to provide a
reason for withdrawal. Those who choose to participate will
be asked to sign the informed consent form or provide a
thumbprint.

Ethical considerations
Many of the women included in this study are likely to live in
poverty and many may have low levels of literacy. In the
context of Covid-19,
living conditions and household
incomes have become even more precarious. These vulnera-

ii40

JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH

bilities raise a number of ethical issues. Women we approach
may not have engaged in research studies before and may not
be aware of what participation entails. Care will be taken to
ensure the study is explained clearly and without scientiﬁc
or research jargon to enable women to autonomously
decide whether to take part. Some women may feel coerced
into participating from feelings of obligation,
fear of
discrimination or other assumed negative consequences of
non-participation. Financial compensation for participation
is a contested issue: if compensation is high relative to local
earnings this may create an economic incentive to participate,
complicating the concept of
truly autonomous consent.
However, for women living in poverty loss of earnings is
an important consideration. Women with young children or
other dependents will also be inconvenienced by participation
in the study. We have therefore decided to offer all participants
a payment valued at the equivalent of a daily wage at each
study visit as an appreciation of their time.

As part of the study, we will identify women experiencing
CMD. At both sites, referral mechanisms to mental health
services are in place with capacity to deal with a potential
increase in referrals. Any suspected or conﬁrmed instances
of abuse will be handled using standard operating procedures
(SOP) as used in previous research in perinatal women at the
NIMHANS site. SOPs are in place for two situations: domes-
tic violence and suicidal risk. These include risk assessment
and referral to appropriate agencies and services. We will only
proceed with the research study when it is safe to do so and
when the safety of participants is not jeopardized through
travel or contact with others. We will follow local Covid-19
guidance as issued by collaborating institutions and ensure
that all contact with participants occurs in line with national
guidance. Ethics approval has been granted by the University
of Oxford and DRPGMC Institutional Ethics Committee
(IEC) and is awaited from NIMHANS IEC and India’s Health
Ministry’s Screening Committee.

Discussion

Main findings of this study
The ﬁndings of this study will include: women’s feedback on
the usability and appropriateness of selected CMD screening
tools; women’s views and knowledge around CMD; assess-
ments of the psychometric validity of CMD screening tools
(including sensitivity, speciﬁcity, positive and negative predic-
tive values and optimal cut-offs of screening tools); preva-
lence and incidence of anxiety disorders, depressive disorders,
suicidality, PTSD and somatization disorder among perinatal
and non-perinatal women; and risk factors associated with
these CMD.

What is already known on this topic
Maternal health and mental health are among the most sig-
niﬁcant contributors to persisting inequalities and morbidity
and mortality globally. Perinatal CMD affects a signiﬁcant pro-
portion of women, with the highest burden carried by LMIC.
Conditions such as perinatal depression and perinatal anxiety
are associated with poor maternal and infant outcomes. Early
detection through screening coupled with effective treatment
can improve outcomes. It is essential, however, that screening
tools are locally validated and culturally appropriate to ensure
women with CMD can be identiﬁed.

What this study adds
Data from this study will make a signiﬁcant contribution to
existing knowledge around CMD in women of reproductive
age. This study will provide new knowledge on the identiﬁca-
tion of CMD across both perinatal and non-perinatal women
in Karnataka and Himachal Pradesh. The screening tools we
translate and validate will have potential for use in routine
antenatal and postnatal care in our study settings, which scope
to improve the detection of CMD in our populations. Our
data will provide CMD prevalence and incidence along with
associated risk factors. In particular, our study will shed light
on PTSD and somatization disorder, which have been under-
researched in perinatal populations in LMIC to date. Finally,
by including both perinatal and non-perinatal women, the
study will provide important and novel insights into the role
of the perinatal state as an independent contributor to mental
disorders.

Limitations of this study
A limitation of the study is that we may not cover all income
groups and educational levels among participants recruited
into the study. Another limitation is that our study currently
extends to six months post-partum, which precludes the
investigation of infant outcomes beyond this period that
may be associated with maternal CMD. However, we plan
to seek additional funding to allow for longer follow-up of
women and their infants in order to assess further trends
in women’s mental health and associations with infant and
child outcomes. A potential challenge we may have is attrition
during the cohort study. Many women travel between their
natal home and their partner’s home, which can lead to drop
out from the study. Women recruited in early pregnancy may
also experience pregnancy losses such as abortion. To address
these challenges, robust systems will be developed at the time
of recruitment to the cohort study to include women who
have lived in the area for at least ﬁve years. We will also collect
sufficient contact details to maximize follow-up, for example
through telephone follow-up if necessary.

Conclusion

Improving the understanding, detection and management of
CMD among women is key to improving women’s health
and promoting gender equality. The National Health Mission
of India has established initiatives to include screening for
mental health in maternal health settings.8 In order to do this
effectively, there is a need for validated tools in local languages
for different population groups. In addition, the study will
provide incidence and risk factor data for perinatal CMD from
two different parts of India and a better understanding of the
speciﬁc contribution of the perinatal state to these conditions.
In the longer term, there is potential to examine associations
between perinatal CMD and infant outcomes and to develop
culturally appropriate interventions to effectively prevent and
treat CMD.
