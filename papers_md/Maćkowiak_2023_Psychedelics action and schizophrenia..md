Abstract
Psychedelics are compounds acting by serotonin 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)2A receptor activation and induce several 
behavioral responses. They are of special interest because of their positive effects on neuropsychiatric disorders (depression 
and posttraumatic stress disorder). However, several findings revealed that some psychedelic actions are similar to symptoms 
observed in schizophrenia (psychosis, sensorimotor gating impairments, attention, and working memory deficits) which might 
limit their clinical applications. Psychedelics activate some neurotransmitters, i.e., serotonergic, and glutamatergic, that are 
also impaired in schizophrenia. Therefore, the neurobiological background of psychedelics and schizophrenia is partially 
similar. Another important aspect to discuss is the perspective of using psychedelics in schizophrenia therapy. Postmortem 
studies showed a loss of synapses in schizophrenia, and the positive effects of psychedelics on neuroplasticity (synaptogen-
esis, neurogenesis, and neuritogenesis) might be essential in the context of schizophrenia therapy. However, because of 
psychedelics' psychotic action, the recommended doses of psychedelics in schizophrenia treatment are not established, and 
subpsychedelic dosing or microdosing are considered. Exploratory studies are needed to determine the tolerability of treat-
ment and appropriate dosing regimen. Another therapeutic option is using non-hallucinogenic psychedelic analogs that also 
induce neuroplastic outcomes but do not have psychotogenic effects. Further preclinical and clinical studies are needed to 
recognize the potential effectiveness of 5-HT2A agonists in schizophrenia therapy.

Introduction

Psychedelics  (mind-manifesting)  are  psychoactive  sub-
stances that induce alterations in mood, thought processes, 
perceptions, and experiences rarely experienced except in 
dreams, contemplative and exaltation, and acute psychosis 
(known as psychedelic experiences or psychedelic trips). 
They are also called psychotomimetic (psychosis-mimick-
ing) or psycholytic (psyche-loosing) [1]. Most psychedelics 
derive from plants or semisynthetic and can be classified by 
chemical structure into indolamines and phenethylamines. 
The indolamine group includes lysergic acid diethylamide 
(LSD), semisynthetic ergosterol that naturally occurs as 
ergot alkaloid lysergic acid in the rye parasite; psilocybin, 
a compound found in magic mushrooms, N,N-dimethyl-
tryptamine  (DMT),  the  active  ingredient  in  ayahuasca; 
5-methoxy-N, N-dimethyltryptamine (5-MeO-DMT). The 
phenethylamine group includes mescaline, the active ingre-
dient in the peyote and Sant Pedro cacti, and 2,5-dimethoxy-
4-iodoamphetamine (DOI) [2].

The subjective effects of psychedelics have been assessed 
using the Hallucinogen Rating Scale (HRS) and Abnormal 
Mental States (APZ) questionnaire to measure altered states 
of consciousness (ASC) [3]. HRS elements were placed into 
six conceptually coherent clusters: somaesthesia, affect, per-
ception, cognition, volition, and intensity. ASCs are defined 
by three primary dimensions: oceanic boundlessness (OSE, 
OBN, and OB), dread of ego dissolution (AIA, DED, and 
AED), and visionary restructuralization (VUS, VRS, and 
VR). The first dimension (oceanic boundlessness) measures 
derealization and depersonalization phenomena associated 
with positive basic mood. The second dimension (dread of 
ego dissolution) measures thought disorder, ego disintegra-
tion, and loss of autonomy and self-control associated with 
arousal, anxiety, and paranoid feelings. The third dimension 
(visionary restructuralization) is related to auditory and vis-
ual illusions, hallucinations, synaesthesias, and alterations in 
the meaning of various percepts [4]. ASC scale was revised 
to OAV scales, and later to the five-dimensional altered 
states consciousness (5AD-ASC) [3].

Psychedelics  are  classic  serotonergic  hallucinogens 
acting as an agonist or a partial agonist of the serotonin 
5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)2A receptor. Pharmacological 
studies showed that psychedelic effects in humans depend 
on the activation of  5HT2A receptors, but not dopamine 
 D2 receptors. Pretreatment with ketanserin, an antagonist 
of 5-HT2A/2C receptors, effectively blocked the effects of 
psilocybin on all three dimensions of ASC. Likewise, pre-
treatment with an atypical antipsychotic, a mixed 5-HT2A/D2 
antagonist, risperidone attenuated APZ scores in the psilocy-
bin study, but no effect was observed after administration of 
a typical antipsychotic, haloperidol, a  D2 receptor antagonist 
[5]. Neuroimaging studies in humans also showed significant 
psilocybin 5-HT2A receptor occupancy in the brain that cor-
related with the psychedelic experience [6].

5‑HT2A receptors

5-HT2A receptor is mainly expressed in the frontal cortex 
of humans and rodents, and it is also detectable at relatively 
lower densities in other brain regions, i.e., hippocampus, 
thalamus, and basal ganglia. In the cortex, 5-HT2A recep-
tors are predominantly found on the dendrites of excitatory 
glutamatergic pyramidal neurons [7–9].

There are known several 5-HT2A receptor-coupled sign-
aling  pathways.  The  best-characterized  signaling  path-
way is  Gq/11-mediated activation of a cytoplasmic protein 
phospholipase C (PLC) that cleaves phosphatidylinositol 
4,5-biphosphate  (PIP2), a phospholipid in the plasma mem-
brane, followed by a generation of diacylglycerol (DAG) and 
inositol triphosphate  (IP3).  IP3 evokes the release of  CA2+ 
from the endoplasmic reticulum, and the stimulation of pro-
tein kinase C (PKC) [10–13]. The 5-HT2A receptor can also 

bind to other G proteins and downstream effector pathways. 
The 5-HT2A receptor agonists stimulate phospholipase  A2 
 (PLA2), and the release of arachidonic acid (AA). The acti-
vation of  PLA2 is not dependent on Gq/11 stimulation but 
correlates with Gi/o pathway and Src, and G12/13 activation of 
Rho [14–16]. Activation of the 5-HT2A receptor also induces 
Gi/o-dependent Gβγ-associates stimulation of extracellular 
signal-regulated kinase, p44/p42 (ERK1/2) [17]. There are 
several additional pathways linked to 5-HT2A receptor stimu-
lation, i.e., pERK through β-arrestin [18] or phospholipase 
D (PLD) by the small G-protein ADP-ribosylation factor 
(SRF) activation [19].

Several findings indicate that hallucinogenic responses 
caused by 5-HT2A receptor agonists depend on the activation 
of specific signaling pathways. In vitro study demonstrated 
that hallucinogenic and non-hallucinogenic 5-HT2A recep-
tor agonists stimulate PLC signaling pathways, while hal-
lucinogen-dependent reactions also include pertussis toxin 
(PTX)-sensitive heterotrimeric Gi/o proteins [20]. The results 
from in vivo and in vitro studies indicate that hallucinogens 
selectively activate Gi/o-dependent signaling, whereas non-
hallucinogenic 5-HT2A agonists do not stimulate Gi/o [21].

Biased agonism of the 5-HT2A receptor was also observed 
at the transcription level. Both hallucinogenic and non-hal-
lucinogenic 5-HT2A agonists induced c-Fos and IκBα tran-
scripts. However, transcripts Egr-1 and Egr-2 were activated 
only by hallucinogens (DOI, DOM, DOB, mescaline, LSD, 
psilocin), but not by non-hallucinogenic 5-HT2A agonists 
(R-lisuride, S-lisuride, ergotamine) [20, 22]. Hallucinogen-
characteristic transcriptome fingerprints were dependent on 
the modulation of both Gq/11 and Gi/o. Recent findings indi-
cate that hallucinogenic-like behavioral responses to 5-HT2A 
agonists (head twitch in animals) seem to be related to the 
activation of Gq and Gs pathways. Hallucinogen agonists 
(DOM, 25C-NBOH) activate both Gq and Gs proteins and 
produce a head twitch response. In contrast, non-hallucino-
genic agonists (lisuride and TBG) only activate  Gq signaling 
and do not induce hallucinogenic-like behavior [23].

The above observation suggests that in the case of the 
5-HT2A receptor, a biased agonism related to the diverse 
signal transduction pathways stimulated by 5-HT2A recep-
tor agonists is detected. Thus, the distinct behavioral and 
molecular responses produced by hallucinogenic and non-
hallucinogenic 5-HT2A receptor agonists acting by the same 
population of cortical pyramidal 5-HT2A receptors might be 
explained by that phenomenon.

Schizophrenia

Schizophrenia is a severe, chronic disorder with symptoms 
divided into three groups: positive symptoms (delusions, 
hallucinations, inexplicable behavioral changes, and thought 
disorders),  negative  symptoms  (avolition,  anhedonia, 

1352

asociality, blunted affect, and alogia), and cognitive deficits 
(poor learning, attention and working memory impairments, 
and retention of verbal information) [24–26].

Several findings indicate that schizophrenia is a neurode-
velopmental disorder with first symptoms observed in late 
adolescence or young adulthood. The age of schizophrenia 
appearance depends on sex. In the case of men, the first 
signs are observed around the late teenagers to early 20s, 
in women between 20s and early 30s [27]. The epidemio-
logical studies suggest the beginning of negative symptoms  
approximately five years before the initial psychotic episode, 
and the positive symptoms start close to the first hospitaliza-
tion [28, 29].

The etiology of schizophrenia is still under investigation. 
However, epidemiologic and genetic evidence suggests that 
disease development results from the interaction of genetic 
background with environmental conditions. The above fac-
tors affect brain maturation during early life and adolescence 
[30]. Moreover, impaired epigenetic mechanisms, interact-
ing with environmental risk factors and controlling gene 
expression, are also considered in the etiology of schizo-
phrenia [31].

The  pathophysiology  of  schizophrenia  is  still  being 
explored. However, several neuroanatomical and neurotrans-
mitter abnormalities are detected in schizophrenia. Neuro-
anatomical studies showed no changes in the total number of 
neurons in schizophrenia but an increase in neuronal density 
and a reduction in the neuropil were detected. Shorter den-
dritic length, lower dendritic spines on pyramidal neurons, 
and a decrease in the level of synaptophysin, a marker of 
axon terminals, and lower synaptic vesicle density are also 
noticed [32–36]. Some evidence shows 60% synapse loss in 
schizophrenia [37]. The schizophrenia hypothesis suggests 
that overpruning in synapses, mainly glutamatergic inputs 
onto cortical interneurons, disrupts excitation/inhibition 
(E/I) balance resulting in negative and cognitive symptoms 
development [38].

The above hypothesis is supported by neuroanatomical 
changes implying dysfunction in neurotransmitters, mainly 
excitatory ones. Alterations in the glutamate signaling might 
be related to the dysfunction of glutamatergic receptors i.e., 
the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, α-amino-3-
hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic (AMPA) receptor, 
or metabotropic (mGlu) receptor. Genetic studies speci-
fied genes coding glutamate receptor subunits, GRIN2A 
for NMDA receptor, GRIA1, GRIA3 for AMPA receptor, 
or GRM3 for mGlu3 receptor as schizophrenia risk genes 
[39]. Moreover, the hypofunction of the NMDA receptor is 
postulated based on the effects of non-competitive NMDA 
receptor antagonists, ketamine, and phencyclidine (PCP). 
They were originally developed as dissociative anesthet-
ics, but they are known to induce schizophrenia-like abnor-
malities in healthy humans. The symptoms include not only 

positive ones (psychosis, thought disorder) but also negative 
and cognitive deficits [40]. Antipsychotic effects of drugs 
acting  selectively  through  glutamatergic  signaling  have 
been explored. Classical agonists of the NMDA receptor 
cause excitotoxicity and neuron damage, and they are not 
considered in schizophrenia treatment However, stimula-
tion of NMDA receptor indirectly by glycinergic (serine, 
cycloserine) acting as NMDA coagonists and glycine trans-
port (GlyT1) inhibitors (bitopertin) have been studied. In 
clinical trials, they demonstrate some effects on negative 
symptoms of schizophrenia [41]. Positive allosteric modu-
lators of AMPA or mGlu receptors and mGlu agonists are 
also promising targets for new antipsychotic drugs. How-
ever, they are still under investigation and need evaluation 
in clinical trials [42, 43].

Another hypothesis proposes that disinhibition of excita-
tory cortical projection induces dysregulation of mesostriatal 
dopamine neurons and psychotic symptoms [38]. Positive 
symptoms result from hyperactivity in dopaminergic trans-
mission in limbic pathways, while negative symptoms are 
thought to arise from hypodopaminergic functioning in the 
frontal structures. These interpretations are supported by the 
fact that all antipsychotics have an affinity to the  D2 recep-
tor and most of them are antagonists to this receptor [44]. 
Moreover, gene-associated studies showed a possible rela-
tionship between the risk of schizophrenia and some vari-
ants in genes related to dopamine signaling, i.e., catechol-
O-methyltransferase (COMT), monoamine oxidase (MAO), 
dopamine transporter (SLC6A3), and dystrobrevin-binding 
protein 1 (DTNBP1) [39].

The role of serotonin, the especially 5-HT2A receptor in 
schizophrenia pathogenesis is also considered. This hypoth-
esis is based on the fact that psychedelics causing psycho-
sis are agonists of the 5-HT2A receptor. On the other hand, 
5-HT2A antagonists might have antipsychotic properties, 
mainly in negative symptoms [44]. Alternative 5-HT tar-
gets are also investigated in the context of schizophrenia 
treatment, i.e., 5-HT1A agonists, 5-HT reuptake inhibitors, 
5-HT2C antagonists and agonists, 5-HT3 antagonists, 5-HT6 
antagonists, 5-HT7 antagonists. However, there are still no 
drugs with selective serotonin pharmacological profile used 
in schizophrenia therapy [41].

Postmortem studies examining the level of 5-HT2A pro-
tein showed inconsistent results. The  [3H] ketanserin binding 
study revealed a decrease in the density of 5-HT2A recep-
tors in cortical areas of schizophrenia patients [45]. How-
ever, another  [3H] ketanserin binding examination reported 
an increase in the number of  [3H] ketanserin binding sites 
to the 5-HT2A receptor in the postmortem prefrontal cor-
tex of antipsychotic-free but not in antipsychotic-treated 
schizophrenic subjects [46]. On the other hand, a western 
blot analysis showed no changes in 5-HT2A receptor immu-
noreactivity in the prefrontal cortex in either treated with 

 
Psychedelics action and schizophrenia

antipsychotics or not treated schizophrenia patients but a 
decrease in mRNA level was found only in patients treated 
with antipsychotics [47]. The above findings indicate that the 
level of the 5-HT2A receptor in schizophrenia might depend 
on antipsychotic therapy but also on methods used in stud-
ies. Thus, the role of the 5-HT2A receptor in schizophrenia 
pathomechanism is not definitively defined yet.

Schizophrenia‑like effects of psychedelics

Psychedelics induce schizophrenia-like related symptoms 
i.e., psychosis, sensorimotor gating impairments, and work-
ing memory deficits (Table 1).

Psychosis

Psychosis is a clinical syndrome represented by several 
symptoms i.e., delusions, hallucinations, and thought disor-
der [48]. Psychosis is a common feature of both psychedelic 
actions in normal volunteers and schizophrenia patients.

Psychedelics induce a psychosis-like syndrome in normal 
volunteers that is characterized by ego disturbances, illu-
sions and hallucinations, thought disorders, paranoid think-
ing, and alterations in mood and affect [4, 5, 49]. Several 
psychotic symptoms induced by psychedelics are similar 
to the positive symptoms observed in the initial stages of 
acute schizophrenia episodes. Hallucinations and the loss of 
self-control over thought processes after the administration 
of psychedelics are similar to those experienced in acute 
psychosis  in  schizophrenia.  Moreover,  visual  hallucina-
tions typical for psychedelics are more often in acute than 

chronic schizophrenia [4]. However, hallucinations observed 
either in healthy volunteers using psychedelics or in patients 
with schizophrenia differ in many respects. Hallucinations 
induced by psychedelics are mostly visual, and both elemen-
tary (brightly colored geometric form figures) and complex 
(images of scenes and landscapes) with ordinary (humans, 
animals, and artifacts) and extraordinary entities (chimeras, 
spirits, and aliens). In schizophrenia, hallucinations mostly 
auditory, and visual hallucinations often include life-size 
images (faces, people, objects, events), and they are real, 
detailed, and anchored in space. In both cases, hallucinations 
have strong existential/metaphysical meanings. Usually, real-
ity assessment is not impaired in people using hallucinogens, 
and they can distinguish between psychedelic effects and 
normal consciousness. In contrast, patients with schizophre-
nia have poor reality monitoring and insight. The duration 
of psychotic episodes is also different. Psychedelics induce 
transient psychotic episodes lasting a few hours unlike in 
schizophrenia patients, where the psychotic episodes are 
recurrent, and can last weeks or months [50].

Neuronal activity during psychosis was examined using 
positron emission tomography (PET) and [F-18]-fluorode-
oxyglucose (FDG) that can analyze the organization of the 
human brain with neuronal function [51]. The results of the 
studies showed metabolic hyperfrontality during psychotic 
episodes in healthy volunteers using psychedelics (psilocy-
bin, mescaline) [49, 52]. Hyperfrontal metabolic pattern was 
also associated with positive psychotic symptoms in acute 
unmedicated first-episode schizophrenia [53, 54] and also 
in unmedicated and medicated chronic patients with acute 
psychotic episodes [55, 56]. Thus, hyperfrontality metabolic

changes are associated with acute psychotic episodes in 
schizophrenics and they are also induced by psychedelics, 
with contrasts to hypofrontality observed in patients with 
chronic schizophrenia [57–59].

Sensorimotor gating

Sensorimotor gating ability regulates sensory information 
that is transmitted to motor output systems. Sensory infor-
mation processed centrally requires some degree of filtering 
or gating before accessing and impacting motor output [60]. 
Prepulse inhibition (PPI) of the acoustic startle response has 
been established as an operational measure of sensorimotor 
gating, and the PPI level may indicate the current integ-
rity of sensorimotor gating mechanisms. PPI occurs when 
a relatively weak sensory stimulus (prepulse) is presented 
30–500 ms before a strong startle-induced stimulus (pulse), 
and reduces the magnitude of the startle response. The fun-
damental mechanism initiating this inhibition is thought to 
resemble the normal process of filtering incoming sensory 
stimuli [61]. In humans, startle is measured from the eye 
blink response through electromyographic recordings from 
the orbicularis oculi muscle, and startle to acoustic stimuli 
or tactile stimuli are used [60]. PPI deficits are observed 
in schizophrenia patients [61–63], their unaffected relatives 
[64], and patients with schizotypal personality disorder [65].
Sensorimotor gating functions are modulated by several 
neurotransmitter systems i.e., dopaminergic, glutaminer-
gic, serotonergic, γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic, and 
cholinergic acting in cortical, limbic, striatal and brain-
stem structures [61, 66]. Some studies indicate that, among 
others, 5-HT2A serotonin receptors are involved in proper 
sensorimotor gating and 5-HT2A receptor polymorphisms 
might contribute to the PPI deficits in schizophrenia [67, 
68]. Analysis of  5HT2A receptor polymorphism (A-1438G, 
T102C,  and  H452Y)  showed  that  patients  carrying  the 
T102CTT and the A-1438GAA allele demonstrated higher 
PPI levels than all other variants. Carriers of the T102C-
C/A-1438G-G allele exhibited a significantly lower PPI than 
patients homozygous for the T102C-T/A-1438G-A allele. On 
the other hand, the 5-HT2A receptor H452Y polymorphism 
did not affect startle parameters [68]. Another evidence indi-
cates that epigenetic modifications (DNA methylation) of the 
5-HT2A receptor allele are also involved in 5-HT2A receptor 
regulation, especially in an early stage of disease onset [67]. 
Thus, genetic background and epigenetic mechanism might 
implicate 5-HT2A receptor function in sensorimotor gating.
Hallucinogens are postulated to work by disrupting sen-
sory filtering mechanisms, resulting in sensory overload and 
cognitive dysfunction [4, 69]. The effects of psychedelics on 
PPI were analyzed in humans and obtained results revealed 
diverse effects of psychedelic substances on PPI. DMT did 
not affect PPI at any using interstimulus intervals (ISI) [70]. 

In the case of psilocybin, some studies show an increase 
in PPI at 100 ms ISI [71], while others indicate that the 
effect of psilocybin on PPI was dependent on ISI. Psilocy-
bin reduced PPI at short (30 ms), had no effect at medium 
(60 ms), and increased PPI at long (120–2000 ms) intervals 
[72]. On the other hand, LSD did not demonstrate a similar 
to psilocybin impact on PPI and decreased PPI at 30 ms, 
60 ms, and 120 ms ISI [73]. Thus, hallucinogens alter PPI 
in humans, but the effects depend on the used substance, and 
ISI applied in the studies.

Working memory

Working memory is a limited-capacity, active short-term 
memory system that maintains information to guide and con-
trol behavior [74]. Working memory deficits are a permanent 
cognitive feature of schizophrenia and memory impairments 
are present during the prodromal stage and persist through-
out schizophrenia [74]. Spatial working memory deficits 
were observed in schizophrenic patients in a spatial delayed-
response task (DRT) [75]. Working memory was also stud-
ied in the Sternberg Item Recognition Test (SIRT), and 
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) showed that 
memory impairment in schizophrenic patients was related to 
a reduction in information processing efficiency, especially 
in the dorsal prefrontal cortex, or lack of an increase fMRI 
activation during task presentation was leading to perfor-
mance impairments [76].

Functional genetic variants have a specific impact on cog-
nitive abilities in a normal population. A study of two poly-
morphisms (rs6313 and rs4941573) in the 5-HT2A receptor 
showed that rs4941573 was associated with spatial working 
memory [77]. Some studies indicate that polymorphism in 
the T102C and A-1438G loci of the  5HT2A receptor is cor-
related with working memory impairment in schizophrenia 
patients, and T102C CC and A-1438G GG homozygotes 
have worse performance in working memory tasks [78].

Working memory was also examined in healthy partici-
pants using hallucinogens acting by 5-HT2A receptor (psilo-
cybin and LSD). Psilocybin (0.25 mg/kg) induced spatial 
memory deficits in humans as measured by DRT. These 
deficits were linked to the activation of 5-HT2A, but not 
 D2 receptors [5]. Another finding reported that psilocybin 
(215 μg/kg) reduced attentional tracking ability analyzed in 
a multi-object tracking test but did not affect spatial working 
memory measured in the Spatial Span test from Cambridge 
Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) 
[79]. Ketanserin did not block the effect of psilocybin on 
attentional performance suggesting an involvement of the 
serotonin 5-HT1A receptor in the observed deficits [79]. The 
effect of psilocybin in medium 115 μg and high 250 μg/
kg dose conditions on spatial working memory in the Spa-
tial Span test was also examined by others [80]. Significant

impairments in performance on the task were observed in 
the high-dose condition but not in the medium-dose con-
dition. Working memory was also assessed with the let-
ter N-back task from Penn Computerized Neurocognitive 
Battery, and psilocybin (10, 20, and 30 mg/70 kg) dose-
dependent impaired the performance in the N-back test [81]. 
The above results indicate that the effect of psilocybin on 
working memory might be dependent on the dose used in 
the studies. Another psychedelic, LSD (100 μg) impaired 
working memory examined by Intra/Extra-Dimensional shift 
task (IED) and Spatial Working Memory task (SWM) from 
CANTAB [82]. Ayahuasca users also showed impairments 
in working memory performance tested  in  the  Stenberg 
working memory task, and the Tower of London task [83].
Recent  findings  indicate  that  polymorphism  of  the 
5-HT2A receptor as well as activation of the 5-HT2A recep-
tor by psychedelics might induce the disruption of working 
memory that is observed in schizophrenia patients.

Glutamatergic transmission in psychedelics action

Numerous animal studies showed that the effects of psych-
edelics might be related to other than serotonergic transmis-
sion (Table 1). Early findings indicate that immediate-early 
genes (IEGs), i.e., c-Fos, Arc proteins induced by psych-
edelics, i.e., DOI, are not expressed in the 5-HT2A-positive 
cells [9, 84, 85]. The observed results of DOI action were 
directly relatable to the activation of 5-HT2A, but not the 
5-HT2C receptors [84, 85]. Later studies showed that psych-
edelics (LSD and DOI) evoked c-Fos expression is present in 
cells positive for 5-HT2A mRNA [20], but the lack of 5-HT2A 
immunoreactivity in cells demonstrating DOI-stimulated 
IEGs transcription might suggest an indirect effect of hal-
lucinogens on IEGs activation.

Dysregulation of glutamatergic signaling is indicated to 
be involved in schizophrenia pathogenesis [40], and some 
evidence also implies that glutaminergic transmission is 
involved in the hallucinogenic actions following 5-HT2A 
receptor activation. A recent study showed that psilocybin 
increases glutamate release in the rat frontal cortex [86] and 
human medial prefrontal cortex [87]. Other findings indi-
cated that either an antagonist of the AMPA receptor, GYKI 
52466, or an antagonist of the NMDA glutamate receptor, 
MK-801, attenuated an increase in IEGs expression (Arc, 
c-Fos) induced by DOI [84, 85]. The above results imply 
that ionotropic receptor activation, i.e., NMDA, and AMPA, 
is necessary for transcriptional activities induced by psych-
edelics. Moreover, a recent study revealed that psilocybin 
increased the level of NMDA receptor subunits, mainly 
GluN2B, but it did not affect the protein of AMPA receptor 
subunits (GluA1, GluA2) in the rat frontal cortex [86]. The 
above findings indicate that ionotropic glutamate receptors 
might play an essential role in the action of psychedelics.

Electrophysiological studies revealed that enhancement 
of 5-HT2A receptor-induced glutamatergic transmission in 
the prefrontal cortex was suppressed by activation of glu-
tamatergic metabotropic receptor mGlu2/3 [88, 89] and an 
agonist of mGlu2/3 also reduced DOI-induced c-Fos expres-
sion [89]. The above findings suggest that the activation of 
presynaptic mGlu2 autoreceptors blocked the stimulation 
of glutamatergic transmission induced by hallucinogenic 
5-HT2A receptor agonists [90]. Another evidence implies 
that  crosstalk  between  5-HT2A  and  mGlu2  receptors  is 
related to their presence in the postsynaptic part of corti-
cal pyramidal neurons. The G-protein coupled receptors 
(GPCRs) studies in mouse and human cortex showed that 
 Gq11-coupled 5-HT2A and the  Gi/o -coupled mGlu2 receptor 
form a specific GPCR heteromeric complex [20, 91, 92]. 
5-HT2A-mGlu2 receptor complex seems to be essential for 
the hallucinogenic-like behaviors caused by  5HT2A agonists 
i.e., head-twitch in animals. 5-HT2A receptor agonist (DOI, 
LSD) did not induce head-twitch behavior in mGlu2 knock-
out mice [93]. Moreover, behavioral responses of 5-HT2A 
receptor activation were returned in mice with overexpres-
sion mGlu2 in the frontal cortex using a viral (HSV)-medi-
ated transgene expression method [92].

The results from animal studies have great translational 
potential since postmortem analysis of the frontal cortex of 
schizophrenic subjects revealed the changes in the expres-
sion of 5-HT2A and mGlu2 receptors [46, 92, 94]. Moreover, 
functional crosstalk between 5-HT2A and mGlu2 receptors 
was also found in schizophrenia because the activation of 
 Gq11 signaling by mGlu2 receptor agonist was dysregulated 
in the postmortem frontal cortex of schizophrenic subjects 
[94].  Thus,  an  interaction  between  5-HT2A  and  mGlu2 
receptors could be a relevant explanation of the mechanism 
involved in psychosis and schizophrenia treatment [95].

5‑HT2A receptor as a target in schizophrenia 
treatment

5‑HT2A receptor antagonists

Antipsychotics are a group of drugs used in schizophrenia 
therapy. They are divided based on data of release (first vs. 
second generation), efficacy, and side effects. However, all 
antipsychotics share a blockade of the  D2 receptor as a nec-
essary mechanism for their action [96]. They are predomi-
nantly useful in positive symptoms of schizophrenia and 
have serious limitations in therapy including low effective-
ness for negative symptoms and cognitive deficits, and side 
effects (for example weight gain, metabolic disturbances, 
extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), akathisia, hyperprolactine-
mia, and sleep disturbances) [97].

First-generation antipsychotics (chlorpromazine and halo-
peridol) are characterized by their relatively high-affinity 

1356

M. Maćkowiak 

antagonism at the  D2 receptor, and they are efficacious on 
positive symptoms of schizophrenia. In contrast, most sec-
ond-generation antipsychotics (clozapine, risperidone, and 
olanzapine) have relatively lower  D2 receptor antagonism 
but they possess relatively higher 5-HT2A receptor antago-
nism that is supposed to increase their efficacy in the treat-
ment of negative and cognitive abnormalities in schizophre-
nia [97]. Recently, a new antipsychotic, lumateperone has 
been approved by the Drug and Food Administration (FDA). 
Lumateperone is an antagonist of 5-HT2A and postsynaptic 
 D2 receptors but also acts as a partial agonist of the presyn-
aptic dopamine  D2 receptor. Similar to other second-gener-
ation antipsychotics, it has a higher affinity for the 5-HT2A 
receptor compared to the  D2 receptor. Clinical studies reveal 
that lumateperone significantly reduces positive and nega-
tive schizophrenia symptoms and does not present EPS and 
metabolic adverse effects usually observed in antipsychotic 
treatment [98, 99]. Thus, lumateperone seems to be a prom-
ising option for schizophrenia therapy in patients with meta-
bolic dysfunction and intolerance to EPS.

A meta-analysis study indicated that 5-HT2A antagonists 
could be useful in the treatment of negative symptoms of 
schizophrenia [100]. Recent findings also suggest that the 
antipsychotic affinity for the 5-HT2A receptor is not signifi-
cantly associated with specific side effects i.e., sedation, 
EPS, prolactin increase, and weight gain [101].

Clinical use of selective antagonists of the 5-HT2A recep-
tor in schizophrenia pharmacotherapy has not been approved 
by FDA. 5-HT2A antagonists, such as roluperidone (MIN-
101), eplivanserin (SR46349B), fananserin, and ritanserin, 
were checked in clinical trials, however, their effectiveness 
in schizophrenia treatment was not satisfactory [97]. At 
this moment, there are no FDA-approved non-dopaminer-
gic antipsychotics for schizophrenia therapy. On the other 
hand, pimavanserin, a reverse agonist of the 5-HT2A recep-
tor with affinity to 5-HT2C but not the  D2 receptor, is used 
in the treatment of hallucinations and delusions associated 
with Parkinson’s disease psychosis [97]. Moreover, com-
bined treatment of pimavanserin with a subeffective dose of 
risperidone increased the therapeutic effects and enhanced 
the safety of risperidone treatment in schizophrenia [102]. 
Thus, the 5-HT2A receptor might be a promising target in 
schizophrenia pharmacotherapy but an affinity and antago-
nism only to the 5-HT2A receptor are not sufficient to get full 
antipsychotic effects.

5‑HT2A receptor agonists

Hallucinogenic  properties  of  5-HT2A  agonists  exclude 
schizophrenia from the current list of potential therapeutic 
targets of psychedelics. Given the historical background of 
the administration of psychedelics to schizophrenia patients 
in the 1950s and 1960s showing their psychotomimetic and 

hallucinogenic properties [103, 104], their clinical appli-
cations require extreme caution. However, in some stud-
ies from the 1950s and 1960s, psychedelic administration 
to young people with autism and schizophrenia improved 
symptoms domain called today as negative symptoms. What 
is more, exacerbation of psychosis was not always observed 
[105, 106].

At present, people with a personal family history of psy-
chosis are generally excluded from clinical trials of psyche-
delic compounds [107]. However, there are some presump-
tions that 5-HT2A agonists might be worthy of consideration 
in schizophrenia therapy, especially when negative symp-
toms and cognitive deficits are predominant in the features 
of the disorder [108], and these deficits are associated with 
structural brain changes, i.e., significant cortical thinning 
[109–111], reduction gray matter volume [112], reduction in 
synaptic proteins and synaptic loss [33, 113]. In the context 
of the above neuroanatomical changes observed in schizo-
phrenia, the 5-HT2A receptor agonist's ability to produce 
rapid and long-lasting changes in neural plasticity might 
be essential from the perspective of schizophrenia therapy. 
Several findings indicate that psychedelics (DOI, psilocybin, 
LSD, DMT) increase dendritic arbor complexity, promote 
dendritic spine growth and stimulate synapse formation 
[114–118]. The above alterations are related to the neuro-
trophic effects of psychedelics. They increase neurotrophic 
factor levels, i.e., brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) 
and activate its receptor TrkB [115, 119–122]. Neurotro-
phin levels are impaired in schizophrenia and antipsychotic 
therapy has diverse effects on their level [123]. Thus, psy-
chedelic treatment might have positive outcomes on synapse 
loss and cognitive deficits observed in schizophrenia by nor-
malizing neurotrophin levels.

Evidence  indicates  that  the  window  of  neuroplastic 
effects for psychedelics is between a few hours to a few days, 
although some neuroplasticity alterations might be observed 
for at least a month [124]. Psychedelics also induce long-
lasting transcriptomic and epigenomic changes, and most of 
them are related to genes associated with synaptic plasticity 
(axonogenesis, synapse organization, synapse assembly). 
However, some of them are correlated with genetic risk for 
schizophrenia development (Cntnap2, Nfasc, Drd2, Grin2b, 
Prkca, Slc1a2) [114, 125, 126].

The potential benefits of using 5-HT2A receptor agonists 
in schizophrenia treatment cause a discussion about strate-
gies for avoiding the psychotogenic effects of psychedelics 
while maintaining neuroplastic effects. At the doses used in 
the therapy of psychiatric disorders, all psychedelic drugs 
induce the “trip”. The patients required observation up to 
24 h after treatment [127]. Presently, the doses used in clini-
cal studies with psilocybin are 20–25 mg/70 kg for adults 
selected to stimulate evidently, subjectively experienced 
effects on perception, cognition, and mood [107]. On the 

 
Psychedelics action and schizophrenia  

1357

other hand, some findings indicate that psychedelics might 
be used in microdoses to get therapeutical effects [128, 129]. 
Psychodelic microdose is defined as 10% of the dose induc-
ing psychedelic effects in the average adult, i.e., for psilo-
cybin 2.0–2.5 mg [130]. Psychedelic microdosing could be 
operated in schizophrenia treatment without inducing psy-
chotic effects. However, further studies will be needed to 
determine the appropriate dose and dosing regimen given 
therapeutic benefits in improving negative and cognitive 
symptoms with the absence of psychotogenic effects, and 
also tolerability of treatment [107].

Pharmacological studies showed that some 5-HT2A ago-
nists do not possess hallucinogenic properties [131] and they 
have different transcriptome fingerprints [22]. Moreover, 
some evidence indicates that non-hallucinogenic psychedelic 
analogs might be a therapeutic option because of their abil-
ity to induce neuroplastic effects without a trip [132–134]. 
However, more studies are needed to verify their useful-
ness in the treatment of negative or cognitive schizophrenia 
dysfunction.

Thus, psychedelic microdosing or non-hallucinogenic 
agonist administration might be considered an alternative 
therapeutic option in schizophrenia treatment. However, 
at present 5-HT2A agonists are not used for treatment of 
patients with  schizophrenia.

and clinical investigations are necessary to confirm the effec-
tiveness of psychedelics in schizophrenia treatment.

Summary and conclusions

References

The studies of using psychedelics in clinical therapy of psy-
chiatric disorders started in the 1950s and 1960s but revealed 
that psychedelic behavioral effects shared some similarities 
with schizophrenia symptoms. Subsequent biochemical stud-
ies in animal models indicated that there is a certain likeness 
between psychedelics and schizophrenia pathophysiological 
background, including 5-HT2A receptor polymorphism in 
schizophrenia, and glutamatergic transmission dysfunction 
in both cases. However, in the case of psychedelics, an inter-
action between 5-HT2A and mGlu2 receptors seems to play 
an important role in the hallucinogen's appearance, in schiz-
ophrenia hypofunction of the NMDA receptor is suggested. 
At present, there is a lot of data showing an opportunity to 
use psychedelics in therapy for several psychiatric disorders 
(depression or posttraumatic stress disorders), but their use 
in schizophrenia treatment is still uncertain. The neuroplas-
tic effects of hallucinogens and non-hallucinogens 5-HT2A 
agonists would be of interest in the treatment of negative 
and cognitive deficits in schizophrenia, and the safest option 
would be to use non-hallucinogenic ones. Currently, there is 
not enough data to predict the further application of 5-HT2A 
agonists in schizophrenia treatment, although it might be a 
beneficial target for new therapies. Additional preclinical
