Abstract
Excessive use of social media (SM) platforms and digital technology (DT), often driven by habitual scrolling
due to adaptive feed experiences, has been linked to anxiety, sleep disturbances, and obsessive-compulsive
behaviors while also exacerbating mental health concerns. Yet, the role of "digital detox", defined as a
voluntary reduction or temporary cessation of device use, remains only partially understood as both a
clinical and lifestyle intervention. This comprehensive scoping review was conducted to consolidate existing
research on digital detox interventions and evaluate contextual factors that may influence their
effectiveness for mental health and well-being.

A targeted keyword search for "digital detox" was conducted in the PubMed database on December 12, 2024,
yielding 34 initial results. This review followed the approach recommended by the Preferred Reporting Items
for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) to identify, screen,
and extract evidence from relevant studies as per pre-specified inclusion criteria. A total of 14 studies were
found eligible, and data from these studies and their relevant references (totaling 640 citations) were
extracted and synthesized. Our findings suggest that digital detox interventions may alleviate depression
and problematic internet use, and individuals with higher baseline symptom severity appear to derive higher
benefits. However, the impact on broader outcomes such as life satisfaction and overall well-being remains
variable. Divergent intervention approaches, ranging from short-term SM abstinence to sustained, moderate
device restrictions and individual differences in baseline severity of symptoms, coping styles, environmental
pressures, and support systems, may contribute to different outcomes across various studies and systematic
reviews. Overall, age, gender, baseline mental health, and range and duration of DT usage prior to detox are
the key variables that may determine the effectiveness of digital detox interventions. Tailored DT usage in
moderation, aligned with each individual's age, developmental stage, and academic needs, has greater
benefits among younger populations, particularly adolescents and young adults, while mindful and
regulated SM use is especially advantageous for female populations. However, other populations could also
benefit, provided interventions address self-regulation challenges specific to adult lifestyles.

Given the growing global prevalence of problematic smartphone use (PSU) and its documented comorbidity
with psychiatric disorders, digital detox strategies have the potential to be integrated into clinical
recommendations and policy initiatives. However, a framework for assessing intervention quality and long-
term outcomes is essential.

Introduction And Background
In today's digital era, social media (SM) platforms and digital technology (DT) have become an integral part
of our lives; these serve as primary avenues for communication, self-expression, academics, and work [1-3].
However, these platforms are often engineered to exploit human desires through features such as adaptive
feed experiences, which refer to personalized, algorithm-driven content [3]. While this can create a highly
engaging, customized experience, it also encourages habitual scrolling and unregulated prolonged device
use by continuously presenting content that the user finds appealing or challenging to ignore [4].

Problematic smartphone use (PSU), defined as excessive or uncontrolled smartphone behavior that may lead
to harm or impair daily functioning, often affects younger populations [5]. A systematic review and meta-
analysis of 109 studies from 2012 to 2022 covering a total of 97,748 individuals estimated the global pooled
prevalence of PSU at 37.1% (95% confidence interval (CI): 33.5%-40.8%), showing a steady rise over time
despite regional and measurement variations [6]. PSU and unregulated SM use are linked with a range of

adverse outcomes, including body image concerns and diminished self-esteem, mental health challenges,
obsessive-compulsive behaviors, poor sleep quality, reduced school performance, and lower productivity [7-
11]. Extensive research supports this concerning trend, with meta-analyses showing significant correlations
between problematic SM use and increased levels of depression, anxiety, and stress [12,13], as well as a link
between PSU and a decline in academic achievement [14].

A key factor contributing to these problems is technostress, which arises from the excessive or misuse of
technology [15]. Technostress manifests as negative emotional and physiological responses, including
anxiety, irritability, frustration, and exhaustion, and is driven in large part by the "fear of missing out"
(FOMO). FOMO compels individuals to remain continuously connected with SM or DT in order to avoid
missing important information or social interactions [15]. This drive is further reinforced by immediate
gratification through the rewarding effect of browsing, e.g., likes and comments and continuous streams of
novel content on SM, which stimulates the dopaminergic system, reinforcing prolonged engagement and
addictive behaviors [16,17].

DT serves as a primary means of communication for young people, who heavily rely on images to express
themselves. The rise of DT and SM has intensified the appearance culture, promoting idealized models and
fostering unregulated behavior and excessive social and body image comparison [18,19]. This digital
environment exploits the vulnerabilities of adolescents, stimulating desires for experimentation and
reinforcing cultural beliefs that can lead to deviant or pathological behaviors related to self-esteem and
mental health [18]. For instance, a secondary analysis of the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development
(ABCD) Study found that mobile phone ownership and frequent SM use among pre-teens were associated
with increased risks of substance use, including alcohol, nicotine/tobacco, and cannabis, over an 18-month
period [20]. Additionally, excessive smartphone use is associated with poor sleep quality and bedtime and
academic procrastination [21]. Research involving school and university students from several countries has
revealed that excessive SM and DT use is significantly associated with poor sleep quality,
intermittent/anxious sleep patterns, and daily function [19,21-24].

Despite these concerns, SM remains an integral part of our daily lives, offering benefits such as enhanced
social connections, reduced loneliness, and safe spaces for marginalized groups such as LGBTQ+ individuals
[25]. In response to rising mental health issues linked to digital use [26,27], many experts advocate for bans
and severe restrictions on SM and DT [28,29]. In Australia, children under 16 will be prohibited from using
various SM platforms by 2025 following the federal parliament's legislation through the Online Safety
Amendment (SM Minimum Age) Bill 2024, which aims to enhance protections during critical developmental
stages [30]. However, a recent study from South Australia has indicated that such restrictions may have
limited short-term benefits and do not address the underlying psychological mechanisms driving
problematic phone use [31]. Instead of merely enforcing bans, experts suggest leveraging targeted emotion
regulation strategies to help adolescents navigate the digital social environment effectively [25,31-
34]. Additionally, escalating mental distress is not limited to those under 16; a meta-analysis assessing the
global prevalence of depression and anxiety symptoms among college students found high rates, with 33.6%
experiencing depression and 39% reporting anxiety symptoms [35]. These findings necessitate the need for
intervention programs that focus on enhancing self-regulation skills to reduce smartphone addiction and
improve sleep quality and overall physical and mental well-being among all youth populations, including
adolescents and young adults [36]. Addressing these challenges through targeted personalized digital detox
strategies and emotional regulation, rather than exclusive restrictive measures, may offer a more practical
approach to mitigating the mental health impacts of DT use [36].

The concept of digital detox, which refers to disconnecting DT and SM use, has recently emerged as a
possible way to address these issues [15,37]. However, its definition varies among experts and citations, and
usually, terms such as break, abstinence, disconnection, timeout, detox, or unplugging are used [38]. The
clinical application of digital detox, which implies temporarily and voluntarily reducing or eliminating DT
and SM use, has recently been proposed, but mainly for the working population [15]. Although initial
findings and anecdotal reports suggest that digital detox practices may improve mental well-being, the
evidence is still fragmented. Many concepts are not fully understood, such as preferred strategies, support
systems, and the populations that could benefit the most [15,39]. As of December 2024, there was no
Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) on PubMed for digital detox [40]. This comprehensive scoping review seeks
to consolidate and clarify what is currently known, identify key gaps in the research, and guide the
development of future systematic reviews, practical takeaways, and strategies to promote mental health in
our increasingly connected world.

The key objectives of this review are to (i) examine the range of mental health and well-being indicators
influenced by digital detox and (ii) determine the contextual factors that may modulate the priority or
impact of digital detox strategies and interventions. We hypothesize that digital detox interventions employ
a variety of methodological approaches and outcome measures to evaluate their effects on mental health
and well-being. Additionally, we anticipate that specific characteristics of these interventions, such as type,
duration, modality, and support mechanisms, along with contextual factors such as demographic
characteristics, baseline technology use, baseline well-being, and cultural context, influence their
effectiveness.

A previous systematic review found that only about 30% of the eligible studies related to digital detox
keywords across multiple databases were of high quality [38]. Given the emerging nature of the digital detox
concept and the absence of a dedicated MeSH term for "digital detox" in PubMed as of December 2024, we
utilized a focused keyword search using all fields for the keyword "digital detox" within the PubMed database
to capture a comprehensive list of relevant and high-quality peer-reviewed medical literature.

Review
A literature search conducted using the keyword "digital detox" on the PubMed database without any filters
on December 12, 2024, yielded 34 results. Table 1 details the eligibility criteria for screening these 34
citations for data extraction.

TABLE 1: Eligibility criteria for data extraction

The search included articles on PubMed published from inception until December 12, 2024.

This review followed a structured approach to identify, screen, and extract evidence from relevant studies in
accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for
Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) [41]. Two independent reviewers conducted the initial Phase 1
(title/abstract) and subsequent Phase 2 (full-text) screening. Two reviewers then completed data extraction,
and two additional reviewers performed quality checks to ensure accuracy and consistency. Any
discrepancies were resolved through discussion or consulting a third reviewer when necessary.

A total of 16 citations were excluded from Phase 1 screening (review of abstract) due to their lack of focus
related to the aims or objectives of this scoping review. Specifically, 10 citations did not include any
characteristics and implementation components of digital detox strategies to enhance well-being or mental
health [42-51]. Additionally, one study was excluded as it focused solely on an individual digital detox app
[52]. Some articles addressed forced digital overuse, such as that experienced during lockdowns or isolation
periods during the pandemic [53-55], and a few of them also included outcomes unrelated to well-being or
mental health [56,57]. Two review articles were excluded from Phase 2 screening as the non-inclusion of any
characteristics and implementation components of digital detox strategies to enhance well-being or mental
health was only reflected in full-text review [58,59]. Two additional studies were excluded from Phase 2
screening of full texts as the digital detox interventions were studied only for screen time reduction and not
for effect on mental health or well-being measures [60,61].

A total of 14 citations met the eligibility criteria and were deemed eligible by two independent reviewers
[62-75]. Two additional reviewers subsequently extracted data to formulate the narrative for this review,
with quality checks conducted by a third reviewer. One of the included original quantitative studies, "Digital
detox: the effect of smartphone abstinence on mood, anxiety, and craving", which was published in 2019
[74], issued a corrigendum in 2020 [75]. Data were extracted from the original articles and verified with the
corrigendum to ensure accuracy and completeness. Figure 1 illustrates the PRISMA flowchart for the overall
results of both Phase 1 and Phase 2 screenings.

Range of mental health and well-being indicators influenced by digital
detox interventions: why digital detox matters?

A growing body of evidence suggests that digital detox interventions, i.e., voluntary breaks or reduced and
mindful usage of digital devices, can positively influence various mental health and well-being indicators,
including stress, anxiety, depression, subjective well-being, and life satisfaction [62,64,65,71]. One emerging
concept is "digital dementia", wherein excessive reliance on digital devices (e.g., smartphones) may also
contribute to attention deficits, memory loss, and cognitive overload, potentially impairing sleep quality,
emotional regulation, and performance at school or work [62,66]. By deliberately reducing digital use, along
with applying mindful approaches to digital usage, individuals can aim to restore a healthier "tech-life"
balance, which can prevent or mitigate cognitive deterioration [62]. Another behavior closely linked to
habitual scrolling is "phubbing", which involves prioritizing smartphone use over interpersonal interactions,
including within couples or families. The perceived stress caused by being "phubbed" can also diminish
relationship satisfaction and, in turn, negatively affect sleep quality [63]. Implementing digital detox
strategies may help relieve stress and improve well-being for both those who engage in phubbing and those

who experience it, ultimately fostering stronger social connections and improving sleep quality. This effect
would be especially pronounced when paired with relationship-focused and stress management
interventions that directly address phubbing by partners, parents, or children [63].

Studies have reported that "digital detox" can positively affect a broad range of outcomes, such as reduced
procrastination, boredom, stress, depression, and anxiety, as well as enhanced self-regulation, self-control,
sleep quality, and overall life satisfaction, which were estimated soon after the intervention period, which
often ranged from a week to a few months [65,68-70,73-75]. While some individuals may experience
temporary feelings of alienation, craving, or increases in screen time for other activities (such as watching
television), many adapt and ultimately report beneficial shifts in addictive behaviors and health-related
measures [68,70,74]. Notably, unlike substance addictions, voluntary abstinence from smartphone and SM
usage has been associated with only craving without an increase in negative mood or anxiety and rather an
improvement in these negative affect states [70,74,75]. However, it is worth noting that excessive or
inappropriate technology use, rather than typical, balanced usage, remains the primary risk factor for
adverse outcomes, suggesting that targeted digital detox strategies can be effective tools for promoting
mental health, preventing digital dementia, and supporting overall well-being [64,65,67,68,71].

Contextual factors that may modulate the impact of digital detox
interventions: where do they matter the most?

The effectiveness and priority of digital detox interventions can vary widely depending on a range of
contextual factors, including demographic characteristics (e.g., age and gender), baseline technology use,
baseline well-being, and cultural context [62,65,70,71]. Adolescents and young adults, for example, undergo
critical periods of brain development characterized by heightened neuroplasticity and susceptibility to
immediate rewards, making them more vulnerable to negative outcomes from excessive screen time [62].
Moreover, initial findings in adolescent populations suggest that girls may derive greater benefit from
digital detox interventions than boys [64], in line with literature showing heightened vulnerabilities and
distinct developmental windows for depressive and anxiety symptoms as well as emotion regulation among
female adolescents [76]. Conversely, targeted use of DT may offer cognitive benefits in older adults through
specific applications. Additionally, working adults may benefit from more robust self-regulatory capacities
but could face different challenges in balancing personal or professional demands [62].

In one of the most robust systematic reviews and meta-analyses to date on digital SM detox, Ramadhan et
al. synthesized evidence from 12 studies in 2024, including randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and non-
randomized experimental designs [65]. The RCTs were largely low-risk across key domains, and the non-
randomized studies were moderate- to high-quality. This systematic review reveals both the potential
benefits and the complexities of implementing digital detox interventions in diverse contexts [65]. While
digital detox may significantly reduce depressive symptoms, the effect on broader outcomes such as stress,
life satisfaction, and mental well-being is often inconclusive. This discrepancy appears partly attributable to
heterogeneous intervention durations (e.g., short-term versus sustained reduction), definitional variations
(e.g., total abstinence versus partial limits on specific platforms), and individual differences in baseline
severity of symptoms, coping styles, and environmental pressures. For instance, individuals presenting with
higher levels of depression at the outset tended to benefit more versus those with milder symptoms, where
the effects were statistically and not clinically significant. Additionally, external stressors and local cultural
factors (e.g., societal norms around technology use and lack of availability of offline social resources) could
overshadow the positive impact of detox, highlighting the importance of tailoring interventions to specific
demographic and psychological needs. These findings highlight the necessity for more targeted research,
particularly subgroup analyses and longitudinal studies that can pinpoint which populations and settings
stand to gain the most from digital detox strategies alongside the development of standardized measures
that capture the complex nature of well-being beyond depressive symptomatology.

The geographical location (urban versus rural) and social environment (e.g., phubbing and relationship
satisfaction) also appear to play a critical role in shaping individual responses to digital detox efforts. For
instance, a narrative review from 78 high-quality studies noted that high-exposure urban settings may
intensify digital dementia risk through attention deficits, memory loss, and academic challenges. In
contrast, regions with less connectivity might see different usage patterns or priorities [62]. Meanwhile, as
phubbing behaviors can negatively affect sleep quality by increasing perceived stress and lowering
relationship satisfaction, digital detox strategies could facilitate emotional and social support [63]. Together,
these studies suggest that cultural norms, socioeconomic factors, and the availability of emotional support
and social connections can further influence whether a detox strategy will reduce stress and improve well-
being or merely shift usage patterns to different platforms [62,64,67]. Moreover, current research often
overlooks minority and marginalized populations, such as ethnic minorities and LGBTQ+ groups, or in rural
settings for low-income nations, limiting the generalizability of existing findings [64,65,68].

Characteristics of effective digital detox interventions: how to
implement?

Effective digital detox interventions share several key attributes, including appropriate duration, modality,

2025 Setia et al. Cureus 17(1): e78250. DOI 10.7759/cureus.78250

and support mechanisms. For instance, some strategies emphasize short-term breaks (e.g., a few days of
complete SM abstinence), whereas others advocate for more moderate but sustained reductions (e.g.,
limiting daily usage or disabling specific applications) [62,64,65,71]. Evidence suggests that personalized
approaches, such as tailoring time limits based on individual habits and needs, can enhance adherence and
reduce negative feelings (e.g., craving and loneliness) [66,69,70,72,73]. Incorporating support systems,
whether through guided group sessions, professional counseling, or digital tools (e.g., monitoring apps such
as ioS Screen Time, Forest, Android Digital Well-Being, Moment, Detox, Quality, Space, Pfftime, and
notifications off), further boosts efficacy by helping users manage cravings and maintain motivation [69,73].
Additionally, pairing digital detox with alternative activities, such as mindfulness, exercise, or social
engagement, improves emotional resilience and deter compensatory screen use [67,68]. Finally,
interventions that explicitly address different life stages, parental controls for children, or relationship
dynamics (e.g., partner phubbing) are more likely to yield sustainable changes in well-being [62,63]. Overall,
a flexible, context-specific, and supportive approach, rather than a one-size-fits-all method, is crucial for
successful digital detox outcomes [67].

Discussion on clinical implications and applications for digital detox
based on findings of this review

Recent estimates suggest that children aged 8-12 spend about 4-6 hours each day on their devices, which
increases to around nine hours per day for teenagers and young adults [77]. A growing body of evidence
highlights the high comorbidity between PSU and common psychiatric disorders, especially with depression,
but also with anxiety and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) [10,78]. A meta-analysis of 17 case-control
studies (18 datasets, 24,019 participants) found that 36.5% of university students had PSU, which was
significantly associated with higher rates of depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation (odds ratio: 2.4 and
2.18, respectively) [79]. Another meta-analysis of 41 studies (41,871 participants) found that about one in
four children and young people exhibit PSU, which was significantly associated with higher odds of
depression, anxiety, perceived stress, and poor sleep quality (odds ratio: 3.17, 3.05, 1.86, and 2.60,
respectively) [80]. The co-occurrence of PSU with numerous mental health disorders reinforces the
importance of considering PSU in broader mental health assessment and treatment, as well as strategies for
the prevention of PSU [36,78].

Regarding assessment, neither the International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-11 nor the Diagnostic and
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)-5 officially recognize PSU or SM addiction as a standalone
diagnosis, although they are identified as an area requiring further research [81-83]. It is possible that these
problems will be considered in future guides for diagnostic formulations (e.g., gaming disorder is now
included in the ICD-11). Lin et al. demonstrated that smartphone addiction shares the core DSM-5
diagnostic factors of substance and non-substance use disorders and have proposed the following diagnostic
criteria for smartphone addiction: compulsive behavior, functional impairment, withdrawal, and tolerance
[84]. However, although terms such as "regular use", "unhealthy use", "addiction", and "use disorder" are often
used interchangeably, they refer to different concepts [77]. DSM-5 describes "use disorder" in the context of
substance addictions based on criteria such as tolerance, cravings, withdrawal, and continued use despite
negative consequences. SM use has risen significantly among children, adolescents, and young adults over
the past decade, yet the study of behavioral addictions lags behind substance use disorder research [81].

In this developing field, the term "unhealthy use" has been described by Xu et al. for any behavior that raises
the risk of harm, whether or not it meets the formal criteria for an addiction. Consequently, "unhealthy use"
can serve as a practical term for identifying problematic screen behaviors and guiding preventive
interventions [77], irrespective of diagnostic classifications. Should clinical criteria and DSM classification
for PSU or problematic DT or SM use become established, "digital detox" would be a salient consideration in
treatment protocols, following a similar trend to other interventions for behavioral addictions.

Treatment addressing PSU and SM addiction may need to consider a wide range of interrelated difficulties
associated with technology use. Although there is a distinction between digital (a broader focus on all digital
devices) and SM detox, the two concepts often overlap in literature [72]. For example, one of the studies
included in this review among university students in Lebanon suggested that Instagram is among the most
difficult platforms to quit, highlighting the distinct challenges posed by SM use relative to broader
technology habits [72]. Hence, clinicians should approach youth openly and without judgment when
discussing screen time and social media use, as disentangling unnecessary and potentially harmful use from
the use required to engage in day-to-day experiences is incredibly complex. By cultivating a safe space to
engage in simple conversations about the role of technology in a patient's life, for example, by asking if they
have their own phone, how much time they spend online, how SM affects their mood, and if they
experienced or witnessed cyberbullying, sexting, etc., clinicians may identify potential "unhealthy use' and
determine whether a digital detox might be beneficial [77].

Although digital detox remains a promising intervention, its efficacy may hinge on factors such as the
severity of the user's dependence, supportive networks, and the individual's broader psychological context
[85,86]. Collectively, findings from the studies reviewed here reinforce the importance of exploring diverse
approaches to mindful use of DT and SM along with strategies to boost emotional health and social
connections [36,64]. As shown in Figure 2, a variety of digital detox strategies can be integrated into

treatment or used by individuals for everyday life.

In particular, pragmatic approaches to digital detoxes and aligned strategies, which meet individuals where
they are, promise the most mental health benefits. Mindful digital downtime, which refers to strategically
withdrawing from devices or apps, has been associated with reductions in depressive symptoms and other
indicators of distress [65]. This approach could be most effective when individuals focus on limiting the most
problematic apps (e.g., TikTok and Instagram) [72,85-86] along with graduated and strategic reductions in
DT usage instead of uniform abstinence [67]. Education and counseling on both the potential harms of
unhealthy use of DT and the benefits of digital detox can further empower families and youth to make
informed decisions and adopt healthier technology habits [87]. This approach helps them develop self-
regulation skills and gradually assume greater autonomy over technology use [87].

Integrating digital detox strategies into existing mental health services could also help people develop
healthier coping mechanisms, particularly those with pre-existing depression, anxiety, attention deficits, or
mild cognitive impairments linked to excessive screen use [62,64,65]. Mindfulness-based techniques in
therapy sessions and support groups should address both the habit of overreliance on technology and the
underlying emotional or cognitive vulnerabilities that reinforce it [67,68]. In other words, treatment should
address the etiology of multiple co-occurring issues and integrate consideration of the ways in which they
transact in case conceptualization.

Relationship counseling also offers a promising avenue for exploring digital detox as a way to counteract
phubbing. Studies have demonstrated that partner, adolescent, or parental phubbing is linked to diminished
relationship satisfaction, heightened stress, and poor mental health and sleep quality [63,88-91]. In clinical
practice, it is essential to offer non-judgmental counseling and involve families in shared decision-making
to promote healthier screen use [77]. When couples and families learn to set boundaries around technology,
such as device-free mealtimes, limited evening usage, and removing all devices from bedrooms before
bedtime, they may notice improvements in communication, emotional support, sleep quality, and well-being
[87]. Incorporating digital detox strategies into relationship-focused therapy and workshops can address
these relational strains and promote more meaningful interpersonal interactions [92-95].

Unmet needs for further research and policy implementation

In systematic reviews, scholars have examined the relationship between SM usage and life satisfaction and
mental health outcomes, with some digital detox interventions reporting significant gains in mental well-
being, while others observe no or minimal changes [38,65]. This discrepancy may arise from both a lack of
high-quality research and an incomplete understanding of which populations benefit most. For example, a
review by Radtke et al. predominantly included lower-quality studies [38], whereas Ramadhan et al. analyzed
only high-quality research [65]. In the meta-analysis by Ramadhan et al., digital detox interventions
significantly mitigated depression (95% CI: -0.51, -0.07; p = 0.01) despite varying intervention durations
across different studies (ranging from a full week of SM abstinence to reducing daily usage by just 10
minutes over three weeks) [65]. Figure 3 illustrates the pathways proposed by Ramadhan et al.,
demonstrating how mindful digital downtime can reduce depressive symptoms.

FIGURE 3: Charting the pathways: how does mindful digital downtime

lead to a reduction in depression?

Constant exposure to idealized online content can trigger social comparison, leading to increased cortisol levels
and stress. Disconnecting from digital platforms may help lower cortisol levels, alleviating stress that contributes to
depressive feelings [65].

Despite the growing body of work on digital detox as a potential remedy for issues such as digital dementia,
psychological distress, and PSU, there remain substantial gaps in both research and practice
[62,64,67,68,73]. Systematic and narrative reviews have noted that existing studies have small or non-
representative samples (e.g., university students or participants from Western contexts only), with short
intervention windows, and an absence of standardized tools for measuring outcomes such as stress,
cognitive decline, or emotional well-being [62,64,65,71]. This heterogeneity in sample demographics,
intervention duration, and assessment methods complicates direct comparisons across studies. Future
research would, therefore, benefit from larger-scale, longitudinal, and more diverse studies, particularly
those employing randomized controlled trials and studying the long-term sustenance of digital detox
practices and outcomes. These studies should include populations with clinical-level digital dependence
(e.g., those with severe withdrawal symptoms or comorbid mental health conditions) and marginalized
groups.

Currently, there is no definitive professional guidance on daily screen time for children over the age of 12
years or on when older children should begin using phones or mobile devices with supervision [77,96].
Nonetheless, some policies across the globe exist. The Ministry of Health in Singapore issued updated
guidelines on January 21, 2025, regarding screen use for children aged 0-12 years [96]. These guidelines
emphasize more stringent recommendations for parents, including limiting screen time to <1 hour per day
outside of school for children aged 3-6 years and to <2 hours per day for those aged 7-12 (except for school-
related activities). The new guidance also advises parents against granting children unrestricted use of
mobile devices or access to SM platforms. Research assessing the mechanisms employed to enact these
policies, as well as the outcome of these policies, will be instrumental in understanding a path forward.

As more and more communities (e.g., schools, districts, states, and countries) seek to develop and enact
policy, engaging and collaborating with key stakeholders in the process will be key. For instance, schools,
universities, and workplaces could arrange critical thinking workshops to support media literacy, mindful
use of technology, and emotional and social learning, ultimately encouraging persistent voluntary behavior
changes. Public health initiatives can also focus on raising awareness of concepts such as digital dementia
and phubbing to highlight the importance of balanced technology use across all age groups. However, the
potential for community-grounded actions (e.g., commitment among parents and guardians to delay
smartphone use in children and adolescents) must be coupled with research and health-oriented guidance
so the onus is not left only to the public to address this critical area of concern.

Limitations

While evaluating the findings of our review, it is important to note that this is a comprehensive analysis
using a focused keyword search within the PubMed database. This approach may have restricted the breadth
of relevant studies captured. However, the decision to focus our search in this manner was strategic, given
the comprehensive nature of this scoping review along with the relatively underdeveloped state of

2025 Setia et al. Cureus 17(1): e78250. DOI 10.7759/cureus.78250

9 of 14

 
standardized terminologies in the field of digital detox [31] and the predominance of low-quality studies
across other databases, as documented in a prior systematic review [29].

Conclusions
Growing evidence has confirmed that PSU frequently co-occurs with common psychiatric conditions,
including depression and anxiety. Hence, digital detox, a term often used and described in the literature as a
targeted break or disconnection from technology, has gained growing attention as a potential strategy to
improve mental health and overall well-being. Emerging evidence suggests that its clinical relevance for
enhancing mental health is especially pronounced among adolescents, young adults, women, and
individuals with pre-existing problematic internet use or mental health conditions. Education and
counseling about the potential harms of unhealthy technology use and the benefits of digital detox can
empower families and youth to make informed choices and cultivate healthier habits. It is also important to
note that small sample sizes, short intervention periods, and limited follow-up constrain the implications of
current literature on digital detox. Hence, further research is needed to explore how best to implement these
strategies for scalable and sustained long-term benefits.
