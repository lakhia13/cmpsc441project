Abstract
Purpose of Review  This review integrates recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses on the efficacy of cognitive behav-
ioral therapy (CBT) for the treatment of anxiety disorders in children and adolescents. To inform personalized approaches 
to intervention, we also review recent research on moderators and predictors of outcomes.
Recent Findings  Meta-analyses provide strong support for the efficacy of CBT for youth anxiety disorders, including with 
preschool-aged children using appropriate modifications. Furthermore, there is evidence that CBT is an effective adjunct 
treatment to psychopharmacological interventions, and the combination of treatments may be most effective for some youth. 
There is limited evidence of consistent demographic and clinical moderators of outcomes. Recent work in neuroscience 
has highlighted novel predictors of treatment outcomes that, with replication, may aid in more personalized approaches to 
youth anxiety treatment.
Summary  CBT is efficacious for treating anxiety disorders in youth and lowering recurrence rates. CBT can also be an 
efficacious adjunct treatment for psychopharmacological interventions. Neuroimaging and psychophysiological measures 
of threat and motivational processing have shown initial promise in predicting symptom change with CBT, with potential 
implications for precision medicine.

Introduction

Anxiety disorders are mental health disorders character-
ized by marked fear or anxiety, avoidance of feared stimuli, 
and significant distress or impairment [1, 2]. Examples of 
anxiety disorders in youth include conditions such as sepa-
ration anxiety disorder, panic disorder, agoraphobia, social 
anxiety disorder, specific phobia, and generalized anxiety 
disorder [1, 2]. Anxiety disorders tend to onset in childhood 
or adolescence, with separation anxiety emerging earliest 
in development and social anxiety disorder, panic disorder,

and generalized anxiety disorder becoming more prevalent 
in late childhood and adolescence [3]. The lifetime preva-
lence of any anxiety disorder in children and adolescents 
is approximately 15–32% [3, 4], and these disorders are 
associated with a range of negative outcomes across devel-
opment, including disruptions in daily life, academic and 
social functional impairment, and persistence of symptoms 
into adulthood [5].

Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is considered a gold 
standard and efficacious treatment for anxiety disorders in 
youth and adults [6, 7, 8•]. CBT generally consists of 12 to 
18 1-h sessions and focuses on identifying and changing 
problematic thinking and behavioral patterns that maintain 
the youth’s presenting symptomatology [9, 10]. CBT clini-
cians introduce and provide opportunities to practice skills 
in session and then assign homework for further refinement 
and generalization of these skills outside of session [10]. 
Cognitive skills help anxious youth develop awareness of 
maladaptive thought patterns maintaining anxiety and, in 
some cases, change them to more realistic or helpful alterna-
tive thoughts [9, 10]. Behaviorally, CBT for anxiety usually

involves repeated, gradual exposure to feared stimuli to 
reduce avoidance and promote new learning [9, 10].

In the present article, we briefly review recent meta-
analytic work examining the efficacy of CBT for anxiety 
disorders in children and adolescents. Importantly, not all 
youth respond to CBT despite the intervention’s efficacy [6, 
7, 8•, 11]. Accordingly, understanding of moderators and 
predictors of individual differences in treatment outcomes is 
needed to personalize treatment and improve outcomes. We 
first summarize research on clinical characteristics, such as 
primary diagnosis and symptom severity, and demographic 
moderators of CBT outcomes, followed by a review of new 
advances in neural predictors of treatment outcomes. We 
highlight recent work using neuroscience methods to pre-
dict CBT response to potentially improve prediction of out-
comes and ultimately inform more personalized approaches 
to intervention.

Efficacy of CBT for Anxiety Disorders 
in Children and Adolescents

Decades of research supports CBT as an efficacious inter-
vention for treating internalizing disorders in children and 
adolescents. For example, one recent meta-analysis of 76 
studies and 106 CBT treatment groups examining outcomes 
in the treatment of anxiety, depression, posttraumatic stress 
disorder,  and  obsessive–compulsive  disorder  in  youth  
found that 77.1% of participants at posttreatment and 81.9% 
at follow-up (ranging from 1 to 89 months) showed signifi-
cant improvements in target symptom measures compared 
to pretreatment (considerable heterogeneity between stud-
ies; I2 = 80.8–83.8%) [12]. Another study conducted several 
meta-analyses to examine the effects of CBT for youth anxi-
ety disorders [13]. An analysis of 39 studies (N = 2697) that 
examined remission of a primary anxiety disorder diagnosis 
at posttreatment found that youth in CBT had a remission 
rate of 49.4% compared to 17.8% for those in waitlist or 
no treatment conditions (moderate heterogeneity; I2 = 52%) 
[13]. Additionally, an analysis of the 28 studies (N = 2075) 
that examined remission of all anxiety disorder diagnoses at 
posttreatment found that youth in CBT had a remission rate 
of 46.8% compared to 19.1% for those in waitlist or no treat-
ment conditions (moderate heterogeneity; I2 = 60%) [13].

CBT is efficacious for anxiety beginning even in early 
childhood using appropriate modifications. A meta-analysis 
of 41 studies of children aged 3 to 8 years old (N = 1965) 
found that anxiety symptoms significantly decreased from 
pre- to posttreatment with CBT (SMD =  − 1.34; moder-
ate  heterogeneity,   Tau2 = 0.37)  [8•].  Anxiety  symptoms 
also decreased when comparing pretreatment to follow-up 
in 19 studies (N = 1423), regardless of length of follow-up 
(SMD =  − 1.40; moderate heterogeneity,  Tau2 = 0.35) [8•]. 

In addition to reducing current symptoms in youth, CBT 
appears to be associated with relatively low relapse rates 
for youth anxiety disorders. For example, a recent meta-
analysis (total N = 535) indicated that approximately 8% of 
youth treated with CBT for anxiety experienced a recurrence 
at follow-up (average follow-up period being 11.06 months 
posttreatment, ranging from 1 to 60 months; 2 studies of 
youth with autism spectrum disorder not included in this 
analysis; considerable heterogeneity, I2 = 81.6%) [14•]. Of 
note, relapse rates were not related to duration of follow-up 
or to the presence of a comorbid attention-deficit hyperactiv-
ity disorder or depressive disorder diagnosis [14•].

Traditional in-person delivery of CBT may not always 
be available to youth in need of evidence-based services. 
For example, the COVID-19 pandemic limited access to in-
person care, increasing demand for telehealth CBT services. 
Outside of the context of the pandemic, many youth live 
in areas with limited access to providers trained in CBT. 
Fortunately, there is evidence to support the efficacy of 
technology-delivered CBT when traditional in-person CBT 
may not be available [6, 15]. For example, a recent meta-
analysis of 711 participants found that, compared to control 
conditions (i.e., treatment as usual, waitlist, or psychologi-
cal placebo), youth in technology-delivered CBT had higher 
remission rates for their primary anxiety disorder diagnosis 
(37.9% versus 10.2%; OR = 4.73; k = 9; no significant heter-
ogeneity, I2 = 0%) and all anxiety disorder diagnoses (19.5% 
versus 5.3%; OR = 3.32; k = 8; no significant heterogene-
ity, I2 = 0%) at posttreatment [15]. Another meta-analysis 
found that technology-delivered CBT performed similarly 
to active treatment control (i.e., in-person CBT or treat-
ment as usual; g = 0.04; N = 203; no significant heterogene-
ity, I2 = 0%) and outperformed passive control conditions 
(i.e., waitlist/no treatment, or information only; trim and fill 
adjusted g = 0.44; unadjusted N = 822; moderate unadjusted 
heterogeneity, I2 = 52.6%) in reducing anxiety symptoms for 
adolescent and young adult participants (aged 12–25 years) 
at posttreatment [6]. There was also no significant differ-
ence between technology-delivered CBT and active treat-
ment controls at long-term follow-up (ranging from 6 to 
12 months posttreatment) in the 2 included studies on anxi-
ety (g = 0.08; N = 140; moderate heterogeneity, I2 = 50.6%) 
[6]. However, for younger participants (i.e., between 3 and 
8 years old), in-person individual (SMD =  − 0.85) and group 
(SMD =  − 0.89) delivery of CBT had stronger effects on 
symptom reduction compared to internet-delivered CBT 
(SMD =  − 0.45) [8•]. Given the variety of the ways in which 
CBT can be delivered via technology (e.g., telehealth with 
an individual provider, telehealth with a group), research 
is needed on moderators of technology-delivered CBT and 
predictors of outcomes to enhance treatment for youth with 
limited access to in-person CBT, particularly for younger 
children with anxiety disorders.

Efficacy of Combination Treatment

Selective  serotonin  reuptake  inhibitors  (SSRIs)  are  an 
efficacious  and  commonly  used  psychopharmacologi-
cal intervention for treating pediatric anxiety disorders 
[16–18]. Compared to placebo, meta-analyses have found 
that SSRIs alone are more effective at reducing anxiety 
symptoms (Log OR = 1.57, N = 734, acceptable heteroge-
neity, Cochran’s Q = 10.56, p = 0.06 [7]; SMD =  − 0.65 
to − 0.61,  N = 96–675,  moderate  to  substantial  hetero-
geneity, I2 = 55.1–73.4% [19]) and enhancing treatment 
response (relative risk = 1.96; N = 396; I2 = 0%) and remis-
sion (relative risk = 2.04; N = 95) [19]. Importantly, the 
combination of SSRI and CBT may be associated with 
greater improvement beyond either SSRI or CBT treatment 
alone [20••, 21, 22]. One of the largest randomized clini-
cal trials compared treatment outcomes for 488 youth with 
a primary diagnosis of separation anxiety disorder, gener-
alized anxiety disorder, or social phobia [22]. Youth were 
assigned to the SSRI sertraline, CBT, combination SSRI 
and CBT, or placebo. The study found that 80.7% of youth 
in combined treatment showed significant improvement by 
week 12 as measured by the Clinical Global Impression-
Improvement scale [23] compared to 59.7% in CBT alone, 
54.9% in SSRI alone, and 23.7% in the placebo condi-
tion [22]. Additionally, meta-analyses found that com-
bination SSRI and CBT treatment significantly reduced 
anxiety symptoms (SMD =  − 0.69 to − 0.46) and increased 
treatment response (relative risk = 1.35–1.47) and remis-
sion (relative risk = 1.51) compared to SSRI (N = 273) or 
CBT treatment (N = 279) alone [19]. Despite the benefits 
of SSRIs, it is worth noting that some patients may not 
tolerate SSRIs well, and CBT may be particularly well-
suited for these youth. A recent meta-analysis of 18 stud-
ies (N = 2631) found that SSRIs for anxiety in youth were 
associated with greater discontinuation related to adverse 
events, including activation, abdominal pain, headaches, 
and sedation, compared to placebo (no significant hetero-
geneity, I2 = 0%) [24].

Predictors and Moderators of Treatment 
Outcomes

Despite the efficacy of CBT, questions remain about why 
it is less effective for some youth than others. Research on 
factors that moderate treatment outcomes or predict who is 
most likely to respond is critical to matching children and 
adolescents to treatments or combinations of treatments that 
will meet their needs. Despite a relatively large literature in 
this area, however, few consistent moderators have emerged. 
For example, little evidence suggests that age or gender 
moderates the effects of treatment on anxiety outcomes. A 

recent meta-analysis (N = 766) compared CBT and non-CBT 
psychological therapies to active and passive controls and 
found that age and gender were not significant moderators 
of treatment effects on anxiety symptom severity in ado-
lescents [25]. Another meta-analysis (N = 535) found that 
relapse rates were higher among younger samples, but gen-
der did not differentially predict relapse rates in youth [14•]. 
Research examining relapse rates based on race and ethnicity 
is more mixed; one meta-analysis found a positive associa-
tion between percent of racial/ethnic minority participants in 
a sample and relapse rates [14•], while another did not find 
evidence that ethnicity moderated treatment outcome [25].
Although various clinical characteristics can inform case 
conceptualization, it remains unclear if they are robustly 
linked with treatment outcome. For example, recent meta-
analyses have found limited evidence that primary diagno-
sis moderates the effect of treatment on symptoms meas-
ured at posttreatment [25] or at the first follow-up (average 
follow-up period being 11.06 months posttreatment) [14•]. 
However, children and adolescents with a primary diagno-
sis of social anxiety disorder were significantly less likely 
to recover following CBT (35% recovery rate) compared 
to those with any other primary anxiety disorder diagnosis 
(54% recovery rate) (N = 635; no significant heterogeneity, 
I2 = 0%) [26]. Another meta-analysis (N = 1169) found that 
youth with higher pretreatment symptoms were less likely 
to have a positive CBT outcome, indicated by a lower prob-
ability of response, remission, and/or a high symptom rating 
(substantial heterogeneity, I2 = 62%) [27]. Although some 
studies have found effects of comorbid depression on poorer 
outcomes in youth [28], two meta-analyses failed to find sig-
nificant effects in predicting treatment outcomes (N = 680; 
considerable heterogeneity, I2 = 81%) [27] or relapse [14•]. 
Variability in participant age may impact results, as depres-
sion is less common in younger children compared to ado-
lescents [29]. It is also possible that depressive symptoms 
assessed dimensionally may be more consistently linked 
to poorer treatment outcomes compared to the presence or 
absence of a depressive disorder diagnosis [28]. There is 
more consistent meta-analytic evidence of higher relapse 
rates among anxious youth with comorbid oppositional defi-
ant or conduct disorder [14•]. Although systematic reviews 
have found mixed evidence regarding the effects of paren-
tal psychopathology on treatment outcomes for anxious 
youth [30, 31], a meta-analysis (N = 1188) found parent 
psychopathology predicted worse CBT outcomes in youth 
with anxiety disorders (substantial heterogeneity, I2 = 53%)  
[27].

In terms of treatment characteristics, parent involvement 
in treatment has been theorized to improve outcomes, but 
there is more limited evidence in support of this. In one meta-
analysis comparing CBT to other psychotherapies for ado-
lescents, parent involvement was not a significant moderator  

1 3856

Current Psychiatry Reports (2022) 24:853–859

of outcomes [25]. Additionally, a meta-analysis (N = 964) 
that compared individual CBT to parent-involved CBT for 
anxious children and adolescents did not find a significant 
difference on youth anxiety symptoms  (Tau2 = 0.02, p = 0.59) 
[32]. There is even some evidence that parent involvement 
can reduce the efficacy of CBT for anxious youth. A meta-
analysis of 75 studies (N = 5412) found that parent involve-
ment (separate and together) was significantly associated 
with  smaller  pre-  to  posttreatment  effect  sizes,  but  only 
using child report [9]. There are several possible reasons for 
these mixed findings. First, there is considerable variability 
in the amount and type of parent involvement [9], which may 
make it difficult to assess specific aspects of having family 
in treatment that enhance outcomes for youth. Older par-
ticipants may not need as much parent involvement in treat-
ment as younger children, which could explain why a meta-
analysis with adolescents did not find parent involvement to 
be a significant moderator of outcomes [25]. Additionally, 
CBT with parent involvement may offer fewer opportunities 
for in-session exposures and thus may be associated with 
smaller effects at posttreatment for some youth, as found 
in one meta-analysis [9]. This suggests that having parents 
involved may take time away from other aspects of treatment 
that more directly target anxiety symptoms, like exposures 
[9]. The dose and focus of parent involvement may need to 
be informed by individualized functional analysis, as some 
youth may find more benefit to having family involved in 
their treatment than others.

Finally, treatment modality (i.e., individual, group, fam-
ily) has also been examined as a possible moderator of treat-
ment outcomes for youth with limited evidence of differences 
across modalities. In a meta-analysis (N = 3386) exploring 
the effectiveness of different CBT modalities for anxious 
children and adolescents, individual CBT did not show a 
significant advantage over family CBT (k = 5; moderate het-
erogeneity, I2 = 49%) or group CBT (k = 4; moderate hetero-
geneity, I2 = 39%) in terms of remission [33]. Furthermore, 
recent meta-analyses with anxious youth did not find treat-
ment modality to be a significant moderator of posttreatment 
outcome [25] or relapse rate at first follow-up [14•].

Neural Predictors of Treatment Outcomes

The investigation of neural predictors of response to treat-
ment for internalizing disorders has been a burgeoning area 
of research over the past decade, with aims to identify who is 
most likely to benefit from a particular treatment, elucidate 
novel treatment targets, and ultimately inform personalized 
approaches to treatment. In terms of neural methods, elec-
troencephalogram (EEG), event-related potentials (ERPs), 
and structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging 
(MRI/fMRI) each have complementing strengths as tools 

to  work  toward  these  aims.  EEG/ERP  is  a  non-invasive 
technique that records electrical neural activity at the scalp 
with millisecond temporal precision and greater feasibility 
in clinical translation due to reduced costs in comparison 
to other neural measures. In contrast, MRI/fMRI is used to 
examine brain structure and function via magnetic fields and 
radiofrequencies to capture changes associated with blood 
flow with excellent spatial resolution. Together, EEG/ERP 
and MRI/fMRI are complementary in providing objective 
assessments and offering additional explanatory power in 
conjunction with other more traditional clinical measures.

To date, most research using neuroscience methods to 
delineate the etiology of anxiety and identify intervention 
targets has focused on neural responses to threat. Circuits of 
interest include the amygdala and regions of the prefrontal 
cortex (PFC) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), which 
play regulatory roles in fear responses, attention, and action 
monitoring,  respectively.  A  recent  systematic  review  of 
21 studies on neural indicators of CBT response in youth 
identified the amygdala, PFC, and ACC as brain regions 
key to predicting treatment outcomes in youth with inter-
nalizing disorders [34••]. Specifically, greater activation of 
the dorsolateral and ventrolateral PFC regions during threat 
processing tasks was associated with greater reductions in 
anxiety severity with treatment. Greater activation of the 
dorsolateral PFC and ventrolateral PFC, regions involved 
in appraising and regulating responses to threatening stim-
uli, potentially supports youth in successfully engaging in 
exposure treatments and leading to enhanced therapeutic 
outcomes. In addition, hyperactivation of the amygdala in 
response to threatening cues, reflecting great threat reac-
tivity,  was  associated  with  greater  post-CBT-treatment 
improvement. On the other hand, lower activation of dorsal 
ACC and dorsomedial PFC, potentially reflecting difficul-
ties with attentional control, during implicit threat process-
ing has been linked with greater and earlier anxiety symptom 
reduction [35]. Together, this literature indicates that altera-
tions in the amygdala, dorsal ACC, and dorsomedial PFC 
function may be indicators of more room for improvement 
at pretreatment and greater opportunity for treatment gains.
Expanding beyond a focus on threat processing, recent 
research has begun to examine motivational processes at the 
neural level in relation to treatment outcomes. In a recent 
investigation, greater reward responsiveness, as indicated by 
striatal activation assessed pretreatment, differentiated youth 
with anxiety disorders who responded to CBT (i.e., > 35% 
symptom reduction) versus youth who did not [36]. Greater 
striatum response to reward anticipation has also been asso-
ciated with greater reduction in anxiety symptoms in youth 
undergoing multiple forms of treatment for depression and 
comorbid anxiety [37]. However, these findings are mixed 
such that blunted reactivity to reward receipt measured by 
EEG has been associated with greater response to treatment, 

1 3Current Psychiatry Reports (2022) 24:853–859

857

particularly in predicting depression symptom reduction in 
youth with anxiety disorders [38]. These findings are similar 
to observations in adults with anxiety and depression [39] 
and conceptualized to suggest that initial dampened reward 
response may signify greater room for improvement across 
treatment. Taken together, the literature suggests that striatal 
activation to reward anticipation may be particularly impor-
tant for supporting treatment engagement for youth with 
anxiety. Moreover, blunted responsiveness to reward receipt 
may be an indicator of potential to benefit from CBT (via 
reduction in depression symptoms) for youth with comor-
bid depression and anxiety. Replication of this research is 
needed to better understand its potential application and 
clinical impact in improving CBT outcomes for youth.

To date, neural predictors of CBT response identified in 
youth are largely similar to those that have been observed in 
adults. In a meta-analysis (N = 442) of the literature on neu-
ral indicators of CBT treatment response in adults, the same 
brain regions as the systemic review in youth were identified 
(i.e., the PFC and ACC, along with the anterior insular cor-
tex; no significant heterogeneity, I2 = 0.56–0.83) [40]. Nota-
bly, although there is region overlap across populations, the 
direction of associations from pretreatment neural indicators 
to posttreatment outcomes may diverge for adults and youth. 
For example, a meta-analysis on CBT outcomes for adults 
concluded that hyperactivation in the ACC was associated 
with better treatment response, whereas a systematic review 
on CBT outcomes for youth suggested that ACC hypoacti-
vation was associated with better treatment response [34••, 
40]. These discrepancies may be due in part to differences 
in brain maturation because of protracted development of 
frontal regions including the ACC [41].

Future research will need to determine the clinical utility 
of these neuroscience methods so they can be effectively used 
to complement clinical assessment and treatment planning 
using personalized approaches. This will require replication 
of existing research examining neural predictors of treat-
ment response so more definitive inferences can be made. 
Similarly, there is a need to establish normative values for 
neural measures of interest, similar to clinical assessments. 
Clinical practitioners utilizing these methods need to be able 
to consistently obtain clean data with known psychometric 
properties so that normative and cutoff values can be used to 
inform treatment planning. This work has begun in EEG/ERP 
and MRI/fMRI research with adults (e.g., [42]) but is in early 
stages. Advanced statistical approaches are also needed to 
foster measure refinement and translation to clinical applica-
tions. Specifically, machine learning approaches hold prom-
ise for detecting and aggregating features of brain function 
that optimally predict treatment response, and ultimately, 
predicting the likelihood of response to different types of 
treatment [43–45]. Indeed, an essential future direction of 
examining neural predictors of treatment outcome is going 

beyond prognostic prediction to also examine prescriptive 
prediction. These future directions have potential implica-
tions for the field’s ability to move beyond simply identifying 
youth who are more or less likely to benefit from a given 
treatment to instead identify the treatment approaches that 
are most likely to result in the greatest and most efficient 
symptom reduction for a particular patient.

Conclusions

Recent meta-analyses have continued to demonstrate the 
efficacy of CBT for treating anxiety disorders in children 
and adolescents, with evidence of moderate to large effects 
on symptoms [6, 7, 8•, 12, 13] for children even as young 
as preschool age [8•]. Furthermore, CBT is efficacious as 
an adjunct treatment to psychopharmacological intervention 
[19, 20••, 21, 22]. Yet, as with most forms of intervention, 
there is considerable individual variability in outcomes [6, 
7, 8•, 11], and few consistent moderators and predictors have 
emerged in the clinical literature [14•, 25, 27, 28, 32, 33]. 
This hinders progress in terms of identifying which interven-
tions work best for whom and optimizing intervention out-
comes. Recent research has leveraged neuroscience methods 
including EEG and fMRI to elucidate novel, neural predic-
tors of CBT outcomes for youth with anxiety disorders, with 
some consistent patterns emerging in brain regions involved 
in threat and motivational processing [34••, 36]. Despite 
the promise of these early findings, there is still much work 
to be done to bridge the gap between clinical neuroscience 
and clinical practice and determine the extent to which these 
methodologies can be applied to inform more personalized 
approaches to youth anxiety treatment.
