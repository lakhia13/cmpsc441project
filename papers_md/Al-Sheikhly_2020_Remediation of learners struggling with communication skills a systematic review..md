Remediation of learners struggling with
communication skills: a systematic review
Deema Al-Sheikhly1*, Linda Östlundh2 and Thurayya Arayssi3

Abstract

Background: Communication skills is a core area of competency for healthcare practitioners. However, trainees
deficient in those skills are not identified early enough to address the deficiency. Furthermore, faculty often struggle
to identify effective remediation strategies for those who fail to meet expectations. We undertook a systematic
review to determine which assessment methods are appropriate to identify learners that struggle with
communication skills and the strategies used to remediate them.

Methods: The literature was searched from January 1998 through to May 2019 using academic databases and grey
literature. Trainees were defined as healthcare practitioners in undergraduate, graduate and continuing education.
Characteristics of studies, assessment and intervention strategies and outcomes were synthesized qualitatively and
summarized in tables.
Results: From an initial 1636 records, 16 (1%) studies met the review criteria. Majority of the learners were medical students.
A few studies (44%) included students from other disciplines, residents and physicians in practice. The remediation programs,
in the studies, ranged from 1 week to 1 year. Around half of the studies focused solely on learners struggling with
communication skills. The majority of studies used a format of a clinical OSCE to identify struggling learners. None of the
studies had a single intervention strategy with the majority including an experiential component with feedback.

Conclusions: A few studies collectively described the diagnosis, remediation intervention and the assessment of the
outcomes of remediation of communication skills. For a remediation strategy to be successful it is important to ensure: (i)
early identification and diagnosis, (ii) the development of an individualized plan and (iii) providing reassessment with
feedback to the learner.

Background
Interpersonal and communication skills are an integral
element of quality patient care and are recognized as a core
area of competency for medical students, residents, and
practicing physicians [1–5]. Furthermore, effective commu-
nication and empathic relationships with healthcare
practitioners are highly valued by patients and their fam-
ilies [6–10] with compromised clinical care and an overall

lower satisfaction with care being associated with poor
communication [11–13]. Hence formal training and assess-
ment programs at the undergraduate, graduate and con-
tinuing education levels are needed [14–17]. Examples of
these include Objective Structured Clinical Examination
(OSCE) with a Standardized Patient (SP), that assesses clin-
ical skills in a standardized setting. Although medical
schools have a variety of methods to teach communication
skills, there still remains a considerable gap. Not all com-
munication curricula are based on a specific validated
framework, nor incorporate a patient-centered communi-
cation approach, nor foster professional and personal

growth. Additionally, the learners’ communication skills
may not always be assessed directly and the quality of the
program may not be evaluated [17].

In 1999, the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical
Education (ACGME) and the American Board of Medical
Specialties (ABMS) stated that “interpersonal and communi-
cation skills that result in effective information exchange and
partnering with patients, their families, and professional as-
sociates” is a core area of competency for residents and prac-
ticing physicians [1, 4]. Additionally in 2004, the National
Board of Medical Examiners (NBME), the Federation of
State Medical Boards (FSMB), and the Educational Com-
mission for Foreign Medical Graduates (ECFMG) imple-
mented the Step 2 Clinical Skills (CS) Examination [18].
One of three subcomponents of the exam is Communica-
tion and Interpersonal Skills, which requires medical stu-
dents or graduates to “establish rapport with the patients,
gather and provide information, help the patient make deci-
sions and provide counseling when appropriate and in a
professional manner” [18].

Despite the importance of communication skills to the
training of future healthcare practitioners and the requirement
to demonstrate competence in those skills at all levels of the
medical continuum, faculty and residency program directors
often struggle with identifying effective remediation strategies
for those who fail to meet expectations [19–21]. This has
mainly been due to the fact that remediation is a time con-
suming process that can be daunting and cumbersome [22]
and that remediation of non-cognitive problems is more chal-
lenging than remediation of cognitive problems [20, 23].

The literature has shown that policies and guidelines for
best practice are needed to improve the quality of the re-
mediation process and to increase the confidence of educa-
tors in applying specific remediation strategies according to
the learner’s skill deficit in all areas of competencies [23, 24].
A variety of remediation strategies have been utilized with
most consisting of three steps: identification/diagnosis, re-
mediation intervention, and re-assessment [25–27]. Hauer
et al. proposed a four-step model which included: (i) initial
assessment to identify deficiencies using multiple assessment
tools, (ii) diagnosis and development of an individualized
learning plan, (iii) deliberate practice, feedback, and reflec-
tion, and (iv) reassessment [23]. A structured seven-step ap-
proach of relationship-centered care, coaching and effective
feedback was also found to be an effective model to success-
fully remediate learners in communication and interpersonal
skills [28]. Some of the key steps included establishing a sup-
portive learning environment, listening to the learner, en-
couraging reflective practice, developing a learning plan and
documenting progress.

The literature on challenges in identifying and remedi-
ating learners struggling with communication skills are
wide and varied [28]. Therefore, the goal of this system-
atic review was to determine the appropriate assessment

tools used to identify learners struggling in communica-
tion skills, the strategies used to remediate them and to
discuss the best practice recommendations proposed by
the authors. In this study we defined remediation as
“additional teaching above and beyond the standard cur-
riculum, individualized to the learner who without the
additional
teaching would not achieve the necessary
skills for the profession” [29].

To achieve this, our research question was:
How do you diagnose a trainee struggling with com-
munication skills and what are the effective remediation
strategies?

Method
In this systematic review a PRISMA (Preferred Reporting
Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis) flow
diagram was utilized for reporting the study selection.

Data sources and search strategy
A comprehensive, search for literature was performed in
the academic databases PubMed, MEDLINE (OVID),
EMBASE (OVID), CINAHL (EBSCO), PsycInfo (OVID),
Web of Science and Scopus and in sources of grey litera-
ture. Pre-searches to identify relevant search strategies,
search terms and information sources were conducted in
March–June, 2018, and the final search was carried out
in June 2018. An update of the search in PubMed and
Scopus were performed in May 2019 to ensure inclusion
of the latest published studies on remediation in com-
munication for healthcare practitioners before complet-
ing the manuscript.

PubMed was used to systematically develop a search string,
which later was applied in the other databases. All selected
keywords were searched both in the fields “Abstract” and
“Article Title” (alternatively “Topic”) and in MeSH/Subject
Headings/Thesaurus when available. No filters or limitations
were applied to retrieve the largest number of result and to
avoid excluding pre-indexed materials. Language, document
type, and publication year restrictions were instead included
in the exclusion criteria for the screening process. We de-
fined trainees as healthcare practitioners in undergraduate,
graduate and continuing education. For the purpose of this
study we defined healthcare practitioners as individuals who
may be involved in healthcare delivery (for example: physi-
cians, nurses, dentists, physiotherapists and pharmacists). A
full search log, including detailed search strings for all in-
cluded information sources, results and notes is available in
Appendix.

Searches for grey literature were conducted in ProQuest
Dissertation and Thesis, Ethos, Open Grey and BASE, The
New York Academy of Grey Literature Reports and in the
library catalogues for British Library, Library of congress
and WorldCat. Due to lack of advanced search features in
many of the grey resources, broader search strings than the

Al-Sheikhly et al. BMC Medical Education          (2020) 20:215

one used in the academic databases had to be applied. The
grey search was updated in May 2019. A full search log can
be found in Appendix.

All the references were uploaded into Covidence (Mel-
bourne, Australia),
for
systematic
blinded screening. Duplicate detection and removal were
carried out using this software.

review software

To complete the selection of relevant references for
the review, a systematic hand screening of references
lists in studies identified to be included in the systematic
review was also carried out. Two additional studies were
identified eligible for the systematic review.

Study selection and title and abstract review
Articles were included if they were original research on re-
mediation in the area of interpersonal and communication
skills. Articles that were not written in the English language,
systematic reviews, conference abstracts, proceedings, book
chapters, comments, editorials or letters and publications
prior to 1998 were excluded. We wanted to limit the review
to primary studies following the implementation of the Ac-
for Graduate Medical Education’s
creditation Council

(ACGME) outcome project where competencies for training,
including communication skills, were defined and imple-
mented. The search in academic databases and in grey
sources yielded 1636 articles (Fig. 1). Based on the title and
abstract, the two reviewers (DA and TA) screened the arti-
cles using Covidence and excluded articles that were clearly
irrelevant. The screening in Covidence was blinded. In situa-
tions where it was difficult to determine eligibility based on
the title and abstract review the article was included for full
article review. The authors met regularly and all uncertainties
were resolved by consensus. Only articles that described an
assessment tool to identify struggling learners as well as an
intervention methodology or remediation strategy were in-
cluded. Articles with an assessment and remediation strategy
but no clear outcome were also included.

Data extraction
Data were entered into a structured extraction framework
that we created. The framework included information on
the article (Year, participant level, participant number, coun-
try of study), assessment tool, remediation strategy and
intervention outcome. One author (DA) extracted the data.

The Medical Education Research Study Quality Instru-
ment (MERSQI) used to evaluate the methodological
quality of experimental, quasi-experimental, and obser-
vational studies in medical education was used [31]. The
tool
includes 10 items, reflecting 6 domains of study
quality [study design, sampling, type of data (subjective
or objective), validity, data analysis, and outcomes]. The
potential range of a MERSQI score is 5–18. Each study
was scored at the highest possible level.

We used the Kirkpatrick’s four-level model for evalu-
ation of educational
interventions to classify the out-
comes of the studies that met our selection criteria [32]:

(cid:1) Level 1: Participant reaction assessed (learner

satisfaction).

(cid:1) Level 2: Participant learning assessed (changes in

knowledge and skills).

(cid:1) Level 3: Participant behavioral change assessed

(application in practice).

(cid:1) Level 4: Results (changes in institutional practice

and patient outcome).

Data synthesis
Characteristics of studies, assessment and intervention
strategies and outcomes were synthesized qualitatively
and summarized in tables. Articles that described similar
assessment tools or similar interventions were grouped
to facilitate the analysis. We used the consensus mean
MERSQI scores with standard deviations to describe the
overall quality of included studies. Meta-analysis was not
possible, given the heterogeneity of assessment tools, in-
terventions and outcome measurements.

Results
Characteristics of eligible studies
From the 1636 records found, 1020 were identified through
electronic database searching and 616 were identified
through other resources such as databases for grey literature
and by systematically reviewing citations in studies selected
to be included in the review. After de-duplication, a total of
933 references were identified for a first review. The total
number of articles that were eligible for inclusion through re-
view of titles, abstracts and full texts was 16 (Fig. 1). Table 1
summarizes information on the country of the study, the
level of struggling learner, number of remediated learners, as-
interventions and outcomes. Struggling
sessment
learners in the studies were predominantly students (n = 11,
69%), followed by residents (n = 4, 25%), and one study in-
cluded family physicians and specialists (n = 1, 6%). Only one
study included pharmacy students (6%), 14 included learners
in medicine (88%) and one included both nursing and med-
ical students (6%). Eight studies were conducted in the US,
three in the UK, two in Canada, one in Belgium, one in
Australia and one in Korea. Only seven studies focused solely

tools,

on learners struggling with communication skills [33–39]
while the remaining studies addressed multiple deficiencies.

Quality of studies
The mean consensus MERSQI score was 10.5 (range 5.5–
11), with a standard deviation of 1.67 and a median score of
8.5, indicating that the overall study quality was not high.
Total consensus MERSQI scores for each paper are shown
in Table 2. Mean domain scores were highest for type of
data (2.63), data analysis (2.19) and sampling (2.06); they
were lowest for validity evidence (1.17) and study design
(1.13). Most of the studies (81.3%) were single group cross-
sectional or single group post-test only. One study was a
retrospective review of records [40], two studies were sur-
veys of medical schools [24, 39] and one study was a survey
of surgery residency programs [20].

Assessment methods used to diagnose struggling
trainees
Table 1 provides details of the assessment tools that
were used in the studies to diagnose trainees struggling
with communication skills and Table 3 provides a sum-
mary of the overall assessment methods used in the
studies reviewed. Most studies (n = 10, 62.5%) used a for-
mat of a clinical OSCE, a tool to assess clinical skills in a
controlled setting, to identify struggling learners [33–35,
37–39, 41–44], four (25%) used a 360-degree or peer
evaluation tool [42, 45–47], one study did not address
assessment methods used [21] and another identified
struggling learners by their failure to meet criteria in
one or more CanMed Roles but did not expand on what
tools were used to achieve this [40].

(Table 3: Summary of Assessment Methods and Re-

mediation Strategies) – Insert near here.

Remediation interventions and outcomes
The studies included a wide range of intervention strat-
egies such as one-on-one coaching/mentoring, tutorials,
individual and group work, focus reading, SP exercises,
role-play, videotape review, and counseling (Table 1).
None of the studies had a single intervention strategy
with the majority including an experiential component
with feedback. Half of the studies (n = 8) developed a re-
mediation course or program [33–36, 38, 41, 43, 47]
with the duration of the intervention ranging from as
short as a weeklong course [34] to a longitudinal one-
year program [35].

Five studies (35.3%) had a program director or a
committee to devise an individualized remediation
plan that included input from learners [20, 37, 40, 45,
46] and one of those studies used the CanMed Roles
as a framework for the development of the plan [40].
In one Canadian study on improving physicians in
practice a variety of intervention strategies were used.

The Director of Experiential
Education creates a performance
improvement plan.
This individualized plan takes into
account input from the student,
preceptor, and the Director of
Experiential Education.
A list of communication tools
includes:
(cid:129) Direct observations of the
student during case
presentations,
(cid:129) Counseling,
(cid:129) Drug information,
(cid:129) Topic presentations, and
(cid:129) An oral “End of Block” exam.

Developed a four-step CPX remed-
ial training program that incorpo-
rates diagnosis of learner
problems, individual reflection, fac-
ulty feedback and supervised
practice.
Step 1 consists of an individual
review in which:
(cid:129) Students watch their own
videotaped examinations,
(cid:129) Reflect on their performances,
and
(cid:129) Develop personal learning goals.
Step 2, the faculty remediation
director:
(cid:129) Watches the videotape
independently and

Step 3 involves a one-to-one
video review guided by the learn-
ing prescription and the student’s
self-identified goals with a desig-
nated faculty member.
In Step 4, students attend one or
both evening workshops in H & P
or PDI, depending on their area of
need.
Workshops consist of: an
introductory 30-min didactic ses-
sion addressing basic concepts;
case-based skills exercises in which
subsets of 2–3 students rotate be-
tween examination rooms with a
faculty facilitator and an SP, and a
whole-group concluding session
to review learning goals.

Discussion
This systematic review on the remediation of deficiencies
of interpersonal and communication skills of healthcare
practitioners across the continuum yielded very few stud-
ies that described the diagnosis, remediation, intervention
and the assessment of the outcomes of remediation. Fur-
thermore, the studies that we identified were small scaled
(range: n = 1 to n = 225) and of single-institutions. They
utilized a variety of assessment methods to diagnose the
specific problems the learners were struggling with includ-
ing evaluations, clinical performance exams, OSCEs with
SPs, direct observations, oral certifying exams and global
rating scales. This is similar to the recommendations from
the Kalamazoo II report that outlined specific assessment
methods to evaluate communication skills [48]. Those in-
cluded (i) direct observations with real patients, (ii) ratings
of simulated encounters with real patients, (iii) ratings of

video or audiotaped interactions, (iv) patient surveys and
(v) examinations of knowledge, skills or attitude.

In our study, OSCE with SP was the most widely used
method for assessing the learners with the majority utiliz-
ing a standardized or validated checklist. According to the
literature OSCE with SPs is considered the “gold standard”
tool for clinical assessment [49] as it can be designed to
examine skills and ability at the “Show how” level of
Miller’s triangle [50]. The checklist is thought to be the
most frequently used assessment tool of communication
behavior as it provides clearer behavioral definitions that
may improve reliability [51]. In one of the studies, the stu-
dents rated practicing with SPs, receiving feedback, from
SPs and faculty, in real time and observing others in small
groups to be the most beneficial components of the pro-
gram that helped them improve in their communication
skills [41]. This was also observed in other studies that in-
cluded OSCEs with opportunities for video review and
feedback as part of the remediation intervention [34, 43].

Deficiencies in non-cognitive skills are the most challen-
ging to remediate [52]. Therefore, it was not surprising that
our systematic review identified a lack of standardized re-
mediation programs for learners struggling with communi-
cation skills. However, we identified common themes for
remediation strategies, which included the use of clinical
practice with an SP, a clinical faculty or another peer, reflect-
ive practice, role-play, video review and structured feedback.

Having institutional policies and guidelines for remediation,
a faculty development as well as a mentoring program, using
learning contracts and documentation of every aspect of the
remediation process are important components that support
the success of the remediation plan. The challenge in the
systematic review was that there were no clear outcomes
specified in most of the remediation programs other than
the learners progressing to the next year of their education
program, passing a certifying exam or graduating.

Moreover the results from this systematic review confirm
what was previously published in that there is a deficiency
of outcomes-based research on strategies for remediation
[23] and a lack of standardized remediation programs [53,
54]. Three steps that lead to successful remediation were
identified in our study that are similar to those identified in
previous studies: (i) early identification and diagnosis, (ii)
developing an individualized remediation plan and (iii) re-
assessment and feedback [22, 26, 53, 55, 56].

Our study further confirmed what was previously de-
scribed in that remediation interventions lack theoretical
foundation and clinical teachers struggle with using a struc-
tured process framed by appropriate theory to generate a
specific educational diagnosis of learners’ difficulties [55].
The majority of the studies we reviewed did not utilize the-
ory to develop their remediation plan. Only one study used
theory (socio-cognitive self-efficacy beliefs) to develop the
remediation program [47] and the authors noted that

participants benefited from enhanced self-efficacy beliefs.
Adult learning theory is thought to have a direct impact on
remediation as the relevance of what is taught as well as
self-direction are important since each learner has their own
approach based on their life experiences [57]. Kolb’s experi-
ential learning cycle [58] has been successfully used to de-
velop remedial courses for surgical residents struggling with
the surgery-qualifying exam [57] and for residents deficient
in communication skills, namely clinical interviewing skills
[59]. Kolb’s experiential cycle has multiple intercalations
with many educational theories. Therefore designing an ex-
periential remedial program using educational activities that
mirror principles of educational theories would be beneficial
[59]. Such activities would target various increasing levels of
cognitive development [60], provide supportive corrective
feedback [61] and reflective practice [62]. In both of the
above studies, the strategies used included learning con-
tracts, structured reflection, reviewing videos or reading ma-
terial and role modeling. Although the majority of authors
in the studies we reviewed do not mention the use of learn-
ing theories to develop their remediation plans they have
unknowingly done so. Most of the remediation strategies
used included a clinical experience (concrete experience), an
observation and reflection on that experience for example
reviewing the video recordings of encounters (reflective ob-
servation), conceptualizing and learning from that experi-
ence as well as learning new techniques for example
through didactics and role-plays (abstract conceptualization)
and finally deliberate practice to apply what was learned (ac-
tive experimentation) and immediate feedback. These are
the main components of Kolb’s experiential cycle [58].

In our study, several remediation plans included reflection
by the learners following their OSCEs, role-plays or clinical
encounters with patients. Reflection before, during and after
an action is foundational to self-directed learning and is ne-
cessary to promote learning. Using Schon’s model [62] of the
reflective practitioner provides those learners with a frame-
work for choosing an effective action in a complex situation.
It is important for the learners to be able to develop the cap-
acity to derive lessons from a concrete clinical experience
[58]. Such experiences help them refine their skills and apply
their learning to subsequent encounters. By actively reflecting
on what they do and do not understand, they can enhance
their own learning from the concrete experience, which in
turn may facilitate the potential transformative impact [63].

Strengths and limitations of the review
The major strengths of this study lie in the search process it-
self, which was very comprehensive and included a wide
range of academic databases as well as grey literature. Add-
itionally, we did not limit the study to one group of learners
and included all healthcare practitioners across the con-
tinuum. The study however has several limitations. First, the
data extraction was performed by a single author, and did

not include conference abstracts, proceedings, book chapters
or articles that only described an assessment tool to identify
struggling learners or an intervention methodology or re-
mediation strategy. Second based on the MERSQI score, the
quality of the studies included were not high and that is a
limitation of the work conducted in the area of study. Fur-
thermore, the studies included in this systematic review
were heterogeneous and hence we were not able to perform
a meta-analysis. There was not enough data to indicate
whether institutions that remediate trainees struggling with
communication skills assess their own communication
training programs to identify any deficits that could be ad-
dressed. Additionally, it was not possible to investigate the
structural differences of the 16 studies identified due to the
variation in the type of information provided.

Implications for practice and future work
Despite these limitations, we can make some recommenda-
tions based on our observations from the studies reviewed.
Having regular evaluation and feedback methods in place
may facilitate the identification of deficiencies early to avoid
serious learning problems later on [64]. For a remediation
strategy to be successful it is important to ensure early iden-
tification and diagnosis, the development of an individual-
ized plan and reassessment with feedback. The most
effective methods for teaching and evaluating interpersonal
and communication skills involve multiple methods of as-
sessment [3]. Therefore, we would recommend using mul-
tiple methods that would include direct observations (with
patients, SPs or via video review] using a checklist or global
rating scale, 360-degree evaluations, patient surveys, case
discussions, role-plays or written examinations of know-
ledge, skills or attitude. Following the diagnosis of the prob-
lem the next steps would include discussions with the
learner in order to develop an individualized remediation
plan, having a learning contract, setting clear goals and ob-
jectives, a reasonable timeline, assigning a mentor, ongoing
monitoring, deliberate practice, re-evaluation and feedback.

Conclusion
This study supports the need for more rigorous outcomes-
based research, using control or comparison groups, for the
diagnosis and remediation of healthcare practitioners strug-
gling with interpersonal and communication skills across
the continuum. It is important to consider the following
practice points: (i) deficiencies in non-cognitive skills are
challenging to remediate, (ii) a major challenge is whether
faculty know how to identify the deficiency and what strat-
egies to use to remediate, (iii) a variety of assessment tools
need to be used to evaluate communication skills and (iv)
early identification and diagnosis, creating an individualized
plan and reassessment with feedback are key to successful
remediation.
