Abstract

The objective of this study was to propose an intervention and safety protocol for performing
animal-assisted therapy (AAT) and evaluating its efficacy in children under outpatient onco-
logical treatment based on psychological, physiological, and quality of life indicators for the
children and caregivers. The sample consisted of 24 children diagnosed with leukaemia and
solid tumours (58% girls with a mean age of 8.0 years) who underwent an AAT programme
consisting of three 30-min sessions in an open group. Two dogs (one Labrador retriever and
one golden retriever) were used, and activities such as sensory stimulation, gait training,
and socialization were conducted. The exclusion criteria were severe mental problems,
inability to answer the questions included in the instruments used, allergy to animals,
unavailability/lack of interest, isolation precaution, surgical wound, use of invasive devices,
ostomy, no current blood count for evaluation, neutropaenia, infection, fever, diarrhoea,
vomiting, respiratory symptoms at the beginning of the intervention or 1 week before the
intervention, hospitalization or scheduled surgery, and non-completion of the AAT pro-
gramme. The variables analysed using validated self or other evaluations were stress, pain,
mood, anxiety, depression, quality of life, heart rate, and blood pressure. A quasi-experi-
mental study design was used. We observed a decrease in pain (p = 0.046, d = –0.894), irri-
tation (p = 0.041, d = –0.917), and stress (p = 0.005; d = –1.404) and a tendency towards
improvement of depressive symptoms (p = 0.069; d = –0.801). Among the caregivers, an
improvement was observed in anxiety (p = 0.007, d = –1.312), mental confusion (p = 0.006,
d = –1.350), and tension (p = 0.006, d = –1.361). Therefore, the selection criteria and care
protocols used for the AAT programme in the oncological context were adequate, and the
programme was effective.

AAT: Physiological and psychosocial variables in paediatric oncology

Introduction

Throughout their domestication process, animals have had great importance in human life,
having been used for transport and hunting since ancient civilizations in all cultures. Further-
more, the biophilia hypothesis suggests that there is an innate human biological tendency to
interact and form close connections and emotional bonds with other forms of natural life,
especially with animals, starting in early childhood [1–4].

Human behaviour towards animals is complex and involves evolutionary, psychologi-

cal, and cultural factors. The phylogenetic proximity and/or the physical, behavioural,
and cognitive similarities between humans and other animals are only some of the factors
that facilitate this relationship[5]. Other factors, such as the animal’s aesthetics, its anthro-
pomorphic characteristics and its child-like morphological and behavioural traits, stand
out among those that increase animals’ attractiveness to humans, especially to children,
[6–8].

It is also worth noting that according to a study by Nagasawa et al. [9], companion ani-
mals, especially dogs, can contribute to the establishment of a human-animal bond that is
behaviourally and neurohormonally similar to the mother-baby relationship. For these
and other researchers, the psychological and psychophysiological effects associated with
human-animal interactions also result from the activation of the oxytocinergic system
and/or the facilitation of human-human relations (the so-called “social catalyst effect”)
[9–10].

Recognition of the positive aspects of this mutual interspecies relationship has prompted

some scholars to investigate the use of animals in promoting human health. Currently, the
International Association of Animal-Interaction Organizations (IAHAIO) has standardized
theoretical, practical, and ethical guidelines related to different forms of intervention involving
human-animal interaction[11].

One of these techniques is Animal Assisted Therapy (AAT), which is “a goal oriented,
planned and structured therapeutic intervention directed and/or delivered by health, education
and human service professionals. (. . .) AAT is delivered and/or directed by a formally trained
(with active licensure, degree or equivalent) professional with expertise within the scope of the pro-
fessionals’ practice. AAT focuses on enhancing physical, cognitive, behavioral and/or socio-emo-
tional functioning of the particular human recipient” [11] (p.5).

Scientific studies on AAT, particularly those involving dogs, have shown an openness to
and an acceptance of this strategy by medical teams[12–18] and have documented recognition
for AAT’s safety and efficacy in different environments and clinical contexts, including hospi-
talization[19–21], emergency medicine[17], oncology[22–29], cardiology[18,30], psychiatry
[31–33], and outpatient and hospital paediatrics[34–38].

The results of studies on AAT are promising despite the lack of standardization of the num-

ber, duration, and frequency of sessions, the executed activities, and the safety measures for
the animals and patients. Overall, the results indicate improvements in haemodynamic and
physiological parameters[20,30] and decreases in the prescription of analgesics[21] and per-
ceived pain[20]. Regarding psychosocial variables, there is evidence of improved mood[34]
and reduced symptoms of depression and anxiety[19,20].

The use of AAT in the oncological context has been reported in several studies in adult pop-

ulations[22–26,29]. These studies have indicated improvements in anxiety and stress and an
increased sense of well-being in addition to providing a distraction in the hospital setting.
Qualitative studies from a single research group involving children[27,28] have indicated an
improvement in the acceptance of invasive procedures, improvement of the sense of well-
being during hospitalization, reduction of depressive symptoms, and better adaptation to

proposed therapies. However, no experimental quantitative studies have evaluated the effect of
AAT in children to date.

In this context, the present study is a pioneer in the field of outpatient paediatric oncology
in Brazil. The objectives of this study are a) to propose an intervention and safety protocol for
the implementation of AAT and b) to evaluate the impact of an AAT programme in children
undergoing outpatient oncological treatment based on psychological, physiological, and qual-
ity of life indicators for the children and caregivers.

Materials and methods

This study used a quasi-experimental design[39] and was approved by the local ethics commit-
tees in animal research (Comitê de E´tica no Uso de Animais do IRCAD Ame´rica Latina—Pro-
cess No. 054/2015) and human research (Comitê de E´tica em Pesquisa–Fundac¸ão Pio XII–
Hospital de Caˆncer de Barretos—Process No. 1009960).

Participants

This convenience sample was not estimated statistically. The participants evaluated for eligibil-
ity for the study (n = 4983) were in outpatient care at a children’s oncology hospital from June
2015 to January 2017. Of these patients, 24 were selected because they met the inclusion and
exclusion criteria.

The inclusion criteria were as follows: a) Both genders aged 6 to 12 years; Diagnosis of a
solid tumour; b) Diagnosis of acute lymphoid leukaemia (in maintenance treatment in phase B
of the RELLA B and RELLA T protocols, both starting at week 53 of maintenance B, and in the
maintenance phase of the BFM 2002 protocol) [40,41]; c) Undergoing outpatient oncological
treatment; and d) Showing a good clinical status after evaluation, with authorization to partici-
pate in the study by the responsible physician.

The exclusion criteria were as follows: a) Children who were not interested in the interven-

tion and/or were afraid of animals; b) Children with severe mental/cognitive problems that
might lead to injuries/inconvenience to the animals and increase the likelihood of undesired
events; c) Allergy to animals; d) Unavailability to participate in the sessions and/or nonatten-
dance at the initial evaluation session; e) Inability to respond to the instruments; and f) Non-
completion of the AAT programme.

In addition to these criteria, specific exclusion criteria were adopted for the children’s par-
ticipation in each session to increase the safety level of the study and to propose an eligibility
protocol for intervention in this specific context; to the best of our knowledge, these criteria
have not been described in detail in previous studies.

In this context, before participation in each AAT session, the children were evaluated by a
nurse, and those who fit the following criteria were excluded: a) Isolation precaution; b) Pres-
ence of a surgical wound (suture, dehiscence, or drainage); c) Use of invasive devices (probe,
catheter, or drain); d) Presence of ostomies; e) No current blood count available for evaluation;
f) Neutropaenia (less than 500/mm3 or less than 1000/mm3 with likelihood of decreasing
within the next 48 hours); g) Presence of severe infection, documented infection by resistant
bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus or coagulase-negative oxacillin-resistant S. aureus, vancomy-
cin-resistant Enterococcus, or cefepime-resistant and/or meropenem-resistant Gram-negative
bacillus), or suspected or confirmed infection with Clostridium difficile; h) Fever, diarrhoea,
vomiting, or respiratory symptoms during the week before the intervention; and i) Hospitali-
zation or scheduled surgery.

The flowchart of the inclusion and exclusion criteria for the study participants is shown in

A specific protocol for animal entry and handling in the hospital setting was created that
complied with the guidelines for animal-assisted interventions in health care facilities[42]. The
adopted parameters were as follows:

AAT: Physiological and psychosocial variables in paediatric oncology

a) All individuals, whether targets of the intervention or members of the technical team,

should wash their hands with water, soap, or alcohol every time they come into contact
with the dogs;

b) The animals were temporarily suspended from activities if, within 7 days prior to the

intervention, they presented with i) stress, fatigue, and/or aggression, ii) oestrus, immu-
nodepression, infections, or open wounds, or iii) episodes of diarrhoea, vomiting, or uri-
nary/faecal incontinence. In cases in which this last condition occurred during the
session, the Hospital Infection Commission was consulted to provide care for the chil-
dren who had come into contact with the animals;

c) In the event of a sphincter-related accident, the site should be properly cleaned, and the

Hospital Infection Commission should be notified accordingly. In this situation, the ani-
mal should be re-educated to prevent the occurrence of such accidents;

d) Possible episodes of bites and/or scratches of the participants by the dogs should be

reported to the medical and nursing staff and later to the Hospital Infection Commission,
and hygiene and care measures should be provided by the whole team;

e) Prohibition of entry of the animal into specific hospital areas, such as kitchens and drug

preparation areas. The animals were only allowed to enter the therapy room; and

f) Dog hygiene should also include bathing, hair brushing, nail trimming, flea and tick

monitoring (for a minimum of 24 hours before the session), and disinfection/cleaning of
the dog’s paws before and after the session with 70% alcohol.

Animals and handler

One Labrador retriever and one golden retriever who were both healthy and carefully selected
for this study were used for the intervention, because they met the following criteria: a) Docil-
ity, obedience training, and socialization; b) Approval of veterinary surgeons and animal
behaviour specialists (trainers) after specific evaluation; c) Updated immunization records and
anti-parasitic treatment; d) Quarterly clinical examinations (haematological and biochemical)
by a veterinarian; e) Exclusive feeding on animal feed (dry food).

The handler was a physical therapist (NBA) with additional academic training in AAT who

was also the owner of the animals. The animals and the handler had prior experience in this
type of activity.

Intervention

The AAT programme consisted of three 30-min sessions per week. The intervention occurred
in an open group with a maximum of seven participants. The number of planned absences per
participant was one, and the lost session needed to be replaced to complete a total of three ses-
sions in a maximum of 4 weeks.

The activities carried out during the intervention were previously planned by the person
delivering the intervention, who chose among the following per appropriateness for each ses-
sion and depending on the interests and dynamics of the group: 1) sensorial and upper limb
stimulation (brush, pet, and play fetch with the dog); 2) training on activities of daily living
(give water and food to the food) and gait (walking with the dog); 3) socialization and recrea-
tion (dog show; playing with the dog’s supplies; dog drawing; agility courses—guide the dog
through obstacles such as cones and ropes; dog clothes—form words that express feelings and
attach them to the dog clothes with Velcro; stories about the dog—daily routine, origin).

Instruments

The following self-applied instruments were used to evaluate outcome variables in the
children:

a) Child Stress Symptoms Inventory: This instrument is composed of 35 items that evaluate
the occurrence or not of stress in children. The instrument was proposed and validated
by Lipp et al[43,44], and the original version was in Brazilian Portuguese. The items were
self-administered, scored on a five-point Likert scale, and recorded in quarter circles
according to the frequency with which the participants presented the symptoms
described in each item as follows: never (0 points); rarely (1 point); sometimes (2 points);
usually (3 points); and always (4 points). The maximum achievable score was 140 points.

b) Quality of Life Evaluation Scale: The instrument is used to evaluate the quality of life in

children aged 4 to 17 years. It is composed of 26 questions that evaluate function, family,
leisure, and autonomy. Each question is self-filled and scored from 0 (very unhappy) to 3
(very happy), and the maximum achievable score is 78. The instrument was originally
proposed by Manificat and Dazord[45] and translated and validated for Brazilian Portu-
guese by Assumpc¸ão et al[46].

c) Child Depression Inventory: This self-administered instrument was designed for children
aged 7 to 17 years to assess the presence and severity of depressive symptoms. It is com-
posed of 20 items scored on a Likert scale from 0 to 2 points according to the symptoms
presented in the past 2 weeks as follows: 0 (no symptoms); 1 (mild symptoms); and 2
(severe symptoms). The instrument was proposed by Kovacs[47], and the version adapted
and validated for Brazilian Portuguese by Golfeto et al[48] was used.

d) Adapted Brunel Mood Scale: The adaptation of the Brunel Mood Scale (BRUMS) created
by Terry and Lane[49] and validated for Brazilian Portuguese by Rohlfs et al[50] was used
for the self-evaluation of the children’s moods. Items 2, 6, 7, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 19, 20,
21, and 22 were used and scored by the participants using a Likert scale ranging from 0
(not at all) to 4 (extremely).

e) Faces Pain Scale: This self-applied instrument is used to measure the intensity of per-

ceived pain in children. It is composed of six horizontal faces expressing different degrees
of pain. The child chooses the face that best represents his/her degree of pain. The instru-
ment was proposed by Hicks et al[51] and translated and validated for Brazilian Portu-
guese by Silva and Thuler[52].

f) AAT Assessment Questionnaire: This instrument was prepared by the authors to evaluate

the participants’ impressions of the AAT programme. It consisted of five questions,
namely: i) "Did you like playing with the dog in the hospital?; ii) Do you think that the activ-
ities with the dog helped your treatment?; iii) What did you think about spending time with
the dog?; iv) Do you think it would be nice to always have a dog in the hospital?; and v)
Would you suggest this activity with the dog to your friends?.

The following instruments were used to evaluate the outcomes in caregivers:

a) State-Trait Anxiety Inventory: This other-evaluation instrument is used to quantify sub-
jective components related to anxiety. It consists of 34 items that describe children’s
behaviour or problems. The items were scored by parents or guardians according to the
child’s degree of suffering on a scale ranging from 0 (absent) to 3 (always). The

instrument was developed by Spielberger[53] and adapted and validated for Brazilian
Portuguese by Silva et al[54].

b) Brunel Mood Scale: This self-applied tool was originally developed by Terry and Lane[39]
and validated for Brazilian Portuguese by Rohlfs[50]. It is composed of 24 items scored
using a five-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (not at all) to 4 (extremely). This instrument
was completed by the caregivers, who answered the items according to the child’s mood.

c) Sociodemographic and Clinical Identification Questionnaire: This instrument was con-

structed for the present study to collect data on the sociodemographic and clinical charac-
teristics of the sample.

Additionally, the blood pressure and heart rate were measured using the BP3ABOH-G-

Tech semi-automatic pressure meter appropriate for the participant’s age.

Data collection

Initially, the nursing team contacted the eligible patients and subsequently their caregivers
after evaluation of the children by the responsible physician. Children who met the inclusion
and exclusion criteria and their parents signed consent and assent forms and were included in
the study. Before the start of the first AAT session, the participants and their caregivers com-
pleted the instruments described above with the help of a member of the research team trained
for this purpose. The heart rate and blood pressure were also measured. At the end of the pro-
gramme (i.e., end of the third session), the participants and their caregivers filled out the same
instruments again, and the physiological parameters were re-measured.

Data analysis

The data were manually entered into a database and analysed using the Statistical Package for
the Social Sciences software (IBM SPSS Statistics 18). Sociodemographic and clinical charac-
teristics were analysed using descriptive statistics. The evaluations before and after the AAT
programme were compared using non-parametric statistics with the Wilcoxon test. The size of
the effect of the differences within groups was calculated using Cohen’s d, with four sizes being
described as follows[55]: small ((cid:20) 0.2); medium (0.2–0.5); large (0.5–1.0); and very large (> 1).
A level of significance of p < 0.05 was considered for all analyses.

Results

The sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of the study sample are shown in Table 1.

The sample had a higher predominance of girls (58%), with a mean age of 8.58 years (range:

6 to 12 years). The most common types of tumours were Ewing’s sarcoma (20.8%) and rhab-
domyosarcoma (12.4%). In addition, 16.4% of the children presented allergies, but this condi-
tion did not prevent their participation in the programme, and none of the evaluated children
had severe mental or cognitive problems.

Tables 2 and 3 show the results of the studied variables before and after the AAT

programme.

Among the children, significant improvement was observed in the pain levels (p = 0.046,

d = –0.894), irritation (p = 0.041, d = –0.917), and stress (p = 0.005, d = –1.404), and a ten-
dency towards a decrease was observed for depressive symptoms (p = 0.069; d = –0.801) with
large or very large effect sizes. No significant changes in the physiological indicators were
observed.

Among the caregivers, significant improvement was observed in the indicators of the Bru-
nel Mood Scale, including anxiety (p = 0.007; d = –1,312), stress (p = 0.006; d = –1.350), and
mental confusion (p = 0.006; d = –1.361) (the latter included the items uncertain, muddled,
anxious, and worried), and the effect size was classified as very large. There was a tendency
towards a decrease in the rate of depression (p = 0.077; d = –0.774). These data are shown in
Table 3.

Notably, no complications were observed during the study period for the patients and dogs,

and no association was found between worsening of the clinical status of the children and the
proposed therapy according to the medical evaluation. Furthermore, the therapy dogs did not
show any signs of stress during the study.

Discussion

AAT is an innovative therapeutic modality that has a positive impact on different psychologi-
cal and physiological variables independent of the target public and the therapeutic context
(hospitalized adults[19–21], emergency medicine[17], oncology[22–29], cardiology[30], psy-
chiatry[31–33], and hospital paediatrics[34–38]). An example is better adaptation to the hospi-
tal setting and a reduction in stress, anxiety, depressive symptoms, and cortisol levels[56–62].
Therefore, there has been high acceptance of this therapy as a coadjuvant strategy for the

management of different medical conditions by medical teams in recent years. Paediatric
oncology is inserted into this context, because the diagnosis and treatment of childhood cancer
causes physical and emotional suffering for children and increases their vulnerability to the
development of psychological disorders, which may directly or indirectly affect their general
clinical condition.

Previous studies in Canada have described pilot procedures and the results of an AAT
programme for children with cancer[27,28]. This programme was designed to assist children
younger than 15 years of age under treatment for haematological and solid tumours. The inter-
ventions lasted 12 months, and children who attended the AAT sessions could not present

allergies, severe neutropaenia, recent surgery, use of invasive devices, or aggressive behav-
iour. The authors reported that the benefits of AAT in this context were evidenced by the
qualitative perception/evaluation by the caregivers and hospital staff, including improved
adaptation to the hospital setting, increased appetite, pain relief, acceptance of invasive pro-
cedures, increased sensation of well-being, less suffering, and increased motivation. Consid-
ering the positive indicators reported by this research group and the absence of quantitative
studies in this context, the objective of the present study was to measure the effects of AAT
on psychosocial and physiological parameters of paediatric oncology patients.

The first challenge and a factor that set this study apart was the proposal of a systematic pro-
tocol with clear and rigorous inclusion and exclusion criteria for the target patients of the ther-
apy as well as the care to be taken in terms of the hospital environment and therapy animals.

This protocol was developed in cooperation with a nosocomial infection control team special-
ized in oncology. The programme had high acceptance by the hospital staff as a whole, and its
execution was feasible. Moreover, no complications that could endanger the health of the
patients and animals were observed.

These findings corroborate those of previous studies, which reported the safety of the use of

AAT in hospitals when care was taken in the indication and inclusion of patients in the inter-
vention[14,27–29,34,36–39,63,64].

Consistent with the findings of previous studies, our results indicated improvement in pain
and psychological parameters (irritation, stress, anxiety, mental confusion, and tension) of the
children undergoing outpatient oncological treatment as perceived by the caregivers and chil-
dren, with significant effect sizes.

The improvement observed after participation in three AAT sessions may be directly
related to the benefits of the human-animal relationship, which favours psychological and
endocrine changes in the human body. Previous studies have shown that visual communica-
tion and touching animals can trigger the release of various substances in the human body,
including oxytocin, endorphins, and serotonin, and reduce the baseline cortisol level
[48,49,65–74]. These hormones and cytokines in combination may contribute to a reduction
of pain, anxiety, and stress and increase the sensation of pleasure and relaxation by children
undergoing cancer treatment.

These results can also be explained from the perspective of interspecies relations, because
there is no competition and instead there is a type of mutualism that justifies the increase in
communication and social relations. The formation of emotional bonds and ties with animals
makes their company enjoyable, especially during treatment, and can fill some challenges
faced by children during daily oncological treatment, including greater distance from relatives,
friends, and school activities and fewer social interactions[54,75].

The distraction provided by AAT is notable [i.e., the change in the focus of attention from

the disease (symptoms, procedures, limitations, and restrictions) to health]. AAT was more
effective than other leisure activities used in the hospital setting, such as reading, interaction
with volunteers, and recreational activities[22,23,25,30,70], probably due to the specificities of
the affiliative and affective relationship between dogs and humans.

AAT: Physiological and psychosocial variables in paediatric oncology

In contrast to the results of previous studies, the symptoms of depression did not improve
significantly in our study despite the tendency towards a reduction in the symptoms compared
to the baseline levels. This result may be because the follow-up period was not sufficient to
allow capture of significant changes in this and the other mood and physiological parameters
analysed; additionally, the sample size was small, which weakened the power of the statistical
tests used and increased the likelihood of type II error (i.e., not identifying differences).

In conclusion, the proposed programme was effective for children in outpatient oncological
treatment considering the quantitative effect on the analysed variables, and the selection crite-
ria and safety precautions adopted for the participants, dogs, and hospital environment were
adequate considering the acceptance of the programme by the medical team and the lack of
complications.

However, this study has the following limitations: 1) a quasi-experimental design64 and the

absence of a control group and 2) a relatively small sample, which was not statistically esti-
mated and was restricted to specific types of tumours.

Therefore, more studies are necessary to address these limitations and produce robust evi-

dence that can prove the effectiveness of AAT in promoting the physical, mental, and emo-
tional well-being of children undergoing oncological treatment and the humanization of the
hospital environment.
