ABSTRACT
Background:  A  complex  bidirectional  relationship  exists  between  sleep  and  post-traumatic 
stress  disorder  (PTSD).  Previous  research  reporting  a  strong  association  between  sleep  and 
PTSD  has 
largely  examined  older  military  veteran  populations,  with  military-related 
confounders  potentially  magnifying  this  effect.  Less  is  known  whether  this  association 
remains strong in younger civilian adults.
Objective:  This  study  examined  the  relationship  between  sleep  disturbances,  PTSD  symptoms 
and  PTSD  symptom  clusters  in  a  young  adult  population  with  mixed  trauma  histories,  while 
investigating the role of sex, chronotype and trauma chronicity in moderating this relationship.
Method: In this cross-sectional study, 337 trauma-exposed undergraduate students (269 females, 
68  males)  aged  17–66  (M = 20.24,  SD = 5.20)  completed  a  battery  of  online  questionnaires 
measuring  trauma  history,  PTSD  symptom  severity,  sleep  disturbances,  chronotype,  mood  state 
and alcohol use.
Results: Trauma-exposed participants with and without probable PTSD demonstrated a significant 
positive relationship between sleep disturbances and PTSD symptom severity, F(3, 333) = 58.24, p  
< .001,  R2 = .34,  although  this  relationship  was  not  significantly  moderated  by  any  of  the 
hypothesised  factors.  Additionally,  sleep  quality  was  significantly  and  positively  associated  with 
all four PTSD symptom clusters (re-experiencing, hyperarousal, avoidance, and negative mood).
Conclusions: The sleep–PTSD relationship in a mixed-trauma, young adult population is consistent 
with what has been found in military veteran populations. The strong association between sleep 
and PTSD highlight the potential for targeted sleep interventions to also benefit young adults with 
PTSD and may reduce PTSD risk in those who have recently experienced a traumatic event.

Relación  entre  alteraciones  del  sueño  y  sintomatología  de  trastorno  de 
estrés postraumático en estudiantes universitarios  

Antecedentes: Existe una relación compleja y bidireccional entre el sueño y el Trastorno de Estrés 
Postraumático (TEPT). Investigaciones anteriores que reportan una fuerte asociación entre el sueño y 
el  TEPT,  han  evaluado  en  gran  medida  a  militares  veteranos  de  mayor  edad,  con  factores 
relacionados  al  ejército,  los  que  pueden  ser  potencialmente  confundentes  al  magnificar  este 
efecto. Se sabe menos si esta asociación sigue siendo fuerte en adultos civiles más jóvenes.
Objetivo: Este estudio examinó la relación entre los trastornos del sueño, los síntomas de TEPT y los 
grupos  de síntomas  de TEPT,  en  una población de adultos  jóvenes  con antecedentes  de trauma 
mixto  mientras  se  investigaba  el  papel  del  sexo,  el  cronotipo  y  la  cronicidad  del  trauma,  en  la 
moderación de esta relación.
Metodología: En este estudio transversal, 337 estudiantes universitarios expuestos a trauma (269 
mujeres,  68  hombres)  de  entre  17  y  66  años  (M = 20,24,  DE = 5,20)  completaron  una  batería  de 
cuestionarios en línea que medían la historia de trauma, la severidad de los síntomas del TEPT, las 
alteraciones del sueño, el cronotipo, el estado de ánimo y el consumo de alcohol.
Resultados:  Los  participantes  expuestos  a  trauma,  con  y  sin  probable  TEPT,  demostraron  una 
relación  positiva  significativa  entre  las  alteraciones  del  sueño  y  la  gravedad  de  los  síntomas  de 
TEPT,  F(3,333) = 58.24,  p < .001,  R2 = 0.34,  aunque  esta 
fue  moderada 
significativamente  por  ninguno  de  los  factores  hipotetizados.  Además,  la  calidad  del  sueño  se 
asoció  de  manera  significativa  y  positiva  con 
los  cuatro  grupos  de  síntomas  de  TEPT 
(reexperimentación, estado hiperalerta, evitación y estado de ánimo negativo).
Conclusiones: La relación sueño-TEPT en una población de adultos jóvenes con trauma mixto es 
consistente  con  lo  que  se  ha  encontrado  en  poblaciones  de  veteranos  militares.  La  fuerte 
asociación  entre el sueño  y el trastorno  de estrés  postraumático  resalta la posibilidad  de que  las 
intervenciones específicas en el sueño también beneficien a los adultos jóvenes con trastorno de 
estrés  postraumático  y  que  puedan  reducir  el  riesgo  de  trastorno  de  estrés  postraumático  en 
aquellos que han experimentado recientemente un evento traumático.

1.  Background

Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a debilitating 
neuropsychiatric  disorder  underpinned  by  four  core 
symptom  clusters:  re-experiencing  of  the  trauma 
through  recurring  memories,  avoidance  of  trauma 
reminders,  physiological  hyperarousal  and  negative 
alterations 
in  cognitions  and  mood  (American 
Psychological  Association,  2013).  Sleep  disturbances 
are  a  hallmark  symptom  of  PTSD  (Germain,  2013), 
with recurring nightmares (re-experiencing symptom) 
and  insomnia  (i.e.  difficulty  falling  and/or  staying 
asleep;  hyperarousal  symptoms)  among  criteria  for 
diagnosis (APA, 2013). PTSD symptoms are strongly 
and bidirectionally associated with poor sleep (Slavish 
et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2019). Disturbed sleep both 
preceding and following trauma exposure is predictive 
of  PTSD  symptoms  and  development  (Chinoy  et  al., 
2022;  Fan  et  al.,  2017;  Koffel  et  al.,  2013;  van  Liempt 
et  al.,  2013;  Wang  et  al.,  2019).  On  the  other  hand, 
PTSD  symptoms  are  linked  to  an  increased  risk  for 
comorbid sleep disruptions (Chinoy et al., 2022; Cor-
nelius et al., 2024). These findings suggest that sleep is 
an  aetiological  factor  underlying  the  development  of 
PTSD  (Germain,  2013)  and  a  maintaining  factor 
once  PTSD  is  established  (Pace-Schott  et  al.,  2015; 
Saguin et al., 2021).

Although  PTSD  can  arise  at  any  life  stage  in  any 
population,  the  research  literature  investigating  its 
relationship  with  sleep  is  dominated  by  primarily 
male  US  military  veteran  samples  above  30  years  of 
age  (Sareen,  2014). To  illustrate,  13 out  of  20  studies 
describing sleep in PTSD investigated combat trauma 
in  a  meta-analysis  (Kobayashi  et  al.,  2007).  The 
majority  of  participants  in  combat  trauma  studies 
were male, while non-combat trauma studies featured 
predominantly  female  participants  (Kobayashi  et  al., 
2007).  Another  meta-analysis  reported  that  studies 
investigating sleep in PTSD including combat veterans 
assessed participants largely aged between 30 and 70, 
while  non-combat  studies  examined  participants 
aged  between  22  and  48  (Zhang  et  al.,  2019).  Many 
characteristics  of  military  populations,  such  as  com-
bat-exposure,  rotating  and  irregular  work  schedules, 
environmental  disruptors  (e.g.  noise),  and  health- 
related  issues  (e.g.  alcohol  or  drug  use)  impact  on 
sleep  and  may  be  catalysts  behind  the  strong  sleep– 
PTSD  relationship  (Good  et  al.,  2020;  Mantua  et  al., 
2019;  Osgood  et  al.,  2019).  Therefore,  it  is  unclear 
whether  the  magnitude  of  the  association  between 
sleep  and  PTSD remains  that  large  in young,  civilian 
populations.  Preliminary  evidence  suggests  a  similar 
relationship,  however,  only  limited  research  exists 
investigating  these  associations  within  young  adults 
who  have  not  experienced  a  military-related  trauma. 
For  example,  Wang  et  al.  (2022)  found  that  college 
students  with  disturbed  sleep  were  more  likely  to 

have  PTSD  but  did  not  assess  the  strength  of  this 
association.  Similarly,  weak  to  moderately  strong 
associations  have  been  found  between  sleep  quality 
and  PTSD  symptoms,  but  these  studies  either  did 
not  capture  the  full  extent  of  PTSD  symptomatology 
(Lind et al., 2017; Pickett et al., 2016) or studied a pre-
dominantly non-clinical sample with low PTSD symp-
tom  severity  (Lehinger  et  al.,  2023).  Therefore,  the 
overarching aim of this study is to further investigate 
the relationship between sleep and PTSD symptoma-
tology, specifically assessing whether this relationship 
remains strong in a young, non-veteran population in 
the  absence  of  military-related  confounders,  while 
accounting  for  potentially  important  trauma-specific 
and individual factors.

1.1.  Trauma-specific  factors

Trauma chronicity (the time since exposure to a trau-
matic event) may alter sleep quality in individuals with 
PTSD. Two studies observed that more recent traumas 
were associated with increased night-time awakenings 
and  nightmares,  compared  to  when  more  time  had 
passed  since  the  traumatic  event  (Hefez  et  al.,  1987; 
Lee  et  al.,  2015;  Rosen  et  al.,  1991).  Individuals  that 
were  assessed  years  after  trauma  exposure  demon-
strated  these  characteristics  less  severely.  Similarly, 
more  recent  studies  measuring  sleep  objectively 
observed  a  significant  effect  of  time  following  PTSD 
diagnosis on sleep disruption with objective sleep dis-
ruptions  reducing  over  time  (Hurwitz  et  al.,  1998; 
Klein  et  al.,  2003;  Mellman  et  al.,  2002,  2014).  How-
ever,  self-reported  sleep  difficulties  may  persist,  even 
years  after  experiencing  the  traumatic  event  (Klein 
et  al.,  2003).  Nonetheless,  most  studies  only  investi-
gated  the  sleep–PTSD  relationship  involving  similar 
chronicity  of  trauma  and  when  military  personnel 
were  studied,  only  tracked  short  periods  of  time  fol-
lowing  deployment  (Kobayashi  et  al.,  2007).  There-
fore,  less  is  known  about  the  effect  of  the  various 
trauma  chronicities  found  in  young  civilian  adult 
populations  and  their  effect  on  the  sleep–PTSD 
association.

1.2.  Individual  factors

Emerging evidence suggests that men and women with 
PTSD  exhibit  different  patterns  of  sleep  disturbances 
(Kobayashi  et  al.,  2012).  Particularly  women  with 
PTSD presented with more disrupted sleep including 
longer  wake  after  sleep  onset  compared  to  men 
(Zhang et al., 2019). Sex-specific differences have also 
been  found  in  a  meta-analysis  investigating  sleep- 
effects in fear conditioning paradigms, the experimen-
tal  model  examining  the  underlying  mechanisms  of 
PTSD  (Schenker  et  al.,  2021).  Sex  moderated  the 

association between sleep and the return of fear follow-
ing extinction, where increases in certain sleep stages 
were  protective  in  males  (i.e.  associated  with  lower 
fear  response)  but  predicted  higher  fear  responses  in 
women.  More  recently,  similar  sex-specificity  has 
been  found  in  those  with  PTSD  (Ney  et  al.,  2022; 
Richards et al., 2022; Schenker et al., 2022). Although 
only a few studies have compared sex-specific patterns 
of  sleep  disturbances  in  PTSD  participants,  PTSD 
studies  rarely  report  an  even  sex  distribution  among 
participants  (Kobayashi  et  al.,  2012;  Schenker  et  al., 
2023; Zhang et al., 2019), which hinders the possibility 
of  further  investigating  sex-specific  differences  in  the 
sleep–PTSD relationship.

Another  factor  that  may  affect  the  sleep–PTSD 
relationship is chronotype or the inherent preference 
of  the  body  for  sleep  and  wakefulness.  However,  the 
effect  of  participant  chronotype  on  the  sleep–PTSD 
relationship has been investigated in only two studies 
to date to our knowledge, and both in military popu-
lations (Harrison et al., 2021; Hasler et al., 2013). Self- 
reported eveningness was associated with greater life-
time sleep disturbance and higher symptom severity in 
combat veterans with various levels of post-traumatic 
stress symptoms (Hasler et al., 2013). Eveningness in 
U.S.  sailors  was  also  found  to  be  associated  with 
both  PTSD  symptoms  and  greater  sleep  disruption 
(Harrison et al., 2021). Studying the effects of chrono-
type on the sleep–PTSD relationship solely in military 
veterans  poses  an  issue.  Long-term  sleep  disruptions 
are  extremely  pervasive  in  these  populations  due  to 
high  proportions  of  shift  work  and  the  inability  to 
maintain  a  consistent  sleep  schedule  (Good  et  al., 
2020).  In  young  adults,  evening-type  has  also  been 
associated  with  both  worse  sleep  quality  and  worse 
psychological  well-being  (Gulec  et  al.,  2013;  Romo- 
Nava et al., 2016; Walsh et al., 2022). Thus, effects of 
eveningness  on  the  sleep–PTSD  relationship  should 
be investigated in young civilian adult cohorts.
sleep  disturbances 

trauma 
exposure  may  be  more closely  associated  with  symp-
tom  cluster  severity  than  PTSD  symptom  severity 
overall.  Prior  research  has  reported  that  re-experien-
cing  symptoms  were  related  to  issues  with  initiating 
and maintaining sleep (Babson et al., 2011), sleep con-
tinuity (Brownlow et al., 2022; Cox et al., 2018; Dietch 
et al., 2019), and sleep quality (Lee et al., 2015; Short 
et  al.,  2017),  while  hyperarousal  symptoms  were 
associated  with  lower  sleep  quality  (Babson  et  al., 
2011;  van  Wyk  et  al.,  2016),  sleep  maintenance  pro-
blems  and  nightmares  (Babson  et  al.,  2011).  There  is 
mixed  or  no  support  for  sleep  to  be  associated  with 
avoidance  or  negative  mood  symptom  clusters, 
respectively (e.g. Babson et al., 2011; Cox et al., 2018; 
Lee  et  al.,  2015,  but  Dietch  et  al.,  2019;  Short  et  al., 
2017).  Prior  research  focused  predominantly  on 
older  samples  and  military  populations  (Brownlow

et  al.,  2022;  Cox  et  al.,  2018;  Short  et  al.,  2017)  and 
research  investigating  the  association  between  sleep 
disturbances  and  specific  PTSD  symptom  clusters  in 
young  adults  is  limited.  For  example,  Lee  et  al. 
(2015) found re-experiencing and hyperarousal symp-
toms,  but  not  avoidance  symptoms,  to  mediate  the 
association between trauma exposure and sleep qual-
ity. Based on the previous research, it is therefore poss-
ible 
and/or  hyperarousal 
symptoms  –  the  hallmarks  of  PTSD  sleep  problems 
– may be more strongly associated with sleep disturb-
ances  than  avoidance  and  negative  mood  symptoms. 
Therefore,  considering  the  effects  of 
individual 
PTSD  symptom  clusters  on  sleep  may  result  in  a 
more  comprehensive  understanding  of  the  sleep– 
PTSD relationship.

1.3.  Aims  and  hypotheses

Based on the above, we aimed to investigate whether 
the magnitude and extent of the relationship between 
symptomatology 
sleep  disturbances  and  PTSD 
remains  large  in  a  young,  civilian  population  with  a 
range of trauma exposures and symptoms, and with-
out  military-related  confounders.  Additionally,  we 
explored  individual  and  trauma-specific  moderators 
of this relationship as well as PTSD symptom clusters. 
We  hypothesised  that:  (1)  a  significant  positive 
relationship  will  exist  between  sleep  disturbances 
and  PTSD  symptom  severity  in  young  trauma- 
exposed  individuals  with  a  range  of  PTSD  symptom 
severity; (2) this relationship will be significantly mod-
erated by sex, chronotype and trauma chronicity; and 
(3)  sleep  disturbances  will  be  associated  with  re- 
experiencing  and  hyperarousal  symptom  clusters, 
but not avoidance and negative mood clusters.

2. Method

2.1.  Participants

720  undergraduate  students  were  recruited  via  con-
venience  sampling  over  a  period  of  six  months  via 
the University of Melbourne (Australia). After exclud-
ing incomplete (i.e. missing sleep or PTSD data) and 
invalid  data  entries  (see  Figure  1),  634  participants 
remained  and  were  grouped  into  trauma-naïve  (N =  
297),  trauma-exposed  without  PTSD  (N = 194)  and 
probable PTSD (N = 143). The protocol was approved 
by  The  University  of  Melbourne  Human  Research 
Ethics  Committee  (#14544)  and  all  participants  gave 
informed consent.

2.2.  Procedure

Data  was  collected  between  February  and  July  2021 
and  participants  anonymously  completed  an  online 

4

survey.  Trauma-exposed  participants  with  and  with-
out probable PTSD were distinguished from trauma- 
naïve by scoring one or more on the Trauma Exposure 
Questionnaire (TEQ, see below; Vrana & Lauterbach, 
1994) and individuals with probable PTSD were ident-
ified using the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5, see 
below; Weathers et al., 2013).

2.3.  Measures

2.3.1.  Trauma  variables
TEQ and PCL-5 were used to assess trauma exposure 
and  PTSD symptomatology.  The  former  lists  a  series 
of common criterion A trauma (APA, 2013) and par-
ticipants respond whether they experienced it (yes) or 
not (no). The latter was used to measure PTSD symp-
tom severity and total scores equal or greater than 33 
indicated that a PTSD diagnosis was probable (Weath-
ers et al., 2013). Cluster item scores were summed to 
obtain  re-experiencing,  avoidance,  hyperarousal,  and 
negative  mood  scores.  PTSD  symptomatology  was 
assessed  in  trauma-naïve  participants  by  completion 
of  the  PCL-5  considering  their  most  stressful  experi-
ence  to  date  (Ney  et  al.,  2021).  Trauma  chronicity 
was  calculated  using  the  years  elapsed  since  partici-
pants’ most recent trauma exposure on the TEQ.

2.3.2.  Sleep  variables
Sleep  quality  was  assessed  using  the  Pittsburgh  Sleep 
Quality Index (PSQI; Buysse et al., 1989), while insom-
nia  and  daytime  sleepiness  were  assessed  using  the 
Insomnia  Severity  Index  (ISI;  Bastien  et  al.,  2001) 
and  the  Epworth  Sleepiness  Scale  (ESS;  Johns,  1991), 
respectively.  A  PSQI  score  >5  is  considered  as  the 
cut-off  score  to  differentiate  between  good  and  poor 
sleep  quality  (Buysse  et  al.,  1989).  Higher  scores  on 
the ISI and ESS are indicative of more severe insomnia 
and greater daytime sleepiness, respectively, with ISI ≥ 
15  used  as  the  clinical  cut-off  for  insomnia  (Morin 
et al., 2011). Chronotype was assessed using the Morn-
ingness–Eveningness  questionnaire  (MEQ;  Horne  & 
Östberg, 1976).

2.3.3.  Demographic  variables
Demographic measures included age and sex as well as 
depressive,  anxiety  and  stress  symptoms  assessed  on 
the  21-item  Depression,  Anxiety  and  Stress  Scale 
(DASS-21;  Lovibond  &  Lovibond,  1995)  and  alcohol 
used measured by the Alcohol Use Disorder Identifi-
cation Test (AUDIT; Saunders et al., 1993). Summary 
scores on each DASS subscale can be interpreted on a 
continuum of severity (Lovibond & Lovibond, 1995). 
Finally,  AUDIT  total  scores  gave  an  indication  for 
risk drinking behaviour (Saunders et al., 1993).

2.4.  Data  analysis

To  test  hypothesis  1,  the  relationship  between  sleep 
disturbances  and  PTSD  symptomatology  in  trauma- 
exposed  participants  with  and  without  probable 
PTSD  was  assessed  using  hierarchical  multiple 
regression  with  sleep  quality  (PSQI),  insomnia  (ISI) 
and daytime sleepiness (ESS) as independent variables 
and PTSD symptom severity (total PCL-5 score) as the 
outcome.  Hypothesis  2  was  assessed  in  trauma- 
exposed  individuals  with  three  moderation  analyses 
to  investigate  the  possible  effects  of  sex,  chronotype 
and  trauma  chronicity  on  the  sleep–PTSD  relation-
ship.  Finally,  the  relationship  between  individual 
PTSD symptom clusters and sleep quality (hypothesis 
3) utilised separate linear regressions with each cluster 
score as an independent variable and sleep quality as 
the outcome variable.

In  prior  studies,  the  type  of  control  population 
used  (trauma-exposed  or  trauma-naïve)  signifi-
cantly moderated the relationship with sleep quality 
when  compared  to  PTSD  (Zhang  et  al.,  2019).  Dis-
turbed  sleep  is  not  solely  associated  with  a  PTSD 
diagnosis  and  is  frequently  observed  in  trauma  sur-
vivors  without  PTSD  (Milanak  et  al.,  2019).  Thus, 
including  both  trauma-exposed  and  trauma-naïve 
individuals  as  controls  and  assessing  the  relation-
ship  between  sleep  and  PTSD  symptoms  dimen-
sionally  may  enhance  our  comprehension  of  their 
interaction.  Therefore,  we  conducted  the  same  ana-
lyses  as  outlined  above  and  included  trauma-naïve 
individuals 
the  relationship  between 
sleep  and  PTSD  symptoms  dimensionally  across 
the  full  sample.  The  results  are  included  in  the 
appendix.

to  assess 

Effect sizes were calculated as Cohen’s R2  (Cohen, 
1988)  and  Green’s  ΔR2  (Green,  1991)  and  bootstrap 
was  applied  to  all  regression  models  with  confidence 
intervals obtained from 10,000 resamples (Davison & 
Hinkley,  1997).  Assumptions  were  checked  prior  to 
running  tests  and  where  assumptions  were  not 
met,  values  fell  within  bootstrapped  limits.  A  flow- 
chart  of  data  processing  and  sample  size  for  each 
hypothesis is reported in Figure 1. All statistical ana-
lyses  were  conducted  in  R  version  4.3.1  (R  Core 
Team,  2023).

3. Results

Means  and  standard  deviations  of  study  question-
naires are reported in Table 1. The total sample con-
sisted  of  491  females  and  143  males,  with  the  age 
ranging  between  16  and  66  years  of  age.  Both  the 
full  and  trauma-exposed  samples  had  a  mean  total 
PCL-5 score below the clinical cut-off of 33. Regardless 
of  whether  trauma-naïve  individuals  were  included, 
reduced  self-reported  sleep  quality  was  observed.

3.1.  Hypothesis  1:  the  sleep–PTSD  relationship

The best-fitting model of sleep disturbances predicting 
PTSD  symptom  severity  in  trauma-exposed  individ-
uals with and without probable PTSD was determined 
using hierarchical multiple regression with sleep qual-
ity as measured by the PSQI, insomnia (ISI) and day-
time sleepiness symptoms (ESS) entered according to 
the strength of their associations with disturbed sleep 
in  PTSD  found  in  previous  studies  (Ahmadi  et  al., 
2022; Westermeyer et al., 2010). Models were signifi-
cant  at  each  step  of  the  regression  (p < .001).  At  the 
final  step,  all  measures  of  sleep  disturbance  together 
were  significantly  associated  with  PTSD  symptom 
severity,  F(3,  333) = 58.24,  p < .001,  accounting  for 
34%,  95%  CI  [.26,  .43]  of  variance  in  the  PCL-5 
score  (a  large  effect;  Cohen,  1988).  ΔR2  suggests  sig-
nificant  improvements  in  model  fit  after  including 
ISI,  F(1,  334) = 28.97,  p < .001,  and  ESS,  F(1,  333) =  
19.41,  p < .001.  Standardised  beta  coefficients  indi-
cated that insomnia symptoms were the strongest pre-
dictor  of  PTSD  symptom  severity  followed  by  sleep 
quality,  then  daytime  sleepiness.  See  Table  2 for 
model  details.  The  model  including  the  full  sample 
can  be  found  in  the  supplementary  table  S1  and 
yielded similar results.

3.2.  Hypothesis  2:  moderation  analyses 
including  sex,  chronotype  and  trauma 
chronicity

In  the  trauma-exposed  sub-sample  with  and  without 
probable  PTSD,  269  were  female  and  68  were  male. 
Overall,  the  model  including  sex,  sleep  quality  as 
well  as  their  interaction  was  significant,  F(3,  333) =  
40.83, p < .001. However, sex was not a significant pre-
dictor  (p = .22)  nor  moderator  of  the  sleep–PTSD 

Figure  1.  Participant  flow  in  study  hypotheses.

Mean  MEQ  scores  demonstrated  an  intermediate 
chronotype,  ranging  from  morning,  intermediate  to 
evening  types.  In  the  trauma-exposed  sample,  the 
average  number  of  trauma  exposures  was  almost 
two, and on average, the most recent trauma occurred 
a little over two years before testing. Mild and moder-
ate depression symptoms, mild stress symptoms, and 
mild  and  moderate  anxiety  symptoms  were  observed 
in the full and trauma-exposed-only samples, respect-
ively. Finally, low risk for harmful patterns of alcohol 
use was observed. To assess hypotheses 1, 2 and 3, the 
results  from  the  trauma-exposed  subgroup  (N = 337) 
are  reported  here  and  from  the  full  sample  are 
included in the supplement (S1, S2, S4). Sixteen indi-
viduals  were  older  than  30.  They  were  excluded  for 
sensitivity  analyses,  but  results  remained  unchanged, 
see supplementary table S5.

relationship  (p = .89,  see  Figure  2(A)).  Likewise,  the 
model  including  chronotype  was  significant,  F(3, 
279) = 30.00, p < .001, but individually did not predict 
PTSD  symptom  severity  (p = .67)  nor  moderate  the 
sleep–PTSD  relationship  (p = .85,  see  Figure  2(B)). 
The  majority  (N = 162)  had  an  intermediate  chrono-
type,  15  self-reported  a  preference  for  morning,  and 
106  were  evening-type.  Data  of  54  were  missing. 
Lastly, trauma chronicity (years since the most recent 
trauma)  was  not  a  significant  predictor  (p = .23)  nor 
moderator  of  the  sleep–PTSD  relationship  (p = .81), 
despite  the  model  overall  reaching  significance, 
F(3,  333) = 41.43,  p < .001  (Figure  2(C)).  In  all  three 
models,  sleep  quality  as  measured  by  the  PSQI  score 
was a significant predictor of PTSD symptom severity 
as measured by the PCL-5 (p < .05). Table 3 includes 
summaries  of  all  moderation  models.  Moderation 
analyses  for  sex  and  chronotype  in  the  full  sample 
can  be  found  in  supplementary  table  S2  with  similar 
results.

3.3.  Hypothesis  3:  the  dimensional  sleep–PTSD 
symptom  cluster  relationship

PTSD  symptom  clusters  including  re-experiencing, 
avoidance,  hyperarousal,  and  negative  mood  symp-
toms  were  all  independently  associated  with  lower 
sleep  quality  with  medium  effects.  Firstly,  greater  re- 
experiencing  symptom  severity  was  significantly 
associated with  lower sleep  quality, F(1, 335) = 71.18, 
p < .001  (Figure  3(A)),  explaining  17.5%,  95%  CI 
[.10,  .25],  of  its  variance  (medium  effect;  Cohen, 
1988). For every standard unit increase in re-experien-
cing  symptom  severity,  there  was  a  corresponding 
standard unit increase in PSQI score of 0.42. Similarly, 
avoidance  symptom  severity  was  significantly  related 
to  sleep  quality,  F(1,  335) = 55.26,  p < .001  (Table  4, 
Figure  3(B)).  It  explained  14%,  95%  CI  [.07,  .21],  of 
variance  in  sleep  quality  (medium  effect;  Cohen, 
1988)  and  every  standard  unit  increase  in  avoidance 
symptom  severity  was  accompanied  with  a  0.38-

point increase in PSQI score. Next, greater hyperarou-
sal symptom severity was significantly associated with 
worse sleep quality, F(1, 335) = 104.6, p < .001 (Figure 
3(C)). It explained 24%, 95% CI [.61, .32], of the var-
iance in sleep quality, which constituted a medium to 
large  effect  (Cohen,  1988).  For  every  standard  unit 
increase in hyperarousal symptom severity, there was 
a  corresponding  increase  in  PSQI  score  of  0.49. 
Finally, negative mood symptom severity was also sig-
nificantly related to sleep quality, F(1, 335) = 85.19, p  
< .001  (Figure  3(D)),  which  explained  20%,  95%  CI 
[.13,  .82],  of  variance  in  sleep  quality  (medium  to 
large  effect;  Cohen,  1988).  Every  standard  unit 
increase  in  negative  mood  symptom  severity  was 
associated  with  a  0.45-point  increase  in  the  PSQI 
score.  Results  from  the  trauma-exposed  and  full 
sample  are  included  in  supplementary  table  S3  and 
S4, respectively, with comparable results.

As avoidance behaviour in PTSD is hypothesised to 
predict anxiety (Bardeen et al., 2015; Sareen, 2014) and 
negative mood overlaps highly with depression symp-
toms  (Elhai  et  al.,  2015),  exploratory  analyses  were 
conducted  to  further  investigate  the  unexpected  sig-
nificance of avoidance and negative mood in relation 
to  sleep  quality  in  two  multiple  regression  models 
(Table  4).  Both  avoidance  and  anxiety  symptoms 
were  significantly  associated  with  sleep  quality,  F(2, 
334) = 43.42,  p < .001.  Beta  coefficients were  0.28  and 
0.25 for anxiety and avoidance respectively, indicating 
anxiety  symptoms  had  a  stronger  association  with 
sleep  quality  than  avoidance.  Both  negative  mood 
and depression symptoms similarly showed significant 
associations  with  sleep  quality,  F(2,  334) = 49.04,  p  
< .001.  Conversely,  beta  coefficients  for  negative 
mood  (0.30)  and  depression  (0.22)  indicated  that 
negative  mood  had  a  stronger  association  with  sleep 
quality than depression symptoms.

4.  Discussion

The aim of this study was to assess the strength of the 
relationship  between  sleep  disturbances  and  PTSD 
symptomatology  in  a  relatively  understudied  sample 
of  young  civilian  adults  with  a  range  of  trauma  his-
tories  and  without  military-related  confounders.  As 
expected,  there  was  a  positive  association  between 
sleep  disturbances  and  PTSD  symptom  severity.  The 
results  were  in  line  with  the  limited  literature  in  the 

field  (Lehinger  et  al.,  2023;  Lind  et  al.,  2017;  Pickett 
et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2022). Contrary to our expec-
tations, sex, chronotype and trauma chronicity did not 
moderate 
the  sleep–PTSD  relationship.  Finally, 
although  re-experiencing  and  hyperarousal  PTSD 
cluster scores were positively associated with sleep dis-
turbances  as  hypothesised,  avoidance  and  negative 
mood  were  also  significantly  related  to  poor  sleep. 
Exploratory  analyses  highlighted  that  the  effect  of 
avoidance  on  sleep  was  independent  from  anxiety 
symptoms  and  the  effect  of  negative  alterations  in 
mood was independent from depressive symptoms.

The observed strong, positive relationship between 
sleep  disturbances  and  PTSD symptomatology  in the 
trauma-exposed  sample  is  consistent  with  previous 
research,  despite  considerable  demographic  differ-
ences between our sample and commonly researched 
veteran  populations  including  younger  in  age,  type 
of  trauma  exposure,  low  risk  of  deleterious  alcohol 
use  and  lack  of  other  military-related  confounders 
(Germain,  2013;  Good  et  al.,  2020;  Kobayashi  et  al., 
2007; Mantua et al., 2019; Sareen, 2014; Zhang et  al., 
2019).  One  surprising  finding  was  the  high  rate  of 
probable  PTSD  detected  within  the  trauma-exposed 
participants (42%) compared with 20% of the general 
population  and  25%  of  military  populations  (Seedat 
et  al.,  2003;  Wellman  et  al.,  2016).  This  may  be  par-
tially explained by the higher rate of psychopathology 
experienced  by  Australian  university  students  com-
pared  with  the  general  population  (Larcombe  et  al., 
2016;  Stallman,  2010).  Young  adults  also  experience 
poorer sleep than the general population, which may 
predispose  them  to  heightened  PTSD  responses  fol-
lowing  trauma  (Cusack  et  al.,  2019).  Clarifying  rates 
of probable PTSD in young adult populations is criti-
cal  in  future  research  investigating  the  sleep–PTSD 
relationship in this population.

Sex,  chronotype  and  trauma  chronicity  did  not 
moderate  the  sleep–PTSD  relationship,  unlike  pre-
vious  research  (Harrison  et  al.,  2021;  Hasler  et  al., 
2013;  Hefez  et  al.,  1987;  Mellman  et  al.,  2014; 
Rosen  et  al.,  1991;  Schenker  et  al.,  2021;  Schenker 
et  al.,  2022;  Schenker  et  al.,  2023).  While  PTSD  is 
about  twice  as  common  in  women  compared  to 
men  (Kessler  et  al.,  2017),  female  participants  were 
overrepresented  in  our  sample.  The  unbalanced 
sample  size  resulted  in  reduced  power  to  detect  the 
moderation  effect  for  sex,  and  particularly  to  detect 

a  slope  significantly  different  from  zero  in  male  par-
ticipants.  Additionally,  it  should  be  noted  that  the 
small  interaction  effects  were  incredibly  difficult  to 
estimate  via  moderation  analyses,  especially  when 
compared  with  strong  main  effects  (Gelman  et  al., 
2020).  To  illustrate,  the  association  between  sleep 
quality  and  PTSD  symptom  severity  (β = 0.50)  in 
the  current  study  was  much  larger  than  the  inter-
action  effect  between  sex  and  sleep  quality  (β =  
−0.02).  The  effect  of  chronotype  on  the  sleep– 
PTSD  relationship  may  also  not  be  as  robust  as  pre-
viously suggested (Harrison et al., 2021; Hasler et al., 
2013).  The  adverse  effect  of  eveningness  on  PTSD 
symptomatology  may  be  stronger  in  military  popu-
lations,  who  commonly  report  long-term  sleep  dis-
ruptions,  which  may  not  be 
in  young 
found 
civilian  populations  (Good  et  al.,  2020).

Finally,  all  four  PTSD  symptom  clusters  –  re- 
experiencing,  hyperarousal, 
avoidance,  negative 
mood  –  were  significantly  associated  with  poor 
sleep.  Interestingly  and  against  our  expectations, 
higher  avoidance  and  negative  alterations  in  mood 
symptoms  were  associated  with  greater  sleep  disrup-
tions.  A  recent  review  proposed  that  fear  of  sleep, 
which  consists  of  dysfunctional  beliefs  about  loss  of 
control  and  safety  (a  symptom  of  the  negative 
mood  and  cognition  cluster)  during  sleep  due  to 
nocturnal  re-experiencing  symptoms  (e.g.  night-
mares),  may  lead  to  a  maladaptive  behaviour  includ-
ing  avoiding  going  to  sleep  (Werner  et  al.,  2021). 
Therefore,  anxiety  may  underlie  avoidance  symp-
toms  (Bardeen  et  al.,  2015;  Sareen,  2014),  which 
has  been  found  to  be  linked  to  sleep  disturbances 
(Hoffman  &  Grossman,  2017;  Spoormaker  &  van 
den  Bout,  2005).  Similarly,  negative  mood  and  cog-
nition  have  been  found  to  be  indirectly  related  to 
sleep  disturbances  through  depressive  symptoms 
(Zhen  et  al.,  2018).  Although  we  accounted  for 
anxiety  and  depression,  the  avoidance-sleep  and 
relationships  were  not 
negative  mood–sleep 
levels, 
accounted 
respectively,  in  our  sample.  This  finding  may  be 
due to our conceptualisation of PTSD symptom clus-
ters  as  separate  constructs.  Network  analysis  of 
symptom  cluster  associations  demonstrated  that  all 
were  causally  associated  and  covaried  over  time  as 
PTSD  developed  following  trauma  (Bryant  et  al., 
2017).  Our  cross-sectional  regression  models  did 
not  account  for  such  covariance.  It  may  be  that 
mainly  re-experiencing  and  hyperarousal  symptom 
clusters  drive  poor  sleep  but  this  was  not  accurately 
estimated  due  to  inter-cluster  covariance.

in  addition 

interventions  to  prevent  and  treat  PTSD  in  young 
adults.  Emerging  research  investigating  sleep  inter-
ventions  in  PTSD  patients  show  promising  results 
(Carlson  et  al.,  2022;  Pigeon  et  al.,  2022;  Raskind 
et  al.,  2013;  Walters  et  al.,  2020).  Targeted  sleep 
therapy 
to  current  gold-standard 
trauma-focused  cognitive  therapy  has  been  found 
to  address  poor  sleep  that  may  be  interacting  with 
and  maintaining  PTSD 
symptomatology  and 
improve  the  efficacy  of  trauma-focused  cognitive 
therapy  (Pigeon  et  al.,  2022;  Walters  et  al.,  2020). 
In  turn,  the  increased  efficacy  of  trauma-focused 
cognitive  therapy  may  reduce  premature  drop-out 
rates  and  increase  treatment  adherence.  Our  obser-
vation  that  34%  of  variance  in  PTSD  symptom 
severity  was  explained  by  disturbed  sleep 
in 
trauma-exposed  participants  strongly  supports  the 
notion  that  sleep  intervention  for  PTSD  may  also 
be  beneficial  for  young  civilian  adults  with  PTSD. 
Our  results  indicate  that  such  a  two-pronged  treat-
ment  strategy  may  therefore  be  an  attractive  option 
for  restoring  normal  sleep  and  reducing  PTSD 
symptom  severity  in  young  adults.

We  found  that  sleep  disturbances  were  associated 
with  PTSD  symptomatology  regardless  of  trauma- 
exposure  and  probable  PTSD  diagnosis,  with  the 
greatest  sleep  disturbances  reported  in  those  with 
probable  PTSD,  followed  by  participants  exhibiting 
subsyndromal  PTSD.  Trauma-naïve  participants 
reported  comparatively  normal  sleep  quality.  The 
strong relationship between sleep and PTSD sympto-
matology  emphasised  that  sleep  disturbances  may 
not  just  be  an  issue  for  those  who  have  likely  PTSD 
but may already be an issue for those who have experi-
enced  a  traumatic  event  and  have  not  yet  developed 
PTSD. These findings highlight possible opportunities 
for preventative PTSD interventions using sleep treat-
ments  in  the  acute  post-trauma  phase.  Individuals 
with subsyndromal PTSD symptoms are at significant 
risk  for  later  disorder  development  (Pietrzak  et  al., 
2014).  Despite  much  research,  preventative  interven-
tions  following  trauma  exposure  demonstrate  low 
efficacy  and  disorder  prevalence  has  remained  stable 
over  the  past  40  years  (Kilpatrick  et  al.,  2013).  Sleep 
as  a  modifiable  factor  presents  opportunities  for  tar-
geted sleep interventions as a potential means to mini-
mise  rates  of  PTSD  development  by  addressing 
dysregulated  sleep  in  the  immediate  aftermath  of 
trauma.  Even  where  PTSD  development  is  not  pre-
vented,  early  sleep  interventions  have  the  potential 
to  prevent  significant  functional  impairment  (Freed-
man  et  al.,  2015)  and  are  particularly  important  in 
populations at risk for disturbed sleep prior to trauma, 
such  as  emergency  service  personnel  (Huang  et  al., 
2022),  military  veterans  (Osgood  et  al.,  2019)  and 
possibly  even  university  students  (Schlarb  et  al., 
2017; Seelig et al., 2010).

4.2.  Limitations

to 

levels 

Despite  its  strengths,  this  study  was  not  devoid  of 
limitations.  One  important  contextual  factor  is  the 
COVID-19  pandemic  and  associated 
lockdowns 
which  occurred  at  the  time  of  data  collection.  This 
increase  stress, 
pandemic  has  been  shown 
depression  and  anxiety 
in  young  adults 
(Varma  et  al.,  2021;  Wang  et  al.,  2022)  and  may 
have  artificially  inflated  PTSD  symptomatology  in 
our  sample.  Pandemic  and  lockdown  environments 
have  also  been  shown  to  alter  sleep  patterns  in 
young  adults,  resulting  in  increased  sleep  duration 
but  poorer  sleep  quality  and  increased  nightmares 
(Socarras  et  al.,  2021).  In  the  future,  this  study  may 
be replicated in a non-lockdown environment to elim-
inate  effects  of  pandemic-related  factors  on  rates  of 
disturbed  sleep  and  PTSD,  and  the  sleep–PTSD 
relationship as a whole.

Additionally, although our sample demonstrated a 
robust  sleep–PTSD  relationship,  the  cross-sectional 
nature of our research design did not allow us to deter-
mine the directionality or causality of this association. 
Prior  studies  have  found  that  sleep  disturbances  can 
increase  the  risk  of  developing  PTSD,  and  PTSD,  in 
turn,  may  predict  future  sleep  difficulties  (Cornelius 
et  al.,  2024;  Wang  et  al.,  2022).  However,  it  remains 
unclear whether sleep disturbances precede the onset 
of PTSD symptoms or if PTSD symptoms lead to sub-
sequent sleep disturbances particularly in the immedi-
ate aftermath of trauma in young adults who have not 
experienced military-related trauma. Our analysis did 
not  explore  mechanisms  underpinning  our  obser-
vations,  which  would  be  required  for  translation  of 
our research findings into clinical practice (McFarlane 
et  al.,  2017).  Therefore,  future  studies  should  incor-
porate  longitudinal  investigations  of  PTSD  sympto-
matology  after  trauma-exposure  and  co-occurring 
changes in sleep in young adults.

5.  Conclusion

This  study  provides  strong  evidence  for  a  positive 
relationship  between  sleep  disturbances  and  PTSD 
symptomatology  in  a  young  adult,  civilian  cohort 
with  mixed  trauma  histories  and  without  military- 
related  confounders.  Increasing  severity  of  sleep  dis-
turbances was associated with increasing PTSD symp-
the  sleep–PTSD 
tom  severity,  confirming 
relationship  previously  observed  in  military  popu-
lations also exists in young adults, including – to a les-
ser extent – in individuals with subsyndromal PTSD. 
Although  causality  cannot  be  established,  the  signifi-
cant association between poor sleep and PTSD symp-
tom severity suggests that sleep disturbances may also 
play  a  role  in  the  maintenance  of  PTSD  in  young 
is  associated  with  a  range  of 
adults.  PTSD 

that 

impairments across various domains, and our findings 
highlight  the  potential  of  targeting  poor  sleep  for 
PTSD  prevention  and  treatment  in  young  adults. 
Finally,  although  young  adults  have  historically  been 
largely overlooked in the PTSD literature, our results 
emphasise  the  critical  need  for  future  research  in 
this cohort.
