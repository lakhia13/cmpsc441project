Abstract
Aims. Three factors converge to underscore the heightened importance of evaluating the
potential health/well-being effects of friendships in older adulthood. First, policymakers,
scientists, and the public alike are recognizing the importance of social relationships for
health/well-being and creating national policies to promote social connection. Second, many
populations are rapidly aging throughout the world. Third, we currently face what some call a
‘friendship recession’. Although, growing research documents associations between friendship
with better health and well-being, friendship can also have a ‘dark side’ and can potentially
promote negative outcomes. To better capture friendship’s potential heterogeneous effects, we
took an outcome-wide analytic approach.
Methods. We analysed data from 12,998 participants in the Health and Retirement Study
(HRS) – a prospective and nationally representative cohort of U.S. adults aged >50, and,
evaluated if increases in friendship strength (between t0; 2006/2008 and t1; 2010/2012) were
associated with better health/well-being across 35 outcomes (in t2; 2014/2016). To assess
friendship strength, we leveraged all available friendship items in HRS and created a com-
posite ‘friendship score’ that assessed the following three domains: (1) friendship network size,
(2) friendship network contact frequency and (3) friendship network quality.
Results. Stronger friendships were associated with better outcomes on some indicators of
physical health (e.g. reduced risk of mortality), health behaviours (e.g. increased physical activ-
ity) and nearly all psychosocial indicators (e.g. higher positive affect and mastery, as well as
lower negative affect and risk of depression). Friendship was also associated with increased
likelihood of smoking and heavy drinking (although the latter association with heavy drinking
did not reach conventional levels of statistical significance).
Conclusions. Our findings indicate that stronger friendships can have a dual impact on health
and well-being. While stronger friendships appear to mainly promote a range of health and
well-being outcomes, stronger friendships might also promote negative outcomes. Additional
research is needed, and any future friendship interventions and policies that aim to enhance
outcomes should focus on how to amplify positive outcomes while mitigating harmful ones.

Three factors converge to underscore the heightened importance of evaluating the potential
health and well-being effects of friendships in older adulthood. First, policymakers, scien-
tists and the public alike are recognizing the importance of social relationships for health and
well-being outcomes and creating national policies to promote social connection. For example,
the United Kingdom and Japan recently appointed their first ‘ministers of loneliness’ to com-
bat loneliness at the national level (Fried et al., 2020), and the U.S. Surgeon General recently
published ‘Our Epidemic of Loneliness and Isolation: The U.S. Surgeon General’s Advisory on
the Healing Effects of Social Connection and Community’. Second, populations are rapidly
aging in many countries throughout the world (United Nations, Department of Economic and
Social Affairs, Population Division, 2020). For example, the number of people aged ≥65 years
in the United States is projected to increase by nearly 50% in the next 15 years (Colby and
Ortman, 2014). Coupled with this rapid pace of population aging, older adults are also more
likely to experience risk factors for loneliness and social isolation, such as: living alone, loss
of family and contemporaries, and illness (National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and

2

Kim et al.

Medicine, 2020). Third, we are currently facing what some call
a ‘friendship recession’. Even before the COVID-19 pandemic,
research has shown that friendship levels have been declining over
time (McPherson et al., 2006; Ward, 2022). A recent report high-
lights our changing social landscape; in 2021, a nationwide survey
found that 12% of respondents reported having 0 close friends,
and 49% reported having three or fewer close friends. This con-
trasts markedly with 1990 when the rates were only 3% and 27%,
respectively (Cox, 2021).

As populations age, identifying factors that bolster health and
well-being is critical for stemming the growing wave of chronic
conditions and mounting healthcare costs (Kubzansky et al., 2018).
Although traditional biomedical efforts have focused on identi-
fying risk factors of disease (e.g. loneliness and social isolation)
(Holt-Lunstad, 2022; Hong et al., 2023; Valtorta et al., 2016; Wilson
et al., 2007), researchers and policymakers increasingly seek poten-
tially modifiable health assets that uniquely enhance a person’s
ability to foster health and well-being (e.g. friendship) (Kubzansky
et al., 2018; VanderWeele, 2017). A large and growing body of
research has evaluated the adverse effects of loneliness and social
isolation on health and well-being outcomes. As illustrative exam-
ples, loneliness has been linked with a 50%, 29% and 26% elevated
risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease, coronary heart disease and
premature mortality, respectively (Holt-Lunstad, 2022; Valtorta
et al., 2016; Wilson et al., 2007). However, much less research has
focused on the potential influence that friendships exert on health
and well-being outcomes, especially in older adults (Blieszner et al.,
2019).

Friendships are shaped by genetics, social structural factors
and changing life circumstances (Blieszner et al., 2019; Festinger
et al., 1950; Iervolino et al., 2002). However, various dimensions of
friendship (i.e. quantity, contact frequency, quality of interactions)
can be intervened upon through several approaches (Blieszner
et al., 2019; Hong et al., 2022) (e.g. a series of questions that foster
closeness through mutual vulnerability (i.e. ‘Fast Friends’) (Aron
et al., 1997); an online 12-week ‘Friendship Enrichment Program’
aimed at promoting relational competence, social skills and friend-
ship formation skills (Bouwman et al., 2017); and components of
other research and programs designed to reduce loneliness and
social isolation) (Hoang et al., 2022; Hong et al., In Press). Growing
research has documented friendship’s association with a range of
health and well-being outcomes. Various dimensions of friend-
ship have been associated with better: psychological health (e.g.
higher life satisfaction and lower depression) (Choi et al., 2020;
Fowler and Christakis, 2008; Santini et al., 2015), health behaviours
(e.g. increased: preventive healthcare service use, physical activity,
smoking cessation) (Christakis and Fowler, 2008; Han et al., 2019;
Watt et al., 2014) and physical health (e.g. reduced risk of: cognitive
decline and mortality) (Chopik, 2017; Sharifian et al., 2020; Shor
and Roelfs, 2015). Interestingly, like other social factors, friend-
ship might act as an ‘amplification system’ for both beneficial and
harmful health and well-being outcomes depending on the social
context. Said another way, networks can magnify whatever they are
seeded with (e.g. attitudes, norms, behaviours). Thus, friendships
can also have a ‘dark side’ and promote negative health and well-
being outcomes. However, research evaluating negative outcomes
is sparse.

Existing friendship and health/well-being studies have been
seminal and contributed substantially to the literature, but they
remain limited from a causal inference perspective. First, many
studies are cross-sectional, making it challenging to assess the
causal and temporal sequence of variables. Second, only a small

portion of studies in the field of social relationships and health have
broken down results by relationship type, preventing us from iso-
lating the effects of friendships. Third, among longitudinal studies
evaluating friendship, many health behaviour and physical health
outcomes have not been evaluated in adult populations. Fourth,
some existing studies do not account for relevant potential con-
founders (e.g. depressive symptoms or baseline health). Fifth, exist-
ing research on friendships and health and well-being is highly
fragmented. Studies often focus on a single dimension of friend-
ship (e.g. network size, contact frequency or interaction quality)
and usually limit their scope to one specific health behaviour
or physical health outcome. This piecemeal approach leaves sub-
stantial gaps in our understanding of how various dimensions of
friendship might collectively or differentially influence a broader
range of health and well-being outcomes. Sixth, most longitudi-
nal studies have not controlled for friendship characteristics in the
pre-baseline wave. Doing so allows researchers to ask a different
question – one particularly important in this era of translational
research: What health and well-being outcomes might we observe
within a relatively short time horizon (over 4 years) if friendships
change?

To begin addressing this question we used an outcome-wide
analytic approach (VanderWeele et al., 2020). This hypothesis-
generating, data-driven approach aims to discover estimates of the
outcomes we might expect to observe if friendship was intervened
upon. Promising findings can then undergo further investigation
in future studies. We leveraged a large, prospective and nation-
ally representative sample of U.S. older adults and tested if changes
in friendship were associated with better subsequent health and
well-being across 35 separate outcomes. These outcomes were
chosen because they are frequently included in seminal geron-
tological models that characterize the antecedents, processes and
outcomes that foster people’s ability to age well (Depp and Jeste,
2006; Rowe and Kahn, 1987; Ryff and Singer, 2009). To the best
of our knowledge, this is among the first studies to evaluate how
changes in friendship are associated with changes in health and
well-being.

Methods

Study population

We used data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS),
a nationally representative panel study of adults aged >50.
Beginning in 2006, HRS staff provided mail-in questionnaires to
study participants and began assessing psychosocial factors in a
randomly selected 50% of HRS participants. The remaining 50% of
HRS participants completed the questionnaire in the subsequent
wave (2008). Each sub-cohort alternates reporting so that each
participant reports psychosocial data every 4 years. In 2006, the
psychosocial questionnaire response rate was 88% and in 2008, it
was 84% (Smith et al., 2013). To increase sample size and power,
we combined data from both sub-cohorts.

Our study used data from three timepoints (t0, t1, t2). All
covariates (including prior levels of friendship) were assessed in the
pre-baseline wave (t0; 2006/2008). The exposure – friendship – was
assessed 4 years later in the baseline wave (t1; 2010/2012). All out-
comes were assessed another 4 years later in the outcome wave (t2;
2014/2016). We restricted the sample to those who completed the
psychosocial questionnaire at baseline because nearly half of our
study outcomes were assessed in the psychosocial questionnaire,
resulting in a final analytic sample size of 12,998 people.

The University of Michigan’s Institute of Social Research coor-
dinates the study and provides extensive documentation about
the protocol, instrumentation, sampling strategy and statistical
weighting procedures (Smith et al., 2013; Sonnega et al., 2014).
The HRS has been approved by several ethics committees, includ-
ing the University of Michigan IRB. Further, informed consent was
obtained from all HRS respondents.

Measures

Friendship
We leveraged all available friendship items in HRS and created a
composite ‘friendship score’ that assessed the following domains.
(1) Friendship Network Size: was assessed by asking respondents,
‘How many of your friends would you say you have a close rela-
tionship with?’ Respondents were asked to provide a numerical
answer in response. (2) Friendship Network Contact Frequency: was
assessed by asking respondents, ‘On average, how often do you do
each of the following?’ (a) ‘Meet up (include both arranged and
chance meetings)’, (b) ‘Speak on the phone’, (c) ‘Write or email’.
For each category, we reverse coded responses so that higher val-
ues represented more frequent contact (0 = ≤ Every Few Months,
1 = 1x-2x/Month, 2 = 1x-2x/Week, 3 = ≥ 3x/Week). (3) Friendship
Network Quality: was assessed by asking respondents to rate per-
ceived support and strain from their friends. On a 4-point Likert
scale, respondents rated the degree to which they endorsed three
support items (e.g. ‘How much can you rely on them if you have
a serious problem?’) and four strain items (e.g. ‘How often do
they make too many demands on you?’). Responses to all items
were averaged within each dimension to create a perceived sup-
port score, and a separate strain score. To standardize the measure,
we first rescored contra-indicative items and created z-scores for
each of the items. Then, we created a composite friendship score
by averaging the z-scores for each measure (higher scores indi-
cated stronger friendships). To evaluate potential threshold effects,
we categorized scores into quartiles based on the distribution of
friendship scores in the sample. In secondary analyses, we sep-
arately evaluated each facet of the friendship composite score in
relation to our health and well-being outcomes. The HRS guides
(and Supplementary Text 1) provide further details about each
assessment.

Covariates
All covariates were assessed in the pre-baseline wave (t0;
2006/2008) by self-report. Covariates included (1) demographics
(age, sex, race/ethnicity [White, Black, Hispanic, Other]), mar-
ital status (married/not married), (2) annual household income
(<$50,000, $50,000–$74,999, $75,000–$99,999, ≥$100,000), (3)
total wealth (quintiles of the score distribution in this sample),
(4) educational attainment (no degree, GED/high school diploma,
≥college degree), (5) employment (yes/no), (6) health insurance
(yes/no), (7) geographic region (Northeast, Midwest, South, West),
(8) religious service attendance (none, <1x/week, ≥1x/week), (9)
personality (openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeable-
ness, neuroticism) and (10) childhood abuse (yes/no). We also
adjusted for prior levels of friendship and all outcomes (listed
directly below) in the pre-baseline wave.

Outcomes
We considered 35 outcomes in the outcome wave (2014/2016
(t2)), including dimensions of physical health factors (all-cause

mortality, number of chronic conditions, diabetes, hypertension,
stroke, cancer, lung disease, arthritis, overweight/obesity, physi-
cal functioning limitations, cognitive impairment, chronic pain
and self-rated health), health behaviours (binge drinking, smok-
ing, physical activity and sleep problems), psychological well-being
(positive affect, life satisfaction, optimism, purpose in life, mas-
tery, health mastery and financial mastery), psychological distress
(depression, depressive symptoms, hopelessness, negative affect
and perceived constraints) and social factors (loneliness, living
with spouse/partner, frequency of contact with: children, other
family or friends – each assessed separately). The HRS guides (and
Supplementary Text 2) provide further details about each assess-
ment (Fisher et al., 2005; Jenkins et al., 2008; Smith et al., 2013;
Sonnega et al., 2014).

Statistical analysis

We used an outcome-wide analytic approach (VanderWeele et al.,
2020), which has several characteristics not widely used outside
of biostatistics and causal inference. Thus, we summarize those
characteristics here.

First, we control for covariates in the wave prior to the expo-
sure (t0), because, if we assess potential confounders in the same
timepoint as the exposure (t1), it remains unclear if they are con-
founders or mediators. If we accidentally control for mediators
in the same timepoint, we may spuriously attenuate a true effect.
A pragmatic approach to avoiding this problem is to adjust for
potential confounders in the pre-baseline wave (t0).

Second, to enhance our ability to strive towards “no unmea-
sured confounding,” and “exchangeability” (as well as other key
criteria described in “disjunctive cause criterion” for selection of
covariates which includes potential causes of either the exposure
or the outcomes or both), which in turn enhances our ability
to make causal inference, we adjust for a rich set of potential
confounder variables to make these assumptions as plausible as
possible (Greenland and Robins, 1986; VanderWeele et al., 2020).
Third, to reduce potential reverse causality, we also adjust for all

outcome variables in the pre-baseline wave (t0).

Fourth, to evaluate potential “change” in friendship, we adjust
for friendship in the pre-baseline wave (t0). This helps “hold con-
stant” pre-baseline levels of friendship (see Supplementary Text S3
for proof and further explanation). Adjusting for pre-baseline lev-
els of friendship (t0) also has several other advantages, including
reducing the risk of reverse causality by “removing” the accumu-
lating effects that friendship already had on outcomes in the past
(“prevalent exposure”) and allowing readers to instead focus on the
effects of change in friendship (“incident exposure”), over 4 years,
on outcomes.

We ran separate models for each outcome. We ran (1) logis-
tic regression models for binary outcomes with <10% prevalence;
(2) generalized linear models (with a log link and Poisson dis-
tribution) for binary outcomes with ≥10% prevalence or (3) lin-
ear regression models for continuous outcomes. We standardized
all continuous outcomes (mean = 0, standard deviation = 1)
so their effect size can be interpreted as a standard deviation
change in the outcome. In our tables, and for ease of reviewing
results, we present multiple p-value cutoffs (both with and with-
out Bonferroni correction for multiple testing) because different
investigators use different threshold standards for interpreting evi-
dence based on current norms in their specific discipline. In our
Results section, we comment on traditional 0.05 p-value threshold

(without Bonferroni correction). However, in all cases, we also
provide 95% confidence intervals which are considered prefer-
able assessments of uncertainty since all thresholds are ultimately
arbitrary.

Additional analyses
We ran several additional analyses. First, to evaluate the robustness
of our results to potential unmeasured confounding, we conducted
E-value analyses to assess the minimum strength of association (on
the risk ratio scale) that an unmeasured confounder must have with
both the exposure and the outcome to explain away the observed
association (VanderWeele and Ding, 2017). Second, to evaluate
how our findings might compare to past research, we re-analysed
all models using a more conventional set of covariates (e.g. sociode-
mographics, but no control for previous friendship scores or out-
comes, in the pre-baseline wave). This analytic approach asks a
different question: what are the potential long-term cumulative
effects that the whole history of friendship (approximated by its
current measure but not controlling for the past) has on outcomes?
Third, we re-analysed the main models but removed people who
had any history of a given physical condition at baseline. Fourth, we
separately evaluated each facet of the friendship composite score in
relation to our health and well-being outcomes.

Multiple imputation
We imputed all missing exposures, covariates and outcomes using
an imputation by chained equations approach and generated five
datasets because it provides a potentially more accurate approach
than other methods of handling missing data and helps address
problems that arise due to attrition (Harel et al., 2018). All analyses
were conducted in Stata 18.0.

Results

In the covariate wave (t0; 2006/2008), the average age of partici-
pants was 65 years old (SD = 10) and they were predominantly
women (59%), married (67%) and high school educated (55%).
Table 1 provides the distribution of covariates by categories of
friendship. As the composite friendship score increased from the
lowest quartile (Quartile 1) to the highest quartile (Quartile 4),
so did the scores of its subordinate elements in a dose–response
manner. For example, people in the highest versus lowest quartile
reported having more close friends (7.8 vs. 1.6), meeting friends
>1x/week more frequently (86.3% vs. 9.1%) and receiving more
social support from friends (3.6 vs. 2.3). Supplementary Table 1
describes change in friendship from the pre-baseline wave (t0) to
the baseline wave (t1).

Table 2 shows the associations between friendship and subse-
quent health and well-being outcomes over the 4-year follow-up
period. When considering physical health outcomes, friendship
was associated with 3 (out of 14) outcomes, including 24% reduced
risk of all-cause mortality (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.62,
0.95), 19% reduced risk of stroke (95% CI: 0.67, 0.97), and higher
self-rated health (𝛽 = 0.09, 95% CI: 0.04, 0.15). When considering
health behaviours, friendship was associated with 2 (out of 4) out-
comes including a 43% (95% CI: 1.03, 1.99) increased likelihood of
smoking and 9% increased likelihood of frequency physical activity
(95% CI: 1.00, 1.18).

Friendship was associated with all 7 (out of 7) psychological
well-being outcomes. The strongest associations were with higher:
positive affect (𝛽 = −0.22, 95% CI: 0.15, 0.28) and sense of mastery
(𝛽 = 0.20, 95% CI: 0.14, 0.27). Friendship was also associated with

all 5 (out of 5) psychological distress outcomes. The strongest asso-
ciations were with negative affect (𝛽 = −0.20, 95% CI: −0.26, −0.13)
and a 17% reduced risk of depression (95% CI: 0.68, 1.00). Finally,
friendship was associated with all 5 (out of 5) social factors. The
strongest associations were with 96% increased likelihood of con-
tacting friends ≥1x/week (95% CI: 1.77, 2.17) and 20% increased
likelihood of not living with a spouse/partner (95% CI: 1.09, 1.32).

Additional analyses

We conducted several additional analyses. First, E-value analy-
ses suggested that a few of the associations we observed were at
least moderately robust to unmeasured confounding (Table 3). For
example, an unmeasured confounder of both friendship and all-
cause mortality by risk ratios of 1.94, each, above and beyond the
large number of potential confounders already adjusted for, could
explain away the association. However, weaker joint confounder
associations could not. To shift the confidence interval to include
the null, an unmeasured confounder associated with both friend-
ship and all-cause mortality by risk ratios of 1.30 each could suffice,
but weaker joint confounder associations could not. Several other
associations were not especially robust to potential unmeasured
confounding. Second, conventionally adjusted covariate models
generally showed larger coefficients than fully-adjusted models
(Supplementary Table 2). These analytic differences might empha-
size the effect of short-term change in friendship vs. accumulating
effects over time or might reflect residual confounding in con-
ventional analyses. Third, when re-evaluating the fully-adjusted
models after removing anyone with a history of a given physical
condition at baseline (t1), the coefficients were generally larger (top
panel of Supplementary Table 2). When evaluating each dimen-
sion of the friendship composite score, frequency of meeting with
friends and negative social strain from friends appeared to have the
largest coefficients (Supplementary Tables 3–8).

Discussion

In a large, diverse, prospective and nationally representative sam-
ple of people aged >50, we observed that stronger friendships
were associated with some indicators of better: physical health
outcomes (i.e. reduced risk of: stroke and mortality) and health
behaviours (i.e. increased physical activity), as well as better out-
comes on psychological well-being (i.e. increased: positive affect,
life satisfaction, optimism, purpose in life, mastery, health mastery,
financial mastery), psychological distress (i.e. decreased: depres-
sion, depressive symptoms, hopelessness, negative affect, perceived
constraints) and social factors (e.g. better scores on: loneliness, liv-
ing with spouse, contact with other family and friends). Friendship
was not associated with other physical health outcomes and health
behaviours. It was also associated with increased likelihood of
smoking and heavy drinking (although the latter association did
not reach conventional levels of statistical significance).

Our results both align with and deviate from results from
past work that evaluated associations between the “prevalence”
of friendship and outcomes. For example, consistent with past
research we observed that “incident” friendship was associ-
ated with some better outcomes: psychological well-being (e.g.
increased: life satisfaction and lower depression) (Choi et al., 2020;
Fowler and Christakis, 2008; Santini et al., 2015), health behaviours
(e.g. increased: physical activity and heavy drinking) (Rosenquist
et al., 2010; Watt et al., 2014) and physical health (e.g. reduced
risk of mortality) (Shor and Roelfs, 2015). However, our results

aThis table was created based on non-imputed data.
bAll of these variables were used as covariates, and assessed in the wave prior (2006/2008) to the exposure wave (2010/2012).
cThe percentages in some sections may not add up to 100% due to rounding.

also diverge with results from past research. For example, we did
not observe associations with some physical health outcomes (e.g.
reduced risk of cognitive impairment, lower number of physi-
cal health conditions) (Chopik, 2017; Sharifian et al., 2020) that
past studies observed. However, when considering our results that
adjusted for conventional covariates, we observed associations that
align with this prior research.

Methodologically, the underlying reasons for diverging results
may stem from a range of sources including differences in: (1)
which covariates were controlled for, (2) control for prior friend-
ship scores, (3) study population (e.g. nationally representative vs.
non-generalizable samples, younger vs. older samples), (4) study
design (e.g. cross-sectional vs. longitudinal), (5) measurement of
the exposure (friendship has been measured in different ways), (6)
measurement of the outcome (e.g. specific outcome vs. compos-
ite measures) and (7) type of analyses employed (e.g. sociometric
analyses vs. covariate-controlled regression approach). When eval-
uating results from conventionally adjusted models, many associ-
ations observed in the friendship literature were also observed in
our results. This suggests that our analyses emphasize short-term
change in friendship vs. accumulating effects over longer durations
of time.

We also observed that friendship was associated with a few
adverse outcomes. For example, it was associated with a 43%
increased likelihood of smoking and 48% increased likelihood of
heavy drinking (this latter association did not reach conventional
levels of statistical significance but does align with results from
some prior research) (Rosenquist et al., 2010). Like other social
factors, friendship might act as an “amplification system” for both
beneficial and harmful health and well-being outcomes depending
on the social context by magnifying whatever they are seeded with
(e.g. attitudes, norms, behaviours). Thus, friendships can also have
a “dark side” and promote negative health and well-being outcomes
by (Christakis and Fowler, 2007; Villalonga-Olives and Kawachi,
2017): (1) excessively straining group members by “requiring”
them to provide support to others, (2) restricting freedom because
of excessive informal control, (3) excluding out-group members,
(4) “down-levelling” norms so that individuals trying to break free
from negative group norms are penalized and (5) facilitating the
“contagion” of unhealthy behaviours from negative role models. As
an illustration of friendship’s dualistic nature on health outcomes,

friends can be a source of emotional and social support for one
another, yet if the exchange of support occurs in social contexts
where there is smoking and/or excessive consumption of alcohol,
the impact of friendship on health and well-being outcomes may
be both positive and negative.

However, the majority of our results suggest that friendship
has a salubrious association with health and well-being outcomes.
Several hypothesized mechanisms illustrate how friendships might
promote health and well-being (Blieszner et al., 2019; Holt-
Lunstad, 2022; Hong et al., 2022; Kawachi et al., 2008; Villalonga-
Olives and Kawachi, 2017). Friendships might promote health by:
(1) increased diffusion of information about health (e.g. referrals
to high-quality healthcare practitioners); (2) social and psycho-
logical support (e.g. instrumental and emotional support in times
of distress); (3) maintenance of healthy norms through informal
social control (e.g. reinforcing norms that certain behaviours [e.g.
exercising] are desirable and the norm) and (4) providing compan-
ionship, fun and satisfaction through mutual interests and shared
activities.

Our study has several limitations, including potential self-
report and common method bias, as both friendship and nearly
all outcomes were self-reported. However, control for pre-baseline
outcomes and a wide range of potential confounders helps to mit-
igate these concerns. Confounding by unmeasured variables and
reverse causality are common concerns in observational research.
However, controlling for a large array of variables, including the
exposure in the pre-baseline wave, the prospective nature of our
data, and results from E-value analyses helps mitigate these con-
cerns. Our results could have been influenced (moderated) by
numerous other factors such as: marital status, age, sex, race/eth-
nicity, socioeconomic status, personality, baseline health and oth-
ers. Future work should formally evaluate these potential mod-
erators of the friendship and health/well-being association. Our
study also featured several strengths, including the use of a large,
diverse, prospective and nationally representative sample of older
adults. Further, we attained stronger evidence of causality for our
question of interest because we adjusted for pre-baseline values of
the exposure and outcomes, as well as a robust range of covariates
(VanderWeele et al., 2020).

Policymakers, scientists and the public alike are recognizing
the importance of social relationships for health and well-being

bThe analytic sample was restricted to those who had participated in the baseline wave (t1; 2010 or 2012). Multiple imputation was performed to impute missing data on the exposure,
covariates and outcomes. All models controlled for sociodemographic characteristics (age, sex, race/ethnicity, marital status, annual household income, total wealth, level of education,
employment status, health insurance, geographic region), pre-baseline childhood abuse, pre-baseline religious service attendance, pre-baseline values of the outcome variables (diabetes,
hypertension, stroke, cancer, heart disease, lung disease, arthritis, overweight/obesity, physical functioning limitations, cognitive impairment, chronic pain, self-rated health, binge drinking,
current smoking status, physical activity, sleep problems, positive affect, life satisfaction, optimism, purpose in life, mastery, health mastery, financial mastery, depressive symptoms,
hopelessness, negative affect, perceived constraints, loneliness, living with spouse/partner, contact children <1x/week, contact other family <1x/week, contact friends <1x/week),
personality factors (openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, neuroticism) and the pre-baseline value of the exposure. These variables were controlled for in the pre-
baseline was (in t0; 2006 or 2008).
cWe used an outcome-wide analytic approach and ran a separate model for each outcome. We ran a different type of model depending on the nature of the outcome: (1) for each binary
outcome with a prevalence of ≥10%, we used a generalized linear model (with a log link and Poisson distribution) to estimate a RR; (2) for each binary outcome with a prevalence of
<10%, we used a logistic regression model to estimate an OR; and (3) for each continuous outcome, we used a linear regression model to estimate a 𝛽.
dAll continuous outcomes were standardized (mean = 0; standard deviation = 1), and 𝛽 was the standardized effect size.
*p < 0.05 before Bonferroni correction; **p < 0.01 before Bonferroni correction; ***p < 0.05 after Bonferroni correction (the p-value cutoff for Bonferroni correction is p = 0.05/35
outcomes = p < 0.001).

aSee VanderWeele and Ding (2017) for the formula for calculating E-values.
bThe E-values for effect estimates are the minimum strength of association on the risk
ratio scale that an unmeasured confounder would need to have with both the exposure
and the outcome to fully explain away the observed association between the exposure and
outcome, conditional on the measured covariates.
cThe E-values for the limit of the 95% confidence interval (CI) closest to the null denote the
minimum strength of association on the risk ratio scale that an unmeasured confounder
would need to have with both the exposure and the outcome to shift the confidence interval
to include the null value, conditional on the measured covariates.

outcomes, and many countries have even begun creating national
policies to strengthen social bonds. Findings from our study sug-
gest that friendships are an important element to consider in these
efforts. Further, continuously iterating existing interventions that
target friendship (Aron et al., 1997; Blieszner et al., 2019; Bouwman
et al., 2017; Hoang et al., 2022; Hong et al., 2022), and creating new
interventions might be a promising method of enhancing several
aspects of health and well-being in our rapidly aging population.
