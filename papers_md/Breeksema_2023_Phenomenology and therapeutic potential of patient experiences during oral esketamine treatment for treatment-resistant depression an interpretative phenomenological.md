Abstract
Background  Ketamine and its enantiomers are widely researched and increasingly used to treat mental disorders, especially 
treatment-resistant depression. The phenomenology of ketamine-induced experiences and their relation to its psychothera-
peutic potential have not yet been systematically investigated.
Aims  To describe the phenomenology of patient experiences during oral esketamine treatment for treatment-resistant depres-
sion (TRD) and to explore the potential therapeutic relevance of these experiences.
Methods  In-depth interviews were conducted with 17 patients after a 6-week, twice-weekly ‘off label’ generic oral esketa-
mine (0.5–3.0mg/kg) treatment program. Interviews explored participants’ perspectives, expectations, and experiences 
with oral esketamine treatment. Audio interviews were transcribed and analyzed using an Interpretative Phenomenological 
Analysis (IPA) framework.
Results  The effects of ketamine were highly variable, and psychological distress was common in most patients. Key themes 
included (a) perceptual effects (auditory, visual, proprioceptive), (b) detachment (from body, self, emotions, and the world), 
(c) stillness and openness, (d) mystical-type effects (transcendence, relativeness, spirituality), and (e) fear and anxiety. Key 
themes related to post-session reports included (a) feeling hungover and fatigued, and (b) lifting the blanket: neutralizing 
mood effects.
Conclusion  Patients reported several esketamine effects with psychotherapeutic potential, such as increased openness, detach-
ment, an interruption of negativity, and mystical-type experiences. These experiences deserve to be explored further to 
enhance treatment outcomes in patients with TRD. Given the frequency and severity of the perceived distress, we identify 
a need for additional support in all stages of esketamine treatment.

Introduction

Research into the antidepressant potential of ketamine has 
proliferated since the early 2000s. The potential therapeu-
tic role of this compound in psychiatry has been explored 
since the early 1970s (Khorramzadeh and Lotfy, 1973). 
Its psychoactive effects include visual and auditory per-
ceptual  changes,  altered  proprioception,  alterations  in 
consciousness, detachment from the world or self, and 
occasionally  ‘mystical’  experiences  (Mollaahmetoglu 
et al., 2021; Sumner et al., 2021; van Schalkwyk et al., 
2017). In mental health contexts, these effects have alter-
nately been labeled ‘dissociative’ (Corssen and Domino, 
1966; Domino et al., 1965), psychotomimetic (mimicking 
a psychotic state) (Krystal et al., 1994), or ‘psychedelic’ 
(Mashour, 2022).

Presently,  ketamine  and  its  enantiomers  (hereafter: 
‘ketamine’) are mainly administered as a regular pharma-
cological treatment without explicit psychological support 
or psychotherapy, and its psychoactive effects are often 
considered undesirable side effects (Grabski et al., 2020; 
Luckenbaugh  et  al., 2014;  Mathai  et  al., 2020).  Some 
therapists integrate ketamine administrations in a broader 
psychotherapeutic framework as ketamine-assisted psy-
chotherapy (KAP) (Drozdz et al., 2022; Joneborg et al., 
2022; Mathai et al., 2022a). However, approaches vary, 
no evidence-based treatments for KAP exist, and research 
on lived experiences and their relation to the therapeutic 
process is scarce.

Only a few recent qualitative studies have explored 
patients’ perspectives on ketamine treatment. Moreover, 
these studies have primarily involved intravenous race-
mic  ketamine  to  treat  (treatment-resistant)  depression 
and suicidality, with one article describing treatment of 
patients with alcohol use disorder. In these studies, the 
following themes were identified: treatment enablers and 
obstacles, patient attitudes, (non)-recovery narratives, 
perceived adverse effects, and the phenomenology of the 
acute effects of ketamine, including perceptual altera-
tions, emotional or mood changes, and cognitive effects 
(Griffiths et al., 2021; Jilka et al., 2021; Lapidos et al., 
2023; Lascelles et al., 2019, 2021; Mollaahmetoglu et al., 
2021; Sumner et al., 2021; van Schalkwyk et al., 2017). 
In  2019,  an  esketamine  nasal  spray  was  registered  for 
treatment  of  treatment-resistant  depression  (TRD).  In 
the European Union, esketamine has been registered as a 
generic anesthetic drug since 1997.

Like intravenous infusions, intranasal administration 
is presently only allowed to be administered under pro-
fessional supervision in a psychiatric hospital and comes 
with significant financial costs, limiting accessibility. Oral 
administration of generic esketamine is less costly, less

invasive for patients than most routes of administration, 
and in principle suitable for at-home treatment. To our no 
knowledge, no qualitative studies have explored patient 
experiences with orally administered esketamine. Patients’ 
experiences  can  inform  us  about  helpful,  less  helpful, 
or negative treatment aspects, and can provide insights 
into potentially relevant psychological processes, which 
may help optimize treatment approaches for vulnerable 
patients. To investigate patients’ perspectives and experi-
ences, we conducted a phenomenological study using in-
depth qualitative interviews in patients with severe TRD 
receiving off-label treatment with a generic oral esketa-
mine solution.

This study is part of a larger qualitative study aimed at 
studying all aspects of oral esketamine treatment in TRD 
patients, including phenomenological and non-pharmaco-
logical aspects. In an earlier publication on the same sam-
ple, we explored non-pharmacological facets, including the 
impact of set and setting on session experience, describing 
patients’ (in) ability to let go of control (Breeksema et al., 
2022a). The primary aim of the current study is to describe 
the phenomenology of patient experiences during oral esket-
amine administration. Our secondary aim is to explore the 
potential therapeutic relevance of these experiences.

Methods

Design

This qualitative study is based on individual, in-depth inter-
views, conducted within an Interpretative Phenomenological 
Analysis (IPA) framework (Pietkiewicz and Smith, 2014; 
Smith, 2004; Smith and Osborn, 2007) in order to explore 
the experiences and perspectives of patients undergoing oral 
esketamine treatment for TRD. IPA is directed at the under-
standing of complex subjective phenomena by examining a 
subjects’ lived experience of a phenomenon in detail (Finlay, 
2014; Miller and Barrio Minton, 2016). IPA emphasizes idi-
ography, i.e., fully exploring individual stories before exam-
ining how these experiences converge and diverge within the 
target group. For a more extensive description of method and 
analysis, we refer to Breeksema et al. (2022b).

Treatment setting and participants

All participants in this qualitative study were patients with 
TRD receiving individually titrated off-label generic oral 
esketamine injection fluid mixed in a liquid formulation. 
Doses started at 0.5 mg/kg and were titrated up in 0.5mg/kg 
steps to a maximum of 3.0 mg/kg based on tolerability and 
antidepressant effects. The 6-week, twice-weekly treatment

was provided at two specialized depression clinics in the 
Netherlands.  Patients  were  severely  treatment  resistant, 
with a mean number of 9.3 failed antidepressant interven-
tions; 60% had also had electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) 
with insufficient response (see Table 1 for full demographic 
information). Mean duration of their current depressive epi-
sode was 55 months. Patients did not receive any prepara-
tory and/or integrative psychotherapy related to the use of 
esketamine.

Purposive  sampling  was  used  to  recruit  partici-
pants;  we  invited  seventeen  individuals  (11  women 
and 6 men), all of whom accepted, participated in an 
interview, and provided written informed consent to 
audio  record  interviews  and  publish  data,  ensuring 
confidentiality  and  anonymity.  The  treatment  proto-
col (M17.217644) and the qualitative research proto-
col  (M20.256068)  were  submitted  separately  to  the 
Medical Ethics Review Board of the University Medi-
cal  Center  Groningen  (METc  UMCG).  The  METc 
exempted both protocols from review, concluding that 
these do not constitute clinical research with human 
subjects as meant under the Dutch Medical Research 
involving Human Subjects Act (WMO) 1999, and that 
approval  was  therefore  not  needed.  Off  label  treat-
ment was approved for TRD and started in 2014 in our 
center. It should be noted that esketamine had already 
been a registered anesthetic medication in the Nether-
lands since 1997 (in contrast to, for example, the USA 
where esketamine is not registered for anesthesiology). 
Participants  were  informed  that  study  participation 
was voluntary and would not affect their treatment. No 
compensation was offered.

Data collection

A total of 17 in-depth interviews (14 by JJB, three by BK) 
were conducted. In order to capture the potential variabil-
ity of effects over the 6-week treatment course, as well 
as  explore  patients’  experiences  with  and  perspectives 
on the treatment as a whole, most interviews were con-
ducted shortly after the initial 6-week treatment, i.e., after 
12 esketamine sessions. Additionally, we included several 
participants who also had several months experience of 
at-home esketamine use. Interviewers were not involved in 
the treatment and had no prior contact with participants. 
Interviews followed a semi-structured interview guide, 
designed to inquire about participants’ experiences with 
esketamine sessions, and the treatment as a whole. The 
interview  guide  included  open-ended  questions  about 
‘acute’ experiences during the ketamine sessions (‘can you 
describe what happened during the ketamine sessions?’) 
and their experiences after the effects had worn off (‘how 
did you notice any impact of the treatment?’), intended 

to explore the phenomenology of treatment sessions, and 
attributions of meaning. For the full interview guide, see 
Breeksema, Niemeijer, et al. (2022a). Interviews lasted 
82min on average. Most interviews took place online due 
to covid restrictions; three were conducted in-person. Data 
saturation, i.e., when it was felt that interviews yielded no 
new insights, was used to decide when to stop including 
new participants. Due to the phenomenological nature of 
the study, our focus is on the extent of variation and how 
exemplary lived experiences were, rather than numerical or 
statistical frequency (Corbin and Strauss, 2008), emphasiz-
ing theoretical generalization from statistical significance 
(Niemeijer, 2015).

Data analysis

Transcribed interviews were analyzed with the support of 
qualitative data analysis software MAXQDA. We followed 
IPA  (Pietkiewicz  and  Smith, 2014;  Smith  and  Osborn, 
2007, 2008) during the iterative analysis process, which 
draws from phenomenological, heuristic, and idiographic 
backgrounds,  and  concerns  both  the  description  and 
the interpretation of participants’ experiences. First, all 
transcripts  were  read  and  then  analyzed  individually. 
Comments were added, which were refined into themes of 
a higher (psychological) abstraction. These themes were 
re-examined, tentative patterns among themes identified, 
which were clustered based upon conceptual similarity and 
differentiation, resulting in a list of major themes and sub-
themes. All authors read parts of transcripts; observations, 
themes,  interpretations,  and  reflections  were  discussed 
between authors until consensus emerged. After individual 
case  analyses,  a  within-group  analysis  was  conducted, 
grouping themes based on conceptual similarities between 
individual participants, identifying both convergent and 
divergent  topics  (where  patient  experiences  differed) 
[20].  Emerging  themes  were  identified  and  tentatively 
organized.  These  themes  were  then  categorized  under 
higher-level categories, which were discussed with different 
authors. This way, all transcripts were discussed within the 
multidisciplinary research team until consensus emerged, 
to triangulate the data and ensure validity. The standards for 
reporting qualitative research (SRQR) and the consolidated 
criteria  for  reporting  qualitative  research  checklists 
(COREQ) were followed to ensure maximal methodological 
rigor (O’Brien et al., 2014; Tong et al., 2007).

“The music changes, it’s so weird, going from fast to very slow, slow songs become 

even slower. Everything changes, becoming at once very loud or very soft.” 
(P15)

“It feels like [a trip]. Like my mind is detached from my body. It goes in all direc-
tions, so to say (…) a rollercoaster of colors, light, sounds, thoughts.” (P11)
“I started feeling a vibration in my body, slowly and as it was getting worse it 

was as if I could hear it. A kind of humming or like [the buzzing sound of] your 
phone vibrating.” (P7)

“Suddenly, all at once, I enter this experience, I am taken along (…) I no longer 
have my body (…) I have no idea that I still have a body, so to speak, then it 
really only is my mind.” (P4)

“You don't know where you are. Are you just a little cell, or are you a particle, 

or…? Something, but not something with two hands, two legs and a head and a 
torso. (…) My self is just gone. These were really experiences outside myself.” 
(P5)

“When I’m deep in my depression (…) it feels as if my heart is literally breaking it 
hurts so much. (…) During the ketamine, my head is empty, but that deep feeling 
of depression that is not so much in my head, but in my body, is also gone. So 
that gives a lot of relief.” (P17)

“You actually end up in a sort of different reality (…) [It is] a kind of waking up. 
[In the sense] that our daily life is a kind of dream state, a sort of program, an 
automatic thing (…) ketamine makes you aware of.” (P7)

“The story of [me] as a patient lying here (…) completely disappeared. (…) Just 
a total openness (…) a kind of primal feeling which I cannot quite describe, a 
clear feeling of ‘this is it!’ This unity, where for a moment [my story] diminishes. 
Not as a thought, more as a kind of realization. And in a pleasant way.” (P2)
“When I am carried along and upwards towards the light [it is all] just peaceful, 
light, and it just feels just nice, and then I feel myself [floating] like a feather all 
the way up.” (P4)

Mystical-type effects

Transcendence of time and space “I'm just really completely gone. (…) I don't perceive the outside world either. I'm 
not able to move. (…) I'm not here, on earth, anymore. I'm floating somewhere in 
that infinite world that doesn't end.” (P10)

“You step outside of your particular little personhood; you get a kind of broader 
perspective (…) The sense of unity was very strong there (…) so the person you 
are necessarily does lose a bit of its importance.” (P8)

“It's like the golden ratio, which recurs a lot in nature, in shells and so on, which 
comes back to perfection, which I actually experienced, the perfection of every-
thing, a kind of unity.” (P7)

“Suddenly, I heard - I can't say I heard a voice, but a phrase came into my head: 
dissolved in the All. (…) and an enormous sense of peace came over me.” (P17)

“Sometimes I knew that the things I saw or heard were not really there. For 

example, I once thought that a blanket was a monster, or that I heard a scream 
outside. And although I was still able to think they were not real, it does feel real, 
and it did make me afraid ... and it’s hard work to stay with it.” (P3)

“It's a very heavy feeling, like if you've been running or exercising or really 

exerted yourself physically (…) Then everything is heavy, I can’t manage any-
more, I need to take a rest for a while I need to come to myself (….) This lasts at 
least until the afternoon and the next day, it's usually over, although occasionally 
you still feel like that…” (P14)

“A side-effect that I could have on the evening of the session day. And often the 
day after as well (…) Feeling like crap. Hungover and just not feeling like any-
thing. Not wanting to eat either. Wobbly and nauseous, dizzy, headache. Things 
like that.” (P3)

“[When I started] I was really at the bottom of the depression, and that has 

gradually gotten better. And it’s now, say, between a 3 and a 6 [out of 10], and 
anyway, that's really different than being at 1 or 2. (…) But of course, it would 
be nice if that could go up a bit more, and that it would become a bit more 
stable.” (P17)

flying,  or  being  on  a  rollercoaster.  This  experience  was 
pleasant for some, but negative for others, who felt as if 
they were drowning or suffocating.

“[It felt like] lying on a huge air mattress, which was 
deflated at certain places, so that I was sucked into one of 
those holes, that went empty while I was lying there.” (P7)

Detachment

With increased intensity, these perceptual effects became 
more dissociative-like and detached: participants felt their 
body sink away, feeling as if their body (parts) no longer 
belonged to them, limbs seemingly becoming very large, 
small, or out of proportion. Some participants described 
becoming even more detached from their bodies, sometimes 
entirely until they were ‘only mind’.

“It was like floating out of your body, going up and out-
side of my body, floating around freely without space and 
time. Lovely.” (P16)

Particularly  at  higher  dosages,  several  respondents 
described being drawn or sucked into a different reality, 
realm, or dimension.

“You just get sucked into one point. And there's no escap-
ing that. (…) You have no body, you're not a person. You are 
something else at that moment. (…) It’s strange. You don't 
know where you are. Are you just a cell, or are you a parti-
cle? A part of something? (…) My [self] is just gone. These 
were really experiences outside of myself.” (P5)

Several respondents also described becoming detached 
from entrenched negative emotions or experiencing few(er) 
emotions during the esketamine sessions. Experiences could 
still be pleasant or unpleasant, but for most respondents, 
specific emotions did not appear to play a large role.

“It is a physical experience, and indeed thoughts pass by, 
and the feeling that my mind is separate from my body and 
that it’s my mind experiencing it (…) but I have no emotions, 
not that I become happy or sad. It is really purely (…) physi-
cal and mental.” (P11)

Tranquility and openness

Several participants noticed a detachment or interruption 
of their negativity, hopelessness, and despair. This transient 
absence of incessant negative thoughts was associated with 

Fig. 1   Overlapping phenomena described by patients during the acute 
phase of oral esketamine sessions

Acute (during session) experiences

Perceptual effects

Esketamine induced visual, auditory, and proprioceptive 
effects. A few participants described visual effects, includ-
ing colorful spirals, geometrical patterns, or visual images 
reminiscent of science fiction movies. Several participants 
reported that environmental noises sounded as if they were 
sped up, slowed down, or intensified. Others described spe-
cific auditory effects: buzzing, crackling, whooshing, bub-
bling, or humming sounds.

“A  ticking  heater  (…)  someone  outside  mowing  the 
lawn… that hum becomes gigantic, really overwhelms eve-
rything.” (P11)

The most pronounced and immersive perceptual effects 
were alterations in proprioception, or how participants expe-
rienced their own body. In the early phase of sessions, the 
experience was likened to a sensation of floating, falling, 

1 3 
Psychopharmacology (2023) 240:1547–1560 

1553

an enlarged space and openness to other thoughts, ideas, and 
emotions. This emptiness or spaciousness was frightening 
to some, but many found this a positive sensation, using 
words like open, light, spacious, stillness, calm, relaxation, 
or peace to describe the experience.

“My head became completely empty and completely calm, 
like a sort of numbness, a feeling like almost like floating 
(…) It felt very relaxing. (…) I know very well where I am, it 
was more of a pleasant not-being. Just away from the world, 
almost, but not frightening.” (P17)

The temporary cessation of negative or suicidal thoughts 
also enabled some participants to distance themselves better 
from entrenched dark thoughts and ruminations.

“The head is empty, and it's just so special after five years 
of being inside your head where it's all very nasty. That 
suddenly those thoughts and feelings disappear. It's very 
bizarre. But very pleasant. And of course, they do return, 
but during the buzz they were gone.” (P17)

Paradoxically, as participants described becoming more 
detached from negative emotions, they also described having 
more room for emotions, both positive (joy, pleasure) and 
negative (sadness, grief). As they became more in touch with 
their own feelings and needs, some participants felt less self-
critical or were able to put their own needs first.

“I also notice that, because I get less depressed, the sad-
ness comes more to the surface. And because of that I think 
I am also more receptive to therapy now.” (P1)

This increased openness facilitated both connections to 
respondents’ emotions and their ability to connect to oth-
ers; several respondents felt as if they had more space to be 
interested in family, friends, and loved ones, to reach out to 
them, and to make different choices based on the importance 
of interpersonal connections.

“I do notice that I am a little more in touch with myself. 
I write and make poetry [again] (…) Also in contact with 
others, in order to let them know how I’m doing. (…) I notice 
that I [still] ignore or avoid things, but now I manage a little 
better to reach out and communicate that to others.” (P3)

For some, having a positive experience or being lifted out 
of their depressive state for a few moments was intrinsically 
valuable.

“It was very beautiful to have felt, to have experienced 
this. (…) I can still recall that feeling, even though it has 
been a few months (…) It doesn't have the same impact now, 
in terms of ridding me of those heavy thoughts and feelings, 
but I do try to hold on to that experience and keep it with 
me. (…) Of course, they do that it’s not about the buzz, but 
oftentimes that buzz is quite nice (laughs).” (P17)

Some considered experiencing an altered state valuable 
in itself: realizing that unpleasant esketamine experiences 
passed away helped them recognize the transient nature of 

difficult experiences in daily life too. For others, the bizarre-
ness of their experiences made them aware that these—like 
negative thoughts—are all created in their head, and that 
these experiences dissipate too.

“It did teach me that you are everything (…) everything I 
think is inside my head. I experience all kinds of things [dur-
ing the esketamine session]. Nothing happens to my body but 
in my head, I go through such bizarre journeys (…) And my 
head, that's me, that's everything. If I think in my head that 
I'm super, then I'm good. And if I think that I'm nothing, um 
then it is all nothing.” (P4)

Mystical‑type experiences

Several respondents described having experiences which 
took place in an infinite space, or outside of space and time. 
Experiences of ego dissolution, or disappearance of their 
sense of self, were closely related to unitive experiences, 
described as becoming part of something greater (the uni-
verse, the cosmos).

“I can't describe it very well but (…) you realize what 
you are: I am the universe, or: I am Being. You step outside 
of your own specific little personhood; you get a kind of 
broader perspective on what you are, on what others are. 
This feeling of unity was very strong. So the person that you 
are necessarily loses its importance a bit.” (P8)

The broader, cosmic perspective of being a tiny part of 
something larger than themselves also communicated a sense 
of relativeness or insignificance for some. Some respondents 
shared that the experience of relativeness contrasted strongly 
with the experience of being depressed and helped put their 
own problems into perspective.

“Depression is (…) a kind of being trapped, (…) it's some-
thing very narrow. And that sense of unity is just something very 
wide, that opens you up, outwards, so [it’s] actually the oppo-
site of depression, which is very much inward oriented.” (P8)
Irrespective of their religious orientation, several partici-
pants described having religious-like experiences. The fol-
lowing participant, who did not consider herself a religious 
person, had an experience she described as spiritual:

“Suddenly, a phrase came into my head: ‘Absorbed into 
the All’. (…) I never speak in words about “The All”, I don't 
even know exactly how to imagine this. But a tremendous 
peace came over me.” (P17)

Another respondent, an active protestant, described one 

of her experiences as heavenly.

“I never had such a concrete conception of heaven before, 
it was always something abstract. (…) I encountered billions 
of souls, floating around freely, not as human beings but as 
spirits, kind of like birds that all flew past each other (…) It 
really gave me a serene peace.” (P16)

Fear and anxiety

Participants’ lived experiences were highly variable in terms 
of valence as well: respondents described positive experi-
ences, but the majority (also) had experiences that were 
frightening, stressful or anxious.

“Sometimes I have a bit of a horror experience: I can't get 
out and I don't know how long it will last because time just 
doesn't exist. (…) At first I think: shit, did I take too much? 
And then it goes wrong, because it all goes so fast and at 
a certain point, I can't think anymore. Then I’m just in that 
darkness and I can't leave, and think: shit, this wasn't sup-
posed to happen (…). It takes forever. It is such an unpleas-
ant experience.” (P4)

For some participants during the esketamine sessions 
their negative thoughts, ruminations, and suicidal thoughts 
were intensified instead of disrupted; these negative emo-
tions often stayed with them after the acute effects had worn 
off.

“[During the ketamine sessions] I tended to get inside 
myself even more [mimicking fetal position], like 'I'm not 
there, I don't want to be there and I'm not there'. Like if you 
occupy less space, you also exist less.” (P3)

Some frightening experiences were characterized by chaos, 
disorientation, feeling as if they had lost all contact with real-
ity, as if they had lost their mind, were dying, or feared that 
they would never again return to sanity or to their body.

“All of a sudden, my mind is in all kinds of other dimen-
sions (…) I can't find my body, it doesn't exist anymore, 
neither does my husband or other people. (…) I feel like a 
hamster in one of those wheels, and I run and run and run 
but nothing happens. I am stuck, I can't get out anymore, 
nothing else exists but me, alone in these dimensions. (…) 
I think I'm dead, because I can't return to my body, time is 
endless, time doesn't exist.” (P4)

ketamine, I'm just lying on a bed, this is a side effect’. I was 
totally lost in infinity.” (P10)

Post‑session experiences

Feeling hungover and fatigued

Many participants described having unpleasant physical 
side-effects immediately after the esketamine session ended, 
summarized as ‘hungover’: nausea, dizziness, headaches, 
muscle aches, blurry vision, occasionally vomiting, and a 
generally feeling of lousiness. These effects generally wore 
off on the same day.

“I was very tired, probably because of the enormous ten-
sion and my resistance to it. I also had enormous muscle 
pain (…) just a stiff body. I was a bit creaky the day after 
and the whole afternoon afterwards I just wasn't worth a 
damn. (…) When I had thrown up, the day after would also 
be completely ruined. (…) A sore belly and a terribly wrinkly 
feeling, so the day after was actually gone.” (P6)

Fatigue and feeling exhausted immediately afterwards 
were also commonly reported. This tiredness sometimes 
lasted a couple of hours, sometimes the rest of the session 
day, and occasionally on the following day as well. Various 
participants described going to bed or needing sleep shortly 
after the session to recuperate. Others noted impaired sleep 
quality, either because they were unable to sleep (well) or 
because they had more vivid dreams or nightmares.

“When I managed to let go, the trips were okay, only the 
dreams that followed are annoying. But yeah, I’m not there for 
sweaty feet, these are thoughts related to my depression. So 
those come to the foreground more. Especially [this trauma] 
that seems to bother me greatly. (…) [It makes me] want to stay 
awake because I know I'm about to get [nightmares].” (P1)

Variability

Lifting the blanket: mood effects

The intensity and content of participant experiences var-
ied substantially: for many participants, higher doses led to 
more intense and occasionally extraordinary experiences, 
whereas others had (unexpectedly) intense effects with lower 
doses. For some respondents, every session had roughly the 
same content and intensity; experiences for others varied 
substantially between sessions in both intensity and content. 
Participants found it difficult to describe their experiences; 
because they had never experienced anything like it; because 
the experience was indescribable, paradoxical, or contradic-
tory; or because memories of the experience tended to fade 
quickly after the effects wore off.

“It was something I had never experienced before. (…) 
I find it very difficult to describe, but I was completely out 
of this world, (…) I could no longer just think ‘oh this is the 

Effects on participants’ mood in the hours and days after 
sessions varied substantially too. Some had no percepti-
ble effect on their mood, whereas others noticed distinct 
improvements. Yet others stated that esketamine provided 
a baseline mood stability or neutrality.

“Ketamine ensures a kind of basic feeling level of, how to 
call it, a kind of neutral feeling of well-being. So not gloomy 
nor overly cheerful but just a good starting point, so to say. I 
have the idea that I now function more like a normal person 
than without the ketamine.” (P16)

Participants used different metaphors to express their 
experience of being depressed: heaviness, darkness, hope-
lessness, bleakness, psychic pain, a diminishing world, or 
being submersed in a swamp. For some, this ‘heavy blanket’ 
or ‘grey veil’ had mostly disappeared.

1 3 
Psychopharmacology (2023) 240:1547–1560

“[I used to wake up] covered by this blanket. Nausea, a 
tight throat, and no lust for life. Really thinking (soft voice) 
‘screw it all’. And then it would lift again, but now [after the 
esketamine] it's just not there.” (P1)

This mood lifting or stabilizing effect was mostly tempo-

rary, lasting one to sometimes three or four days.

“I feel like I'm lying under a very heavy blanket, and 
because of the ketamine (…) a corner is lifted and I can 
look at the light. So, then my mood does improve a little, 
and that usually lasts about a day and a half, and then it 
subsides.” (P10)

When respondents noticed improvement, they often men-
tioned appreciating sensory input again, noticing a reviving 
of dulled senses, such as tasting, smelling, and enjoying food 
again, seeing sharper and in color instead of in grey, and 
feeling emotions and feelings return.

“Actually [when I was severely depressed] I felt little (…) 
It was just dead, I had no feeling. (…) When I say this now, I 
feel very guilty about it. But if my daughter or husband had 
died, I don't even think I would have felt the sadness. (…) 
When I looked at my daughter, I didn't feel that I loved her. 
But when I look at her now, I think gee I love her so very 
much. And I feel it too.” (P4)

Some  participants  mentioned  hypersensitivity  and 
increased irritability; possibly related to feeling more open 
and vulnerable, after having had the depressive veil lifted.

“On some days, I just notice sensitivity to small sounds 
(…). There are also days that, having recovered after two 
hours, then I can just function normally. [But on bad days] 
the world is more overwhelming; I am more sensitive to 
stimuli. Like in a supermarket I can more easily become a 
bit panicky, overwhelmed.” (P11)

The broadened perspective enabled several respondents to 
make different life choices, such as eating healthier, drink-
ing less alcohol, and exercising more; others (re)gained a 
perspective about their life and future. Participants also 
described recapturing a sense of enjoyment, and having 
more space and energy to undertake activities, practice art 
or sports, having more creativity, picking up hobbies, and 
initiating contacts with friends again.

“My head used to be constantly giving negative impulses 
(…) coming up with a thousand scenarios in my head why 
things would go wrong or whatever. Yeah, and that's just 
gone. And if it is there for a moment I can stop it, and then 
it actually stops. That is wonderful. (…) I can read a book 
now and I can listen to my wife better. You know, there is 
room again to ask someone how they are doing. (…) There 
was just no room for that. [Now I have] a desire to do things 
again that wasn't there before. (…) Now things have a pur-
pose: to be happy. (…) I can't really remember ever feeling 
this way. It has always been survival and now it's not.” (P15)

Discussion

This is the first qualitative study examining the phenom-
enology of the (sub)acute drug effects of oral esketamine in 
patients with severe, treatment-resistant depression, extend-
ing earlier findings on the role of ‘set and setting’ (Breek-
sema, Niemeijer, et al., 2022b). Esketamine induced sub-
jective effects that varied significantly in intensity, content, 
valence, and on mood, both between and within subjects.

A recent qualitative study on patients with alcohol use 
disorder who received 0.8mg/kg racemic IV ketamine with 
psychological support described remarkably similar experi-
ences (Grabski et al., 2022; Mollaahmetoglu et al., 2021). 
Despite discrepancies in enantiomers, route of administra-
tion, bioavailability, dosage, degree of psychological sup-
port, and patient populations, these similarities demonstrate 
ostensibly characteristic psychoactive features of ketamine: 
perceptual changes (auditory, visual, and proprioceptive); 
detachment (from body, emotion, mind, self, and the world); 
and mystical or transcendental experiences. In our study, the 
themes of openness, stillness, and spaciousness fit all three 
categories and were associated with transient cessation of 
negative thoughts and feelings (see Fig. 1).

In  this  article  we  used  ‘detachment’  to  describe  spe-
cific facets of the phenomenology of the ketamine expe-
rience, rather than the commonly used ‘dissociation’. We 
argue that the construct is both too broad and narrow to 
describe ketamine’s effects. Existing scales (such as the 
Clinician-Administered Dissociative States Scale; CADSS) 
to measure dissociation were developed to measure disso-
ciative aspects of post-traumatic stress disorder (Bremner 
et al., 1998). Dissociation is prevalent in a range of men-
tal disorders (Lyssenko et al., 2018), and this close relation 
to psychopathology means that associations with this term 
are mainly negative. Further, these only partially describe 
the phenomenology of ketamine and show no consistent 
relationships  nor  offer  a  therapeutic  rationale  related  to 
antidepressant response (Chen et al., 2022; Grabski et al., 
2020; Luckenbaugh et al., 2014; Mathai et al., 2020; Sos 
et al., 2013). A possible exception is the ’depersonaliza-
tion’ subscale (but not ‘derealization’ or ‘amnesia’) of the 
CADSS (Niciu et al., 2018). Interestingly, detachment, or 
disconnection, has been called a core element of depression 
(Karp, 1997; Osler, 2022), and there are other similarities 
in how depressive and ketamine states are described, such 
as diminished affect; emptiness or void; and decreased self-
importance (Kendler, 2016). Importantly, the valence and 
meaning attributed to these states differed significantly. The 
feelings of worthlessness, despair, hopelessness, or numb-
ness that often permeated the lives of depressed patients was 
temporarily interrupted during esketamine sessions, which 

1 31556

Psychopharmacology (2023) 240:1547–1560

created an openness that enabled them to consider other 
perspectives and outlooks. Future studies should refine and 
operationalize detachment (e.g., to oneself, body, negative 
emotions and thoughts, external surroundings) in the context 
of antidepressant response, and how this disconnection may 
relate to increased connectedness.

Using a spatial metaphor: whereas patients’ minds occu-
pied a small gloom-filled space during their depression, the 
temporary expansion of this mind space made everything 
(including thoughts, anxieties, concerns etc.) appear smaller 
in comparison. Such a shift in perspective was frightening 
to some, but (also) helpful in contextualizing their perceived 
problems and realizing their relative insignificance and tran-
sience. This mind-expansion also made it easier for patients 
to connect to their own feelings, to others, and the outside 
world: the antithesis of disconnection and isolation. Multi-
ple participants in our study described the intrinsic value of 
temporarily being lifted out of their depressive state, echoing 
reports from other qualitative studies (Griffiths et al., 2021; 
Lascelles et al., 2019; Mollaahmetoglu et al., 2021; Sumner 
et al., 2021; van Schalkwyk et al., 2017). Some critics con-
tend that this temporary ‘high’ should not be confused with 
an antidepressant effect (Horowitz and Moncrieff, 2021). 
However, this acute, positively experienced effect is thought 
to  play  a  central  role  in  both  psychedelic  and  ketamine 
assisted therapy modalities (Dore et al., 2019; Mathai et al., 
2022a). Further, in ketamine treatment acutely experienced 
anxiety correlates negatively with treatment outcomes (Aust 
et al., 2019), whereas acutely experienced happiness corre-
lates with longer-term positive outcomes (Chen et al., 2020), 
although anxiety did not appear to affect treatment retention 
(Bahji et al., 2022). In fact, the temporary interruption of 
incessant negative cognitions and feelings (also described 
elsewhere, see e.g. (Griffiths et al., 2021; Mollaahmetoglu 
et al., 2021)) makes ketamine suitable as a treatment for 
mood disorders, suicidal ideation and potentially for other 
mental disorders characterized by psychological rigidity 
(Servaas et al., 2021).

For some, this transient interruption created a window 
of  opportunity  associated  with  increased  openness  to 
engage in psychotherapy. Ketamine has been combined 
with mindfulness-based interventions (see (Payne et al., 
2021) for further potential synergies) to treat substance 
use  disorders  (SUD)  and  PTSD  (Azhari  et  al.,  2021; 
Dakwar et al., 2019; Grabski et al., 2022; Pradhan et al., 
2017; Pradhan and Rossi, 2020; Stocker et al., 2022), as 
ketamine-assisted psychotherapy or ketamine psychedelic 
therapy (Dore et al., 2019; Krupitsky and Grinenko, 1997) 
or with adjunctive cognitive-behavioral therapy (Wilkin-
son et al., 2017,  2021), favored by some experts as the 
current  gold-standard  paradigms  (including  third-wave 

therapies such as dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) and 
acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT)) (Yaden et al., 
2022). Future studies should investigate whether combi-
nations with psychotherapies can extend the therapeutic 
benefit of esketamine, to explore the optimal timing of such 
interventions (Mathai et al., 2022a), and look at appropri-
ate modalities for TRD treatment.

Our respondents reported various elements of mysti-
cal-type experiences (ME) (MacLean et al., 2012); ME 
correlate positively with treatment benefits in different 
patient populations treated with serotonergic psychedelics 
(Johnson et al., 2019; Ko et al., 2022) and ketamine in 
SUD patients (Dakwar et al., 2014, 2018; Mollaahmetoglu 
et al., 2021; Rothberg et al., 2020; Sumner et al., 2021). 
Participants in our study also described these experiences 
as meaningful; future studies should systematically inves-
tigate to what degree ME mediate therapeutic outcomes in 
TRD treatment and explore appropriate therapeutic frame-
works. Existing psychometric instruments may be suitable 
(e.g., MEQ-30 (Barrett et al., 2015; MacLean et al., 2012), 
5D-ASC (Studerus et al., 2010), EDI (Nour et al., 2016), 
and WCS (Watts et al., 2022)), but a novel questionnaire 
that captures the unique profile of the acute effects of keta-
mine is needed.

Many participants reported moments of psychological 
distress.  Common  fears  were  related  to  experiences  of 
detachment, e.g., being afraid of dying, of going crazy, or 
never returning to their body or reality. Dissociative effects 
and associated anxiety (e.g. paranoia, grief, panic, nausea) 
experienced even by healthy volunteers have been described 
as early as 1965 (Domino et al., 1965) and continue to be 
described today (Griffiths et al., 2021; Lascelles et al., 2019; 
Mollaahmetoglu et al., 2021; Sumner et al., 2021). This 
firmly underlines the need for continued emotional and 
psychological support throughout all stages of ketamine 
treatment,  which  is  particularly  crucial  in  vulnerable 
patients.  Providing  treatments  that  induce  potentially 
destabilizing  experiences  without  providing  optimal 
preparation and continued support is both unethical and 
likely clinically inefficient, as transient fear and anxiety 
can exacerbate feelings of helplessness and pointlessness 
(Breeksema, Niemeijer, et al., 2022a). An important open 
question is whether these transient challenging experiences 
can be therapeutically beneficial, as has been suggested 
for classical psychedelics and entactogens (Barrett et al., 
2016; Breeksema, Kuin, et al., 2022b). At minimum, proper 
support for ketamine treatment should consider the role of 
education and preparation for the variable and unpredictable 
states induced by ketamine; expectancy and expectations 
management; instructing calming techniques; creation of 
trust and rapport with an empathetic, caring and present 

1 3

1557

staff; inclusion of trusted others throughout the process; 
and  a  treatment  setting  optimized  for  patient  comfort 
(Breeksema, Niemeijer, et al., 2022b; Carhart-Harris et al., 
2018; Eisner, 1997; Johnson et al., 2008). An important goal 
of intervention design should be to increase the likelihood 
of positively experienced sessions, to reduce occurrence and 
impact of anxious and fearful sessions, and ideally to also 
facilitate the safe emergence and integration of potentially 
salient  psychological  content  (Dakwar  et  al.,  2014). 
Anxiety can be mitigated by providing adequate education 
and  preparation,  psychological  and  emotional  support, 
the use of music, and interpersonal rapport (Breeksema, 
Niemeijer, et al., 2022a; Ceban et al., 2021; Krupitsky et al., 
2007); in case of extreme anxiety (low) doses of anxiolytic 
medication may alleviate patients’ distress (for an overview 
of potential interactions see (Veraart et al., 2021)).

Strengths and limitations

A major strength of this study is the use of phenomeno-
logical methods, which allowed us to explore patients’ lived 
experiences of orally administered esketamine in far greater 
detail than standardized approaches. Asking open-ended 
questions enabled us to explore experiences and topics not 
covered in standardized questionnaires, not only generating 
a better understanding of beneficial and negative facets of 
orally administered esketamine, but also yielding insights 
into the diversity of psychological experiences that poten-
tially mediate the therapeutic benefits of esketamine.

This study was conducted on oral esketamine for patients 
with severely treatment-resistant depression that may not be 
representative of large study populations; they are however 
probably representative of patients in real world settings 
seeking ketamine treatment. We also do not know whether 
other administrations and formulations induce similar effects, 
although comparison of our study with previous qualitative 
research does point in that direction. There is a potential risk 
of selection bias as we only interviewed patients who fin-
ished their initial 6-week treatment, although this was likely 
mitigated by the mix of positive and negative experiences 
reported by participants. The sample size could also raise 
questions about (external) validity although 17 respondents 
is a considerable sample size in phenomenological research.
Lastly, the therapeutic effects determined in our study 
were  not  assessed  systematically.  Lacking  a  therapeutic 
framework within which to understand and harness these 
effects, it remains to be seen whether these can indeed be 
used to optimize the therapeutic efficacy of esketamine. An 
important future step would be to explore whether the anti-
depressant response, psychological safety, and patient com-
fort can be enhanced by optimizing the treatment setting, and 
the degree of psychological support, and/or specific (psycho)
therapeutic approaches.

Conclusion

Oral esketamine induced a number of subjective effects 
that were highly variable in terms of intensity, content, 
valence, and impact on patients’ mood. Despite the regu-
lar pharmacological treatment context, in which patients 
merely received information about possible side effects and 
minimal preparation for the acute subjective effects, patients 
reported various effects that suggest a therapeutic poten-
tial for depression treatment, such as increased openness, 
detachment, interruption of negativity, and mystical-type 
experiences. Harnessing these distinctive properties of keta-
mine might provide an important opportunity to optimize 
or extend its antidepressant effects. Psychological distress 
was common in most patients, highlighting the need for 
ongoing emotional and psychological support in all stages 
of esketamine treatment and an optimized treatment setting.
