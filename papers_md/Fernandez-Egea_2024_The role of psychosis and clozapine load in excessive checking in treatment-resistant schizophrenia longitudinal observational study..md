Background

A significant proportion of people with clozapine-treated
schizophrenia develop ‘checking’ compulsions, a phenomenon
yet to be understood.

Aims

To use habit formation models developed in cognitive neuro-
science to investigate the dynamic interplay between psychosis,
clozapine dose and obsessive–compulsive symptoms (OCS).

Method

Using the anonymised electronic records of a cohort of cloza-
pine-treated patients, including longitudinal assessments of OCS
and psychosis, we performed longitudinal multi-level mediation
and multi-level moderation analyses to explore associations of
psychosis with obsessiveness and excessive checking. Classic
bivariate correlation tests were used to assess clozapine load
and checking compulsions. The influence of specific genetic
variants was tested in a subsample.

Results

A total of 196 clozapine-treated individuals and 459 face-to-face
assessments were included. We found significant OCS to be
common (37.9%), with checking being the most prevalent
symptom. In mediation models, psychosis severity mediated
checking behaviour indirectly by inducing obsessions (r = 0.07,

95% CI 0.04–0.09; P < 0.001). No direct effect of psychosis on
checking was identified (r = −0.28, 95% CI −0.09 to 0.03; P =
0.340). After psychosis remission (n = 65), checking compulsions
correlated with both clozapine plasma levels (r = 0.35; P = 0.004)
and dose (r = 0.38; P = 0.002). None of the glutamatergic and
serotonergic genetic variants were found to moderate the effect
of psychosis on obsession and compulsion (SLC6A4, SLC1A1 and
HTR2C) survived the multiple comparisons correction.

Conclusions

We elucidated different phases of the complex interplay of
psychosis and compulsions, which may inform clinicians’
therapeutic decisions.

A significant proportion of people with schizophrenia develop obses-
sive–compulsive symptoms (OCS). Some experience an obsessive–
compulsive disorder (OCD) after remission of psychosis, whereas
others enter an intermediate state combining psychosis and OCS.1
However, there is no clear understanding of this phenomenon.

Schizophrenia and OCS/OCD

OCS and OCD are common among those with schizophrenia, with
prevalence increasing from 12.5% in individuals in an at-risk mental
state for psychosis to 25% in early schizophrenia and up to 47% in
clozapine-treated patients.2 There is a plausible biological overlap
between schizophrenia with OCS and classic OCD. Both feature
over-activation of the orbitofrontal cortex3 and exhibit similar
traits of cognitive inflexibility, reduced processing speed and
memory deficits.4 Further,
individuals with schizophrenia with
OCS share a genetic background with OCD. Specifically, single
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and other genetic variants in
the glutamate pathway, such as SLC1A1 (glutamate transporter)
and GRIN2B (glutamate receptor), are associated with OCS in
people with clozapine-treated schizophrenia.5 However, associa-
tions with serotonergic (5-HT) pathways have not been explored,
despite the role of SLC6A4 (a serotonin transporter), HTR2A and
HTR2C (serotonin receptors) in OCD.6 Some authors advocate
for including schizo-obsessive disorder as a schizophrenia subtype
in which pre-existing OCS or OCD are unmasked after psychosis

remission.4 However, this hypothesis is undermined by work
showing a correlation between OCS and psychosis severity.5
Others argue that de novo OCS in schizophrenia are an anti-
psychotic-related event.1 Epidemiologically, de novo OCS are
over-represented in patients treated with clozapine, olanzapine or
risperidone when compared with patients prescribed aripiprazole,
amisulpride or haloperidol.6 This likely reflects these drugs’ differ-
ent 5-HT2A/2C receptor affinity. OCS are also associated with
higher clozapine dose and length of treatment and clozapine
plasma levels,7 suggesting a dose-dependent relationship. This is
challenged, however, in the literature, with some suggesting that
these findings are confounded by the higher antipsychotic doses
typically required by those with psychosis of greater severity.8

Using the habit model to understand the interplay
between psychosis, OCS and clozapine

We have previously identified that, in clozapine-treated patients,
psychosis severity and length of treatment are distinct risk factors
for obsessions and checking compulsions respectively.9 Most
studies show a predominance of compulsions over obsessions in
this group, with excessive checking being the most frequently
reported repetitive behaviour.10 Informed by models of habit forma-
tion developed in cognitive neuroscience, we conceptualised these
checking compulsions as arising as the by-product of psychosis.
Specifically, repetition in the context of a diminished ability to

164

Clozapine and excessive checking

consider an action’s outcome may lead to the automatisation of
behaviour (‘habit formation’). Further, decreased 5-HT activity
may enhance habit development.11 We have applied this framework
to hypothesise a two-phase model of OCS and OCD development.
First, an initial phase of checking as a goal-directed behaviour
may occur due to psychotic hypervigilance. After remission of
psychosis, achieved with antipsychotic treatment, a second ‘habit’
phase may occur in which clozapine ameliorates psychosis but pro-
motes checking compulsions via serotonin antagonism in those
vulnerable.

In the present study, we investigated the dynamic interplay
between psychosis, clozapine dose and OCS. We aimed to test
this two-phase hypothesis using a large cohort of clozapine-
treated patients assessed longitudinally. Specifically, we hypothe-
sised that:

(a) checking compulsion is related to psychosis severity
(b) checking severity correlates with clozapine plasma levels in

those in remission from psychosis.

We also explored the moderating effects of specific genetic var-
iants on the development of psychosis-related obsessions and
compulsions.

Method

For this study, relevant psychopathology scales included in the
CRD were the Obsessive–Compulsive Inventory – Revised (OCI-R),
self-reported annually from 2016 (and completed independently
of other scales), and the PANSS-positive, rated every 2 years since
2017.

Psychopathology scales
Severity of OCS was measured using the OCI-R,12 an 18-item self-
reported measure featuring six subscales: washing, checking, order-
ing, obsessing (e.g. having obsessional thoughts), hoarding and
mental neutralising. The impact of each item on a respondent’s
function is reported via a 5-point scale, ranging from ‘not at all’
(0) to ‘extremely’ (4). The total score, therefore, ranges from 0 to
72, with higher scores indicating greater OCS severity. As in previ-
ous work,9 we considered a total score ≥21, or ≥5 on any subscale,
as clinically significant.

Psychosis severity was measured using the positive subscale
(items P1–P7) of the PANSS13. The PANSS is a clinician-rated
scale that includes 7 items referring to psychotic (‘positive’) symp-
toms rated on a 7-point scale (1 absent, 7 extreme). Patients were
considered in remission from psychosis when none of these items
scored ≥3, as the main goal of the study was to explore whether
active symptoms (PANSS score of ≥3) were associated with OCS/
OCD.

Study design and setting

Assessment of clozapine load

This naturalistic longitudinal observational study used anonymised
electronic records gathered by Cambridgeshire and Peterborough
NHS Foundation Trust (CPFT). CPFT is the primary public
mental healthcare provider for approximately 890 000 people in a
mixed urban/rural area in the East of England, UK.

Ethics, participants and electronic records

The authors assert that all procedures contributing to this work
comply with the ethical standards of the relevant national and insti-
tutional committees on human experimentation and with the
Helsinki Declaration of 1975, as revised in 2008.

We used the Clinical and Research Database (CRD) for
Persistent Schizophrenia under NHS Research Ethics Committee
(REC) approvals (ref. 13/EE/0121; 18/EE/0239). This database con-
tains anonymised routine clinical data from the CPFT Clozapine
Clinic.

Extracted data maintained patient anonymity by removing all
identifiable data. All clinical assessments in the CRD were per-
formed by an experienced psychiatrist (E.F.E.) and the database
also contained self-rated measures that the patients completed
during routine clinical appointments. This study covers information
from 24 August 2012 to 31 December 2022. The CRD includes 3126
face-to-face assessments of 254 patients taking clozapine. For this
study, we included only assessments that had a standardised evalu-
ation of OCS and scores on the positive subscale of the Positive and
Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS-positive) (see below).

Routine clinical assessments

All annual Care Programme Approach (CPA) assessments in the
electronic record include sociodemographic data (age, gender, age
at illness onset, clozapine start date), a review and confirmation of
prescribed medication (with dose),
smoking habit
(average number of cigarettes per day), alcohol use (average
number of alcohol units per week) and latest clozapine and norclo-
zapine plasma levels results (including date of test). All patients are
evaluated on all the scales.

current

We used blood clozapine levels as a measure of clozapine load,
rather than clozapine dose, as dose (typically ranging from
75–900 mg/day) is an inaccurate measure of clozapine load.14
This is because clozapine metabolism is influenced by various
factors, including medication adherence, gender, cytochrome poly-
morphisms, concurrent medication and smoking habits. Blood
levels, therefore, represent a more precise measure.

Genetics of clozapine-induced OCS

One hundred patients of the final sample of 196 also consented to
participate in the ethically approved ‘Genetics of common cloza-
pine-induced side effects’ study (REC reference 18/NW/0581).
The study aimed to replicate previously described genetic variants
associated with clozapine side-effects, including OCD and meta-
bolic complications.

Specifically, we explored genetic variants in the serotonin
pathway,
including single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs):
SLC6A4 (rs4795541, rs25531), HTR2A (rs6313, rs6314) and
HTR2C (rs3813929, rs1414334). Variants within the glutamate
pathway were also included: SLC1A1 (rs2228622) and GRIN2B
(rs890). Samples were collected during routine blood monitoring
at
(Flinders
Technology Associates) cards by Sigma-Aldrich, allowing storing,
transporting, stability and DNA purification from samples at
room temperature.

The Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in

Epidemiology (STROBE) guidelines checklist was followed.

Statistical analysis

For basic description, categorical variables are reported in the
format ‘n (%)’ and continuous variables in the format ‘mean (s.d.)’.
Pearson correlation coefficients were used to measure the
strength and direction of associations between continuous variables.
To account for multiple comparisons, we applied a Bonferroni
correction.

A multi-level mediation model assessed the longitudinal associ-
ation between psychosis severity and checking compulsions, directly
and indirectly via obsessing. This is the preferred method for explor-
ing longitudinal changes in samples where the time between assess-
ments is not fixed, as in our study. Psychosis severity (measured by
the PANSS-positive subscale) was included as both a fixed-effect
and a (per-participant) random-effect variable, and the duration
of clozapine treatment was controlled for, as in previous similar
studies. Further analyses used PANSS-positive items associated
with reality distortion (items P1, P3 and P6).

For assessing the effect of clozapine load on psychosis severity,
we selected a subgroup of participants to avoid factors confounding
previous research. These individuals (a) were on clozapine mono-
therapy (no other antipsychotic or antidepressant) for more than
a year, (b) were in remission from psychosis and (c) had plasma
levels taken within 28 days of the OCS evaluation (without interven-
ing medication changes) that were within the upper limit of the
therapeutic range (0.6 mg/L or 600 ng/mL).

Multi-level moderation models were also conducted to explore
whether specific genetic variants moderated the association between
psychosis severity and checking compulsions via obsessions. The
models were fitted with psychosis severity and genetic variant as
both fixed-effect and (per-participant) random-effect variables.
Duration of clozapine use was controlled for. This was performed
in a subgroup of patients for whom genetic data were available
(n = 97, with 235 face-to-face assessments).

All statistical analyses were performed using R (version 3.5.0 for
Windows), including the packages lmerTest (version 3.1-2) and
Mediation (version 4.5.0).

10.1192/bjp.2024.30 expands on the details of the prevalence of OCS
severity by psychosis remission.

The role of psychosis and reality distortion in OCS

Psychotic symptoms significantly correlated with overall OCS
severity and with the obsessing and checking compulsion subscales
of the OCI-R (Table 2). This association was significantly stronger
for obsessing (r = 0.419) than compulsion (r = 0.116). Table 2 also
shows the associations with the individual psychotic symptoms.

The effect of psychosis on checking behaviour was indirect,
mediated by obsessional symptoms. No direct effect of psychosis
on checking compulsions was identified (Fig. 1). The length of
clozapine treatment was controlled for in this model. In further
models (Supplementary Figs 1 and 2), an indirect effect of psychosis
on compulsion was found only for participants with active para-
noid/psychotic symptoms (n = 198: those for whom the sum of
scores on PANSS items P1 + P3 + P6 > 4). Similar results were
found when additional confounders,
including clozapine dose,
were included in the models.

Sample description

The final sample consisted of 196 clozapine-treated patients and 459
OCI-R/PANSS-positive pair assessments, each participant being
followed for an average of 2.7 years. Table 1 shows key sociodemo-
graphic and clinical variables at baseline: 74 participants (37.9%)
had an OCI-R score at or above the OCD cut-off of 21. Obsessing
and checking compulsions were the most common OCS. Among
those in remission from psychosis (n = 60 out of 196), 25 (12.8%
of the total) exhibited significant checking behaviours (indicated
by a score >4 on the checking subscale).

Thirty-five participants (17.9%) exhibited negligible OCS (total
score <5 and checking factor <2) after 5 years or more on clozapine
treatment. The Supplementary material available at https://doi.org/

The role of clozapine on the persistence of excessive
checking after psychosis remission

Figure 2 shows the significant correlations between checking com-
pulsions and clozapine dose (n = 65; r = 0.378, P = 0.002), clozapine
plasma level (r = 0.353; P = 0.004) and norclozapine level (r = 0.270;
P = 0.030). There was no correlation between obsessing and either
clozapine dose or levels (P > 0.21).

Within this group of patients in remission, we compared those
with excessive checking (OCI-R checking subscale score >4; n = 28)
with those without checking (n = 37). Those with excessive checking
had a higher clozapine dose (t = 2.956; P = 0.04), higher clozap-
ine levels (t = 2.973; P = 0.04) and higher norclozapine levels
(t = 2.363; P = 0.021).

Genes moderating psychosis-to-obsession and
obsession-to-compulsion effects

We found the association of psychosis with obsessions to be mod-
erated by serotonergic genes in uncorrected tests, but this did not
survive correction for multiple comparisons. In the uncorrected
tests, genotype GC for HTR2C (rs1414334) moderated the effect,
and genotype GA SLC6A4 (rs25531) and genotype AA for
SLC1A1 (rs2228622) moderated the effect from obsession to com-
pulsion, but none of the other SNPs studied did. Supplementary
Table 1 details the eight SNPs studied.

however, are not feasible here, as the potentially lethal side-effects
of clozapine generally prohibit
its chronic administration to
healthy volunteers. Long-term longitudinal studies in people with
schizophrenia after clozapine initiation could provide a more
detailed characterisation, but the latency of the onset of OCS (up
to a decade) may render such studies impractical. Given this, we
consider this study’s large sample and longitudinal follow-up to
represent a balance between practical
feasibility and rigour.
Second, OCS were evaluated using a self-rated scale and further
work might benefit from replication using a clinician-rated scale
such as the Yale–Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS).
Again, however, this may be impractical in a clinical environment.
Third, the patient sample included in this study’s genetic analyses
was small (n = 97), and these findings should therefore be taken
as exploratory and in need of replication.

Discussion

We found that OCS are common in clozapine-treated patients and
are associated with both psychosis severity and clozapine load, albeit
at different phases. Mediation analyses suggested that psychosis
severity generates checking behaviour indirectly by inducing obses-
sions. After remission from psychosis, checking compulsion corre-
lated with clozapine plasma levels. We also found indications that
serotonergic and glutamatergic variants might moderate the effect
of psychosis on obsessions and compulsions, although our sample
was too small for these findings to be considered conclusive.

Interpretation of findings and comparison with previous
research

Our results broadly align with previous research regarding OCS
prevalence (here, 37.9%) and the predominance of checking and
obsessing symptoms. Our sample is representative of a typical clo-
zapine-treated cohort, with male predominance (79%), an average
prescribed clozapine dose of ∼330 mg/day and a typical treatment
length (∼17 years). Importantly, however, this study’s sample size
(196 participants), longitudinal nature and volume of standardised
OCS and PANSS-positive assessments (457 face-to-face assess-
ments) are more extensive than any previous research.

This work builds on a hypothesis established a priori and devel-
oped during our previously published cross-sectional publication.
We have conceptualised clozapine-associated OCS as a dynamic
phenomenon that fluctuates in intensity according to psychosis
severity, in line with recent work by Schirmbeck and colleagues,15

and clozapine load. We uncoupled OCS into its two main compo-
nents (obsessions and compulsions) and applied a mediation
model that identified an association of psychosis severity (particu-
larly the severity of reality distortion symptoms such as delusions,
hallucinations or suspiciousness/persecutory beliefs) with obsessive
thoughts. Obsessive thoughts, in turn, triggered checking behaviour.
This may initially be understood as goal-directed, safety-seeking
behaviour in acutely psychotic paranoid patients. As one patient
in this cohort reported, ‘I need to check everything is in place as
my upstairs neighbour comes to steal my stuff’. Then, in patients
achieving psychosis remission, we found checking severity to be sig-
nificantly correlated with clozapine plasma levels, suggesting a role
of clozapine in perpetuating checking as a non-goal-directed action
or habit. Indeed, persistently impaired safety signalling has been
described in OCD,15 limiting patients’ ability to assign safety valua-
tions after verification.

Appreciating the distinct roles of psychosis and clozapine in
OCS development is essential to understanding the apparent dis-
crepancies in previous cross-sectional studies. The point prevalence
of OCS (measured via questionnaire) may fluctuate according to the
severity of the psychosis (Fig. 1, Table 2), clozapine load (Fig. 2),
concomitant medications (e.g. antidepressants) or even the tools
used to assess the symptoms. For instance, psychosis-driven, goal-
directed checking might not be considered OCS but part of a delu-
sion. Here we circumvented this risk by using a patient-reported
OCS questionnaire.

Our hypothesised two-phase model of OCS development9 is
based on cognitive neuroscience’s framework of habit formation11
and shows the potential for embedding cognitive neuroscience
into clinical practice. In our context, clozapine-treated patients in
psychosis remission might experience checking compulsions as an
antipsychotic-induced habit. A notable strength of our two-phase
model is its integration of present results, previous studies and
patients’ narratives,
in which psychosis-induced goal-directed
behaviour becomes habitual. This model is also flexible regarding
the content of the repetitive behaviour, as we found checking
whereas others reported washing as the most common compul-
sion.16 Therefore, it can accommodate other triggers, such as the
influence of stressful events, cognitive dysfunctions or affective
symptoms (not included in this study as they were not part of the
a priori hypothesis).

A plausible mechanism for the persistence of repetitive behav-
iour following remission from psychosis may be clozapine’s antag-
onism of 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors. A decrease in serotonin
neurotransmission causes perseveration in reversal learning tasks,

the hallmark of cognitive inflexibility in compulsive behaviours
such as OCD.17 In humans, dietary tryptophan depletion (which
reduces serotonin in the brain acutely) promotes habitual rather
than goal-directed control.18 Remarkably, a recent mouse-model
study showed similar results. Mice receiving clozapine increased
their grooming time significantly (as a proxy of compulsion). This
behaviour then reverted on the administration of fluoxetine, a
the same
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor. Interestingly,
effects were seen in both wild-type and Sapap3-knockout mice (a
well-known animal model of OCD), albeit with significantly
greater intensity in the knockout mice, suggesting a genetic vulner-
ability to clozapine-induced habit formation.19

Nevertheless, it is also interesting to note that individual factors
might increase vulnerability. For instance, 35 patients (17.9%)
exhibited negligible OCS after 5 years or more on clozapine treat-
ment. Variation in vulnerability was explored in this work, in
which we suggest a distinct moderating effect of serotonergic and
glutamatergic SNPs on the psychosis-to-obsession and obsession-
to-compulsion pathways respectively (Supplementary material).
We found evidence to support previous findings involving the glu-
tamate pathway,20 such as SLC1A1. More importantly, we report
the first indication of serotonin pathway involvement, as described
in pure OCD. However, drawing firm conclusions about the role of
specific variants will require work with larger samples. Nevertheless,
our identification of several genetic variants in the serotonin
pathway (SLC6A4, HTR2C) moderating the psychosis–obsession–
compulsion pathway is notable, and may offer clues to future pre-
ventive or therapeutic approaches. The converging evidence from
this and other studies indicates that interventions directed at enhan-
cing serotonin function are crucial for the effective treatment of clo-
zapine-induced OCS,21 as in pure OCD. Nevertheless, we did not
specifically explore the effect of medication modifications on OCS
severity, and further research is needed in this area.

A better understanding of the different phases of the phenom-
enon, in which compulsions arise as a by-product of florid paranoid
psychosis and then perpetuated in predisposed subjects by cloza-
pine’s anti-serotonergic action, may inform clinicians’ therapeutic
decisions.
