Abstract

Background—Insomnia is common in the elderly, and is associated with chronic disease, but 
use of hypnotics increases the incidence of falls. Montmorency tart cherry juice has improved 
insomnia by self-report questionnaire.

Study Question—Is insomnia confirmed by polysomnography, and is tryptophan availability a 
potential mechanism for treating insomnia?

Study Design—A placebo-controlled, balanced, crossover study with subjects >50 years of age 
and insomnia were randomized to placebo (2 weeks) or cherry juice (2 weeks) (240ml 2 times/
day) separated by a 2-week washout.

Measures and Outcomes—Sleep was evaluated by polysomnography and 5 validated 
questionnaires. Serum indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase (IDO), the kynurenine to tryptophan ratio, 
and prostaglandin E2 (PGE-2) were measured. In vitro, Caco-2 cells were stimulated with 
interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and the ability of cherry juice procyanidin to inhibit IDO which 
degrades tryptophan and stimulates inflammation was measured. The content of procyanidin B-2 
and other major anthocyanins in cherry juice were determined.

Results—Eleven subjects were randomized, 3 with sleep apnea were excluded and referred. The 
8 completers with insomnia increased sleep time by 84 minutes on polysomnography (p=0.0182) 
and sleep efficiency increased on the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (p=0.03). Other 
questionnaires showed no significant differences. The serum kynurenine to tryptophan ratio 
decreased, as did the level of prostaglandin E2 (both p<0.05). In vitro, cherry juice procyanidin 
B-2 dose-dependently inhibited IDO.

INTRODUCTION

Insomnia is a common condition in the elderly and is associated with reduced quality of life 
and adverse outcomes. In a survey, 23% to 34% of 9,000 adults over 65 years of age 
complained of insomnia.1 Insomnia is associated with increased prevalence of medical 
disorders including hypertension,2 type-2 diabetes,3 exacerbation of chronic pain4 and a 
decline in cognitive function.5 Cognitive behavioral therapy is not always effective for 
chronic primary insomnia, and the short-term use of hypnotics increases the risk of falls in 
the elderly by over 4-fold.6 Therefore, it is important to identify treatments for insomnia 
without apparent side effects.

Montmorency (Prunus cerasus) tart cherry juice has been reported to have a positive effect 
on insomnia in elderly people as measured by the Insomnia Severity Index. The biggest 
effect seen was on the “waking after sleep onset” subscale.7 Although the authors stated that 
the mechanism for the beneficial effect of tart cherry juice on insomnia was unknown, they 
suggested that melatonin contained in the cherries could be responsible. The effective dose 
of the cherry juice was juice derived from 100g of cherries. The amount of melatonin in the 
dose of cherry juice used in the study was equivalent to 0.135 μg, and the dose of melatonin 
recommended for sleep is 0.5 to 5 mg.8 Thus, it would appear that the effect of tart cherry 
juice on sleep is due to more than its melatonin content.

Tryptophan, a precursor of serotonin, reduces sleep latency in humans at doses of 1.2 to 2.4 
grams.9 Since tart cherries contain only 9 mg of tryptophan per 100 grams, one might 
presume that this small amount of tryptophan could not impact insomnia. Tryptophan 
degradation, however, parallels and predicts insomnia.10–12 Tryptophan is degraded by the 
enzyme indoleamine 2, 3 deoxygenase (IDO) to produce kynurenine. Indoleamine 2, 3 
deoxygenase is stimulated by inflammation, and inhibition of IDO not only increases 
serotonin and improves mood, but also decreases inflammation.13–14. Since tryptophan is 
degraded into kynurenine, the ratio of kynurenine to tryptophan is a measure of tryptophan 
degradation, a lower value suggesting decreased tryptophan degradation.

Tart cherry juice contains 0.2% procyanidins.15 Since procyanidins can be detected in 
human serum 2 h after ingestion,16 we hypothesized that tart cherry juice standardized to a 
specific procyanidin content would decrease the ratio of kynurenine to tryptophan and 
contribute to the treatment of insomnia.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Clinical Trial

A randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled clinical trial was conducted to test the 
effectiveness of tart cherry juice of known procyanidin content as a treatment for insomnia. 
This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Pennington Biomedical 
Research Center and registered on ClinicalTrials.gov under NCT01669317. Eleven healthy 
male or female subjects (age ≥50 years) with chronic insomnia and a usual bedtime between 
9 p.m. and midnight were included in this study. Insomnia was defined as trouble sleeping 
on average more than 3 nights per week, with an Insomnia Severity Index score greater than 
or equal to 10 and meeting the International Classification of Sleep Disorders – 2 (ICSD-2) 
criteria for insomnia.17–18 ICSD-2 defines insomnia as a complaint of difficulty initiating 
sleep, difficulty maintaining sleep, waking up too early and sleep that is chronically non-
restorative or poor in quality, despite adequate opportunity for sleep and circumstances 
conducive to sleep. Insomnia includes at least one of the following daytime complaints 
related to the sleep difficulty: fatigue or malaise; poor attention, concentration or memory 
impairment; social vocational dysfunction or poor school performance; mood disturbances 
or irritability; daytime sleepiness; motivation, energy or initiative reduction; proneness for 
errors or accidents at work or while driving; tension, headaches, or gastrointestinal 
symptoms in response to sleep loss; or concerns or worries about sleep. Subjects who had 
diabetes mellitus, were taking sedating or hypnotic medications or were taking chronic 
medication without a stable dose for one month or longer were excluded.

Subjects fasted for 10 hours except for water prior to screening, and blood was drawn for 
glucose, creatinine, potassium, uric acid, albumin, calcium, magnesium, creatine 
phosphokinase, alanine-leucine transaminase, alkaline phosphatase, iron, cholesterol, 
triglycerides, high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and low density lipoprotein (LDL) 
cholesterol. A health questionnaire and five validated questionnaires were completed 
(Insomnia Severity Index, the Epworth Sleepiness Scale, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, 
the Beck Depression Inventory and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory).19–22

Subjects who passed screening drank 240ml of tart cherry juice containing a measured level 
of procyanidin (Table 4) or placebo juice in the morning and 1 to 2 hours before bedtime for 
14 days. All cherry juice was from the same batch and was analyzed for its content of 
phenolic compounds. The placebo juice was made of vapor-distilled water, fructose, 
dextrose, lemon powder and looked and tasted like cherry juice. After two weeks of cherry 
juice or placebo, subjects had an over-night polysomnographic sleep study, and blood was 
drawn that evening for measurement of the kynurenine to tryptophan ratio to evaluate 
tryptophan degradation, and prostaglandin E-2 (PGE-2) to evaluate inflammation. Upon 
waking after the sleep study, the 5 validated questionnaires were repeated and subjects were 
questioned about any adverse events. After a two week washout period, the subjects were 
crossed-over to the tart cherry juice or the placebo they did not take in the first two-week 
testing period, and the two-week testing period was repeated. The order of the cherry juice 
was balanced and assigned randomly.

Blood testing, serum preparation and analysis

Blood drawn for testing of free tryptophan, kynurenine and PGE-2 was frozen and stored at 
−80° C until analysis by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with ultraviolet 
(UV) and fluorescence detection. The ratio of kynurenine/tryptophan as an index of IDO 
activity was calculated using an Agilent 1100 series HPLC with a diode array detector and a 
fluorescence detector.23 The wavelength of the UV detector was set at 365 nm and 
fluorescence excitation was at 254 nm with detection at 404 nm. A 6-methyltryptophan 
internal standard was used, and the fluorescence conditions were set to excitation at 220 nm 
with detection at 354 nm.24 The stock solutions of tryptophan or kynurenine were 1 mmol L
−1 in the mobile phase, and were prepared immediately before use. Serial dilutions of the 
serum samples were made to produce final (additional) concentrations of 6.25, 12.5, 25, 50, 
75 and 100 μmol L −1 for tryptophan, and 0.0625, 0.125, 0.25, 0.75, 1.5 and 6.25 μmol L −1 
for kynurenine. After addition of the internal standard, the medium was precipitated with 
perchloric acid (8% final acid concentration), centrifuged for 10 min at 64 g in a refrigerated 
centrifuge and 20 μL of the clear supernatant was used for testing. PGE-2 levels in sera 
before and after cherry juice consumption were determined by enzyme-linked 
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using a commercial kit from Peprotech (Rocky Hill, NJ).

Chemicals and Reagents—The Cherry Marketing Institute provided Indian Summer® 
cherry juice without Vitamin C which was stored at 20°C and used within three months. 
HPLC grade acetonitrile, methanol, and trifluoroacetic acid were purchased from Fisher 
Scientific (Fair Lawn, N.J.). C18-Sep-Pak cartridges were purchased from Waters (Milford, 
MA). Proanthocyanidin B-2 was purchased from Chromadex (Irvine, CA). Dulbecco’s 
Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM), fetal bovine serum, trypsin and phosphate buffered 
saline were obtained from Fisher Scientific (Pittsburgh, PA). Bio-Rad DC protein assay kit 
was purchased from Bio-Rad Laboratories (Hercules, CA). An ELISA kit for prostaglandin 
E2 (PGE2) was purchased from Peprotech (Rick Hill, NJ). Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) 
membranes and 4–12% Bis-Tris gel were obtained from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). Bovine 
serum albumin (BSA), primary antibodies against IDO, nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-
enhancer of activated B cells subunit (NF-κB-p65) and β-actin were purchased from Santa 
Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Primary antibody against cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) 
was purchased from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI). Peroxidase-conjugated secondary 
antibodies were obtained from Jackson Immunoresearch (West Grove, PA). X-ray film was 
purchased from Phoenix Research (Candler, NC).

Cell culture

Caco-2 colon cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) 
(Manassas, VA). The cells were propagated in Invitrogen minimum essential media (MEM) 
containing sodium bicarbonate, 15 mM Hepes, fetal bovine serum to a final concentration of 
10%, Invitrogen Glutamax, and sodium pyruvate. All experiments were with 80–90% 
confluent cultures. All cells were propagated at 37°C in 5% CO2 in a humidified chamber.

In Vitro effect of proanthocyanidin-B2

Caco-2 (1.8 × 105 cells/well) colon cancer cells were stimulated with 10 ng/mL interferon-
gamma (IFN-γ) in the absence or presence of 0–50 μM of procyanidin B-2 at 37°C, 5% CO 2 
for 24 h. The levels of IDO, NF-κB or COX-2 in the control and procyanidin-treated cells 
were evaluated by Western blot using anti-IDO, anti-NF-KB, or anti-COX-2 antibodies. Beta 
actin served as a loading control. The data are representative of three separate experiments.

Determination of the procyanidin B-2 content

The method of Kennedy25 was used to isolate and extract procyanidin-B2 from cherry juice. 
The method of Kim and Lee26 was used to determine the levels of procyanidin B-2 in cherry 
juice. Procyanidin B-2 standards were used for quantitative analysis of procyanidin B-2 in 
cherry juice. The method of Kim and Lee26 was used for the extraction, isolation and 
analysis of cyanidin-3-O-glucoside, cyanidin-3-O-rutinoside or cyanidin-3-O-
glucosylrutinoside in cherry juice. These anthocyanins and procyanidins were selected, 
because they represent the major anthocyanins and procyanidins present in tart cherries.27 
Analyses of procyanidin B-2 or anthocyanins were performed using an Agilent 1100 HPLC 
equipped with a photodiode detector. Procyanidin B-2 was detected at 280 nm and 
anthocyanins were detected at 520 nm.

Statistical analysis

Since there were no polysomnographic studies of cherry juice upon which to base a power 
analysis, the clinical trial was designed as a pilot study to determine power for a larger, 
adequately powered study that would give statistically significant differences. The 
differences in the polysomnographic studies and questionnaires were compared by t-test for 
paired observations. Categorical variables were compared by chi-squared test.

Proanthocyanin-B2, Procyanidin-B2, anthocyanins, procyanins, IDO, NF-κB, COX-2, 
PGE-2, interferon-γ, tryptophan, kynureinie and the kynurenine to tryptophan ratio were 
analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) or non-parametric equivalent of ANOVA. 
Comparisons between the active and the placebo conditions were made on days 35 and 70 
using variance analysis with the baseline values on day 0 as a covariate. Probability (p) 
values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.

RESULTS

Clinical Trial

Eleven subjects were randomized, but eight subjects completed both arms of the study and 
data relating to those eight subjects were analyzed. Three subjects had moderate to severe 
sleep apnea by polysomnography. They were eliminated from the analysis and referred for 
evaluation and treatment. The eight subjects who completed both arms of the study are 
described in Table 1. The polysomnographic results are presented in Table 2. The sleep time 
was extended in the cherry juice condition by 84 minutes (p=0.0182). The sleep efficiency 
improved in the cherry juice condition, but did not reach statistical significance. The results 
of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) are presented in Table 3. The Habitual Sleep 
Efficiency improved (p=0.03), and the sleep duration also improved on the PSQI but did not

reach statistical significance. There were no statistically significant differences on the 
Insomnia Severity Index, the Epworth Sleepiness scale, the Beck Depression Inventory II or 
the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. There were no adverse events.

Serum kynurenine

The kynurenine to tryptophan ratio was reduced in the cherry juice condition (p<0.05) 
indicating an inhibition of IDO with a reduction in the degradation of tryptophan (Figure 2). 
The level of PGE-2, a marker of inflammation, was also dose-dependently reduced (p<0.05) 
(Figure 3).

Procyanidin B-2 and anthocyanin contents of tart cherry juice

The tart cherry juice contained procyanidin B-2, cyanidin-3-O-glucosylrutinoside, 
cyaniding-3-O-glucoside and cyanidin-3-O-rutinoside (Table 4). The presence of these 
bioactives in cherries has been reported.15

Interaction of procyanidin B-2 and inflammatory biomarkers

The efficacy of procyanidin B-2 against IDO, was demonstrated by stimulating Caco-2 cells 
with IFN-γ. The IDO, NFK-B, and COX-2 levels in cancer cells decreased with 
progressively higher concentrations of procyanidin B-2. We found that procyanidin B-2 at 
24 μM to 50 μM inhibited IFN- γ induced IDO in human Caco-2 colon cancer cell lines 
(Figure 1)

DISCUSSION

Pigeon et al. performed a pilot cross-over study exploring the effect of tart cherry juice 
(240ml twice a day) or placebo over two weeks on insomnia in individuals ≥65 years of age 
with a 2-week washout period between crossover arms.7 They reported statistically 
significant improvement during the cherry juice consumption in the Insomnia Severity Index 
and a 62 minute improvement in waking after sleep onset. Our study design was patterned 
after that of Pigeon et al, but unlike that study, ours used formal polysomnography testing, 
the gold-standard method for evaluating sleep pathology. Sleep questionnaires used in the 
Pigeon et al. study represent a weakness, since they rely on self-report to evaluate a 
condition in which people are not conscious of their surroundings, and sleep questionnaires 
do not identify participants with sleep apnea. Sleep apnea is a mechanical condition that 
results in poor sleep quality, but would not be expected to improve without reversal of 
airway obstruction. Since 3 of 11 subjects in our study meeting the Pigeon et al. screening 
criteria had sleep apnea rather than insomnia, being able to identify and eliminate sleep 
apnea is important. Using polysomnography gives a more accurate assessment of sleep and 
allows selection of subjects with insomnia.

Howatson et al. evaluated sleep quality in 20 healthy exercising volunteers between the ages 
of 18 and 40 years (26±4.6, mean ± SD).24 They used actigraphy to access the endpoints and 
gave 30ml of tart cherry juice concentrate twice a day for 7 days or placebo in a cross-over 
trial with a 2-week washout period between study arms. The cherry juice condition had a 
statistically significant increase of time in bed (25 minutes), total sleep time (34 minutes)

and sleep efficiency (5–6%). The urinary degradation product of melatonin increased 
statistically (~17%) in the cherry juice condition, but there was no change in the circadian 
rhythm of melatonin. Melatonin is postulated to treat insomnia, by restoring disturbed 
circadian rhythms. Cherry juice increased melatonin intake by 85μg/d while the melatonin 
dose shown to treat insomnia ranges between 0.5 and 5 mg/d, a dose that is 6- to 60-fold 
higher. Thus, the increase in melatonin may not be the major mechanism responsible for the 
improving sleep quality. The Howatson et al.24 study does, however, give support to the 
beneficial effects of tart cherry juice on sleep quality in a younger group of volunteers than 
those tested in the present study.

Our study included healthy volunteers that were ≥50 years of age. We eliminated three of 11 
subjects with sleep apnea that were diagnosed by polysomnography, something that the 
studies by Pigeon et al. and Howatson et al. did not do. The polysomnography was done on 
only two nights and some acclimation to the procedure might have been desirable. This 
weakness should have been overcome by the balanced order of the sleep studies and the 
cross-over design of the trial. Although the prevalence of sleep apnea may have been lower 
in the younger subjects studied by Howatson, the subjects studied by Pigeon et al. were all 
≥65 years of age. One strength of our study was its accuracy through the use of 
polysomnography, but since it was a small pilot study, many of the parameters we measured 
did not demonstrate a statistically significant change. This is a weakness that can be 
addressed by a larger future study with adequate power to detect the other endpoints. Despite 
the small size of our pilot study, we demonstrated a statistically significant 84 minute 
increase in sleep time by polysomnography and reduced plasma levels of kynurenine with 
increased tryptophan levels. The kynurenine tryptophan ratio (K/T) is the gold standard for 
determining IDO activity.28–29 The in vitro and in vivo results obtained suggest that the 
procyanidin B-2 in cherry juice is an inhibitor of IDO and part of the mechanism by which 
tart cherry juice improves sleep efficiency. These findings suggest that procyanidin B-2-rich 
cherry juice can improve tryptophan bioavailability for serotonin synthesis and might 
theoretically contribute to mood-enhancing effects, although this was not detected on the 
questionnaires evaluated in this study.30 These findings suggest that of all the procyanidins 
that reach the gastrointestinal tract, the oligomeric procyanidins are converted into dimeric 
procyanidins and absorbed. The polymeric procyanidins are not bioavailable. Because of the 
high content of procyanidin B-2 in the tart cherry juice used in this study, we used 
procyanidin B-2 as a standard for the study.

The other major phenolic compounds in tart cherries such as cyaniding-3-O-
glucosylrutinoside are deglycosylated before absorption and metabolized into phenolic 
acids. We did not evaluate the effects of the phenolic acids on IDO. IFN-γ up regulates 
COX-2 and IDO and has been shown to correlate with increased production of PGE2 and 
kynurenine.31 IDO overexpression is linked to COX-2 expression.32 Inhibition of IDO is 
associated with COX-2 suppression.33 Our in vitro results showed inhibition of IDO and 
COX-2 (Figure 1) and our in vivo results showed inhibition of PGE2 (Figure 3).

We conclude that tart cherry juice is an effective treatment for insomnia. It has no adverse 
events as demonstrated in our study as well as in prior studies by others. Procyanidin B-2 is 
a likely active ingredient in tart cherry juice acting through plasma kynurenine reduction,

tryptophan enhancement, and inhibition of IDO. Procyanidin B-2 may be an effective 
ingredient for improving insomnia. Thus, tart cherry juice and its active ingredients may 
offer a safe, yet effective, improvement in insomnia that will not increase the prevalence of 
falls or other side effects associated with hypnotic medications.
