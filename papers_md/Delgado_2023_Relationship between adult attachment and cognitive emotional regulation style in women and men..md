attachment and cognitive 
emotional regulation style 
in women and men

Cognitive emotion regulation (CER) strategies are useful in evaluating the risk of developing emotional 
disorders and that they may define subjects’ styles. This study aims to explore the extent to which 
specific styles of CER strategies relate to the anxious and avoidant attachment dimensions in adults 
and whether such relationships operate similarly for women and men. Two hundred and fifteen adults 
(between 22 and 67 years old) completed the Spanish versions of the Cognitive Emotion Regulation 
Questionnaire and the Experiences in Close Relationships instrument. Cluster analysis, ANOVA and 
Student’s t‑test were used. Our results show that women and men can be successfully classified into 
two CER clusters (Protective and Vulnerable), distinguished by the higher use in the protective cluster 
of the CER strategies considered most adaptive and complex (Acceptance, Positive Refocusing, 
Refocus on Planning, Positive Reappraisal, and Putting into Perspective). However, only in women 
were the anxious and avoidant attachment dimensions significantly associated with CER style. In 
conclusion, from a clinical and interpersonal perspective, it is interesting to be able to predict the 
belonging to a Protective or Vulnerable coping style by analysing the CER strategies and to know their 
relationship with the adult affective system.

Emotion regulation refers to the set of competences that allow one to supervise, evaluate, and modify the pro-
cesses that are implied in the origin of emotion, thereby modulating one’s emotional  manifestations1. Due to 
its importance, emotion regulation has been addressed by different lines of research from a range of perspec-
tives, including the biological, psychological, and socio-cultural. In this broad view, cognitive emotion regula-
tion strategies are highlighted as a factor relevant to understanding our way of dealing with emotional threats. 
Garnefski et al.2 developed the Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (CERQ) to assess the thoughts 
most employed to handle challenging emotions or feelings, such as Self-Blame, Acceptance, Rumination, Positive 
Refocusing, Refocus on Planning, Positive Reappraisal, Putting into Perspective, Catastrophizing, and Blaming Oth-
ers. Subsequent research has confirmed the presence of these nine primary strategies across different cultures 
and  ages3–10. Research on cognitive emotion regulation strategies has revealed that, on the one hand, strategies 
usually referred to as “less adaptive” or “maladaptive,” such as Rumination, Catastrophizing, Self-Blame, and 
Blaming Others, are directly related to symptoms of depression and  anxiety3–6. On the other hand, the so-called 
“adaptive strategies,” such as Positive Reappraisal, Putting into Perspective, and Acceptance, are inversely related 
to such symptoms (e.g.,7–10).

However, the functional relationship that defines maladaptive strategies as risk factors and adaptive strate-
gies as prevention factors is not always applicable. It varies with such factors as the condition of the sample, 
e.g., clinical or community-dwelling, its age, and its cultural  composition11–13. At the same time, various works 
have proposed that the adaptive or maladaptive nature of the strategies and, therefore, their protective or risk-
enhancing function, also depends on various contextual  factors14–17. The research available in this regard is still 
very scarce; so far, for example, the analysis has focused on contextual factors such as the controllability of the 
 stressor18, the type or intensity of the emotion, and the social or achievement circumstances in which the strate-
gies must be  implemented19. In general, the results obtained describe a dynamic process in which contextual 
factors mediate the selection of whatever strategies may be the most effective in the specific circumstances that

ated with the regulation of the emotional response. However, most affective transactions take place in social 
settings. In fact, interpersonal processes (e.g., in a family, social, or couple setting) are a contextual factor that is 
especially relevant in terms of the emotions we experience and the way we regulate  them20. Moreover, the research 
carried out from this interpersonal perspective is of relevance insofar as it provides information not only on the 
intrapsychic processes that underlie the regulation of emotion, but also on the effects of that regulation on dif-
ferent areas of a person’s life (e.g., health, affiliative tendencies, relationships, and conflict management)20,21. In 
relation to this, it seems evident that the styles of affective bonding that we deploy in interpersonal relationships 
could affect the processes that give rise to emotion and its regulation. The theory of attachment formulated by 
 Bowlby22 looks at the bond of attachment from the perspective of how a baby–adult interaction system operates 
to keep the child close to the adult and to protect him or her from threats. According to this theory, as the child 
grows, the experiences of caring begin to be represented symbolically in an internal working model that gathers 
the essential aspects of the self and the other in an attachment relationship. However, as pointed out by Brether-
ton and  Munholland23, in Bowlby’s  theory22, internal working models should not be regarded as dispositions 
or temperament traits, since they are updated as the child develops. Numerous studies highlight the stability 
of an early attachment style during childhood and adolescence, especially the secure  style24. The principles of 
attachment theory have been applied to adult relationships, revealing the presence of parallel styles of emotional 
relationships and threat coping. Nevertheless, correspondences between early attachment representations and 
romantic styles need to be addressed carefully. Measures of adult attachment, as the state of mind with respect 
to attachment, assessed by the AAI (Adult Attachment Interview) have shown a wide association with early 
attachment  representations24. However, despite their conceptual analogies, mainstream research reports a weak 
relationship between the affective style in current romantic relationships and early attachment  representations24,25. 
It has been speculated that the patterns of affective regulation observed in adult relations could be more strongly 
affected by current interpersonal exchanges. Therefore, the affective style displayed in adult relationships might 
be affected by factors that go beyond early attachment representations (such as previous experiences in roman-
tic relationships, maturative changes, or significant life situations). Furthermore, previous research has proven 
that the adult affective style influences different areas of a person’s life, emerging as a relevant dimension for 
our understanding of adults’ cognitive emotion regulation styles. In general, anxiously attached adult individu-
als have been described as having a higher sensitivity for detecting threats and a bias towards a negative and 
exaggerated valuation of such threats. Alternatively, avoidantly attached adult individuals are defined by their 
attempts to render the system of attachment through methods such as emphasizing self-sufficiency, avoiding 
emotional closeness, denying their attachment needs, and maximizing their physical and emotional distance 
from  others26,27. Predictably, insecure adult attachment dimensions have been related to symptoms of depression 
and anxiety or psychopathic  traits28–31.

As far as we know, the relationship between an individual’s adult romantic style and their profile of cognitive 
emotion regulation remains unexplored, even when it is predictable that the two constructs may be interrelated. 
To fill this gap, in this work we explore the relationship between adult cognitive emotion regulation style and 
the avoidant and anxious adult attachment dimensions in the context of a romantic relationship, examining 
whether such a connection works in a similar way for men and women. We hope that this work will improve 
our knowledge about the cognitive style of emotional regulation in women and men and about how these styles 
relate to the affective bonds that both maintain with their partners.

Method
Participants.  A  total  of  215  people  participated  in  the  study,  ranging  in  age  from  22  to  67  years  old 
(M = 41.03 years old, SD = 10.49). Of the participants, 30.2% were men (M = 42.20 years old, SD = 10.29), while 
69.8% were women (M = 40.53 years old, SD = 10.61). Regarding academic level, most of the sample held a uni-
versity degree (87%), and the rest of the participants had professional training (6.5%) or had graduated from 
secondary school (4.7%) or primary school (1.9%). Employment status was also taken into consideration: 48.4% 
had a permanent job, 14% had a temporary job, 2.3% were retired, and the rest of the participants either did not 
work (13.5%) or were focusing exclusively on their studies (21.9%). Participation in this research was voluntary, 
and there were no economic or academic rewards.

Instruments.  The Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire2, Spanish version (CERQ-S)32 consists of 36 
items, four for each of the nine cognitive emotion regulation strategies it measures: Self-Blame (i.e., thinking 
that one is responsible for what happened), Acceptance (i.e., accepting what has happened and resigning one-
self to it), Rumination (i.e., reflecting on one’s feelings and thoughts associated with what happened), Positive 
Refocusing (i.e., thinking about enjoyable experiences instead of about the stressful event), Refocus on Planning 
(i.e., concentrating on the measures to adopt in response to the event), Positive Reappraisal (i.e., considering 
the positive aspects of what happened), Putting into Perspective (i.e., reducing the relevance of the event), Cata-
strophizing (i.e., having thoughts that intensify the negative side of what happened), and Blaming Others (i.e., 
having thoughts that shift the blame for what happened onto others). In turn, these nine scales can be grouped 
into  two  more  general  categories,  namely  adaptive  or  appropriate  strategies  (Acceptance,  Positive  Refocusing, 
Refocus on Planning, Positive Reappraisal, and Putting into Perspective) and maladaptive or inappropriate strate-
gies (Self-Blame, Rumination, Catastrophizing, and Blaming Others)2,32,33. These two categories (more adaptive 
strategies and less adaptive strategies) will be the ones used in this research and are the result of the sum of the 
corresponding CERQ first-order dimensions. The CERQ has good psychometric properties, both in its original 
 version2 and in the versions adapted to other languages, in which the structure of the original nine-factor model 
has been  confirmed6,32–35. In the sample used in the original  study2,36, the internal consistency (alpha) of the

Vol:.(1234567890)www.nature.com/scientificreports/scales ranged from 0.75 (Self-Blame) to 0.86 (Refocus on Planning). In our study the alpha values ranged from 
0.70 (Acceptance) to 0.89 (Positive Reappraisal), with coefficient alphas of 0.89 and 0.82 for the more and less 
adaptive strategies, respectively.

Experiences in Close Relationships37 Spanish version (ECR-S)38 is a 32-item instrument containing a 7-point 
(1 = “strongly disagree” and 7 = “strongly agree”) Likert-type answer scale that has been validated within the adult 
Spanish population. It enables the evaluation of the original ECR’s orthogonal romantic attachment dimensions 
of anxiety and avoidance. In the ECR-S, 17 items measure anxiety about relationships (for instance, “I resent it 
when my partner spends time away from me”) and 15 items measure avoidance of intimacy (e.g., “I am nervous 
when partners get too close to me”). The items appear in the same order as in the English-language ECR. The 
ECR has good psychometric properties, both in its original  version37 and in the Spanish  version38. According 
to its authors, the ECR-S presents indexes of satisfactory internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha) of 0.87 for the 
Avoidance dimension and 0.85 for the Anxiety dimension. In our study, the alpha values ranged from 0.92 for 
Avoidance to 0.88 for Anxiety.

Procedure.  This cross-sectional, relational, and descriptive research study was carried out between Janu-
ary 2020 and December 2022. The sample was obtained through a form that was uploaded on an institutional 
open web page of the Universidad Nacional de Educación a Distancia (UNED; https:// www. uned. es). They were 
informed that their participation, which was voluntary and anonymous, would comprise completing a series 
of sociodemographic data and two questionnaires (CERQ-S and ECR-S). All participants signed the informed 
consent through the Internet form (by checking the corresponding checkbox). This study was approved by the 
ethics committee of the Universidad Nacional de Educación a Distancia (protocol number 25-PSI-2022) and was 
conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki (World Medical Association)39.

Not being 18 years of age at the time of the study and not having signed the informed consent were considered 

exclusion criteria for the study.

Although the total sample consisted of 215 participants, five cases were eliminated from the analyses because 
three participants did not indicate their gender and two left unanswered more than four of the instrument’s items 
measuring attachment. In the remaining cases, missing values for an item were replaced by the mean value of 
the item. The missing values, distributed randomly among the different items from these scales, represent 0.32% 
of the data from the Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire and 0.36% from the Experiences in Close 
Relationships instrument.

Data  analysis.  The  statistical  analyses  employed  were  as  follows:  Descriptive  analysis  and  Pearson’s  cor-
relations between the first and second order dimensions of the CERQ and the attachment dimensions (avoid-
ance and anxiety). Cluster analysis (K-means) was used to obtain groups of subjects who were similar in their 
cognitive emotion regulation style (in all cases, the criterion of K = 2 was used, which is the minimum value that 
allows capturing differences between participants). This analysis was used for the total sample and later also 
separately for the all-male and all-female subsamples. The clustering process used the scores from the subjects in 
the second-order factor dimensions of the CERQ-S and used One-Way ANOVA to examine the relevance of the 
variables in the process of conglomeration. Student’s t-test and Hedges’ g (95% interval confidence) were used 
to analyse the possible statistical differences and the effect size (ES) between the two coping styles identified in 
each case (total sample and separate sub-samples of men and women) in the nine first-order dimensions of the 
CERQ-S and in the two dimensions of adult attachment. IBM SPSS 27 was used for the statistical analysis.

Results
Descriptive  analysis.  Descriptive  analysis  and  correlation  matrix  were  calculated  between  the  first  and 
second-order dimensions of the CERQ and avoidance and anxiety attachment dimensions (Table 1).

Cluster analysis according to cognitive emotional coping type.  To construct the clusters, the par-
ticipants’ scores on the second-order factors on the CERQ (More vs. Less adaptive strategies) were employed as 
variables. Two groups were obtained (Table 2 shows the results of the clusterization process and the centres of 
the final clusters). The first cluster consisted of 124 participants, who were grouped together according to their 
ability to use a higher amount of the more adaptive cognitive emotional coping strategies (CECS): Acceptance, 
Positive Refocusing, Refocus on Planning, Positive Reappraisal, and Putting into Perspective (Protective style). The 
second cluster consisted of 91 participants, who were grouped together based on their minor tendency to use 
the more adaptive CECS, resulting in a more equitable use of the more and the less adaptive cognitive emotional 
regulation strategies (Vulnerable style). In both groups, the use of the less adaptive strategies was similar (Fig. 1). 
In summary, in one group the use of adaptive strategies is clearly higher than that of non-adaptive ones (protec-
tive group); while in another group, clearly differentiated, the use of adaptive strategies is simply superior to that 
of non-adaptive strategies (vulnerable group).

Subsequently, the two groups were compared in the nine first-order dimensions of the CERQ-S. Significant 
statistical differences were found in five of the nine dimensions of the CERQ-S considered more adaptive. The 
participants from group 1 (Protective style) scored significantly higher than the participants from group 2 (Vul-
nerable style) in the dimensions of Positive Refocusing, Refocus on Planning, Positive Reappraisal, Putting into 
Perspective (large ES), and Acceptance (medium ES). In contrast, no statistically significant differences were found 
between the two groups in the use of Self-Blame, Rumination, Catastrophizing, or Blaming Others. The results 
indicate that the most relevant strategies for differentiating between both coping styles are those described above 
as the “more adaptive” strategies (see Table 3).

Confidence Interval (95%): g = .20 (Small); .50 (Medium); .80 (Large). a Welch test is reported because Levene’s 
test indicated that the homogeneity of variances assumption was not met for this variable.

Analysis of attachment factors according to coping style.  Once the two types of participants were 
identified according to their CECS style, their mean scores on the two dimensions of adult attachment evaluated 
via the ERC-S were compared. Statistically significant differences were found in both dimensions of attachment 
(Table 3). The participants from the protective style, characterized by the more frequent use of the more adaptive 
CECS, were shown to have lower scores on avoidance (small ES) and anxiety (medium ES) attachment dimen-
sions.

Cluster analysis according to cognitive emotional coping type by gender.  The cluster analysis 
was repeated separately for the all-male and all-female samples. As in the previous case, two participants groups 
were obtained. Table 4 shows the results of the clusterization process and the centres of the final clusters for men 
and women. As in the previous analysis, the differences between the clusters are determined by the group of 
more adaptive strategies. In both samples, the people included in the first group (Protective style) are character-
ized by a higher score on the more adaptive CECS. In contrast, the use of the less adaptive strategies is similar 
for the four groups.

The first group (Protective style) consisted of 24 men and 87 women, who were grouped together according 
to their ability to use a higher amount of the more adaptive CECS (Acceptance, Positive Refocusing, Refocus on 
Planning, Positive Reappraisal, and Putting into Perspective). The second group (Vulnerable) consisted of 39 men 
and 60 women. As can be seen in Fig. 2 (and similarly to Fig. 1), if a cut-off point were to be established to dif-
ferentiate between both groups, it would be at around 70 points in the more adaptive strategies.

In comparing mean CECS scores according to group (Protective vs. Vulnerable), very similar results were 
obtained for men and women (see Table 5). Significant statistical differences were found in the five first-order 
dimensions of the CERQ-S considered to be more adaptive strategies. Specifically, the participants (men or 
women) from group 1 (Protective style) scored significantly higher than the participants from group 2 (Vulnerable 
style) in the dimensions of Acceptance, Positive Refocusing, Refocus on Planning, Positive Reappraisal, and Putting

into Perspective, with large effect sizes, except for the group of women in the Acceptance dimension (medium 
ES). Regarding the strategies considered less adaptive, no statistically significant differences in Self-Blame or 
Rumination were found in either of the two groups. In contrast, different results were obtained in the group of 
men and women in the dimensions of Catastrophizing and Blaming Others. Specifically, on the one hand, women 
fitting group 2 (Vulnerable style) scored significantly higher than those aligning with group 1 (Protective style) 
on Catastrophizing (small ES); however, no statistically significant differences were found in men. On the other 
hand, the men from group 1 (Protective style) scored significantly higher than those from group 2 (Vulnerable 
style) on the strategy of Blaming Others (medium ES), in contrast to the women, among whom no statistically 
significant differences were found between the two styles.

Table 5). In the group of men, no differences were found between the two cognitive emotional regulation styles 
in the Anxious and Avoidant attachment dimensions. In contrast, the women belonging to group 2 (Vulnerable 
style) scored significantly higher than those aligning with group 1 (Protective style) in the Avoidant (small ES) 
and Anxious (medium ES) attachment dimensions.

Discussion
Cognitive strategies for emotional self-regulation play an important role in the way we deal with emotions and 
are of great relevance in clinical settings. Such strategies as Rumination or Catastrophizing are usually related to 
depression or anxiety  symptoms3–5,10, while other strategies considered as “adaptive,” such as Positive Refocusing 
or Putting into Perspective, are inversely related to those same  symptoms7–10,14,40–42. For this reason, results like 
those mentioned above have promoted the consideration of “multivariate patterns” of cognitive regulation strate-
gies as an alternative to targeting isolated strategies of cognitive  regulation43. Accordingly, our study approach 
focused not on isolated strategies, nor even on groupings of strategies, but on individual styles of the use of 
strategies, which emerges as an adequate method to produce a realistic image of how individuals use cognitive 
strategies for regulation.

The results of our work identified two cognitive styles of cognitive emotion regulation. Specifically, individu-
als with a noteworthy tendency to use the cognitive strategies usually related to higher mental health scores 
(Acceptance, Positive Refocusing, Refocus on Planning, Positive Reappraisal, and Putting into Perspective) fit a 
Protective style, which runs counter to a second, Vulnerable style composed primarily of individuals who make 
a significantly less noteworthy use of these same strategies. The statistical analyses also reveal that the use of 
the so-called adaptive strategies (Acceptance, Positive Refocusing, Refocus on Planning, Positive Reappraisal, and 
Putting into Perspective) is significant enough to distinguish individuals in terms of their style (see Fig. 1), sug-
gesting that these cognitive emotion regulation strategies may be crucial for individuals to preserve psychological 
adjustment and avoid the risk of developing emotional disorders such as depression or anxiety. In terms of clinical 
implications, this result suggests the desirability of involving people in the use of "adaptive" and complex strate-
gies, since these strategies are revealed as the discriminating factor between the two regulation styles observed. 
Interestingly, the current research agrees on highlighting the complexity and singularity of adaptive strategies, 
suggesting that Positive Reappraisal, Positive Refocusing, and Putting into Perspective may demand higher levels 
of attentional control abilities, which in turn implies that cognitive control deficits in working memory, interfer-
ence control, or perseveration could lead to greater reliance on the cognitive strategies of Self-Blame, Acceptance, 
Rumination, and Catastrophizing3,44,45, which require less cognitive elaboration.

Vol.:(0123456789)www.nature.com/scientificreports/Traditionally, differences have been observed between men and women with respect to the greater use of 
one or another emotional regulation  strategy46,47, noting, among other generalized effects, a greater presence of 
rumination or internalized coping styles in  women48. These results are consistent with the significantly higher 
risk among women of developing a depression or anxiety  disorder46,49,50.

Nevertheless, other research emphasizes that the nine cognitive emotional regulation strategies measured 
by the CERQ are gender-invariant, although women are more likely than men to use adaptive cognitive emo-
tion regulation  strategies51. In addition to these heterogenous results, some authors have pointed out that the 
relationship between the use of emotional regulation strategies and emotional disorders might not be the same 
for men and  women52,53. In this puzzle of diverse results, in which not only cognitive or neurological but also 
cultural aspects have an influence, we find that from the point of view of the subjects, there are no differences 
in the cognitive regulation styles of men and women. In our study, male and female subjects showed the same 
two cognitive regulation styles, differentiated by the greater use of the most adaptive strategies. In addition, 
while the Vulnerable style described most of the men, in women the Protective style predominated – a result that 
is consistent with the evidence indicating that women tend to score higher in emotional  intelligence54–56 and 
interpersonal  competence57–59.

Although the cognitive coping groups showed identical clustering in men and women, a remarkable gender 
difference emerged. Specifically, men who fit the Protective style were significantly more likely to blame others 
than men allocated to the Vulnerable style (see Table 5). This issue, located in the cognitive coping groups of men, 
contrasts with the evidence that places this strategy among the least adaptive and relates it to the presence of 
psychopathy  traits51,60–63, pointing again to the consideration already raised that the degree to which a regulatory 
strategy is adaptive depends not only on its nature but also on its flexible use and effective implementation by the 
 individual14–17. Thus, while the rigid use of the Blaming Others strategy could generate maladaptive consequences 
for the individual, our study suggests that, in the broader context of a healthy and complex style of cognitive 
regulation, the use of this strategy could be “protective” for the user. Blaming Others is a strategy that involves 
externalizing responsibility, thus helping to avoid the emergence of negative emotions (e.g., guilt or shame)64 
and to preserve the positive self-concept that the person has of  himself65,66. In addition, Blaming Others is the 
strategy most linked to interpersonal relationships, as some authors have already pointed  out60. This uniqueness 
puts us on the track of considering gender differences from the point of view of “the Other”. Recourse to Blaming 
Others might be more available to those people who have less of a tendency to put themselves in the shoes of the 
other, that is, to feel empathy. Empathy is a complex emotion that involves being able to share another person’s 
emotional state and mental perspective. This emotion traditionally shows higher levels in women, particularly in 
studies based on self-reported  measures67–69. In turn, impassivity, a contrast factor to empathy defined as a lack of 
solidarity with and sensitivity to others, is a key factor in the research on gender  differences70. Thus, although we 
cannot explain the reasons for the observed difference in the use of Blaming Others on the part of the men who fit 
the Protective style, based on previous research, we can hypothesize that a higher sensitivity to the perspectives 
of others and their feelings, usually found in women, may be underlying this gender singularity, which allows 
men to have one more strategy in their adaptive style of cognitive emotion regulation.

Gender differences were also found in the relationship between cognitive coping styles and adult attachment 
dimensions. As can be seen in Table 5, attachment dimensions were significantly related to the cognitive emotion 
regulation clusters of women, but they were not significant for men. Specifically, women who showed anxious or 
avoidant attachment in their relationships were more likely to be included in the Vulnerable cognitive emotion 
regulation group. That is, interpersonal attachment emerged as a more relevant factor in the cognitive emotional 
regulation processes of women than in those of men. The motives for this connection remain unclear, but we 
can hypothesize that this difference may be reinforced by the influence of cultural gender stereotypes. Parents 
socialize their sons and daughters according to culturally prescribed gender roles, which helps to explain why, as 
children become more aware of their images, sex role stereotypes, and expectations, these differences  increase71. 
In most cultures, women, more than men, are required to attend to the perspectives of others and to take care 
of others’ interests and desires, which may help to explain the higher interrelation, observed in our study, 
between their interpersonal attachment insecurities and their cognitive emotion regulation style. In this sense, 
interpersonal attachment style could be acting in women as a source of additional affective information that, 
together with the rest of their emotional resources, contributes to the selection of a specific regulatory  style16,72. 
This normalized dynamic could be altered in insecure attachment styles; in people with these attachment styles, 
the associated cognitive biases (e.g., cognitive and emotional distancing in avoidant attachment, or negative 
evaluation and high emotional reactivity in anxious attachment) would act as a contextual factor, favouring the 
selection of a higher-risk emotional regulation style, i.e., the Vulnerable style.

In sum, our research confirms that women and men display similar cognitive emotion regulation styles and 
that cognitive strategies considered more adaptive (Acceptance, Positive Refocusing, Refocus on Planning, Posi-
tive Reappraisal, and Putting into Perspective) play a decisive role that predicts their belonging to one or another 
cognitive emotion regulation style. In turn, although our work does not provide an explanation for some of the 
observed gender differences, it does highlight some interesting points that may improve our understanding of 
them. First, although the styles of cognitive emotion regulation were similar in women and men, men apparently 
presented a wider range of adaptive strategies by including “Blaming Others” in the Protective style of cognitive 
emotion regulation strategies. Second, the cognitive emotion regulation styles of men were more independent 
of their interpersonal affective system than was the case in women, which may be related to the gender differ-
ences observed in the socio-cognitive development of women and men in most cultures. The observed gender 
differences highlight the style of bonding, with the couple as a factor of special relevance in the dynamics of 
the emotional regulation of women. In this sense, our results suggest the relevance of considering the extent to 
which toxic and abusive romantic relationships may affect the individual’s cognitive way of dealing with threats 
or challenges.
