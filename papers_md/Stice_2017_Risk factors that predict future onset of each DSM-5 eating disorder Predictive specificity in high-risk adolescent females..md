Risk Factors that Predict Future Onset of Each DSM-5 Eating 
Disorder: Predictive Specificity in High-Risk Adolescent Females

Abstract

Objective—Because no single report has examined risk factors that predict future onset each 
type of eating disorder and core symptom dimensions that crosscut disorders, we addressed these 
aims to advance knowledge regarding risk factor specificity.

Method—Data from 3 prevention trials that targeted young women with body dissatisfaction 
(N=1272; M age 18.5, SD 4.2) and collected annual diagnostic interview data over 3-year follow-
up were combined to identify predictors of subthreshold/threshold anorexia nervosa (AN), bulimia 
nervosa (BN), binge eating disorder (BED), and purging disorder (PD).

Results—Negative affect and functional impairment predicted onset of all eating disorders. Thin-
ideal internalization, body dissatisfaction, dieting, overeating, and mental health care predicted 
onset of subthreshold/threshold BN, BED, and PD; positive thinness expectations, denial of cost of 
pursuing the thin ideal, and fasting predicted onset of 2 of these 3 disorders. Similar risk factors 
predicted core eating disorder symptom onset. Low BMI and dieting specifically predicted onset 
of subthreshold/threshold AN or low BMI. Only a subset of factors showed unique predictive 
effects in multivariate models, likely due to moderate correlations between the risk factors (M r = .
14).

Conclusions—Results provide support for the theory that pursuit of the thin ideal and the 
resulting body dissatisfaction, dieting, and unhealthy weight control behaviors increase risk for 
binge/purge spectrum eating disorders, but suggest that youth who are inherently lean, rather than 
purposely pursuing the thin ideal, are at risk for AN. Impaired interpersonal functioning and 
negative affect are transdiagnostic risk factors, suggesting these factors should be targeted in 
prevention programs.

General Scientific Summary

Findings suggest that pursuit of the thin beauty ideal and the resulting body dissatisfaction and 
weight control behaviors increase risk for developing eating disorders involving binge eating and 
unhealthy weight control behaviors, but that inherently lean young women, rather than those 
purposely pursuing the thin ideal, are at risk for eating disorders involving a dangerously low body 
weight. Findings also suggest that negative affect and impaired interpersonal functioning are 
transdiagnostic factors that increase risk for the full spectrum of eating disorders.

Eating disorders affect 13% of females (Allen, Byrne, Oddy, & Crosby, 2013; Stice, Marti, 
& Rohde, 2013a) and are marked by chronicity, relapse, distress, functional impairment, and 
risk for future obesity, depression, suicide, substance abuse, and mortality (Arcelus, 
Mitchell, Wales, & Nielsen, 2011; Swanson, Crow, Le Grange, Swendsen, & Merikangas, 
2011). However, few studies have evaluated risk factors that predict future onset of each 
DSM-5 (American Psychiatric Association, 2013) eating disorder using validated diagnostic 
interviews, which is vital because this design provides definitive evidence that the risk 
factors predate onset of the disorder (Kraemer, Stice, Kazdin, & Kupfer, 2001). Although 
prospective studies have predicted future increases in eating disorder symptom composite 
measures (e.g., Stice, 2001; Vohs Bardone, Joiner, Abramson, & Heatherton, 2001), they 
provide less definitive evidence of temporal precedence and can be challenging to interpret 
because symptoms often decrease over time and it is not clear that the models are predicting 
emergence of clinically significant eating pathology. Studies have also predicted future onset 
of individual eating disorder symptoms (e.g., Pearson, Combs, Zapolski, & Smith, 2012; 
Goldschmidt, Wall, Loth, Le Grange, & Neumark-Sztainer, 2012), which provides clear 
evidence of temporal precedence, but the clinical significance of individual eating disorder 
symptoms has not been well established. Another limitation of this literature is that many 
studies have not used diagnostic interviews, which is concerning because many researchers 
view diagnostic interviews as the gold standard. An improved understanding of risk factors 
that predict onset of each DSM-5 eating disorder will inform etiologic theory for each 
disorder, inform content for prevention programs tailored for the various eating disorders, 
which would be indicated if they have distinct risk factors, determine which high-risk 
subgroups to target with selective prevention programs for each disorder, and potentially 
identify transdiagnostic risk factors.

Only one study examined factors that predicted future onset of interview-assessed 
subthreshold/threshold anorexia nervosa (sAN/AN) among participants confirmed to be 
disorder-free at baseline. Low body mass index (BMI) and low dieting during early 
adolescence predicted sAN/AN over 5-year follow-up in a community sample of females 
who were in early adolescence at baseline, but early puberty, pressure for thinness, thin-ideal 
internalization, body dissatisfaction, negative affect, or social support deficits did not (Stice 
& Bohon, 2013). Findings from risk factor studies are summarized in Table 1.

Five studies examined factors that predicted future onset of interview-assessed subthreshold/
threshold bulimia nervosa (sBN/BN), all of which involved community samples of 
adolescent girls. Dieting predicted onset of sBN/BN onset over 1-year follow-up (Patton, 
Johnson-Sabine, Wood, Mann, & Wakeling, 1990). Weight concerns, drive for thinness, 
body dissatisfaction, ineffectiveness, negative affectivity, dieting, and alcohol use, and low 
interoceptive awareness predicted onset of sBN/BN over 4-year follow-up, but 
perfectionism, maturity fears, interpersonal distrust, and BMI did not (Killen et al., 1996).

Dieting and psychiatric problems predicted BN onset over 3-year follow-up, but peer 
dieting, BMI, daily exercise, and parental separation did not (Patton, Selzer, Coffey, Carlin, 
& Wolfe, 1999). Elevated BMI, social pressure for thinness, thin-ideal internalization, 
dieting, fasting, negative affect, social support deficits, and early puberty predicted onset of 
sBN/BN over 5-year follow-up, but body dissatisfaction did not (Stice, Davis, Miller, & 
Marti, 2008a; Stice & Bohon, 2013). Social pressure to be thin and body dissatisfaction 
predicted onset of sBN/BN over a longer 7-year follow-up in the same sample, but thin-ideal 
internalization, dieting, negative affect, or depressive symptoms did not (Stice, Marti, & 
Durant, 2011a).

Only one study each examined factors that predicted future onset of subthreshold/threshold 
binge eating disorder (sBED/BED) and purging disorder (PD), both of which used the same 
community sample of females who were in early adolescence at baseline. Social pressure for 
thinness predicted onset of sBED/BED over 7-year follow-up, but thin-ideal internalization, 
body dissatisfaction, dieting, or negative affect did not (Stice et al., 2011a). Thin-ideal 
internalization, body dissatisfaction, and dieting predicted PD onset over 7-year follow-up, 
but social pressure to be thin, negative affect, and depressive symptoms did not (Stice et al., 
2011a).

Thus, no single report has investigated risk factors that predict future onset of each major 
DSM-5 eating disorder, which limits knowledge about risk factor specificity. Indeed, only 
four prospective studies have contributed to this literature, underscoring the need to expand 
this evidence-base. Equally striking, only one prospective study investigated risk factors that 
predict onset of AN, BED, and PD. The low incidence of certain eating disorders, 
particularly AN, has contributed to this lacuna. For instance, one of the largest prospective 
studies did not identify a single participant who showed AN onset (McKnight Investigators, 
2003). One solution is to use a high-risk design wherein participants at elevated risk for 
mental health disorders are followed. Prospective high-risk designs have been used to 
elucidate risk factors for a variety of disorders, such as depression (LeMoult, Ordaz, 
Kircanski, Singh, & Gotlib, 2015), anxiety disorders (Schmidt, Lerew, & Jackson, 1999), 
substance abuse (Chassin, Pitts, DeLucia, & Todd, 1999), and psychosis (Cannon et al., 
2008). One previous study used this approach for eating disorders (Jacobi et al., 2011), 
though not all diagnoses were confirmed by interview and the small sample size precluded 
the ability to examine risk factors for each type of eating disorder. Accordingly, the present 
study combined data from three large randomized eating disorder prevention trials that used 
parallel recruitment and assessment procedures, which increased sensitivity to detecting risk 
factors that predict future onset of eating pathology. The goal was to test whether a set of 
factors assessed at baseline predicted future onset of eating disorders and the core eating 
disorder symptom dimensions that crosscut different diagnostic categories over 3-year 
follow-up.

We investigated a range of factors that have been theorized to increase risk for eating 
disorders in several univariate and multivariate etiologic models (e.g., Hohlstein, Smith, & 
Atlas, 1998; Lavender et al., 2016; McCarthy 1990; Stice, 2001). For instance, the dual 
pathway model posits that elevated cultural pressure for thinness and internalization of the 
thin ideal promotes body dissatisfaction, which in turn contributes to unhealthy weight

control behaviors (e.g., meal skipping) and negative affect, which both increase risk for 
emergence of binge eating and compensatory weight control behaviors (Stice, 2001). We 
hypothesized that baseline elevations in thin-ideal internalization, positive expectances 
regarding thinness, denial of costs of pursuing the thin ideal, and body dissatisfaction would 
increase risk for onset of disorders marked by use of weight loss behaviors, including AN, 
BN, and PD. We further hypothesized that baseline elevations in weight control behaviors, 
dieting, and negative affect would increase risk for onset of disorders characterized by binge 
eating, including AN, BN, and BED. We hypothesized that functional impairment and 
mental health care, which may represent proxy measures of general psychopathology, may 
be transdiagnostic risk factors that increase risk for any eating disorder. Based on past 
findings, we also hypothesized that a low BMI at baseline would increase risk for onset of 
AN, but a high BMI at baseline would increase risk for BN and BED, as it might be a proxy 
measure for a tendency toward dysregulated eating.

We also investigated the predictive effects of prodromal eating disorder symptoms, based on 
evidence that fasting predicted BN (Stice et al., 2008a). Specifically, we tested the 
hypotheses that overeating, fasting, and excessive exercise would predict onset of syndromal 
eating disorders. Such analyses are useful because it is possible that the emergence of one of 
these prodromal symptoms reliably predicts emergence of eating disorders, serving as a 
“gateway” to the full syndrome. However, it is important to consider the partial criterion 
confounding when interpreting any predictive effects of prodromal symptoms.

We estimated models that predicted onset of subthrehold or threshold eating disorders, as 
well as onset of threshold eating disorders, because individuals with threshold versus 
subthreshold levels of BN and BED showed similar functional impairment, emotional 
distress, and treatment care (Stice, Marti, Shaw, & Jaconis, 2009). This is also important 
because many individuals who seek treatment meet criteria for subthreshold rather than 
threshold eating disorders (Eddy, Celio, Hoste, Herzog, & Le Grange, 2008). A related 
lacuna is that only four studies reported descriptive data about progression from 
subthreshold to threshold levels of an eating disorder, which should also advance knowledge 
of etiologic processes; an average of 4% of young women with subthreshold AN progressed 
to threshold AN during follow-up, 25% of young women with subthreshold BN progressed 
to threshold BN during follow-up, and 21% of young woman with subthreshold BED 
progressed to threshold BED over follow-up (Lewinsohn et al., 2000; Patton et al., 1990; 
Stice et al., 2009, 2013). However, because those studies had small numbers of participants 
with subthreshold eating disorders, we also reported diagnostic progression for each eating 
disorder in the present study.

Finally, scholars have called for research on behavioral and cognitive symptom dimensions 
that crosscut psychiatric diagnoses (Sanislow et al., 2010), consistent with the Research 
Domain Criteria (RDoC) perspective. Studies using a wide variety of analytic approaches 
conducted over the last two decades suggest that eating pathology occurs along a continuum 
(Luo, Donnellan, Burt, & Klump, in press; Olatunji et al., 2012; Stice, Killen, Hayward, & 
Taylor, 1998; Tylka & Subich, 2003). Accordingly, we also investigated baseline factors that 
predicted onset of core symptom dimensions that crosscut eating disorders, including binge

low body weight.

Methods

Participants and Procedures

We combined data from one efficacy trial (Trial 1; Stice, Marti, Spoor, Presnell, & Shaw, 
2008b) and two effectiveness trials (Trial 2; Stice, Rohde, Shaw, & Gau, 2011b; Trial 3; 
Stice, Rohde, Butryn, Shaw, & Marti, 2015) resulting in a sample of 1,272 participants.

Design of Randomized Prevention Trials

Measures

Mailings and fliers recruited female students for trials evaluating body acceptance 
interventions at high schools (Trial 1 and 2) and colleges (Trial 1 and 3). There was only one 
inclusion criterion: that participants answer affirmatively when asked if they had body image 
concerns during a phone screen. Regarding exclusion criteria, we sought to exclude 
participants who met criteria for DSM-IV (American Psychiatric Association, 2000) AN or 
BN, though analyses of the baseline diagnostic interview data indicated that we were not 
entirely successful (see below). Informed consent was obtained from participants (and 
parents if minors). Trial 1 participants were randomized to the Body Project eating disorder 
prevention program, Healthy Weight eating disorder prevention program, an expressive 
writing intervention, or assessment-only control condition. Trial 2 and 3 participants were 
randomized to the Body Project or educational brochure control condition. Participants 
completed surveys and interviews at baseline and at 1-, 6-, 12-, 24-, and 36-month follow-
up. Additional details can be found in Stice et al. (2008b, 2011b, 2015).

Eating pathology—The semi-structured Eating Disorder Diagnostic Interview (EDDI; 
Stice et al., 2013a) assessed eating disorder symptoms over the past 3 months at baseline and 
since previous interview at follow-ups on a month-by-month basis. DSM-5 criteria for eating 
disorders, as operationalized in Stice et al. (2013a), were used (see Table 2 for definitions). 
However, we operationalized subthreshold AN following Stice et al. (2009) because it 
represents a subthreshold version that more closely parallels AN (overweight and obese 
participants can be diagnosed with atypical AN per DSM-5) and because we did not collect 
data on weight loss history, making it impossible to diagnose atypical AN. We also predicted 
onset of recurrent (2 or more episodes) binge eating, recurrent compensatory behaviors, and 
diagnostic threshold levels of overvaluation of weight/shape and fear of weight gain/obesity. 
With regard to prodromal symptoms, Overeating included counts of eating rapidly, eating 
until uncomfortably full, eating large amounts when not hungry, eating alone due to 
embarrassment, feeling depressed or guilty after overeating, and feeling upset that you could 
not control overeating, Fasting reflected the number of times per week in past three months 
two meals in a row were skipped to “as a means of controlling your shape or weight” and 
Excessive exercise reflected the number of times per week in the past 3 months of vigorous 
exercise for more than an hour or moderate exercise for more than 2 hours was used “to 
compensate for overeating”. EDDI eating disorder diagnoses have shown 1-week test-retest 
reliability (κ = .79) and inter-rater agreement (κ = .75) for DSM-5 eating disorders,

sensitivity to intervention effects, and participants with versus without EDDI-diagnosed 
eating disorders show greater functional impairment, emotional distress, and treatment care 
(Stice et al., 2008b, 2009, 2013a, 2013b).

Thin ideal internalization—The Ideal-Body Stereotype Scale–Revised assessed thin-
ideal internalization (Stice et al., 2008b). It has shown internal consistency (α = .91), 2-week 
test–retest reliability (r = .80), predictive validity for bulimic symptom onset, and sensitivity 
to intervention effects (Stice et al., 2008b).

Positive thinness expectancies—The Thinness Expectancy scale (Hohlstein et al., 
1998) assessed expected social and psychological benefits of thinness. It has shown internal 
consistency (α = .86) and predictive validity for body dissatisfaction onset (Stice & 
Whitenton, 2002).

Denial of costs of pursuing thin ideal—We created 5 items assessing denial of costs 
associated with pursuing the thin ideal (sample item: The risks associated with severe 
dieting are overrated). This scale has shown internal consistency (α = .82), 1-week test-
retest reliability (r = .87), and predictive validity for eating disorder onset (Stice, Rohde, 
Gau, & Shaw, 2012).

Body dissatisfaction—The Body Dissatisfaction Scale (Stice et al., 2001) assessed 
dissatisfaction with 9 body parts. It has shown internal consistency (α = .94), 3-week test–
retest reliability (r = .90), predictive validity for eating disorder onset, and sensitivity to 
intervention effects (Stice et al., 2008b, 2011a).

Weight control behaviors—We used the Weight Control scale to assess reported dietary 
and exercise behaviors used to control weight (sample item: I have eaten more fruits and 
vegetables). This scale showed internally consistent (α = .82), 4-week test-retest (r = .63), 
and sensitivity to intervention effects (Stice, Presnell, Gau, & Shaw, 2007).

Dieting—The Dutch Restrained Eating Scale (van Strien, Frijters, van Staveren, Defares, & 
Deurenberg, 1986) assesses the frequency of various dieting behaviors. It has shown internal 
consistency (α = .95), 2-week test–retest reliability (r = .82), convergent validity with self-
reported (but not objectively measured) caloric intake, predictive validity for bulimic 
symptoms, and sensitivity to intervention effects (Stice et al., 2008b; van Strien et al., 1986).

Negative affect—Different measures of negative affect were used in each trial and were 
standardized to permit analyses of the combined data set. In Trial 1 negative affect was 
assessed with the sadness, guilt, and fear/anxiety subscales from the Positive Affect and 
Negative Affect Scale-Revised (PANAS-X; Watson & Clark, 1992), which has shown 
internal consistency (α = .95), 3-week test-retest reliability (r = .78), predictive validity for 
bulimic symptom onset, and sensitivity to detecting intervention effects (Stice et al., 2008b). 
In Trial 2 negative affect was assessed with the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-
Depression Scale (CESD; Radloff, 1977), which has shown internal consistency (α = .74 – .
91), temporal reliability (2- to 8-week test-retest r = .51 – .59), and convergent validity with 
clinician ratings of depressive symptoms (M r = .88; Andrews, Lewinsohn, Hops, & Roberts,

1993; Roberts, Lewinsohn, & Seeley, 1991). In Trial 3 negative affect was assessed with the 
21-item Beck Depression Inventory (Beck et al., 1988), which has shown internal 
consistency (α = .73-.95), 1-week test-retest reliability (r = .93), convergent validity with 
clinician ratings of depressive symptoms, and sensitivity to intervention effects (M r = .75; 
Beck et al., 1988; Stice et al., 2015).

Functional impairment—Impairment in the family, peer group, romantic, and school 
domains was measured with 17 items from the Social Adjustment Scale-Self Report for 
Youth (Weismann & Bothwell, 1976). The original scale has shown convergent validity with 
clinician and collateral ratings (M r = .72) and sensitivity to detecting treatment effects 
(Weismann & Bothwell, 1976). The 17-item version has shown internal consistency (α = .
77), 1-week test–retest reliability (r = .83) and sensitivity to intervention effects (Stice et al., 
2008b).

Mental health care—Use of mental health services was operationalized as the frequency 
of visits to mental health care providers. Receipt of care in the last 6-months was coded “1” 
and no health care coded “0”. This item showed 1-year test-retest reliability (r = .89) and 
differentiate individuals with versus without eating disorders (Stice et al., 2008b; Stice et al., 
2013a).

Body mass—The BMI (kg/m2; Pietrobelli et al., 1998) was examined as a baseline 
predictor of eating disorder onset and used to diagnose AN. Height was measured to the 
nearest mm using portable stadiometers. Weight was assessed to the nearest 0.1 kg using 
digital scales with participants wearing light indoor clothing without shoes or coats. Age- 
and sex-adjusted BMI centiles were used to determine whether participants were 
underweight for AN. Height and weight were measured twice at each assessment, to reduce 
errors, and averaged. BMI has shown convergent validity (r = .80 – .90) with direct measures 
of body fat (Pietrobelli et al., 1998).

Statistical Methods

Cox proportional hazard models estimated with SAS PHREG (SAS Institute Inc., 2011) 
tested which baseline risk factors predict onset of (a) subthreshold/threshold eating 
disorders, (b) threshold eating disorders, and (c) eating disorder symptoms. Participants who 
met criteria for the outcomes at baseline were excluded from the Cox models. Each risk 
factor was first tested in separate models and then significant predictors were entered 
simultaneously to assess unique effects. All risk factors were converted to z-scores so hazard 
ratios could be interpreted as the difference in risk at each time point associated with a one 
standard deviation change in the risk factor. To isolate risk factor effects from intervention 
effects, dummy coded vectors of intervention condition were included as covariates. The 
Breslow (1974) method was used to handle tied event times in the hazard models. A 
transform of the Martingale residuals evaluated the proportional hazards assumption. If this 
assumption was not met models were re-estimated with covariate interactions with time 
included as predictors. Missing onset data were accounted for with right-censoring in the 
hazard models and 20 imputed data sets were used to account for missing risk factor data. 
Sequential regression multiple imputation (SRMI; van Burren, 2007) was used to impute

Results

Preliminary Analyses

Table 3 provides demographic data for the present sample and compares it to a 
representative sample of age-matched young women recruited from middle schools on 
demographic factors and study variables that were assessed in both studies. The mean body 
dissatisfaction score from our high-risk sample was 0.6 standard deviation (SD) higher than 
the mean body dissatisfaction score from a representative sample of adolescent girls (Rohde 
et al., 2015), mean thin-ideal internalization score was 0.6 SD higher, mean dieting score 
was 0.7 SD higher, mean overeating score was 1.2 SDs higher, mean fasting score was 0.1 
SD higher, mean excessive exercise score was 0.1 SD higher, and mean functional 
impairment was 0.2 SD lower. Data suggest that the sample used in the present study was at 
moderately higher risk, suggesting that results may generalize to the broader population of 
adolescent girls and young women. A related question is whether there was a restriction in 
range for the risk factors, which could reduce sensitivity. Table 3 indicates that although 
some variables had a smaller SD in the present high-risk sample compared to the 
representative community-recruited sample, this was not the case for all variables examined. 
Moreover, the fact that such a high percentage of risk factors exhibited significant predictive 
effects (see below) implies we had sufficient sensitivity.

Attrition for diagnostic data, which are the only data examined from each follow-up 
assessment, was 2% at posttest, 7% a 6-months, 6% at 1-year, 7% at 2-year, and 14% at 3-
year follow-up. All but one case completed the full baseline assessment and 99% completed 
at least one follow-up (M = 5.3 of 6 assessments, SD = 0.9). Incidence rates for subthreshold 
and threshold levels of each disorder and core symptom dimensions over follow-up are 
shown in Table 4. Incidence rates were 9% for any threshold level disorder, 15% for any 
subthreshold disorder, and 52% for any core symptom dimension.

Rates of diagnostic progression, which is defined as a subthreshold level disorder that 
escalates to threshold level at a later date, was 5% for AN, 40% for BN, 46% for BED, and 
33% for PD. Participants who only experienced a subthreshold eating disorder after 
experiencing a full threshold eating disorder are not included in these analyses.

We tested whether participants with subthrehold versus threshold levels of each eating 
disorder differed significantly in terms of negative affect and functional impairment, as few 
studies have tested whether these groups show similar impairment. Negative affect and 
functional impairment scores reported closest to onset of each disorder were compared. 
Negative affect scores between subthreshold and threshold cases did not significantly differ 
(all p-values > .214) and were associated with small effect sizes differences for BN (d = .07), 
BED (d = 0.24), and PD (d = .01). Negative affect scores for subthreshold AN (Mean = 0.10, 
SD = 1.07) versus threshold AN (Mean = 1.30, SD = 1.13) significantly differed (t-value = 
2.54, p-value = .018, d = 1.11). Functional impairment scores between subthreshold and

threshold cases did not significantly differ (all p-values > .134) and were associated with 
small effect size differences for AN, BN, BED, and PD (Cohen’s d’s .24, .27, .11, and .10, 
respectively).

Correlations between baseline risk factors are shown in Table 5. The average correlation 
among risk factors was r = .14 (range = .01 – .54).

Univariate Predictors of Specific Eating Disorders

We first tested in Cox proportional hazard moderation models whether the relation between 
the risk factors targeted in the Body Project prevention program (thin-ideal internalization, 
thinness expectancies, denial of thin-ideal costs) showed significantly different relations 
with eating disorder onset among Body Project versus control participants. This was 
necessary because an assumption of combining the data from these trials is that condition 
did not moderate the predictive effects of the risk factors targeted in the prevention 
programs. We likewise tested whether the relation between the risk factor targeted in the 
Healthy Weight prevention program (weight control behaviors) showed significantly 
different relations with eating disorder onset among Healthy Weight versus control 
participants. No significant interactive effects were found (all p-values > .098).

Table 6 reports results from the univariate Cox proportional hazard models predicting onset 
of future subthreshold or threshold eating disorders. Functional impairment and lower BMI 
at baseline predicted future onset of sAN/AN. Greater thin-ideal internalization, thinness 
expectancy, denial of costs of pursuing the thin ideal, body dissatisfaction, dieting, negative 
affect, overeating, fasting, functional impairment, and mental health care predicted future 
onset of sBN/BN. Greater thin-ideal internalization, thinness expectancy, body 
dissatisfaction, dieting, negative affect, overeating, functional impairment, and mental health 
care predicted future onset of sBED/BED. Greater thin-ideal internalization, thinness 
expectancies, denial of costs of pursuing the thin ideal, body dissatisfaction, dieting, 
negative affect, overeating, fasting, excessive exercise, functional impairment, and mental 
health care predicted future onset of sPD/PD.

Table 7 reports results from univariate Cox proportional hazard models were also used to 
predict future onset of threshold eating disorders. Significant baseline risk factors were 
similar to those predicting onset of subthreshold/threshold eating disorders. Differences 
were that negative affect was a predictor for onset of AN (p = .014), but not sAN/AN (p = .
534); denial costs was a predictor for onset BED (p = .007), but not sBED/BED (p = .143); 
thinness expectancy was a predictor for onset of sBED/BED (p = .028), but not BED (p = .
056); and fasting and excessive exercise were predictors for onset of sPD/PD (p’s = .001 
and .017, respectively), but not for PD (p’s = .078 and .706). No differences in predictors for 
sBN/BN versus BN were found.

Table 8 shows results from the univariate Cox proportional hazard models predicting future 
onset of core eating disorder symptoms. Greater thin-ideal internalization, thinness 
expectancy, denial costs of thin ideal pursuit, body dissatisfaction, dieting, negative affect, 
overeating, excessive exercise, functional impairment, and mental health care predicted 
binge eating onset. Similar risk factors predicted compensatory behavior onset, with the

exception that the effect for denial of the costs of thin ideal pursuit was non-significant and 
weight control behaviors was significant. Similar risk factors also predicted onset of 
overvaluation of weight or shape, except that thin ideal internalization, denial of costs of thin 
ideal pursuit, and mental health care were non-significant, and fasting was significant. 
Finally, similar risk factors predicted onset of fear of gaining weight, except fasting was 
significant. Unlike the other symptoms, current BMI was only assessed at each assessment, 
not on a month-by-month basis over follow-up. Thus, logistic regression models were used 
to assess whether baseline risk factors predicted onset of low BMI at any follow-up 
assessment. Lower baseline dieting scores (OR = 0.67, 95% CI [0.47, 0.97], p = .033) and 
lower BMI (OR = 0.03, 95% CI [0.01, 0.10], p < .0001) predicted low BMI onset.

Multivariate Predictors of Specific Eating Disorders

Multivariate models predicting onset of future subthreshold or threshold eating disorders, 
which included risk factors with significant univariate effects, revealed that elevated 
functional impairment (HR = 1.64, 95% CI [1.10, 2.44], p = .0142) and lower BMI (HR = 
0.06, 95% CI [0.02, 0.14], p < .0001) remained unique predictors of sAN/AN onset. 
Elevated dieting (HR = 1.45, 95% CI [1.12, 1.88], p = .0048), negative affect (HR = 1.46, 
95% CI [1.19, 1.79], p = .0003), and overeating (HR = 1.78, 95% CI [1.48, 2.13], p < .0001) 
showed unique predictive effects for sBN/BN onset. Elevated thin-ideal internalization (HR 
= 1.36, 95% CI [1.05, 1.75], p = .0184), body dissatisfaction (HR = 1.71, 95% CI [1.31, 
2.23], p < .0001), and functional impairment (HR = 1.31, 95% CI [1.04, 1.65], p = .0209) 
showed unique predictive effects for sBED/BED onset. Elevated body dissatisfaction (HR = 
1.63, 95% CI [1.21, 2.18], p = .0012), dieting (HR = 2.24, 95% CI [1.66, 3.03], p < .0001), 
and overeating (HR = 1.25, 95% CI [1.03, 1.52], p = .0224) showed unique predictive effects 
for sPD/PD onset.

Multivariate models predicting onset of future threshold eating disorders, which included 
risk factors that showed significant univariate effects, revealed that elevated negative affect 
(HR = 2.24, 95% CI [1.25, 3.99], p = .0064) and lower BMI (HR = 0.63, 95% CI [0.44, 
0.91], p < .0135) showed unique predictive effects for AN onset. Elevated body 
dissatisfaction (HR = 1.50, 95% CI [1.08, 2.08], p = .0166), overeating (HR = 2.07, 95% CI 
[1.65, 2.61], p < .0001), and fasting (HR = 1.29, 95% CI [1.08, 1.53], p = .0046) showed 
unique predictive effects for BN onset. Elevated body dissatisfaction (HR = 1.49, 95% CI 
[1.07, 2.06], p = .0167), overeating (HR = 1.99, 95% CI [1.59, 2.49], p < .0001), and 
functional impairment (HR = 1.40, 95% CI [1.07, 1.83], p = .0142) showed unique 
predictive effects for BED onset. Elevated body dissatisfaction (HR = 1.88, 95% CI [1.29, 
2.72], p = .0009) and dieting (HR = 1.94, 95% CI [1.35, 2.79], p = .0003) showed unique 
predictive effects for PD onset.

Multivariate models predicting onset of future eating disorder symptoms, which included 
risk factors that showed significant univariate effects, revealed that elevated dieting (HR =

(HR = 1.24, 95% CI [1.03, 1.49], p = .0220), showed unique predictive effects for onset of 
fear of weight gain/obesity. Lower baseline BMI (HR = 0.03, 95% CI [0.01, 0.11], p < .
0001) showed a unique predictive effect for onset of low BMI.

Discussion

Thin-ideal internalization, positive expectancies for thinness, body dissatisfaction, dieting, 
overeating, and mental health care predicted onset of BN, BED, and PD, and denial of costs 
of pursuing the thin ideal and fasting predicted onset of two of these three disorders. Results 
for the first four risk factors largely converge with prior prospective studies that identified 
predictors of future onset of subthreshold/threshold BN, BED, and PD (Table 1) and provide 
support for the theory that pursuit of the culturally sanctioned thin ideal and the resulting 
body dissatisfaction, dieting, and maladaptive weight control behaviors increase risk for 
eating disorders involving binge eating and unhealthy compensatory behaviors. The overlap 
in predictors of BN, BED, and PD is striking, as each of these risk factors predicted onset of 
two or three of these eating disorders and no examined risk factor was specific to only one of 
these eating disorders classes.

Few studies have tested whether prodromal symptoms predict onset of syndromal eating 
disorders. The predictive relation between fasting and onset of binge-spectrum eating 
disorders converges with past findings (Stice et al., 2008a), but the effects for overeating and 
excessive exercise are novel. When interpreting the prodromal effects, it should be noted that 
there was partial criterion confounding, in that fasting and excessive exercise can be 
diagnostic features of AN, BN, and PD, and that three of the six overeating questions must 
be endorsed for a BED diagnosis. The former might have contributed to the relation of 
fasting and excessive exercise to BN onset and the relation of fasting to PD onset, but could 
not explain the relation of excessive exercise to BED onset. Moreover, if criterion 
confounding were solely driving the results, fasting and excessive exercise should have 
predicted onset of AN, but they did not. The latter criterion confounding could have 
contributed to the relation of overeating to BED onset, but could not explain why overeating 
predicted onset of BN and PD, as those overeating features are not required for these two 
diagnoses. The fact that it took 11.5 months on average to show onset of BED also implies 
that participants did not simply show a small increase in binge eating to fulfill BED criteria. 
Further, all of the participants at baseline who endorsed overeating did not met criteria for 
the other symptoms of each of the eating disorders; as such participants were excluded from 
survival models. Although effect sizes were generally small, overeating showed the largest

predictive effects for BN and BED. Data imply that it might be useful for indicated 
prevention programs to focus on individuals with prodromal eating disorder symptoms.

Negative affect and impaired psychosocial functioning were the only risk factors that 
predicted onset of all four eating disorders. The former finding provides support for etiologic 
models that posit that negative affect increases risk for binge eating and compensatory 
weight control behaviors (Lavender et al., 2016; Stice, 2001). Theoretically, negative affect 
increases the reward value of high-calorie foods and binge eating improves mood 
(Lemmens, Rutters, Born, & Westerterp-Plantenga, 2011; Stice, 2001). Negative affect may 
also increase the likelihood of unhealthy weight control behaviors because they reduce 
anxiety about excess body fat. For others, negative affect may reduce appetite, contributing 
to unhealthy weight loss. The finding that impaired psychosocial functioning increased risk 
for all eating disorders is noteworthy because etiologic theory has not implicated this risk 
factor. Yet this finding converges with evidence that social withdrawal predicted onset of any 
eating disorder (except AN) over 3–20 year follow-up (Allen, Byrne, Oddy, Schmidt, & 
Crosby, 2014). Data suggest that impaired functioning precedes onset of the disorders 
examined herein and thus may play a role in the development of the full spectrum of eating 
disorders. Impaired functioning may contribute to negative affect, which could increase risk 
for binge eating, compensatory behaviors, and under-nutrition for the reasons enumerated 
above.

This is the first study to find that mental health care predicts onset of eating disorders. It is 
unlikely that mental health care prompts eating disorder onset. Rather, receiving mental 
health care may be a proxy risk factor for comorbid psychopathology (e.g., it is possible that 
mood and anxiety disorders contribute to mental health care and also increase risk for eating 
disorders).

One striking findings is that low BMI, low dieting, negative affect, and functional 
impairment predicted onset of AN and a low BMI, whereas the risk factors relating to 
cultural pressures for thinness and resulting body dissatisfaction and weight control 
behaviors did not. The evidence that a low BMI predicted onset of AN and a low BMI, 
which was the largest effect, and the evidence that low dieting predicted onset of a low BMI, 
converges with evidence that low BMI and low dieting predicted future onset of AN in the 
only other prospective study of risk factors for AN onset (Stice & Bohon, 2013). The earlier 
study used data from a community sample of adolescent girls followed over 5-years (early 
puberty, perceived pressure for thinness, thin-ideal internalization, body dissatisfaction, 
negative affect, and social support deficits did not predict AN onset). The evidence that low 
BMI predicted AN onset in two studies converges with the finding from retrospective studies 
that lifetime diagnoses of AN correlated with a low BMI at age 6 (Tyrka, Waldron, Graber, 
& Brooks-Gunn, 2002) and with low birth weight (Cnattingius, Hultman, Dahl, & Sparen, 
1999), and low dieting, eating conflict, meal struggles, and unpleasant meals at age 6 
(Kotler, Cohen, Davies, Pine, & Walsh, 2001). Contrary to accepted theorizing based on 
case-control studies, which implicate dieting, perfectionism, and low self-esteem (e.g., 
Fairburn, Cooper, Doll, & Welch, 1999), results imply that youth who are ambivalent to food 
or who undereat for other reasons, and therefore have lower BMIs and less need to diet, are 
at risk for AN. Although low body weight during early adolescence might be construed as a

prodromal sign of incipit AN onset, fasting and excessive exercise did not predict AN onset. 
Negative affect and impaired psychosocial functioning also predicted AN onset, implying 
that youth who have high negative affect and difficulty getting along well with their family, 
friends, and peers are at risk for AN onset or that under-eating causes or exacerbates 
affective disturbances and interpersonal conflict. The fact that thin ideal internalization and 
body dissatisfaction did not predict AN implies that cultural pressure for thinness do not 
increase risk for AN.

Risk factors that predicted onset of subthreshold or threshold eating disorders generally 
predicted onset of threshold versions of the same eating disorder, implying that risk factors 
for subthreshold and threshold variants of these eating disorders are more similar than 
different. Further, the risk factors that predicted onset of binge eating and compensatory 
behaviors were similar to those that predicted onset of subthreshold and threshold BN, BED, 
and PD. There were only a few differences in risk factors identified in these analyses: 
whereas excessive exercise did not predict onset of subthreshold or threshold BN and BED, 
it did predict binge eating onset; and fasting showed a stronger relation to onset of 
subthreshold or threshold PD than compensatory behavior onset. Results suggest that these 
forms of eating pathology have similar risk processes. In contrast, perhaps the largest 
difference is that most of the examined risk factors predicted future onset of weight and 
shape overvaluation and of fear of weight gain, whereas only two of these risk factors 
predicted onset of subthreshold or threshold AN. These findings imply that sociocultural 
factors and prodromal symptoms play a more potent role in the attitudinal components of 
AN versus the low BMI component. These results also suggests that the etiologic processes 
that give rise to a low BMI and AN are distinct from those that predict onset of the other 
core behavioral and attitudinal symptoms.

Many of the risk factors that showed significant univariate effects did not account for unique 
variance in eating disorder onset in multivariate models, presumably because these factors 
are functionally correlated; subscription to the thin ideal theoretically contributes to body 
dissatisfaction, which motivates use of unhealthy weight control behaviors, and contributes 
to negative affect (Stice, 2001). Body dissatisfaction and dieting showed unique effects for 
onset of BN and BED, implying that these are cornerstone risk factors that should be 
targeted in prevention programs. Negative affect and thin-ideal internalization also showed 
unique predictive effects for onset of BN and BED respectively, implying that the effects of 
these factors are somewhat distinct from those of body dissatisfaction and dieting. It was 
noteworthy that overeating and functional impairment showed unique effects for onset of 
these two eating disorders and that overeating showed a unique effect for onset of PD, as is 
the first study to investigate these factors. Findings imply that these variables are tapping 
orthogonal risk processes that deserve greater attention in etiologic theories and prevention 
programs.

Diagnostic progression from subthreshold to threshold levels of eating disorders was higher 
in this high-risk sample (31%) than in studies of more representative samples (17%). 
Diagnostic progression was lower for AN (4%) than for BN, BED, and PD (21–46%), 
mirroring the pattern from community samples (AN = 4%, BN = 25%, BED = 21%). 
Individuals with full threshold versus subthreshold levels of eating disorders generally had

similar deficits in functional impairment and negative affect, replicating past findings (Stice 
et al., 2009).

It is important to consider study limitations. First, most of the examined risk factors involved 
variables implicated in sociocultural etiologic models of eating disorders. Future risk factor 
studies should include biological variables. The evidence that a prevention program that 
reduces pursuit of the thin ideal decreases fMRI-assessed brain reward region response to 
thin models (Stice, Yokum, & Waters, 2015) suggests that this cornerstone sociocultural risk 
factor has a biological basis that maps onto reward valuation from the RDoC matrix. There 
may be value in examining biological processes that underlie other risk factors examined 
herein. Second, the focus on body-dissatisfied women may have obscured detection of other 
risk factors orthogonal to body dissatisfaction. However, the means and SDs for the risk 
factors were similar to those from a community sample of aged-matched adolescent girls, 
implying that this sample is representative and that there was no restriction in range that 
reduced sensitivity. Moreover, the risk factors identified in this high-risk study of adolescent 
females were similar to those identified in community studies of adolescent females (Table 
1), suggesting that the high-risk design did not bias results. Third, participants in this study 
completed eating disorder prevention programs, though the effects of condition were 
statistically controlled and the predictive effects of the risk factors were not affected by the 
interventions. Fourth, we combined normalized responses to a negative affect measure and 
depressive symptom measures, but the two constructs are not isomorphic and combining 
them probably introduced error variance, though fortunately this did not prevent us from 
detecting predictive effects of this risk factor. Fifth, it is possible that some of the results 
could have emerged due to chance. We considered using a lower alpha, but decided against it 
for three reasons. First, it is important to balance Type I error risk (false positive findings) 
against Type II error risk (false negative findings); given that survival models that predict 
onset of low incident events have low sensitivity, we were more concerned about Type II 
errors. Second, the fact that 62% of the tested effects were significant communicates that it 
is unlikely that we are interpreting chance findings, which would have been closer to 5% of 
the tested effects. Third, the fact that findings from this report converge with those from 
prior studies also suggests it is unlikely that the present results are due to chance. 
Nonetheless, we report the exact p-values of each of the tests so that readers can focus on the 
effects that exceed more stringent alpha levels (e.g., p < .01) if they so desire.

With regard to implications, results suggest that examining high-risk samples is a useful way 
to identify risk factors for specific mental disorders within a diagnostic cluster. Second, the 
predictive role across eating disorders played by negative affect and functional impairment 
suggests that these should be examined as potential risk factors for the onset of other mental 
disorders, as they may represent transdiagnostic risk factors for psychopathology, which if 
targeted in prevention programs might reduce a range of mental health problems. Third, 
findings suggest a distinct risk profile for AN versus eating disorders in the binge eating/
purging spectrum. Data imply it would be useful to target low BMI middle school students 
to advance knowledge of risk factors for AN. Fourth, the overall similarity in risk factors 
that predicted onset of threshold versus subthreshold or threshold eating disorders versus the 
core symptom dimensions that crosscut eating disorders implies that eating pathology exists 
along a continuum. Future research should focus on elucidating how best to model eating

pathology in etiologic studies to maximize sensitivity for detecting risk factors. Fifth, results 
imply that the yield of eating disorder prevention programs, which typically focus on thin-
ideal internalization and body dissatisfaction, might be improved by also targeting negative 
affect, overeating, and functional impairment. The evidence that negative affect and 
impaired interpersonal functioning predict a range of eating disorders implies that it might 
be fruitful to target these high-risk populations with selective prevention programs if the 
goal is to prevent the full spectrum of eating disorders. Also, existing prevention 
interventions may be more effective in reducing future binge/purge behaviors than the 
weight restriction present in AN, which should be investigated. Data suggest that 
interventions aimed at preventing AN may need to target qualitatively different high-risk 
populations (e.g., low weight middle school girls) and might need to focus on reducing 
distinct risk processes for optimal success.

Table 2

Anorexia nervosa

Bulimia nervosa

Body mass index (BMI) less than 85% of the median expected for age and gender
Definite fear of weight gain more than 75% of the days for at least 3 months
Weight and shape were 1 of the main aspects of self-evaluation

At least four uncontrollable binge-eating episodes per month for at least 3 months
At least 4 compensatory behavior episodes per month for at least 3 months
Weight and shape were definitely 1 of the main aspects of self-evaluation

Binge eating disorder

At least four uncontrollable binge-eating episodes/days per month for at least 3 months

Less than 1 compensatory behavior on average per month during this period
Marked distress about binge eating
Binge eating characterized by 3 or more of the following: rapid eating; eating until uncomfortably full; 
eating large amounts when not physically hungry; eating alone because of embarrassment; feeling 
disgusted, depressed, or guilty after overeating

Subthreshold anorexia nervosa

BMI between 90% and 85% of that expected for age and gender
Definite fear of weight gain more than 25% of the days for at least 3 months
Weight and shape were 1 of the main aspects of self-evaluation

Subthreshold bulimia nervosa

Subthreshold binge eating 
disorder

Purging disorder

Subthreshold purging disorder

At least 2 uncontrollable binge-eating episodes per month for at least 3 months or at least 6 episodes over a 
shorter period
At least 2 compensatory behavior episodes (i.e., self-induced vomiting, laxatives or diuretic use, fasting, 
and excessive exercise to compensate for overeating) per month for at least 3 months or at least 6 episodes 
over a shorter period
Weight and shape were definitely 1 of the main aspects of self-evaluation

At least 2 uncontrollable binge-eating episodes/days per month for at least 3 months or at least 6 episodes 
over a shorter period
Less than 1 compensatory behavior on average per month during this period
Marked distress about binge eating
Binge eating characterized by 3 or more of the following: rapid eating; eating until uncomfortably full; 
eating large amounts when not physically hungry; eating alone because of embarrassment; feeling 
disgusted, depressed, or guilty after overeating

At least 4 episodes of self-induced vomiting or diuretic/laxative use for weight control purposes per month 
for at least 3 months
Less than 1 uncontrollable binge-eating episode on average per month during this period
Weight and shape were 1 of the main aspects of self-evaluation

At least 2 episodes of self-induced vomiting or diuretic/laxative use for weight control purposes per month 
for at least 3 months or at least 6 episodes over a shorter period
Less than 1 uncontrollable binge-eating episode on average per month during this period
Weight and shape were 1 of the main aspects of self-evaluation

Note. Eating disorder classifications are not mutually exclusive across disorders. Study prevalence reflects the number of participants who met 
criteria at baseline and those who showed onset during the follow-up period. Cumulative incidence reflects participants who showed onset during 
the follow-up period, excluding those who met criteria at baseline.
