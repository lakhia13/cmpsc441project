Abstract

Adverse events in childhood and adolescence, such as social neglect or drug abuse, are known to 
lead to behavioral changes in young adulthood. This is particularly true for the subset of people 
who are intrinsically more vulnerable to stressful conditions. Yet the underlying mechanisms for 
such developmental trajectory from early life insult to aberrant adult behavior remains elusive. 
Adolescence is a period of dynamic physiological, psychological, and behavioral changes, 
encompassing a distinct neurodevelopmental stage called the ‘critical period’. During adolescence, 
the brain is uniquely susceptible to stress. Stress mediators may lead to disturbances to biological 
processes that can cause permanent alterations in the adult stage, even as severe as the onset of 
mental illness when paired with genetic risk and environmental factors. Understanding the 
molecular factors governing the critical period and how stress can disturb the maturation processes 
will allow for better treatment and prevention of late adolescent/young adult onset psychiatric 
disorders.

Introduction

In the past, many scientists have addressed the question of how early life events may 
contribute to the shaping of adult behavior. These investigators include psychologists like 
Erikson and Piaget who stated that during the long-term trajectory there are several specific 
stages that contribute to the proper development towards adult behavior. For example, 
Erikson’s theory of psychosocial development suggests there are eight stages of 
psychosocial conflicts in ego growth from infancy to adulthood.1 Piaget’s four stages of 
cognitive development takes into consideration how biological maturation and 
environmental factors facilitate cognitive development throughout the lifespan.1

Consistent with such a conceptual framework of psychological development, recent clinical 
and epidemiological evidence has indicated that any early life disturbances, such as abuse or 
neglect, may lead to aberrant behaviors in adulthood, and potentially enhance the risk for a 
wide range of psychiatric conditions.2–6 For example, aberrant use of drugs, such as 
marijuana, in adolescence has been correlated to a heightened risk of psychosis.7

In rodent models, early life stress also reportedly impairs mood, cognition, memory, and 
learning in adulthood.3,5 Many of these studies have found that early stress elicits several 
molecular and structural changes in the brain, which accompany the behavioral deficits in 
adulthood.8 Thus, rodent models may be useful in studying mechanisms of how adverse 
events in early life may underlie adult behavior during the developmental trajectory.

Major psychiatric conditions, such as schizophrenia or severe cases of bipolar disorder, 
emerge in late adolescence and young adulthood, and most display a chronic deteriorating 
course after onset. Thus, there are two major mechanistic questions: the first being why 
these disorders often emerge after puberty, although the initial risk events may occur years 
earlier, sometimes even during prenatal stages; and the second being why the emerged 
deficits frequently become sustained throughout adulthood.

2.  Dynamic changes in the adolescent brain

During adolescence, the brain, including the cerebral cortex, changes and matures drastically 
(Fig. 1). For example, in the first half of adolescence, massive elimination of synapses 
occurs, specifically among glutamatergic neurons.9 This event occurs not only in a cell 
autonomous mechanism, but is also influenced by non-neuronal cells such as microglia and 
astrocytes.10 In the cerebral cortex, dopaminergic projections from the midbrain region 
undergo alterations, accompanied by increases in dopamine levels until late adolescence.
11,12 Response to γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic neurons also critically changes during 
adolescence.13 An increase in myelination is prominent in late adolescence to young 
adulthood as well, which is associated with overall changes to molecular expression profiles.
14,15

At the physiological level, the dynamics of neuronal activity changes during adolescence as 
cortical regions are formed into functional networks. There is also increased synchrony at 
multiple brain wave frequencies as well as changes in the balance between excitatory and 
inhibitory synapses (E/I balance).16 Neuronal oscillations, particularly at gamma-band 
frequencies, may play an important role in cognitive and behavioral responses, such as 
perceptual grouping, attention-dependent stimulus selection, working memory, and 
consciousness.17

3.  Critical periods

The classic concepts in neuropsychology that describe multiple developmental stages can be 
applied to the concepts of critical periods in neuroscience. The notion of the critical period 
originated from the observation by Wiesel and Hubel that monocular light deprivation 
during the neonatal stage resulted in blindness that could not be recovered by light exposure 
later in life, despite no prior intrinsic anatomical or biological abnormalities.18 Recent

studies in molecular neuroscience have indicated that there are indeed critical developmental 
windows governed by several concrete molecular factors: molecules associated with GABA 
neurotransmission and some immune-related molecules have been underscored.19,20

Experimental validation of critical periods has encouraged investigators to extend this 
approach to understand how stress during the critical period may even create vulnerability 
and resilience to psychopathology, and affect behaviors in later stages. Adolescents show an 
attenuated fear memory and extinction, suggesting that adolescence is indeed a sensitive 
period to stress that differs from other developmental and adult stages.21 One study found 
that adolescents with anxiety disorders show a decreased responsiveness to cognitive 
behavioral therapy (CBT) compared to children and adults.21 This susceptibility is 
associated with age-specific changes in neuroplasticity in the prefrontal cortex. Alterations 
to the neural regulation of fear and anxiety in adolescence, when paired with early life stress, 
can lead to a heightened “vulnerability to pathogenic experiences”.21 Yet, the unique 
molecular expression profiles and limited temporal window of adolescence allows clinicians 
to develop personalized treatment based on the patient’s genetic profile and age.

As we described above, dopaminergic projections, particularly mesocortical projections, 
mature during adolescence. Disturbance of this maturation by adverse events during 
adolescence is experimentally proven to be causal for aberrant animal behavior, such as 
deficits in information processing, mood control, and psychostimulant hypersensitivity.22 
Investigators have elucidated that excess stress hormones, such as glucocorticoids, mediate 
this disturbance in adolescence.22 By altering the timing of blockade against the activated 
glucocorticoid receptor signaling, we can determine how the critical period links 
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis-associated dopaminergic disturbance and 
aberrant behavior in adulthood.23 In addition, maturation of cortical myelination occurs in 
adolescence, and disturbances to this maturation process may also underlie abnormal 
behaviors in adulthood. Among rodents, it has been shown that the two weeks post-weaning 
may play a crucial role in proper myelination and adult behavior.24

4.  Pathological trajectory: from pathogenesis to pathophysiology and 

final manifestation

Any disease trajectory can be defined as a course from the initial etiology (pathogenesis) to 
the final clinical manifestation via pathophysiology, in which critical mediators account for 
the phenotypes25,26 (Fig. 2). In humans, in which every individual is heterogeneous because 
of genetic variability, the process of pathogenesis is tightly associated with genetic 
vulnerability and environmental insult in early development. It is possible to postulate that 
the critical period described above may underlie between the pathogenesis and 
pathophysiology, in which the biological events of the brain may directly account for the 
phenotypes.

We then ask how disturbances to brain maturation during the critical period can lead to 
chronic dysfunction. If the critical period is restricted to a specific developmental time frame 
for the manifestation of a devastating phenotype, then why does biological influence during 
the critical period produce sustained behavioral changes later in life, and what is the

mechanism underlying the disease trajectory from the biological changes during the critical 
period to the persistent symptomatic manifestations? One possible answer may be that such 
a devastating event in this short time frame may fundamentally alter the developmental 
program. Nevertheless, its underlying molecular mechanism is unclear. However, new 
experimental evidence has indicated that biological influence during the critical period may 
affect the epigenetic landscape on the chromosome, which may result in the irreparable and 
long-lasting changes. For example, dysregulation of the HPA axis during the critical period 
affects dopaminergic neurons long-term through alterations to the epigenetic hallmarks on 
genes such as tyrosine hydrolase (Th), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (Bdnf), and FK506 
binding protein 5 (Fkbp5).23

5.  Future prospective: potential application of preclinically defined critical 

period to clinical settings

As described above, many preclinical studies have recently evidenced that there are critical 
periods in adolescence, and that disturbance to biological processes during these sensitive 
developmental time frames may account for abnormal adult behaviors. At least in part, 
epigenetic mechanisms during the critical period may underlie such late adolescent/young 
adult onset and long-lasting behavioral abnormalities.27 How can we utilize this knowledge 
from preclinical studies to better the treatment and prevention of patients with late 
adolescent/young adult onset psychiatric disorders?

Interventions with aberrant epigenetic processes are currently one of the leading topics in 
translational neuroscience. For example, experimental drugs such as histone deacetylase 
(HDAC) inhibitors have been tested using animal models for Alzheimer’s, in which 
epigenetic implications have been suggested for the memory disturbances.28 Nevertheless, in 
general, epigenetic intervention as a clinical application is challenging, because we still do 
not know of a way to intervene the epigenetic change for a specific subset of genes without 
interfering with entire genes. One noteworthy idea is to utilize the Clustered Regularly 
Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)-Cas9 system to target an exact set of 
epigenetic changes, but this is only currently utilized at the animal level.29 Therefore, a more 
realistic way to address the critical period and its devastating effect on adult behavior may be 
to take a prophylactic approach. If we can define the critical period for certain types of adult 
phenotypes associated with adverse events in early life, we may define certain groups of 
patients who may possibly have a higher vulnerability to such stressors. As a result, we can 
guide them to avoid such stressors prior to the critical period, circumventing the 
deteriorating event altogether and protecting them from the long-lasting brain dysfunction 
and behavioral deficits. By focusing on the intersection of environment, biology, and 
lifestyle, we need personalized prevention, treatment, and care for all of us.

Cortical maturation and behavioral patterns in developmental trajectory of major mental 
illnesses. The upper panel shows the developmental trajectory of brain maturation. Brain 
maturation, including maturation of interneurons and dopaminergic projections, pruning of 
glutamatergic synapses, and increased myelination, occurs from birth to young adulthood, 
most dynamically during adolescence. Stress mediators regulated by genetic and 
environmental factors affect this maturation processes during this critical period. Aberrant 
brain maturation induced by stress mediators might be an essential mechanism underlying 
the disease. The lower panel shows the course of abnormal behavioral patterns related to 
major mental illnesses. Disturbance of brain maturation caused by stress mediators during 
the critical period may increase vulnerability to major mental illnesses, for which the 
devastating behavioral phenotype (over the threshold) will begin to emerge in late 
adolescence and early adulthood. Adapted from Jaaro-Peled and colleagues, with permission
