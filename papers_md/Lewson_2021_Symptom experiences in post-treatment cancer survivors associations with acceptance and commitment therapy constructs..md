Abstract

Purpose—Acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) has improved symptom and quality-of-
life outcomes in pilot research with post-treatment cancer survivors. To further test the ACT 
model, the present study examined relationships between ACT constructs and subgroups of post-
treatment survivors based on the severity of common symptoms.

Methods—Survivors who had completed primary treatment for stage I or II cancer (N=203) 
participated in this one-time survey. Latent class analysis (LCA) was used to identify subgroups of 
survivors based on the severity of fatigue, sleep disturbance, pain, anxiety, and depressive 
symptoms. Multinomial logistic regressions employing Vermunt’s 3-step approach were used to 
examine ACT constructs (e.g., mindfulness, acceptance, values progress) as correlates of survivor 
subgroups based on symptoms.

Results—LCA showed three survivor classes: (1) mild to moderate levels of all symptoms except 
for normal pain intensity, (2) mild anxiety, moderate fatigue, and normal levels of all other 
symptoms, and (3) normal levels of all symptoms. Lower mindfulness, acceptance, and values 
progress and higher cognitive fusion, psychological inflexibility, and values obstruction were 
associated with a greater likelihood of being in class 1 or 2 than class 3.

Conclusion—Findings are consistent with the ACT model. Survivors with greater symptom 
burden reported greater withdrawal from personally meaningful activities and less acceptance of 
their cancer diagnosis and internal experiences (e.g., thoughts, feelings, symptoms). Findings 
provide strong justification for further testing of ACT to reduce symptom-related suffering in 
cancer survivors.

Introduction

Many cancer survivors experience persistent, debilitating symptoms for months or years 
after cancer treatment [1]. Common symptoms include fatigue, sleep disturbance, pain, 
anxiety, and depressive symptoms. These symptoms tend to co-occur, with survivors 
showing heterogeneous clustering and severity of symptoms [2, 3]. Survivors’ heightened 
symptoms have a substantial negative impact on their daily activities, functional status, and 
quality of life [4–6].

There is growing interest in mindfulness and acceptance-based interventions for cancer 
symptom management. Rather than focusing on symptom reduction, these interventions, 
such as acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT), aim to minimize the negative impact of 
symptoms on functioning [7]. The goal of ACT is to increase psychological flexibility so 
that internal experiences (e.g., symptoms, thoughts, feelings) do not impede engagement in 
meaningful activities. Psychological flexibility is comprised of commitment and behavior 
change processes as well as mindfulness and acceptance-based processes. Commitment and 
behavior change processes involve identifying and behaving in accordance with one’s 
values, or personal guiding principles. Mindfulness and acceptance-based processes involve 
intentional and nonjudgmental attention to one’s thoughts, feelings, and experiences of the 
present moment [8]. Thus, from an ACT perspective, cancer survivors with higher physical 
and psychological symptom interference are expected to show greater psychological 
inflexibility. This includes processes such as obstruction of value-based action and cognitive 
fusion, or allowing one’s behavior to be overly influenced by one’s thoughts [8].

Pilot studies of ACT have produced promising results in cancer populations, including 
improved emotional well-being, psychological flexibility, and quality of life [9, 10]. In a 
pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) with post-treatment survivors, both ACT and 
Behavioral Activation groups were superior to a waitlist control group and showed 
comparable post-intervention reductions in anxiety and depressive symptoms [11]. 
Additionally, the ACT group showed greater reductions in avoidance/rumination and social

impairment than the other two groups. Another pilot RCT found that compared to 
survivorship education and enhanced usual care, group-based ACT was effective in reducing 
breast cancer survivors’ fear of cancer recurrence, general anxiety, and depressive symptoms 
at 6-month follow-up [12]. Both studies demonstrated moderate to large effects of ACT on 
psychological outcomes [11, 12].

Although ACT has shown promise in a few pilot studies with post-treatment cancer 
survivors, additional research is necessary to establish links between ACT constructs and 
common cancer-related symptoms before investing resources in large-scale trials. To date, a 
few studies have associated greater psychological flexibility and mindfulness with reduced 
distress in post-treatment survivors [13–15], and one study linked greater mindfulness to 
reduced physical symptoms in breast cancer survivors [14]. Building on this limited 
literature, the present study examined relationships between a range of ACT constructs and 
subgroups of cancer survivors based on symptom levels. Latent class analysis was used to 
group post-treatment solid-tumor survivors by level of fatigue, sleep disturbance, pain, 
anxiety, and depressive symptoms. Based on the ACT model [8] and prior literature [14, 16, 
17], we hypothesized that survivor subgroups with higher symptom levels would have lower 
mindfulness, acceptance, and values progress and higher cognitive fusion, psychological 
inflexibility, and values obstruction compared to those with lower symptom levels.

Methods

Participants and procedures

Study procedures were approved by the Indiana University Institutional Review Board. 
Recruitment took place from February to October of 2018. Survivors were recruited from a 
public hospital, an academic medical center, and an affiliated clinic in the midwestern 
United States. Potential participants were identified through the Indiana University Health 
and Eskenazi Health Cancer Registries, and eligibility was confirmed through medical chart 
review. Patients were eligible if they 1) had been diagnosed with breast, prostate, 
gastrointestinal (GI), or lung cancer; 2) had completed primary treatment for stage I or II 
cancer at least 6 months ago (ongoing endocrine therapy was allowed) or were at least 3 
weeks post-diagnosis of stage IV cancer; 3) were at least 18 years of age; and 4) were fluent 
in English. Survivors were excluded if they made 3 or more errors on a validated 6-item 
cognitive screener [18] or could not provide informed consent.

Of the 701 patients who were mailed a study introductory letter and consent form, 592 
(84%) were reached via phone. Of those reached, 99 (17%) refused to participate and 29 
(5%) were ineligible or deceased. Common reasons for refusal included a lack of interest in 
the study and time constraints. Of the 464 consenting participants, 430 (93%) completed 
REDCap or paper surveys. Only participants who had received treatment for stage I or II 
cancer (n=203) were included in the current analyses, as their symptom profiles were 
expected to differ from those with advanced cancer [19]. Our findings on adults with 
advanced cancer will be published in a separate report.

Measures

Page 4

Demographic and medical information—Demographic and medical information was 
retrieved from survivors’ medical records including age, gender, cancer type and stage, date 
of diagnosis, and cancer treatments. Participants reported their race/ethnicity, marital status, 
education, income level, and employment status. Participants also indicated whether they 
had been diagnosed with or received treatment for 12 common medical comorbidities within 
the last three years, such as hypertension and diabetes [20].

Physical and psychological symptoms—Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement 
Information System (PROMIS) measures were used to assess the severity of psychological 
and physical symptoms during the past week. These NIH-funded measures have undergone 
rigorous psychometric testing [21], and evidence supports their reliability and validity in 
cancer survivors [19, 22]. The severity of anxiety and depressive symptoms was assessed 
with the 4-item PROMIS short form anxiety and depression measures [23]. Short form 
PROMIS measures were also used to assess the severity of physical symptoms, including 4-
item measures of sleep disturbance and fatigue and a 3-item measure of pain intensity [21, 
24]. T-scores <50 for fatigue measures and T-scores <55 for sleep disturbance, pain, anxiety, 
and depression measures are considered normal based on published threshold scores [25, 
26].

Cognitive fusion—The 7-item Cognitive Fusion Questionnaire (CFQ) was used to assess 
participants’ tendency to allow their behavior to be overly influenced by their thoughts [27]. 
The CFQ has demonstrated strong internal consistency, test-retest reliability, and ability to 
predict anxiety in cancer survivors [27]. Participants rated how true each statement was for 
them on a 7-point scale ranging from “never true” to “always true.” A sample item is “I 
struggle with my thoughts.”

Mindfulness—Mindfulness was assessed with the Act with Awareness, Nonjudging, and 
Nonreactivity subscales of the Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire-Short Form (FFMQ-
SF) [28]. In research with cancer survivors, these subscales have demonstrated strong 
internal consistency [29] and have been related to health outcomes [30, 31]. For the current 
analysis, we combined the 5-item Acting with Awareness and Nonjudging subscales to 
assess mindfulness, as they were highly correlated in our sample (r=.61, p<.01), whereas 
Nonreactivity showed small correlations with these subscales. Participants rated each 
statement on a 5-point scale ranging from “never or very rarely true” to “very often or 
always true.” A sample item is “I make judgments about whether my thoughts are good or 
bad.”

Acceptance—Acceptance of cancer was measured using the Peace, Equanimity, and 
Acceptance in the Cancer Experience scale (PEACE) [32]. The current analysis focused on 
the 5-item Peaceful Acceptance subscale. This subscale has shown good internal consistency 
(α=0.78) and criterion validity in adults with cancer [32]. Items are asked in question form 
(e.g., “To what extent are you able to accept your diagnosis of cancer?”) and answered on a 
4-point scale ranging from “not at all” to “to a large extent.”

Psychological inflexibility—The 7-item Acceptance and Action Questionnaire-II (AAQ-
II) was used to measure psychological inflexibility, or attempts to avoid unwanted thoughts 
and emotions even when doing so contributes to behaviors that are not in line with personal 
values. This measure has shown good discriminate validity and test-retest reliability [33]. 
Additionally, in research on the AAQ-II in adults with cancer, alphas have ranged from 0.78 
to 0.87 [34]. Participants were asked to rate how true each statement was for them on a 7-
point scale ranging from “never true” to “always true.” A sample item is “I worry about not 
being able to control my worries and feelings.”

Value-based living—Value-based living, or living in accordance with one’s personal 
principles, was assessed with the 10-item Valuing Questionnaire (VQ) [35]. The obstruction 
subscale contains five negatively worded items (e.g., “Difficult thoughts, feelings or 
memories got in the way of what I really wanted to do”), whereas the progress subscale 
contains five positively worded items (e.g., “I was proud about how I lived my life”). Both 
VQ subscales have shown good internal consistency (obstruction, α=0.79; progress, α=0.81) 
and concurrent validity with measures of ACT constructs in healthy samples [35]. Both have 
also been used with adults with cancer [36]. Participants rated how true each item was for 
them on a 7-point scale ranging from “not true at all” to “completely true.”

Analysis—Descriptive statistics were computed for demographic and medical 
characteristics and main study variables, and intercorrelations were computed between 
physical and psychological symptoms and ACT variables using the Statistical Package for 
the Social Sciences, Version 25.0 (SPSS). Then a latent class analysis was conducted in 
Mplus, Version 8 to group survivors based on fatigue, sleep disturbance, pain intensity, 
anxiety, and depressive symptoms. After six class solutions were tested iteratively, model fit 
indices (e.g., information criterion and likelihood ratio tests) and conceptually meaningful 
interpretability were assessed to determine the final number of survivor subgroups [37]. 
Lower values for information criterion [38], such as the Bayesian Information Criterion 
(BIC) and Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), and statistical significance (p<.05) of the 
Vuong-Lo-Mendell-Rubin likelihood ratio test (VLMR LRT) [39] indicate better model fit. 
Entropy above .80 also indicates a good-fitting model [40, 41]. Differences in demographic 
and medical characteristics between classes were assessed using chi- square tests, one-way 
ANOVAs, and Kruskal-Wallis tests. P values <.01 were considered statistically significant. 
Finally, multinomial logistic regressions employing Vermunt’s 3-step approach [42] were 
used to examine ACT variables as correlates of survivor subgroups based on symptoms. P 
values <.01 were considered statistically significant due to the number of regression 
analyses.

Results

Preliminary analyses

Sample characteristics are presented in Table 1. The majority of participants were non-
Hispanic White and married or partnered with an average age of 63 years. The sample had 
about equal numbers of men and women and a wide range of education and income levels. 
Each cancer type (breast, prostate, GI, and lung) and stage was approximately evenly

represented in the sample, and the average time since diagnosis was 3.5 years at the time of 
survey completion.

Intercorrelations, descriptive statistics, and Cronbach’s alphas for main study variables are 
presented in Table 2. Significant negative correlations were found between all five symptoms 
and the ACT variables of mindfulness, acceptance, and values progress, except for a non-
significant association between pain intensity and values progress. Additionally, all 
symptoms showed significant positive correlations with ACT variables related to 
psychopathology, including cognitive fusion, psychological inflexibility, and values 
obstruction. All measures had good to excellent internal consistency reliability (α range = 
0.82–0.95).

Primary analyses

A latent class analysis was conducted to group participants into classes based on the severity 
of fatigue, sleep disturbance, pain intensity, anxiety, and depressive symptoms. Anxiety and 
depression were allowed to covary in this analysis. Solutions ranging from one to six classes 
were tested iteratively. The 3-class solution fit the data significantly better than the 2-class 
solution (VLMR p<.05, entropy = 0.95), with enhanced interpretability that was 
conceptually meaningful. Although model fit indices (i.e., BIC and AIC) favored the 4-class 
solution, class sizes and interpretability were markedly reduced using this model. Model fit 
indices are presented in Table 3. Thus, the 3-class solution was selected due to conceptually 
meaningful interpretability, adequate class sizes, and good class separation. Class 1 (n=29) 
had mild to moderate levels of all symptoms except for normal pain intensity. Class 2 (n=69) 
had mild anxiety, moderate fatigue, and normal levels of all other symptoms. Class 3 
(n=105) was characterized by normal levels of all symptoms [25]. Of the demographic and 
medical characteristics listed in Table 1, only being married or partnered was significantly 
2(2, N=203)=12.88, p=.002. Descriptive statistics for symptoms and 
associated with class, χ
ACT variables by participant class are presented in Table 4.

Multinomial logistic regressions found that ACT variables were related to patient classes 
based on symptom severity (see Table 5). Lower mindfulness, acceptance, and values 
progress and higher cognitive fusion, psychological inflexibility, and values obstruction were 
associated with a higher likelihood of being in class 1 or 2 compared to class 3.

Discussion

This study identified subgroups of post-treatment, solid-tumor survivors based on levels of 
common symptoms and their associations with ACT constructs. Three subgroups of 
survivors were identified: those with mild to moderate levels of all symptoms except for 
normal pain intensity; those with mild anxiety, moderate fatigue, and normal levels of all 
other symptoms; and those with normal levels of all symptoms. Prior research has also 
found heterogeneity with respect to the clustering and severity of survivors’ symptoms [2, 
3]. In the current study, compared to survivors with normal levels of all symptoms, the other 
survivor subgroups displayed lower mindfulness, acceptance, and values progress as well as 
higher cognitive fusion, psychological inflexibility, and values obstruction. Findings are 
consistent with the ACT model [8] and suggest that post-treatment survivors with higher

symptom burden have greater difficulty accepting their cancer diagnosis and internal, 
present-moment experiences (e.g., thoughts, feelings, symptoms). Results also suggest that 
survivors with greater symptom burden may be more likely to withdraw from activities 
consistent with personal values.

One prior study with disease-free breast cancer survivors found that greater psychological 
inflexibility, or avoidance of unwanted experiences, was associated with higher levels of 
distress [13], and other studies have found this association in patients of mixed cancer types 
and stages [7, 43]. Our results extend this work by correlating this avoidance with a range of 
physical and psychological symptoms in post-treatment survivors. One potential explanation 
for these findings is that survivors may cope with long-term treatment side effects by 
attempting to avoid difficult thoughts, feelings, and bodily sensations. Additionally, attempts 
to avoid symptoms may increase their severity, as survivors may not seek appropriate care or 
may engage in ineffective methods of symptom control (e.g., avoiding social activities to 
conserve energy). It is also possible that an unmeasured third factor (e.g., emotional 
reactivity) may underlie symptom perceptions and psychological inflexibility.

This study also examined mindfulness and acceptance processes and commitment and 
behavior change processes that comprise psychological flexibility. Increased mindfulness 
has been associated with lower physical and psychological symptoms in breast cancer 
survivors [14] and less distress in survivors of various cancer types [7, 15, 44]. This study 
found that higher levels of mindfulness facets—acting with awareness and nonjudging—
were associated with reduced physical and psychological symptoms during the post-
treatment period. One explanation is that perceived symptom burden may decrease if 
survivors give full attention to activities in the present moment. Additionally, a non-
judgmental stance may interrupt maladaptive reactions to symptoms, such as rumination and 
catastrophizing. Relatedly, in our study, greater cognitive fusion, or being overly entangled 
with one’s thoughts, was correlated with higher symptom levels, whereas greater acceptance 
of cancer was correlated with lower symptom levels. While an accepting attitude towards 
cancer has been repeatedly associated with less distress [45], cognitive fusion has rarely 
been studied in cancer, with one survey linking it to greater distress in a heterogeneous 
sample of cancer survivors [27]. Commitment and behavior change processes, or value-
based actions, have also received limited research attention in cancer [36, 43]. Our findings 
suggest that even mild to moderate symptoms in survivors are correlated with perceptions of 
limited progress in pursuing meaningful activities.

Limitations of this study should be noted. Although this sample was diverse in terms of 
gender, socioeconomic status, and cancer type, 76% of participants identified as non-
Hispanic White. Future studies should examine the generalizability of these findings to 
racially and ethnically diverse populations. Due to the cross-sectional design, temporal 
relationships between ACT constructs and symptoms could not be determined. Longitudinal 
designs could elucidate potentially bidirectional relationships between ACT constructs and 
symptoms. Additionally, future studies could include other ACT processes such as self as 
context. Finally, because of the exploratory nature of latent class analysis, findings warrant 
replication.

Conclusion

Page 8

Many cancer survivors experience persistent symptoms long after treatment is completed 
[1]. Our results suggest that symptoms may interfere with purposeful attention to the present 
moment, acceptance of one’s experiences, and living according to personal values. 
Alternatively, survivors who maintain an open, accepting posture toward present-moment 
experiences while pursuing meaningful activities may perceive less symptom burden. This 
research and ACT pilot trials [11, 12] provide strong support for large-scale investigation of 
ACT for reducing symptom interference with functioning in post-treatment survivors. Our 
results also point to potential treatment targets in ACT, such as mindfulness and value-based 
action, that may be assessed as mediators of ACT’s effect on symptom interference in future 
trials. Indeed, interventions emphasizing mindfulness meditation have significantly reduced 
fatigue in cancer survivors, although more research is needed to determine their long-term 
efficacy (Johns et al., under review). If found to be efficacious, ACT and other mindfulness-
based interventions could be readily disseminated to clinicians and fulfill an unmet need in 
the comprehensive care of cancer survivors.
