Abstract

Background: Actigraphy may provide a more valid assessment of sleep, circadian
rhythm (CR), and physical activity (PA) than self‐reported questionnaires, but has not

been used widely to study the association with depression/anxiety and their clinical

characteristics.
Methods: Fourteen‐day actigraphy data of 359 participants with current (n = 93),

remitted (n = 176), or no (n = 90) composite international diagnostic interview

depression/anxiety diagnoses were obtained from the Netherlands Study of

Depression and Anxiety. Objective estimates included sleep duration (SD), sleep
efficiency, relative amplitude (RA) between day‐time and night‐time activity, mid
sleep on free days (MSF), gross motor activity (GMA), and moderate‐to‐vigorous PA
(MVPA). Self‐reported measures included insomnia rating scale, SD, MSF, metabolic

equivalent total, and MVPA.

Results: Compared to controls, individuals with current depression/anxiety had a
significantly different objective, but not self‐reported, PA and CR: lower GMA (23.83
vs. 27.4 milli‐gravity/day, p = .022), lower MVPA (35.32 vs. 47.64 min/day, p = .023),
lower RA (0.82 vs. 0.83, p = .033). In contrast, self‐reported, but not objective, sleep

differed between people with current depression/anxiety compared to those without

current disorders; people with current depression/anxiety reported both shorter and

longer SD and more insomnia. More depressive/anxiety symptoms and number of

depressive/anxiety diagnoses were associated with larger disturbances of the

actigraphy measures.

Conclusion: Actigraphy provides ecologically valid information on sleep, CR, and PA
that enhances data from self‐reported questionnaires. As those with more severe or

comorbid forms showed the lowest PA and most CR disruptions, the potential for

retrospective self‐reported questionnaires, that summarize static esti-
mates, which are potentially biased by patientʼs cognitive impairments

and negative perception (Sallis & Saelens, 2000).

Wrist‐worn actigraphy devices can objectively assess (disturbances

in) sleep, CR, and PA. The ecological measurement with actigraphy in
patients’ natural environments continuously over time may translate

development and prognosis of such disorders. Participants were initially

included at the baseline assessment in 2004 to 2007 (n = 2981), and seen
for the fifth time at the 9‐year follow‐up assessment wave (2014–2017)
for a regular follow‐up interview (n = 1776),

including a psychiatric

NESDA waves, consented to be approached for this sub‐study,
participated in the regular interview ≤ 31 days prior to starting the

EMA measurements, had good mastery of the Dutch language, were
familiar with smartphone use and willing to wear a wrist‐worn actigraphy

and were provided with a GENEActiv device (Activinsights Ltd.,

Kimbolton, UK) as well as a prepaid envelope or box to send the
GENEActiv back by mail after the 2‐week period. Participants wore the
wrist‐worn GENEActiv actigraphy device and took part in the EMA

device. Siblings were invited if they did not have a current or past

assessment on a smartphone for 2 weeks during which they filled out

diagnosis of a depressive and/or anxiety disorder or another severe

questions on current mood states. If they did not have a smartphone with

psychiatric disorder (such as psychotic or severe addiction disorder). All

participants were fully informed and given time to ask questions before

internet access, they could borrow one from the study. Of the 384

actigraphy data were included in the analyses if at least 1 week day

and 1 weekend day of usable data was available, with at least 16 hr
recorded per day and per night (see Supporting Information “Raw data
processing” for further details about the actigraphy data pipeline). The

final sample was composed of 359 (93.5%) participants with 13.68 ± 1.26

valid days, of which 90% completed the protocol for 14 days.

2.2 | Diagnosis of depression and/or anxiety
disorders

As in the previous waves, at the 9‐year follow‐up, DSM‐IV–based

diagnoses of depressive disorders (dysthymia and major depressive

disorder) and anxiety (social anxiety disorder, panic disorder with

and without agoraphobia, agoraphobia, and generalized anxiety

disorder) were established with the composite international diag-

nostic interview (CIDI, version 2.1; Wittchen, 1994). The interviews

were conducted by specially trained clinical research staff. For this

study, participants were divided into the following three groups: (a) A

group with no lifetime depressive and/or anxiety disorders, (b) a

group with remitted depressive and/or anxiety disorders (having a
lifetime, but not current [6‐month] diagnosis), and (c) a group with

current depressive or anxiety disorder in the past 6 months.

2.3 | Clinical characteristics

Studied clinical characteristics were the severity of depressive

symptoms and that of anxiety symptoms, number of comorbid

psychiatric disorders, duration of depressive or anxiety disorders, age

of onset, and medication use (i.e., antidepressant and benzodiaze-

Participants wore the GENEActiv watch on their nondominant wrist

for 2 weeks. They were instructed to wear the watch day and night

and only taking it off when going to the sauna or when playing a

contact sport in which wearing a wristband is unsafe. They were also

instructed to press the button on the device when going to sleep and

when getting up. In this study, the accelerometer was set to sample

at 30 Hz and raw actigraphy data were analyzed using an open
source R package, GGIR (version 1.5–18, see Supporting Information

for further details on the raw actigraphy data cleaning processing

pipeline). Sleep was assessed as total sleep duration per night (in

hh:mm) and sleep efficiency per night (%). CR was assessed by mid

sleep on free days (MSF; clock time) and the relative amplitude (RA)
between day‐time and night‐time activity per day. Physical activity
was assessed as gross motor activity per day (milli‐gravity [mg],
1g = 9.81 m/s2) and minutes in moderate‐to‐vigorous PA per day
(objective minutes in moderate‐to‐vigorous PA per day were defined
as the sum of 1‐min epochs in which gross motor activity was larger

than 125 mg, which has recently been used by others (Kim et al.,

2017)). Average weekly estimates were derived for each participant.

Actigraphy variables were chosen based on several reasons. First, the

selected actigraphy variables are among the ones reported fre-

quently in adult studies and have been previously linked to

psychopathology (Burton et al., 2013; Hori et al., 2016; Luik et al.,

2015; Lyall et al., 2018). Second, these measures cover the concepts

comparison on their association with depressive and anxiety

symptoms were estimated using the 30‐item inventory of depressive
symptomatology (IDS) self‐report (Rush, Gullion, Basco, Jarrett, &

Self‐reported sleep was evaluated using the following questionnaires:

was determined as a count of current depressive and anxiety

disorder was calculated as a count of the number of waves at which

the patient reported a depression and/or anxiety diagnosis during the

Self‐reported chronotype was assessed with the Munich chron-
otype questionnaire (MCTQ; Roenneberg, Wirz‐Justice, & Merrow,

2003). The MCTQ contains 29 questions about time of waking up and

living (Burton et al., 2013) and circadian impairments (Lyall et al.,

2018). As improvement in depression with antidepressant medica-
tions have been linked with greater day‐time activity levels (Todder,
Caliskan, & Baune, 2009) and higher RA between day‐time and night‐

time activity (Todder et al., 2009) when using actigraphy, the

continuous measurement of daily activity and circadian rhythmicity
with wrist‐worn actigraphy may help to monitor treatment effects

(Martin & Hakim, 2011).

However, first some conditions should be met before actigraphy

could play a role in monitoring of treatment response. Although it has

been suggested that actigraphy could be used to follow the

progression of depression treatment, it is still unclear how sensitive

and specific actigraphy is for the characterization of this change in

psychological state (Martin & Hakim, 2011). Which actigraphy

variables are best suited for monitoring purposes and definitions of

clinically relevant improvement on these variables needs to be

examined. Interpretation is also not always immediate (e.g., RA
between day‐time and night time activity) and clinicians may need

additional training for the use of devices in the clinical practice.

Wearing research devices such as a GENEActiv device, may be

experienced as stigmatizing as a patient may be asked for its use in

public (Scott et al., 2019; Simblett et al., 2019). Popular commercial

activity trackers are aesthetically pleasing and therefore maybe less
stigmatizing, but at a cost of lower quality data—whether these

devices are suitable for monitoring treatment effects is unknown

(Scott et al., 2019). Currently, the majority of devices used in

research settings need to be connected to a computer to download

data and to extract variables with the use of specific software,
resulting in a time‐consuming procedure. In the future, devices with
bluetooth‐compatible connectivity and consumer devices are likely to
become more common, allowing the real‐time synchronization of
data on the patientʼs smartphone app and on a data visualization

dashboard. Data may become readily available and interpretable for
the clinician, while for the patient, real‐time feedback on activity and

sleep may help to adopt more healthy habits (Matcham et al., 2019).

While actigraphy appeared to enhance information obtained from
self‐reported questionnaires, self‐reported assessment can also be

improved by using a daily electronic diary that is less costly and time

consuming than actigraphy and it may be more personalized to

individuals (Martin & Hakim, 2011). Such electronic diaries may

also incorporate other questionnaires on sleep and sleep quality

such as the Pittsburgh sleep quality index or

the insomnia

severity index.

Actigraphy indices of sleep were not significantly different across

diagnostic groups. Moreover, while sleep duration measured with
actigraphy was not associated with depression and anxiety, self‐

reported sleep duration was consistently associated with psycho-
pathology in the current study and elsewhere (Luik et al., 2015). Self‐

reported and objectively assessed sleep duration also appeared to be

poorly correlated, and this possibly indicates that perceived sleep

reflects different aspects of sleep than the objective estimate. This

might be due to sleep misperception, which is more common in

patients with severe depressive and anxiety symptoms (Dittoni et al.,

To conclude, we found that persons with current depression and/

or anxiety exhibit reduced PA and more CR disturbances than

controls using actigraphy. As the correlations of actigraphy estimates
with self‐report measures were generally low, actigraphy monitoring

was shown to provide an easy and noninvasive approach to capture
objective information regarding both night time sleep and day‐time

activity, and, sleep and CR. In addition, persons with greater severity

and, among current cases, with more psychiatric comorbidity showed

lower PA and more CR disturbances. Therefore, adjunctive behavior-

al and chronotherapy interventions in depression and anxiety may

especially focus on these individuals. While this study confirms the

feasibility and acceptability of monitoring patients, more research is

needed to establish whether actigraphy could, possibly, in the future,

play a role in monitoring treatment response to such interventions.
