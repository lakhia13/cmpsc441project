Abstract

Much research seeks to articulate the brain structures and pathways implicated in addiction and 
addiction recovery. Prominent neurobiological models emphasize the interplay between cortical 
and limbic brain regions as a main driver of addictive processes, but largely do not take into 
consideration sensory and visceral information streams that link context and state to the brain 
and behavior. Yet these brain–body information streams would seem to be necessary elements of 
a comprehensive model of addiction. As a starting point, we describe the overlap between one 
current model of addiction circuitry and the neural network that not only regulates cardiovascular 
system activity but also receives feedback from peripheral cardiovascular processes through the 
baroreflex loop. We highlight the need for neurobiological, molecular, and behavioral studies of 
neural and peripheral cardiovascular signal integration during the experience of internal states and 
environmental contexts that drive alcohol and other drug use behaviors. We end with a call for 
systematic, mechanistic research on the promising, yet largely unexamined benefits to addiction 
treatment of neuroscience-informed, adjunctive interventions that target the malleability of the 
cardiovascular system to alter brain processes.

INTRODUCTION

Contemporary neurobiological models of addiction coalesce around interactions among 
specific limbic and cortical brain regions that are thought to control the imbalance 
of automatic/impulsive relative to deliberate/self-controlled behaviors associated with 
substance use disorder (SUD). Evidence suggests, however, that information streams from 
the body link context and bodily states to the brain’s behavioral outputs via both subcortical 
and cortical paths. The present article argues that the absence of body systems in current 
neurobiological addiction theories limits their translational and clinical value by missing a 
fundamental yet malleable source of individual variability. This individual variability can 
be tied to the seemingly automatic reactions to salient contexts and cues that interfere with 
more deliberate behavioral responses and can be therapeutically manipulated. We focus on 
the cardiovascular system as a source of consequential visceral information that is inherently 
embedded in the experience of addiction.

2 |  THE BODY RELAYS CONTEXT TO THE BRAIN

Alcohol and drug use behaviors are initiated in-the-moment based on internal dynamics, 
such as cortical and subcortical integration of sensory information with affective states that 
are often prompted by salient environmental cues.1 Further, body systems can promote 
addictive behaviors by, for example, their capacity to serve as “silent” drivers of attention 
allocation and embedded components of associative learning, motivation, and salience.2–4 
Theoretical models such as Damasio’s somatic marker hypothesis5 and Robinson and 
Berridge’s incentive salience hypothesis6 have led to important contributions in this area, 
but the specific ways in which body systems actively contribute to flexible or inflexible 
behavior towards alcohol and other drugs continues to receive only limited attention.7–10

The neurophysiology, functional anatomy, and molecular mechanisms of the bidirectional 
information streams that connect neural and cardiovascular processes have been well 
characterized.11 From this literature, the central autonomic network (CAN) was described 
as a coordinated network of forebrain, midbrain, and brain stem structures that centrally 
meditate autonomic nervous system functioning.12,13 This set of structures bears remarkable 
overlap with those articulated in various contemporary neurobiological models of addiction, 
and the structures conceptually implicated in core features of addictive behavior.14–16 Yet, 
translational addiction models have not gone much beyond a “black box” conceptualization 
of bodily inputs.

The body continually conveys signals that are components of arousal states and emotional 
tone to the brain through humoral (e.g., central chemoreceptors in the hypothalamus monitor 
the hematological milieu), vagal (i.e., cholinergic vagal afferents relay information about 
physiological states to sensory afferent cell bodies in the nodose ganglia that propagate 
to the CAN), and spinal pathways (e.g., the lamina 1 spinothalamocortical pathway with 
its somatotopic organization, conveying visceral information that converges with afferent 
information from cranial nerves before projecting to the CAN).17

Rather than being static inputs, however, there is marked complexity in how the brain 
receives and interprets this information. For instance, afferent signals from the heart may 
be manipulated or optimized at the level of the brain to alter the way affective stimuli are 
processed during differing psychological and physiological states.18–20 Additionally, meta-
analytic evidence points to distinct parasympathetic and sympathetic subnetworks to task 
negative (i.e., the default mode network) and task positive (i.e., the frontoparietal control 
network, salience network) networks, respectively,12 which further embeds cardiovascular 
activation pathways within the functional neural networks that orient an individual towards 
self-referential thought or externally oriented attention. Moreover, it underscores the 
importance of the cardiovascular system processes that often operate outside of awareness 
and contribute to the automaticity of substance use behaviors in addictive disorders.

We therefore posit that CAN-regulated cardiovascular dynamics are not independent parallel 
processes that regulate physiological processes such as heart rate and blood pressure, but are 
in fact integrated and necessary components of the brain’s response to any given challenge. 
To this point, mounting evidence suggests that central control of visceral reactivity is 
predictive rather than strictly reflexive, such that neural prediction errors contribute to 
exaggerated and blunted cardiovascular stress reactions that undermine adaptive whole-body 
responses to challenge.18 This is a conceptual departure from predominant theories such 
as Thayer’s heuristic neurovisceral integration model21 that have focused on cardiovascular 
processes as downstream indicators of neural integration, rather than active processes that 
may enhance neural regulation.

We hypothesize that the neural alterations elicited by addiction also negatively affect central 
control of cardiovascular processes and arousal. In turn, dysregulation in these processes can 
then contribute to or exacerbate deficits in brain circuit regulatory mechanisms underlying 
addiction. A corollary hypothesis discussed in a later section of this article shows that 
improving central control of cardiovascular processes with interventions such as heart rate 
variability (HRV) biofeedback provides physiological scaffolding to support behaviorally 
focused addiction interventions. As a starting point, to illustrate functional overlaps between 
putative addiction processes and the primary functions of CAN structures (Figure 1), we 
use Koob and Volkow’s widely discussed neurobiological model of addiction.22 We note, 
however, that the highlighted functional and structural overlaps are applicable to other 
neuroscientific models of addiction.15,23,24

3 |  PERIPHERAL AND CENTRAL CARDIOVASCULAR CONTROL IS 

ALTERED BY INTOXICATION

In Koob and Volkow’s neurobiological model of addiction,22 the binge/intoxication stage 
of the addiction cycle is characterized by substance seeking and use, loss of executive 
control mediated by glutamatergic systems,25 and the manifestation and reinforcement of 
incentive salience via phasic activation of dopaminergic systems.26 A number of subcortical 
neural structures, many in the basal ganglia, are implicated as primary drivers of the acutely 
reinforcing properties of alcohol and other drugs. These include the ventral tegmental area, 
substantia nigra pars compacta, nucleus accumbens, central nucleus of the amygdala, globus

pallidus, and thalamus. As exposure to intoxication–withdrawal cycles builds, the dorsal 
striatum is recruited to automate stimulus–response habits that drive further substance use 
related behaviors.

It is noteworthy how these areas, many of which are shared by the CAN, are highly 
interconnected with brainstem areas that regulate the cardiovascular and respiratory systems. 
Alterations of cardiovascular processes during the binge/intoxication stage have been 
extensively documented. HRV (the variability in consecutive R-spike to R-spike intervals in 
the electrocardiogram waveform), which is commonly used as a biomarker of cardiovascular 
adaptive capacity, decreases during acute intoxication, as does blood pressure variability.27 
Additionally, the sensitivity of the neurally mediated feedback loop that modulates blood 
pressure known as the baroreflex has also been shown to decrease in response to alcohol 
intoxication.28 In parallel, high risk drinkers show heightened response of an HRV index that 
captures baroreflex activation (i.e., the 0.1-Hz HRV index) to alcohol and other drug cues,29 
and vascular disruptions have been observed in binge drinkers within the first nine years of 
drinking.30

This raises the possibility that the allostatic load of repeated intoxication–withdrawal cycles 
leads to a loss of flexibility in the cardiovascular system in the same way flexibility 
is thought to be lost in other body systems such as the hypothalamic–pituitary adrenal 
axis under repeated intoxication–withdrawal.31 Thus, less accurate information about 
physiological context would be relayed to the brain, further undermining basal ganglionic 
regulatory process, and hypothetically contributing in discoverable ways to the aberrant 
cognitive, affective, and behavioral features of addiction.

4 |  CARDIOVASCULAR FEATURES ARE EMBEDDED IN NEGATIVE 

AFFECTIVE STATES

The aversive experience of substance withdrawal, characterized by substance-specific 
physiological symptoms and negative affect, is also proposed as essential to the addictive 
cycle. In the withdrawal/negative affect stage of Koob and Volkow’s model,22 the 
extended amygdala, through its projections to the hypothalamus and brainstem, and in 
the case of opioid withdrawal the locus coeruleus,32 drives physiological responses to 
neurological states such as those arising from withdrawal. Evidence for including peripheral 
physiological feedback in this stage of addiction is strong because extended amygdala 
components including the central nucleus of the amygdala, bed nucleus of the stria 
terminalis, and to a lesser extent, the basolateral amygdala are important components 
of the CAN,13 and by definition, the neural structures of the CAN serve by merging 
feedback from the heart and vasculature with higher order cognitive and affective factors 
derived in midbrain and forebrain structures, as well as with information from other 
autonomic systems. In doing so, visceral constituents of withdrawal and negative affect 
become embedded in the subjective affective experience of these states.17 Tachycardia/heart 
palpitations and diaphoresis, for example, are inextricably linked to the negative affective 
states that arise during acute alcohol or opioid withdrawal. This aligns with current theory 
that conceptualizes the structures of the dopaminergic extended amygdala as receivers of

information that are responsible for evaluating the emotional content of stimuli or states and 
allocating attention.9,22

5 |  CARDIOVASCULAR INFORMATION IS INTEGRATED CORTICALLY

Koob and Volkow also propose a substance preoccupation/anticipation stage of addiction 
characterized by incentive sensitization that is driven by the basolateral amygdala and 
insular cortex and processing of contextual information represented in the orbitofrontal, 
prefrontal, and anterior cingulate cortices, as well as the amygdala.22 The insula, prefrontal, 
and anterior cingulate cortices are reciprocally innervated with midbrain structures, brain 
stem nuclei, and the periphery in the service of integrating effortful and automatic 
information processing (Figure 1). To understand how visceral and sensory information 
become embedded in an addictive process, it is useful to consider the functional roles of 
these cortical structures, all of which integrate cognitive and emotional information with 
a variety of bodily sensations. A clear example is the insular cortex, which as the seat 
of interoception, is considered a primary viscerosensory area that mediates consciousness 
of feelings through its role in the representation of bodily states and urges.33,34 Large 
literatures further implicate this structure in emotional awareness, appetitive drive, and urges 
to use alcohol and other drugs.34,35

Diminished capacity of the executive system structures to regulate attention, salience, 
and craving is believed to be an essential component of addiction.36,37 The discussion of 
disruptions in attention and salience, and the experience of craving, raises consideration of 
the baroreflex feedback loop that delivers cardiovascular information to and from the brain 
and ensures a continuous bidirectional stream of modulation.38 This recursive feedback 
loop involves well-documented pathways from the brain to the heart, via the efferent 
parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous systems, and from the cardiovascular system to 
the brain (afferent traffic) through baroreceptors—mechanoreceptors in arterial walls that 
respond to vessel stretching in response to moment-to-moment changes in blood pressure 
(Figure 2).

Baroreceptors convey information to nucleus tractus solitarius neurons that then propagate 
information to higher neural centers that control peripheral resistance (i.e., vasculature tone) 
and heart rate, as well as behavioral responding. The entirety of the baroreflex feedback loop 
allows us to consider how system variability is generated and used to modulate homeostatic 
set points and adjust to chronic challenges either adaptively or maladaptively (i.e., allostatic 
load).39,40 Experimental evidence suggests baroreflex-mediated afferent signaling about 
cardiovascular variability participates in substance use behavior maintenance through its 
influence on attention capture by provocative cues, cue salience, and visceral reaction to 
cues.2 Thus, visceral arousal responses elicited by cues in the environment—such the sight 
of a regularly attended drinking establishment or substance use location—can influence 
attention capture and thereby serve to perpetuate or exacerbate preoccupation, salience, 
anticipation, and craving. Other pathways of heart–brain interaction, such as assessed by 
heartbeat-evoked potentials41 and direct modulation of neural blood flow and oxygenation,42 
further implicate cardiac cycle timing effects and predictive coding in attention and 
somatosensory perception.

6 |  CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS OF INCLUDING THE CARDIOVASCULAR 

SYSTEM IN MODELS OF ADDICTION

Cardiovascular disease progression associated with substance use is well studied,43,44 
but there is a need for laboratory and experimental study of the mechanistic role of 
cardiovascular changes in decision making,45 the emotion regulation failures associated with 
addiction,46 and their potential for rebound during recovery. We previously observed that 
women receiving a 12-week course of cognitive behavioral therapy for alcohol use disorder 
experienced improvements in cardiovascular regulation from pretreatment to posttreatment, 
even without stable abstinence.47 These improvements were observed across measures of 
metabolic activity, HRV, and baroreflex sensitivity. This study supported other research 
showing that improved baroreflex sensitivity may signal improved blood pressure regulation 
and cardio protection,48 as well as increased regulation of emotion, stress, and behavior,49 
and aligns with a growing literature showing improvements in cardiovascular processes 
following mindfulness-based interventions and cognitive behavioral therapy for a range of 
clinical presentations. It is likely that other treatments like dialectical behavior therapy 
give rise to similar improvements in cardiovascular functioning. Future clinical trials of 
psychotherapeutic interventions should include cardiovascular measures to explore such 
effects. Additionally, measures of cardiovascular regulation could serve as much needed 
objective measures of treatment response in clinical trials.50

Observed improvements in cardiovascular regulation in individuals receiving cognitive 
behavioral therapy further support the possibility that improved cardiovascular–brain 
feedback may serve as a scaffold to reinforce the goals of psychotherapy and behavior 
change. It is also possible that restoration of autonomic homeostasis may help individuals 
better buffer stress and mitigate craving. If, in fact, the cardiovascular system is capable 
of recovery even after years of chronic, heavy substance use,47 treatment adjuncts that 
directly target cardiovascular regulatory mechanisms such as the baroreflex may accelerate 
cardiovascular recovery in the service of sustaining substance use behavior change,51 as well 
as improving health and quality of life.

The idea that improvements in cardiovascular processes may help increase regulation 
of emotion, stress, and behavior is consistent with the observation that sympatholytic 
medications affecting the cardiovascular system are known to reduce stress, craving and 
substance use. Prazosin and doxazosin, two alpha-1 adrenergic inverse agonists commonly 
referred to as alpha-blockers and widely used to treat hypertension, reduce stress reactivity, 
craving, and the use of alcohol and other drugs,52–56 potentially by dampening high 
basal levels of sympathetic arousal commonly observed in individuals with SUD.55,56 
Whereas the effects of alpha-blockers on blood pressure are primarily driven by countering 
norepinephrine-mediated vasoconstriction via alpha-1 adrenergic receptors in the smooth 
muscle of the vasculature, effects on craving and substance use likely derive from direct 
actions on alpha-1 adrenergic receptors found throughout the central nervous system.

GABAergic drugs offer another class of medications with the potential to mitigate 
CAN/autonomic dysregulation in SUD.57 Acamprosate (Campral), for instance, is a 
centrally acting GABA agonist and glutamate antagonist58 that is hypothesized to

attenuate hyper-glutamatergic states associated with craving57 and relatedly effect reductions 
in psychophysiological arousal, as evidenced by reduced heart rate, galvanic skin 
conductance,59,60 and blood cortisol.61 Acamprosate may also reduce alcohol and other 
drug use, although findings to date have been mixed.62

Similar effects can also be achieved with HRV biofeedback, a behavioral intervention 
that originated from the observation that maximal increases in the amplitude of heart rate 
oscillation are produced when the cardiovascular system is rhythmically stimulated by 
paced breathing at a frequency of approximately 0.1 Hz (equivalent to six breaths per 
minute).63,64 This effect is linked to resonance properties of the cardiovascular system 
and the physiological phenomenon of respiratory sinus arrhythmia, that is, increases 
and decreases in heart rate in response to respiratory inhalation and exhalation. HRV 
biofeedback is empirically supported for treating a variety of disorders and performance 
enhancement, putatively through effects on baroreceptors and the vagal afferent pathway to 
frontal brain regions.65 A recent meta-analysis found that HRV biofeedback was associated 
with large effect size reductions in stress and anxiety that were not moderated by clinical 
diagnosis.66 A small but growing body of research also suggests that HRV biofeedback 
may be a useful complement to current first-line treatments for SUD. Preliminary studies 
suggested that both short67,68 and longer term69,70 courses of HRV biofeedback may help 
reduce craving levels beyond reductions observed during inpatient addiction treatment as 
usual, and relapse prevention housing. A recent systematic review suggested that HRV 
biofeedback and paced breathing proxies were useful for promoting decreases in craving, 
although larger and better controlled studies are needed.71

Theoretically, HRV biofeedback enhances communication between neural and 
cardiovascular systems that modulate physiological arousal in response to salient cues 
and internal states that trigger substance use, and thus may increase behavioral flexibility 
towards appetitive stimuli, and improve individuals’ capacity to regulate negative affect. 
Given the strong psychophysiological component of craving72 and HRV biofeedback’s 
ability to acutely effect major shifts in autonomic activation,65 it is possible that HRV 
biofeedback may mitigate craving by helping individuals restore autonomic homeostasis 
or executive control, or reduce autonomic allostatic load during craving states. It is also 
possible that HRV biofeedback may chronically enhance CAN regulatory capacity to 
buffer against craving or restore cardiovascular flexibility in the more generic service of 
supporting new learning. These speculations are empirically testable in human experimental 
studies designed to capture HRV biofeedback’s effects on craving, emotion, cognition, and 
behavior at multiple, integrated system levels using neuroimaging, electroencephalogram, 
electrocardiogram, cognitive tasks, neuropsychological tests, and subjective report. The 
growing availability and scalability (via mobile devices) of HRV biofeedback provides the 
means for expanded and ecologically valid study of enhanced baroreflex sensitivity and 
diminished in-the-moment cardiovascular reactivity to triggers as potential mechanisms that 
may interrupt substance use behaviors in the natural environment.

A recent proof-of-concept functional magnetic resonance imaging study supports this idea. 
Bates and colleagues20 exposed alcohol drinkers to two blocks of alcohol picture cues with 
an experimental group completing 5 min of 0.1-Hz breathing between alcohol cue blocks

(equivalent to six breaths per minute; a typical breathing rate in HRV biofeedback at which 
resonance between respiration and HRV occurs) and controls completing a low-demand 
cognitive task. During exposure to the second round of alcohol cues, the experimental group 
exhibited significantly less activation in brain regions involved in visual processing (i.e., left 
inferior and superior lateral occipital cortices, right inferior lateral occipital cortex, bilateral 
occipital pole, and temporal occipital fusiform cortices), while activation in brain areas 
implicated in behavioral control, internally directed cognition, and brain–body integration 
was increased (i.e., medial prefrontal, anterior and posterior cingulate, and precuneus 
cortices, paracingulate, and lingual gyri). The control group showed no significant changes 
in brain activation between alcohol cue exposures. These findings provide preliminary 
evidence that manipulation of the cardiovascular system with 0.1-Hz breathing alters neural 
activation in a manner theoretically consistent with a dampening of automatic sensory input 
and strengthening of higher level cognitive processing.

7 |  CONCLUSIONS

There remains vigorous debate about the neurological processes underlying the acute 
reinforcement of alcohol and other drugs, the learning and stimulus–response habits 
that drive further substance use, the aversive experience of substance withdrawal, and 
perseveration of motivational states (e.g., craving).45 The cardiovascular system, as well 
as other sensory and visceral systems, importantly contribute to these processes and the 
experience of addiction by providing contextual information to the brain, often outside 
of conscious awareness. This information can derive from and support an overlearned 
behavioral repertoire, even in opposition to conscious efforts to inhibit such responses. 
Physiological reactivity serves a critical role in survival and adaptation, but can also become 
maladaptive when reflexive, predictive, or over-learned responses (e.g., changes in heart rate 
and blood pressure) help to perpetuate SUD.

We suggest that neurobiological models that include sensory and visceral information 
streams are more complete because their inclusion allows models to more roundly explain 
the role of context and affective states in addiction and addiction recovery. Decades of 
psychophysiological research provides tractable experimental manipulations to test the 
plasticity of the baroreflex loop, and mobile assessment of physiological signals used to 
study cardiovascular mechanisms in the natural environment are now widely available. As 
such, as a field, we are well positioned to capture simultaneous visceral and neural response 
through well-defined and ecologically valid decisional and emotion regulation tasks that 
will inform more holistic models of addiction and recovery—work that is ongoing in the 
cognitive and affective neuroscience communities at large.45

Interest is growing in the way the cardiovascular and other physiological systems (e.g., 
immune and gastrointestinal) are involved in psychopathology, but research in these domains 
remains “fringe” in both biological and psychological sciences of addiction. In this article, 
we used Koob and Volkow’s neurobiological model of addiction as an example to point 
out several natural intersections between the brain, body, and behavior. We emphasized that 
without sensory and visceral input and reactions, the brain would be disconnected from 
the bodily context in which it exists. These ideas integrate well with other neuroscientific

models and theories of addiction,5,25,73 that provide an additional level for exploring core 
biological mechanisms underlying addictive disorders through Research Domain Criteria 
(RDoC).74 These ideas also align with calls for neuro-clinical assessment of individuals 
with addiction to characterize patients’ individual prognosis and probability of response to 
behavioral and pharmacological treatments.25

In conclusion, it is difficult to imagine a comprehensive model of addiction that does 
not consider sensory and visceral information streams and attendant bodily processes as 
fundamental components of behavioral responding. Expanding existing neurobiological 
models of addiction to more comprehensively integrate the neurological structures subsumed 
by the CAN and the sensory and visceral information streams it both controls and is 
influenced by, as well as connected bodily systems (e.g., cardiovascular, endocrine), will 
grow the translational and clinical utility of current models. Further, this will support the 
development of noninvasive, body-based interventions that specifically target the automatic 
physiological reactivity that so often undermines SUD recovery attempts and serve as a 
complement to existing cognitive-behavioral and pharmacotherapeutic approaches.

FIGURE 1. 
Integration of neural circuitry associated with Koob and Volkow’s addiction model and the 
central autonomic network (CAN). Koob and Volkow22 mapped specific neural circuits onto 
a three-stage addiction model that includes a binge/intoxication stage (blue), withdrawal/
negative affect stage (red), and preoccupation/anticipation/craving stage (green). These 
structures are heavily interconnected with the constellation of connected brain structures 
known as the CAN (gold/gold outline). LEFT: A three-dimensional rendering of the brain 
showing the integration of the CAN with structures implicated in the binge/intoxication 
stage (blue), withdrawal/negative affect stage (red), and preoccupation/anticipation/craving 
stage (green) of addiction. Overlap between these structures and the CAN are demarcated 
in blue, red, and green with a gold outline. RIGHT: A schematic of the brain to body 
(descending) and body to brain (ascending) pathways showing connectivity among the 
structures of the three-stage addiction cycle model, and the structures of the CAN (gold / 
gold outline). Note: for simplicity, not all projections noted below are shown. During the 
binge/intoxication stage (blue), the CAN likely participates through ascending pathways that 
integrate autonomic/visceral information via the thalamus. During the withdrawal/negative 
affect stage (red), the primary intersection of CAN and addiction circuitry appears to occur 
via projections to the extended amygdala. The CAN also shares significant overlap with 
the structures implicated in the preoccupation/anticipation/craving stage (green), including 
the medial prefrontal, orbitofrontal, insula, and anterior cingulate cortices, as well as 
the basolateral amygdala. Independent of the proposed neural circuitry of addiction,22 
evidence from decades of research on the CAN suggests that brain stem nuclei are key 
integration centers of autonomic/visceral information, and that these structures are highly 
interconnected to higher order brain structures. At the bottom right of the schematic is the 
nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS), the first central relay (ascending) for all medullary reflexes 
controlling cardiovascular functions (cardiac and baroreflex reflexes) and respiration 
(carotid chemoreflex and pulmonary mechanoreflexes). It receives and responds to stimuli 
from the heart, baroreceptors, lungs and gut, and directly communicates to higher brain 
areas like the hypothalamus and cortex. It further relays information to subcortical and

cortical centers via the parabrachial nuclei (PN), periaqueductal gray (PAG) region, and 
raphe nuclei (RN). The parabrachial nuclei are key regulators of cardiovascular, respiratory, 
and gastrointestinal functioning with ascending projections to the hypothalamus, amygdala, 
and insular and infralimbic cortex, as well as descending projections to the nucleus 
ambiguus (NAm). The parabrachial nuclei also receive converging visceral, nociceptive, 
and thermoreceptive inputs from the spinal cord and convey this information to the 
hypothalamus, amygdala, and thalamus. The periaqueductal gray likewise plays a critical 
role in autonomic regulation, motivated behavior, and behavioral responses to stress, as well 
as pain modulation via its extensive inputs from higher brain areas including the cortex, 
amygdala, and hypothalamus, with outputs to brainstem areas like the reticular formation 
(RF) and raphe nuclei. The raphe nuclei have a diverse range of roles including pain 
inhibition via the dorsal horn, temperature regulation, and modulation of circadian rhythms 
and alertness. Finally, the dorsal motor vagal nucleus (DMVN) provides primary descending 
parasympathetic control of the heart and is the motor operator for cardiac, baroreflex, and 
pulmonary reflexes; it receives indirect inputs from the cortex as well as direct inputs 
from the nucleus tractus solitarius. Abbreviations: ACC, anterior cingulate cortex; BLA,

FIGURE 2. 
Bidirectional neuro-cardiovascular pathways. Dynamic control of heart rate is maintained 
via efferent pathways from the brain via cranial (parasympathetic) and sympathetic nerve 
fibers of the autonomic nervous system. These efferent nerve fibers converge on the heart, 
mainly at the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes, to modulate moment-to-moment heart 
rate. Dynamic changes in blood pressure are likewise maintained via efferent sympathetic 
pathways that directly and indirectly control arterial tone (i.e., constricting or dilating 
blood vessels) through innervation of the arteries, and the secretion of epinephrine and 
norepinephrine via the adrenal medulla gland. These end organs then convey feedback 
to the brain via stretch receptors, called baroreceptors, in the aorta and carotid arteries. 
Activation of baroreceptors is relayed to the nucleus tractus solitarius and higher order 
central autonomic network (CAN) structures, thereby ensuring real-time information about 
blood pressure and heart rate is propagated to neural centers that control cardiovascular 
processes, as well as behavioral responding
