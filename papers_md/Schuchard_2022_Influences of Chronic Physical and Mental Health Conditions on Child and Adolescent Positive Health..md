Abstract

Objective:  Pediatric positive health refers to children’s assessments of their well-being. The 
purpose of this study was to contrast positive health for children aged 8 to 17 years with and 
without chronic physical and mental health conditions.

Methods—Data were drawn from the National Institutes of Health Environmental influences on 
Child Health Outcomes (ECHO) research program. Participants included 1,764 children ages 8 
to 17 years from 13 ECHO cohorts. We measured positive health using the PROMIS Pediatric 
Global Health and Life Satisfaction patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures. We used multiple 
regression to examine cross-sectional associations between the PROs and parent-reported health 
conditions and sociodemographic variables. We defined a meaningful difference in average scores 
as a PROMIS T-score difference of >3.

Results:  The sample included 45% 13–17 year-olds, 50% females, 8% Latinx, and 23% Black/
African-American. 54% had a chronic health condition. Of the 16 chronic conditions included in 
the study, only chronic pain (β = −3.5; 95% CI: −5.2 to −1.9) and depression (β = −6.6; 95% CI: 
−8.5 to −4.6) were associated with scoring >3 points lower on global health. Only depression was 
associated with >3 points lower on life satisfaction (β = −6.2; 95% CI: −8.1 to −4.3). Among those 
with depression, 95% also had another chronic condition.

Conclusion:  Many children with chronic conditions have similar levels of positive health as 
counterparts without chronic conditions. The study results suggest that negative associations 
between chronic conditions and positive health may be primarily attributable to presence or 
co-occurrence of depression.

Introduction

In recent years, there have been rising numbers of children with chronic health conditions 
and of individuals with multiple, co-occurring chronic conditions.1–3 Although biomedical 
science has primarily focused on negative outcomes of chronic conditions, the evaluation 
of positive health outcomes is important to identify factors that promote health and help 
individuals thrive.4 A positive health approach emphasizes that health is more than the 
absence of illness, and the presence of illness does not necessarily prevent individuals from 
leading lives that they evaluate as healthful and satisfying.5,6 Nevertheless, understanding 
the relationships between different types of chronic conditions and positive health outcomes 
may be useful to promote the health and well-being of children living with chronic 
conditions and help them adapt to health challenges.

The experiential component of positive health refers to evaluations and perceptions of one’s 
own health and well-being, which can be measured directly using patient-reported outcome 
(PRO) measures.5,7,8 The Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System 
(PROMIS) initiative provided researchers and clinicians with several pediatric positive 
health measures,7,8 including Global Health (perceptions of physical, mental, social, and 
overall health)9 and Life Satisfaction5 (evaluations of life as good).

By adopting positive health as one of five core outcome areas, the Environmental influences 
on Child Health Outcomes (ECHO) program provides opportunities to study positive health 
in large, diverse samples of children.10 The National Institutes of Health (NIH) launched the 
ECHO program in 2016 to support studies across the United States that address the effects 
of environmental exposures on children’s health and development. To date, data from 69 
cohorts have been submitted to the ECHO-wide Cohort Data Platform. The first multicohort 
ECHO study examined PROMIS Parent Proxy Global Health and Life Satisfaction for 
children aged 5 to 9 years.6 In that study, children with chronic conditions had slightly 
worse global health but similar levels of life satisfaction compared to those without chronic 
conditions. Other research has shown negative associations between life satisfaction and 
mental health problems such as depression in childhood.11–13

The purpose of this study was to examine self-reported global health and life satisfaction 
for children and adolescents aged 8 to 17 years with and without a variety of chronic 
physical and mental health conditions. In addition to studying an older age range, this study 
expanded on the prior study6 in several ways. This study included participants from 13 
cohorts, compared to three in the prior analysis, and sample sizes were sufficient to examine 
associations between specific health conditions and the outcomes. Recently developed 
nationally representative percentiles for PROMIS pediatric measures14 enabled comparisons 
between the study sample and the United States general population. Finally, we evaluated 
specific hypotheses regarding reports of children’s physical conditions (e.g., asthma, motor 
problems), cognitive conditions (e.g., developmental delays), and affective conditions 
(anxiety or depression). We hypothesized that physical and cognitive conditions would 
be associated with lower global health but not associated with life satisfaction, whereas 
affective conditions would be associated with lower global health and life satisfaction. Based 
on prior research, we also predicted lower global health and life satisfaction for older 
compared to younger children,15,16 for girls compared to boys,15,16 and for children with 
lower compared to higher socioeconomic status.5,6,17,18

Methods

Data Sources

The study was a cross-sectional retrospective analysis using data from the ECHO-wide 
Cohort Data Platform.19,20 This database serves as the repository for data submitted by 
ECHO researchers in accordance with the ECHO-wide Cohort Data Collection Protocol, 
which specifies data elements to be collected by all ECHO cohorts (see echochildren.org/
echo-program-protocol). The Protocol lists preferred and acceptable measures for each 
data element, and the ECHO Data Analysis Center and Person-Reported Outcomes Core

provided harmonized variables for data elements that were collected using a variety of 
cohort-specific and/or ECHO-wide forms (e.g., child race and household income).

To compare the characteristics of the ECHO study sample to a sample of the US general 
pediatric population, demographic and diagnosis data from the 2020 National Survey of 
Children’s Health (NSCH) were summarized for children ages 8 to 17 years. The Census 
Bureau conducted this mail and web-based survey using a national sample of US households 
with children. Details regarding survey methodology and public use data files may be found 
at the Census Bureau website.21

Study Sample

Participant inclusion criteria were the following: (1) completion of the PROMIS Pediatric 
Global Health and PROMIS Pediatric Life Satisfaction self-report measures within 30 days 
of each other, (2) age 8 to less than 18 years at the time of completing the PRO measures, 
and (3) data available on the presence of physical and mental health conditions.

Outcome Measures

Children completed the PROMIS Pediatric Global Health 7 questionnaire, which is used to 
measure perceptions of one’s physical, mental, and social health9 and the PROMIS Pediatric 
Life Satisfaction 8b questionnaire, which is used to measure evaluations of one’s life as 
good and satisfying.5 PROMIS instruments and information about the rigorous methods 
used to develop them7,8 may be found at healthmeasures.net. Each measure was calibrated 
to a scale with a mean of 50 and standard deviation of 10 using modern item response 
theory techniques. The PROMIS measures were scored using Bayesian expected a posteriori 
estimation22 implemented by the Firestar R-based simulation software.23 This procedure 
uses the item properties and individuals’ patterns of responses to estimate scale scores, 
which were linearly transformed to T-scores (T-score = score × 10 + 50).

Health Conditions and Covariates

Parents reported their children’s chronic health conditions, which we categorized as 
physical or mental. Physical health conditions included the following: asthma, cerebral 
palsy, chronic pain, epilepsy or seizure disorder, motor problems (fine and/or gross motor 
problems), head injury and/or brain injury, heart condition, hearing or ear problems, and 
vision problems (“problems with seeing”). Mental health conditions included two affective 
conditions (anxiety and depression) and the following cognitive conditions: attention-
deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD) or pervasive 
developmental delay, other developmental delays, intellectual disability, learning disability, 
speech or language disorder. Each condition in the study was missing values for fewer than 
5% of participants. To maximize sample sizes for the study, participants with missing values 
on a subset of the listed conditions were included and classified based on the available data. 
Participants were classified as having a physical condition if they had ever been diagnosed 
with at least one of the listed physical conditions, or they were classified as not having a 
physical condition if the available data did not include a diagnosis from the list. Similarly, 
participants were classified as having a mental health condition if they had ever been 
diagnosed with at least one of the listed mental conditions. Participants without any data on

the listed physical conditions or without any data on the mental conditions were excluded 
from the study.

The following sociodemographic information was determined for study participants and 
analyzed as dichotomous variables: child age at time of PRO administration (13–17 years vs. 
8–12 years), sex of the child at birth (female vs. male), annual household income (< $50,000 
vs. $50,00 or more), and parental educational attainment (less than college vs. some college 
or above). In addition, we used child race and ethnicity variables to create a combined 
race/ethnicity variable with the following categories: Hispanic, non-Hispanic Black, non-
Hispanic White, or non-Hispanic other races. For income and education, we selected 
cut-points that maximized sample sizes for these variables and selected the measurements 
that occurred nearest to the time of the child’s completion of the PRO measures; 96% of 
measurements on each variable occurred less than 3 years from PRO completion. Almost all 
measurements of parental education (97%) referred to the biological mother of the child.

Data Analyses

We used multiple regression to examine cross-sectional associations between the PROs 
and health conditions and sociodemographic variables. PROMIS Pediatric Global Health 
and Life Satisfaction T-scores were regressed on the sociodemographic variables and one 
or more health condition variables of interest. In preliminary analyses, we found that the 
ECHO cohort intraclass correlation coefficient was 0.01 for global health and 0.04 for life 
satisfaction. These results indicated that mixed models with cohorts as random effects were 
not necessary because little of the variance in the outcomes was attributed to differences 
between cohorts. Instead, each model included ECHO cohort (a 13-level categorical 
variable) as a covariate in addition to the selected sociodemographic variables. Tests of 
statistical significance used an alpha level of .05. We defined a meaningful difference 
between groups as a PROMIS T-score absolute difference of >3, which corresponds to a 
threshold of 0.3 standard deviation units. This minimum difference level is supported by 
other PROMIS studies that have computed minimally important differences.24,25

We examined the associations of global health and life satisfaction with sociodemographic 
variables and with having a physical condition only, cognitive condition only, affective 
condition only, or multiple types of conditions compared to no chronic condition, controlling 
for ECHO cohort in each model (Models 1a and 1b). Because prior studies have found 
gender differences on these outcomes to be larger in adolescence compared to younger 
ages,5,17 we also tested the interaction between child sex and age for each outcome. We next 
examined associations with specific physical and mental health conditions, controlling for 
ECHO cohort, sex, age, race/ethnicity, and income in each model (Models 2a, 2b, 3a, and 
3b). For Models 2–3, participants with missing data on any of the diagnoses in the model 
were excluded.

There were no data on household income for 184 participants (10%) and no data on 
parental education for 109 participants (6%). For these variables, multiple imputation was 
implemented using the mice package in R, which uses fully conditional specification.26 
This R package was used to create 20 multiply imputed datasets27 and conduct regression 
analyses on the pooled data. In addition, we conducted sensitivity analyses to examine

whether results were substantially different using case-wise deletion instead of multiple 
imputation. We repeated the regression analyses using the subset of participants with data on 
all study variables, including each health condition in the study (n = 1,296; 73% of total).

To compare global health and life satisfaction in the study sample to the United States 
general population, we used nationally representative percentiles for the two PROMIS 
measures.14 These percentiles enable the comparison of scores to the general population 
of children in the United States and provide cut-points to categorize and further aid 
interpretation of scores. The three categories for PROMIS pediatric scores are good (> 25th 
percentile), fair (6th–25th percentiles), and poor (≤ 5th percentile).14

Results

Participants

ECHO cohorts with 20 or more participants that met study inclusion criteria were included. 
Participants were 1,764 children from 13 of the 69 ECHO cohorts. Descriptions of the 
ECHO cohorts and participant recruitment methods are included in the Appendix. Most 
cohorts obtained a convenience sample by enrolling pregnant women at obstetrics practices 
and other local institutions. One cohort oversampled for infants at high risk for autism, 
and others oversampled for exposures associated with childhood illness, including smoking 
during pregnancy, preterm births, and low income. The number of participants from each 
cohort ranged from 23 to 433. The percentage of participants in each cohort with physical 
health conditions ranged from 22% to 58% (mean = 39%), and the percentage of participants 
in each cohort with mental health conditions (cognitive and/or affective) ranged from 20% to 
61% (mean = 38%).

Participant characteristics are reported and compared to the NSCH general population 
survey sample in Table 1. The mean age of participants was 12 years (SD = 3). The sample 
included 45% 13–17 year-olds, 50% females, 8% Latinx, 23% Black/African-American, and 
34% with annual household income of <$50,000. Participant characteristics for subgroups 
with different types of chronic conditions are included in the Appendix.

Chronic Conditions

The most common conditions in the ECHO study sample were ADHD (17%), anxiety 
(14%), and asthma (13%). These conditions were similarly common in the NSCH sample: 
ADHD (15%), anxiety (17%), and asthma (15%). The prevalence of all chronic conditions 
cannot be directly compared between the ECHO and NSCH samples due to differences in 
the questionnaires administered. However, 65% of parents in the NSCH sample reported that 
their child does not have any health conditions,1 whereas only 46% of children in the ECHO 
sample did not have any of the included conditions.

Global Health and Life Satisfaction

Across the 13 cohorts, the earliest dates of PROMIS measure completion occurred in 2017 
and the latest in 2021. The mean global health T-score for the full study sample was 
47.4 (range = 18–68; SD = 9.3), which corresponds to the 49th percentile in the general 
population, and the mean life satisfaction T-score was 48.8 (range = 18–63; SD = 9.3), 
which corresponds to the 50th percentile. These results indicate a similar level of positive 
health in the study sample as in the US general population.

Regression Analysis Results

Compared to children without chronic health conditions, children who only had physical 
health conditions had similar levels of global health (β = −1.5; 95% confidence interval 
[CI]: −2.7 to −0.3) and life satisfaction (β = −0.6; 95% CI: −1.8 to 0.6) (Table 2). Similarly, 
children who only had cognitive conditions had similar levels of global health (β = −1.3; 
95% CI: −2.8 to 0.2) and life satisfaction (β = −1.2; 95% CI: −2.7 to 0.3) compared to 
children without any chronic conditions. In contrast, children with affective conditions or 
multiple types of conditions scored on average 4–5 points lower on global health and on life 
satisfaction compared to children without any chronic conditions (Table 2).

Lower global health and life satisfaction were also significantly associated with older 
compared to younger ages, females compared to males, and lower compared to higher 
income, but most of these associations did not surpass the threshold of 3 points for a 
meaningful difference (Table 2). The addition of a child sex by age interaction term 
resulted in a significant interaction for global health (β = −3.5; 95% CI: −5.2 to −1.8) 
and for life satisfaction (β = −1.9; 95% CI: −3.6 to −0.2), indicating that the negative 
associations with the adolescent age range were greater for females than for males. Because 
parental education was not associated with either outcome, this variable was not included in 
subsequent analyses. Each of the remaining regression models included all other covariates 
(i.e., ECHO cohort, sex, age, race/ethnicity, and income), but we focus on the results of the 
chronic condition variables.

The analysis of specific mental health diagnoses showed that depression was associated with 
more than one-half standard deviation lower scores on global health (β = −6.6; 95% CI: 
−8.5 to −4.6) and on life satisfaction (β = −6.2; 95% CI: −8.1 to −4.3). No other affective 
or cognitive condition was associated with a difference of more than 3 points on either 
outcome (Table 3). Of the specific physical health conditions in the study, only chronic 
pain was associated with scoring more than 3 points lower on global health (β = −3.5; 
95% CI: −5.2 to −1.9), and no physical health conditions were associated with more than 
3 points lower on life satisfaction (Table 3). To further examine the association of chronic 
pain with global health, we reran the physical conditions model with two separate chronic 
pain variables: chronic pain without comorbid depression (n = 114) and chronic pain with 
comorbid depression (n = 22). Chronic pain without depression was associated with less 
than 3 points lower on global health (β = −2.6; 95% CI: −4.4 to −0.9), whereas chronic pain 
with depression was associated with scoring nearly one standard deviation lower (β = −9.1; 
95% CI: −13.0 to −5.2). We obtained similar results in all analyses using case-wise deletion 
for missing data (see Appendix).

Comparisons to the US General Population

Because the regression analyses revealed that depression had the strongest associations with 
the study outcomes, we examined the prevalence of depression in the study sample and 
compared outcomes for participants with and without depression to the general population. 
We found that the prevalence of depression was < 1% among children without any other 
chronic health condition. In contrast, 12% of children with physical health conditions, 14% 
of children with cognitive conditions, and 41% of children with anxiety also had depression.

Comparisons to the general population are displayed in Figure 1 for participants with no 
chronic condition, with depression, and with other health conditions without depression. For 
children with depression, the 95% confidence intervals around the mean global health and 
life satisfaction T-scores fell within the range of fair scores (i.e., 6th – 25th percentiles). 
Children with chronic pain but no comorbid depression had mean global health and life 
satisfaction T-scores that fell below the median of the general population but within the 
range of good scores (i.e., >25th percentile). Mean global health and life satisfaction 
T-scores for children with other health conditions were similar to children without chronic 
conditions and to the general population.

Discussion

The positive health approach focuses on outcomes of child well-being, which is consistent 
with the World Health Organization definition of health as more than the absence of disease 
and a complete state of physical, mental, and social well-being.28 This study showed that 
the relationship between chronic conditions and positive health outcomes depends on the 
type of health condition. Children with only physical or cognitive health conditions had 
similar global health and life satisfaction compared to those without chronic conditions, 
whereas children with affective or multiple health conditions had lower global health and 
life satisfaction. Of the 16 physical and mental health conditions included in the study, 
only chronic pain and depression were associated with meaningful differences in global 
health, and only depression was associated with meaningful differences in life satisfaction. 
These results highlight the impact of persistent pain and/or emotional distress on children’s 
evaluations of their lives and the need to address these issues.

Children with chronic conditions who did not have depression were remarkably similar in 
positive health outcomes to those without chronic conditions and to the general population. 
These results expand on a growing body of work5,6,13,16 showing that living with a chronic 
condition does not preclude life satisfaction and other positive health outcomes for children 
and adolescents, including a prior study of parent-proxy life satisfaction for children aged 
5–9 years across three ECHO cohorts.6 Compared to individuals without chronic conditions, 
similar levels of life satisfaction have been observed for youth with cancer,29 adolescents 
with mild mental disabilities,30 and adolescents who had a chronic condition at 7 years of 
age.31 In addition, recent studies of children and youth with chronic kidney disease32 and 
Crohn’s disease33 found that the distributions of PROMIS Pediatric Life Satisfaction scores 
in the study samples were similar to the US general population.

Unlike other health conditions in this study, depression was strongly associated with worse 
outcomes on the positive health measures. Notably, 95% of children with depression had 
an additional chronic condition. The prevalence of depression among participants without 
any chronic conditions (<1%) was markedly lower than among participants with physical 
conditions (12%) or cognitive conditions (14%). The results are consistent with prior 
findings that children with chronic conditions are more likely to experience mental health 
problems34 and that life satisfaction is lower for children with mental health problems.11–13

Results from this study corroborated prior findings of sociodemographic variables that are 
associated with health and life satisfaction in children. As in this study, prior research 
has shown lower global health and life satisfaction for adolescents compared to younger 
children, with the decline in adolescence particularly pronounced for girls compared to 
boys.5,15–17 Lower income levels in this and prior studies were also associated with lower 
global health and life satisfaction, demonstrating socioeconomic disparities in positive health 
outcomes.5,6,17,18

Study Limitations and Future Directions

Although the study included a large, diverse sample of children, it was not representative 
of the general population. In particular, the sample had a high percentage of children with 
chronic health conditions because some studies within the ECHO-wide cohort focused 
on risk factors for illness in childhood. Nevertheless, most cohorts in this study used 
convenience samples of pregnant women from the general population, and the prevalence 
of a number of common conditions in the ECHO sample (e.g., ADHD, asthma, chronic 
pain, learning disabilities, anxiety, depression) was similar to the general population NSCH 
sample.

Despite the large proportion of participants with chronic conditions in the study, it is 
possible that some participants were incorrectly classified as not having a physical or mental 
health condition due to incomplete data. Sensitivity analyses using only complete cases 
supported the main findings of the study, but all diagnosis data relied on parental report 
rather than medical records, and the list of health conditions was restricted to the conditions 
with data available in the ECHO-wide Data Platform. Because we used reports of whether 
a condition was “ever diagnosed,” there may have been cases in which a condition was not 
present when the PROMIS data were collected. In addition, we did not have sufficient data 
to examine the effects of specific characteristics of each condition (e.g., disease duration 
or severity) on positive health outcomes, which will be important directions for future 
research. Other future directions include examining associations between positive health and 
characteristics of special health needs such as visibility, stability, and severity rather than 
specific diagnoses.35,36 In addition, there may be differences depending on whether children 
or parents report the characteristics of the children’s health conditions.37

This study highlighted the importance of children’s mental health for life satisfaction. 
Prior research suggests that mothers’ mental health can impact their children’s mental 
health and life satisfaction,18,38 whereas positive family experiences correlate strongly with 
better life satisfaction for children and adolescents.12 Together, these findings emphasize the 
importance of both children and parents’ mental health for children’s well-being. Because

this and many prior studies were cross-sectional, however, causality cannot be determined. 
The examination of causal pathways and modifiable factors that affect positive health are 
needed to elucidate the associations that have been found among the physical and mental 
health of children and their parents.11,39,40

Clinical Implications

Although further work is needed to support the generalizability of the study results to 
the general pediatric population, this study has notable implications for promoting positive 
health. The findings suggest that negative impacts of chronic conditions on children and 
adolescents’ well-being may be primarily attributable to an increased risk for persistent 
emotional distress. The symptoms of physical health conditions and developmental disorders 
may last for years or even a lifetime, but it is possible that negative effects on life 
satisfaction could be minimized by interventions that prevent and treat comorbid mental 
health problems. Such interventions could include regular screening for depression, 
particularly among children with chronic conditions. The US Preventive Services Task 
Force recommends routine depression screening for children 12 and older in primary care 
settings,41 but children younger than 12 may benefit from such screening as well. It may 
also be beneficial to increase the availability of psychiatry consultation teams to primary 
care providers, such as the services provided by the Massachusetts Child Psychiatry Access 
Project42 and the Pennsylvania Telephonic Psychiatric Consultation Service Program.43 
Examining the effects of interventions like these on positive health outcomes has the 
potential to shift the perspective of health as the absence of illness to the promotion of 
positive health outcomes for children with or without chronic conditions.

What’s New

This study showed that many children and adolescents with chronic health conditions 
are remarkably similar in positive health outcomes to those without chronic conditions. 
Negative associations between chronic conditions and life satisfaction may be primarily 
attributable to co-occurrence of depression.

Notes. The 2020 National Survey of Children’s Health columns include data from the specified NSCH items for all participants aged 8 to 17 
years in the public use files available at https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/nsch/data/datasets.html. All diagnosis data were obtained via 
parents’ report of whether their child ever had the diagnosis, with the exception of NSCH items PHYSICALPAIN (report of chronic pain in past 12 
months) and K2Q43B (report of current hearing problems). The denominator for each percentage is the number of participants with data available 
for the condition. Missing data in the ECHO study sample included the following: asthma n=80; motor problems n=70; head or brain injury n=62; 
intellectual disability n=57; chronic pain n=53; speech disorder n=52; learning disability n=44; depression n=43; vision problems n=40; ADHD 
n=37; ASD n=36; cerebral palsy n=32; heart condition n=32; anxiety n=18; epilepsy n=7; hearing problems n=2.
