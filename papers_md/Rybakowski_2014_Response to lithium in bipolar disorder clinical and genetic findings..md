ABSTRACT: The use of lithium is a cornerstone for preventing recurrences in bipolar disorder (BD). The
response of patients with bipolar disorder to lithium has diﬀerent levels of magnitude. About one-third of
lithium-treated patients are excellent lithium responders (ELR), showing total prevention of the episodes. A
number of clinical characteristics were delineated in patients with favorable response to lithium as regards to
clinical course, family history of mood disorders, and psychiatric comorbidity. We have also demonstrated
that
features of hypomania (a hyperthymic temperament) and a lack of cognitive
disorganization predict the best results of lithium prophylaxis. A degree of prevention against manic and
depressive episodes has been regarded as an endophenotype for pharmacogenetic studies. The majority of
data have been gathered from so-called “candidate” gene studies. The candidates were selected on the basis
of neurobiology of bipolar disorder and mechanisms of
lithium action including, among others,
neurotransmission, intracellular signaling, neuroprotection or circadian rhythms. We demonstrated that
response to lithium has been connected with the genotype of BDNF gene and serum BDNF levels and have
shown that ELR have normal cognitive functions and serum BDNF levels, even after long-term duration of
the illness. A number of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of BD have been also performed in
recent years, some of which also focused on lithium response. The Consortium on Lithium Genetics (ConLiGen) has established
the large sample for performing the genome-wide association study (GWAS) of lithium response in BD, and the ﬁrst results have
already been published.

■ LITHIUM AS A MOOD-STABILIZING DRUG

Bipolar disorder (BD), for which principal symptoms constitute
recurrent manic and depressive episodes, is a serious mental
illness, with a worldwide prevalence of 2−5% of
the
population.1 BD imposes a great burden on both patients
and their families, and approximately 10−20% of patients
commit suicide over the course of their illness.2 In a recent ﬁfth
edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
Disorders, bipolar disorder makes a separate category, with
main clinical diﬀerentiation based on the severity of manic
episodes into bipolar I, with full-blown manic episodes, and
bipolar II, with hypomanic ones.3

In the treatment of bipolar disorder, mood stabilizing drugs
play the most important role. A mood stabilizer can be deﬁned
as a drug that, if used as monotherapy, (1) acts therapeutically
in mania or/and in depression; (2) acts prophylactically against
manic or/and depressive episodes, as demonstrated in a trial of
at least one year’s duration, and (3) does not worsen any
therapeutic or prophylactic aspect of the illness outlined above.
lithium was ﬁrst observed by the
The antimanic eﬀect of
Australian psychiatrist, John Cade, 65 years ago,4 and its mood-
stabilizing eﬃcacy (preventing manic and depressive recur-
rences in mood disorders) was described in the early 1960s by
the British psychiatrist, Geoﬀrey Hartigan.5 In 1970−1973, the
results were published of eight controlled studies researching
the prophylactic eﬀectiveness of lithium and including the use
of placebo carried out in Europe (in Denmark and the U.K.)
and in the United States. Analysis showed that the percentage

of patients in whom recurrences of depression or mania
occurred was signiﬁcantly lower while receiving lithium (on
average 30%) than while receiving placebo (on average 70%).6
The prophylactic eﬀectiveness of lithium has been conﬁrmed
in two meta-analyses performed in the ﬁrst decade of the 21th
century. Geddes et al.,7 covering 5 randomized controlled trials
involving 770 patients, showed that lithium was more eﬀective
than a placebo in preventing all relapses, with a relative risk
(RR) of 0.65, being slightly better against manic recurrences
(RR = 0.62) than against depressive recurrences (RR = 0.72).
Nivoli et al.8 performed a systematic research of long-term
treatment randomized controlled trials enrolling 1561 bipolar
patients with at least 6 months of follow-up, of whom 534 were
randomized to lithium. They concluded that, while earlier
studies suggested a high eﬀectiveness of lithium against both
mania and depression, more recent ones show greater evidence
of
lithium prophylaxis against manic
relapses. Nowadays, lithium is still regarded as the cornerstone
of the long-term therapy of bipolar disorder.9

not having further recurrences of the illness and thus able to
live a totally normal
life. In our study on bipolar patients
entering lithium prophylaxis in the 1970s (60 patients) and in
the percentage of patients not
the 1980s (49 patients),
experiencing aﬀecting episodes on lithium monotherapy for
over a 10 year period was 35% and 27%, respectively, roughly
one-third of lithium-treated subjects.11

A degree of prevention against recurrences of manic and
depressive episodes during long-term lithium treatment can be
assessed either
retrospectively or prospectively, and the
response can be expressed in either categorical or dimensional
terms. The most frequent categorical assessment consists of
three categories: (1) excellent lithium responders (ER), no
aﬀective episodes on lithium; (2) partial
lithium responders
(PR,: 50% reduction in the episode index, deﬁned as number of
episodes per year compared to prelithium period; (3) lithium
nonresponders (NR), <50% reduction, no change or worsening
in the episode index, deﬁned as number of episodes per year
compared to prelithium period.

In 2002, the Canadian researchers (Alda et al.) introduced a
scale allowing quantitative retrospective assessment of
the
quality of prophylactic lithium response.12 This scale is referred
to as “the Alda scale”. In this scale, criterion A rates the degree
of response (activity of the illness while on adequate lithium
treatment) on a 10 point scale. Criteria B1−B5 establish
whether there is a causal relationship between the improvement
and the treatment. Criterion B involves B1, the number of
episodes oﬀ the treatment; B2, frequency of episode oﬀ the
treatment; B3,
treatment; B4, compliance
during period(s) of stability; and B5, the use of additional
medications during the periods of stability. The total score is
obtained by subtracting B from A and is in the range 0−10.
Therefore, this scale allows for either a categorical assessment
(i.e., below or above some cutoﬀ point) or a dimensional
assessment of lithium response.

the duration of

The stability of lithium response over time has been a subject
of considerations. In his recent review, Post13 presents two
diﬀerent forms of acquired treatment resistance to lithium. The
ﬁrst is a refractoriness due to discontinuation of lithium after a
good long-term response. In such cases, the next recurrence
favorably respond to lithium used in previously
does not
eﬀective doses. The second is a refractoriness due to a possible
tolerance to lithium. In such cases, after a good long-term
response, the aﬀective episodes appear, sometimes of increased
in a recent
frequency, and duration. However,
severity,
multicenter study including 346 lithium-treated patients,
it
was found that
the mean morbidity index in this group
remained stable over a period of 20 years.14

A great deal of research has been performed trying to
elucidate clinical and genetic factors connected with lithium
eﬃcacy, with the assessment of such eﬃcacy by the three
categories or/and the Alda scales. A degree of prevention
against recurrences of manic and depressive episodes during
long-term lithium treatment (e.g., excellent lithium responders)
was regarded as an endophenotype for pharmacogenetic

studies.■ CLINICAL FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH LITHIUM

EFFICACY

In 2010, Grof,15 summarizing the issue of excellent lithium
responders pointed to such clinical features of this group as the
illness course with distinct aﬀective episodes and periods of
complete remission. He also noticed that these patients have

low psychiatric comorbidity and frequent bipolar family history.
Their clinical picture would thus reﬂect a “classic” form of the
bipolar disorders, whose features are similar to those described
by Kraepelin16 as manisch-depressives Irresein.

Five years earlier, a meta-analysis of clinical factors associated
with lithium eﬃcacy was performed by Kleindienst et al.17 The
authors investigated 42 potential clinical predictors of lithium
prophylactic eﬃcacy based on the results of 43 studies. Two
factors connected with better eﬀect of lithium were identiﬁed,
namely, an episodic pattern of mania-depression sequences and
later age of illness onset. On the other hand, three factors were
found which may weaken the prophylactic eﬀect of lithium,
such as an episodic pattern of depression-mania sequence, a
high number of previous hospitalizations, and continuous
cycling. This may indicate that lithium eﬃcacy is related to a
predominant manic pole as well as to lower severity of the
disorder.

There are also studies comparing lithium responders with
those responding favorably to other mood-stabilizing drugs. In
the German Multicenter Study of Long-Term Treatment of
Aﬀective and Schizoaﬀective Psychoses (the MAP study)
comparing the diﬀerential eﬃcacy of lithium versus carbama-
zepine in a randomized clinical trial with an observation period
of 2.5 years, patients with the classical
form of the illness
(bipolar I without mood-incongruent delusions and without
comorbidity) had the prophylactic eﬃcacy of lithium superior
to that of carbamazepine, while the opposite was true for
patients with the nonclassical form of the illness.18 Therefore, it
may be suggested that carbamazepine responders may have an
atypical bipolar disorder, characterized by mood-incongruent
delusions and comorbidity. It is likely that the clinical features
of responders to carbamazepine are similar to those of another
mood-stabilizing anticonvulsant drug, valproate.

In a study attempting to delineate clinical and family history
features of responders to lamotrigine, in contrast to responders
to lithium, it was found that the course of illness in lamotrigine
responders was rapid cycling or chronic, while episodic in
responders to lithium, and lamotrigine-responders had higher
comorbidity of panic disorder and substance abuse compared
to lithium responders. The relatives of lithium responders had a
signiﬁcantly higher risk of bipolar disorder, while relatives of
lamotrigine responders had a higher prevalence of schizo-
aﬀective disorder, major disorder, and panic attacks.19

In our recent study,20 we included 111 patients (76 women,
35 men) with bipolar disorder, aged 34−85 years (mean 61
years), receiving lithium for 5−39 years (mean 18 years).
Bipolar I was diagnosed in 79 patients, and diagnosis of bipolar
II was made in 32 patients. Lithium eﬃcacy was assessed by the
identifying excellent responders (ER),
three-category scale,
partial responders (PR), and nonresponders (NR), as well as
with the Alda Scale, estimating eﬃcacy within the range 0−10.
Among patients studied, 27% met criteria for ER, 63% for PR,
and 10% for NR and the mean score in Alda scale was 6.6 ±
2.5.

The results of our study conﬁrmed some factors, previously
suggested as connected with lithium response, and contradicted
the others. We conﬁrmed better eﬀect of lithium prophylaxis in
patients with later onset of illness, shown in previous studies,
covering a total of 1138 patients.17 However, we did not ﬁnd a
relationship between lithium eﬃcacy and duration of illness
before lithium. This contradicts the suggestions of Franchini et
al.21 and Ketter et al.22 about a better prophylactic eﬀect of
lithium in patients in which lithium treatment had been

instituted within a short duration of the illness. We also found a
better eﬀect of lithium in bipolar II versus bipolar I patients,
while such a diﬀerence was not found in the analysis of
Kleindienst et al.17

The early studies of Maj et al.23 as well as Mendlewicz et al.24
suggested that better eﬀect of lithium may be connected with
more frequent family history of mood disorder. However, in a
subsequent paper of Coryell et al.,25 familial
loading with
bipolar disorder was not associated with better outcome with
lithium. Our results seem to show the opposite, as patients
without family history of mood disorder had signiﬁcantly higher
score on the Alda scale compared with those with such a history
(7.0 ± 2.2 vs 5.8 ± 2.7, respectively). In this context, a paper of
Misra and Burns26 can be mentioned, where in a group of
severe lithium nonresponders 3/4 of them had family history of
mood disorder. On the other hand, we observed that having
family members receiving lithium was connected with better
prophylactic eﬀect of
lithium. Probably, a decision to start
treatment with lithium in a family member was based on good
eﬃcacy of this drug in the patient. This may also conﬁrm the
opinion of Grof15 that a favorable eﬀect of lithium is heritable.
Young et al.27 showed a trend toward lithium non-
responsiveness in bipolar patients with comorbid anxiety
disorders. The results of our study indicate that the impact of
comorbid anxiety disorders on the degree of prophylactic
lithium eﬀect may be sex-speciﬁc. We have found that men with
comorbid anxiety disorders had signiﬁcantly poorer response to
lithium as measured with the Alda scale compared to those
without (5.5 ± 2.1 vs 7.0 ± 2.2) while the opposite was true in
women (7.3 ± 2.0 vs 6.3 ± 2.9, respectively).

In a study of O’Connell et al.,28 including 248 lithium-treated
bipolar patients, current alcohol and drug abuse was associated
with poor outcome. In our sample, 34% of men showed
diﬀerent degrees of alcohol abuse/dependence, and the eﬃcacy
of
lithium in this group was poorer compared with the
remaining group (5.4 ± 2.2 vs 6.8 ± 2.2 respectively).

We have also performed research to delineate a speciﬁc
personality proﬁle for the best lithium response. In 71 patients
treated with lithium carbonate for 5−37 years (mean 18 years),
their temperamental aﬀective
an assessment was made of
proﬁles using the Temperament Scale of the Memphis, Pisa,
Paris and San Diego-Autoquestionnaire (TEMPS-A),29 and
their schizotypic traits by means of
the Oxford-Liverpool
Inventory of Feelings and Experiences (O-LIFE).30 The scores
obtained on these scales were correlated with the assessment of
prophylactic lithium eﬃcacy by means of the Alda scale.

TEMPS-A measures ﬁve temperaments: depressive, cyclo-
thymic, hyperthymic, irritable, and anxious. In our study, the
response to lithium correlated signiﬁcantly positively with the
hyperthymic temperament score, and negatively with the
anxiety, cyclothymic, and depressive temperament scores.31
These results may conﬁrm the studies dating back to Cade’s4
original report, which indicated a primacy of the antimanic
action of lithium, and of analyses, showing a better eﬀect of
lithium in episodic patterns of mania−depression sequence.17
Therapeutic eﬀect of
in acute
euphoric mania, related to hyperthymic temperament.32 The
negative correlation with a cyclothymic temperament may
correspond to the worse eﬀect of
lithium in patients with
continuous cycling.17

lithium is more signiﬁcant

The subscales of the O-LIFE include unusual experiences,
cognitive disorganization,
introversion/anhedonia and impul-
sive nonconformity. A signiﬁcant negative correlation of lithium

eﬃcacy with cognitive disorganization, and an insigniﬁcantly
negative correlation with the remaining three subscales was
demonstrated.33 A dimension of cognitive disorganization is
highly associated with “psychoticism” and increases the risk for
schizophrenia and bipolar disorder with psychotic symptoms.34
A negative correlation between a tendency to psychotic
symptoms and lithium eﬃcacy is consistent with clinical
experiences which shows that lithium is devoid of antipsychotic
eﬀects.

■ GENETIC FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH LITHIUM

EFFICACY

Candidate Genes. Pharmacogenetics of

response to
lithium was the topic of several reviews, published in the past
5 years,35−38 including that written by the author of this
paper,39 on which this section will be mostly based, with some
additions of recent ﬁndings. The majority of data have been
gathered from so-called “candidate” gene studies,
the
candidates being selected on the basis of neurobiology of
lithium action. Within
bipolar disorder and mechanisms of
candidate genes,
those connected with neurotransmission,
intracellular signaling, neuroprotection, or circadian rhythm
have been studied. In this Review, a separate subchapter will be
dedicated to the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)
and its connection with lithium eﬀects on cognition, reﬂecting
studies performed by the author’s group.

Among neurotransmitters, the serotonergic system has long
been implicated in the neurobiology of bipolar disorder and the
mechanism of lithium action.40 In genetic research, a functional
promoter polymorphism of the serotonin transporter gene (5-
HTTLPR) located on chromosome 17q12, where a short (s)
allele is connected with lower activity of the gene, has been
most frequently studied. A short allele of 5-HTTLPR has been
associated with a predisposition to aﬀective disorder, both

the enzyme of serotonin synthesis,

bipolar and unipolar41 and with a poor
response to
antidepressants in a Caucasian population.42 In several studies,
including ours,43−45 an association between the s allele and
prophylactic lithium nonresponse was demonstrated. However,
it was not conﬁrmed in two subsequent papers.46,47 Another
study,48 on a polymorphism of
tryptophan
hydroxylase,
found a
marginal association with lithium response. As to dopaminergic
system, Severino et al.49 showed an association between bipolar
illness and A48G polymorphism of the dopaminergic receptor
D1 (DRD1) gene, located on chromosome 5q35, and we have
demonstrated an association of this polymorphism with lithium
response.50 A role of
the glutamatergic system in the
pathogenesis of bipolar illness and the mechanisms of lithium
action has also been postulated, with special emphasis on
glutamate receptor NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate). However,
in our study,51 any association between three polymorphisms in
the NMDA receptor 2B subunit (GRIN2B) gene and lithium
response was not shown. The Src family, tyrosine kinase FYN,
plays a key role in the interaction between brain-derived
neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and the glutamatergic receptor
NMDA and the FYN gene is located on chromosome 6q21. We
showed an association between two polymorphisms of the FYN
gene and bipolar disorder52 and a marginal association between
T/C polymorphism of this gene and lithium response.53

The eﬀect of

therapeutic action of

lithium on the phosphatidyl

inositol (PI)
intracellular signaling, has long been considered the most
important mechanism of
this ion in
bipolar disorder.54 However, this was not markedly reﬂected in
molecular-genetic studies of lithium response. An association
with such a response was obtained with polymorphism of the
inositol polyphosphate 1-phosphatase (INPP1) gene located on
chromosome 2q32,55 also in patients with comorbid post-
traumatic stress disorder.56 However, this was not replicated in
a study by Brazilian investigators.46 Studies on the poly-
morphisms of other genes connected with the PI system, such
as inositol monophosphatase2 (IMPA2) and diacylglycerol
kinase eta (DGKH) genes, did not ﬁnd any associations with
lithium response.57,58 Another intracellular signaling system
inﬂuenced by lithium is the cyclic adenosine monophosphate
(cAMP) pathway. Mamdani et al.59 performed an association
study with genes for cAMP-response binding protein (CREB)
and found an association between bipolar disorder and lithium
response and two polymorphisms of CREB1 gene located at
chromosome 2q32−34. In connection with this, Canadian
investigators recently showed that alterations in phosphorylated
CREB (pCREB) signaling may constitute AN endophenotype
of lithium-responsive bipolar disorder.60
Compelling evidence suggests that,

lithium action in bipolar disorder, the inhibition of glycogen
synthase kinase 3beta (GSK3β),

neuroprotection (synaptic plasticity, apoptosis) as well as in the

investigators demonstrated an association between functional
the GSK3β gene located on

chromosome 3q13, and lithium response62 but this was not
conﬁrmed in two other studies,

network coordinating circadian rhythms, GSK3β interacts with
a number of proteins, including Rev-Erb-α, and a variant of the
Rev-Erb-α gene,
located on chromosome 17q11, has been
shown, in two recent studies, to be associated with prophylactic

In the Poznan center, a molecular-genetic study of multiple
polymorphisms of circadian rhythm genes such as CLOCK
(circadian locomotor output cycle kaput), ARNTL (aryl
hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator-like, TIM (timeless
circadian clock), and PER3 (period circadian clock 3) was
carried out in relation to the eﬃcacy of lithium prophylaxis. An
association was found between both polymorphisms and
the ARNTL and TIM genes (chromosome
haplotypes of
respectively), and lithium
locations 11p15 and 12q13,

Also in our Department, we carried out genetic studies on
matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), extracellularly acting
implicated in a number of pathological
endopeptidase,
conditions including cancer, cardiovascular and neuropsychi-
atric diseases. We demonstrated an association between
functional polymorphism of
located on
chromosome 20q11−13, and bipolar disorder.67 However, we
were unable to ﬁnd such an association with lithium response.68
On the other hand, we did ﬁnd an association with
polymorphism of the glucocorticoid receptor (NR3C1) gene
located on chromosome 5q31−32,69
implicated in the
pathogenesis of bipolar disorder.70

the MMP-9 gene,

Positive results have been obtained concerning associations
of three genes located on chromosome 22q11−13 with lithium
response. A signiﬁcant association between lithium response
and genetic variations in the breakpoint cluster region (BCR)
gene located on chromosome 22q1171 and with the X-box
binding protein 1 (XBP1) gene located on chromosome
22q1272 was found. A predisposition to bipolar disorder
connected with both these genes had been previously
reported.73,74 Silberberg et al75 described an association with
lithium response and the calcium channel gamma-2 subunit
(CACNG2) gene, also known as
located on
chromosome 22q13.

stargazin,

In conclusion, candidate gene studies mentioned above have
shown a number of associations between the polymorphism of
a given gene and a prophylactic response to lithium. The
apparent limitation is that, only a minority of them has been
consistently replicated. Furthermore, each of
the single
nucleotide polymorphisms of a given gene accounts for a
small portion of the total variance in lithium response (1−2% at
best). Therefore, lithium response is apparently polygenic, and
only by simultaneously examining multiple genes and multiple
variants within these genes would it be possible to provide
some guidelines for predicting the response.

Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) System
and Lithium Response. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor
(BDNF) is the most important neurotrophic factor studied in
is involved in a number of brain processes
psychiatry. It
including neuronal proliferation, synaptic plasticity, memory,
and learning. The functional polymorphism of the BDNF gene,
located on chromosome 11p13, shows an association with a
predisposition to bipolar disorder.76 Studies performed by our
research group have shown that the response to lithium may be
connected both with Val66Met polymorphism of the BDNF
gene as well as with serum BDNF levels. Our group was the
ﬁrst to demonstrate an association of this polymorphism with
lithium response: a better eﬀect of lithium prophylaxis was
connected with the presence of the Met allele of Val66Met
BDNF polymorphism.77,78 Interestingly, an association with the
Met allele of this polymorphism was also found for hyper-
thymic temperament,79 which may further conﬁrm the results
of correlation between lithium response and TEMPS-A

temperaments mentioned earlier.31 We also observed an
interaction between BDNF gene and serotonin transporter
(5-HTTLPR) polymorphism, where the concomitant presence
of Val homozygosity of BDNF and the s allele of 5-HTTLPR
could predict lithium nonresponse with a 70% probability.80 On
the other hand, an association of
lithium response with
Val66Met polymorphism of the BDNF gene was not conﬁrmed
in populations other than Caucasian.46,81

We have also studied the BDNF system in relation to
cognitive functions in lithium-treated patients. It was shown in
experimental studies that lithium produces an enhancement of
learning and memory.82,83 On the other hand, some degree of
cognitive impairment has been demonstrated in lithium-treated
patients.84 The studies performed by our
research group
showed that
the preservation, or even improvement, of
cognitive functions may be connected with a quality lithium
prophylaxis. This is, to a great extent, observed in excellent
lithium responders, who, even after long-term lithium treat-
ment, have normal cognitive functions when compared to
healthy, matched controls.85,86 A decrease in serum BDNF has
been postulated as a marker of later stage of bipolar disorder87
whereas excellent lithium responders, with a mean of 21 years
of lithium treatment, have normal serum BDNF levels.86

responders. Probably, the most important is a total prevention
of aﬀective episodes which themselves may be toxic for the
brain and cause a deterioration of cognitive functions.88,89
Second, a neurotrophic eﬀect of lithium may play a role, with
stimulation of the BDNF system, and inhibition of GSK-3β, as
the main elements. Another possible mechanism could also be
connected with some antiviral properties of lithium. Dickerson
et al.,90 demonstrated that infection with herpex simplex virus
may be associated with cognitive deﬁcits in bipolar disorder,
long-term lithium administration was

connected with attenuation, or remission, of herpes infection.91
It is also possible that excellent lithium responders even before
the treatment may constitute a subgroup of bipolar disorder
with most favorable clinical course and outcome including a
good status of cognitive functions.

in our study,

Genome-wide Association Studies. A number of
genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been per-
formed in recent years, some of which also focused on lithium
response. In 2008, a family based association study of lithium-
related candidate genes in bipolar disorder was performed,
where lithium genes were selected as related primarily to
inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (17 genes), to GSK3β/Wnt signal-
ing (39 genes) and to those implicated by mRNA expression
data and related approaches (35 genes). No association with
bipolar disorder was found in relation to genes speciﬁcally
connected with lithium mechanisms.92 In the same year, a
paper appeared describing the results of GWAS in bipolar
disorder, where the highest signal was obtained with the DGKH
gene, which encodes a key protein in the lithium-sensitive
phosphatidyl inositol pathway.93

American researchers utilized GWAS data, obtained from the
Systematic Treatment Enhancement Program for Bipolar
Disorder (STEP-BD) study, to examine association with risk
for
recurrence among patients treated with lithium, and
subsequently examined the regions that showed the greatest
evidence of association in a second cohort of bipolar patients
drawn from a clinical population at University College, London.
A phenotype deﬁnition was that of achieving euthymia for at
least 8 weeks during prospective follow-up. It turned out that,
of the regions with a p value of <5 × 10−4 in the STEP-BD
cohort, ﬁve (8q22, 3p22, 11q14, 4q32, 15q26) showed
consistent evidence of association in a second cohort. The
authors found a region of special interest on chromosome 4q32
spanning a GRIA2 gene, coding for the glutamate AMPA
receptor.94

In a GWAS study performed by Squassina et al.95 on lithium-
treated Sardinian patients with bipolar disorder, phenotypic
assessment of
lithium response was made, using the
retrospective criteria of a long-term treatment response scale.
The strongest association, also supported by the quantitative
trait analysis, was shown for a single nucleotide polymorphism
(SNP) of the amiloride-sensitive cation channel 1 neuronal
(ACCN1) gene,
located on chromosome 17q12, encoding a
cation channel with high aﬃnity for sodium, and permeable to
lithium.

Review

Recent GWAS study performed by the Taiwanese
researchers included 294 bipolar patients of Han Chinese
descent, receiving lithium treatment. The strongest association
with the response to lithium was obtained with the gene coding
glutamate decarboxylase-like protein 1 (GADL1), located on
chromosome 3p24.96 Glutamate decarboxylase is an enzyme
that catalyzes the decarboxylation of glutamate to GABA
(gamma-aminobutyric acid) that makes it an important factor
for both glutamatergic and GABA-ergic neurotransmission.

Following an initiative by the International Group for the
Study of Lithium-Treated Patient and the Unit on the Genetic
Basis of Mood and Anxiety Disorders at the National Institute
of Mental Health, lithium researchers from around the world
have formed the Consortium on Lithium Genetics (Con-
LiGen). The aim of the ConLiGen was to establish the largest
sample to date for genome-wide studies of lithium response in
bipolar disorder.97 This sample currently comprises more than
2000 patients characterized for response to lithium treatment.
Such an endophenotype has been deﬁned retrospectively by
means of the Alda scale.12 A recent article by Manchia et al.98
reports on substantial inter-rater agreement and reliability of
lithium response assessed in twenty nine ConLiGen sites. Two
deﬁnitions of lithium response, one dichotomous and the other
continuous were identiﬁed.

The ﬁrst genetic results of the ConLiGen initiative including
1200 patients were presented during a CINP meeting in
Stockholm in 2012. The GWAS top hit (p = 1.52 × 10−6) was
found for the SLC4A10 gene coding solute carrier family 4,
sodium bicarbonate transporter, member 10, which belongs to
a family of sodium-coupled bicarbonate transporters. This gene
is located on chromosome 2q24 and is highly expressed in the
hippocampus and cerebral cortex. It has been implicated in
complex partial epilepsy and mental retardation as well as being
a subject of
in recurrent major depression. The
bicarbonate sensitive pathway is the most important mecha-
nism for active lithium inﬂux into the cell.99 Recently, based on
218 cases of Han Chinese or Japanese ancestry, an attempt was
made to replicate the results of Chen et al.96 However, no
association was found between GADL1 gene and lithium
response in this ConLiGen sample.100

Genetic factors associated with lithium prophylactic eﬃcacy

interest

in BD are summarized in Table 2.

■ CONCLUDING REMARKS

Lithium still remains a cornerstone for the long-term therapy of
bipolar disorder, and a number of clinical and biological factors
have been identiﬁed as connected with favorable prophylactic
response to this ion. However, this review of clinical and
genetic data connected with lithium eﬃcacy has a number of
limitations. They include relatively small samples of patients in
many clinical and genetic studies as well as that some studies
may have been prescreened for good outcome cases. Only a
minority of results obtained in candidate gene studies has been
consistently replicated and some GWAS research were not
speciﬁcally aimed for lithium response. In this respect, the
forthcoming GWAS results achieved within the framework of
the ConLiGen project can make an important step forward.

Bearing this limitations in mind, it seems, nevertheless, that
on the basis of the data provided, a clinical and psychological
proﬁle of “lithium responder” can be constructed. As to
biological factors, mainly genetic ones, it may be possible that
with the progress of pharmacogenomics, clinicians will
eventually be assisted by a panel of genetic tests that may

successfully predict which bipolar disorder patient is the most
likely to have the best response to lithium.
