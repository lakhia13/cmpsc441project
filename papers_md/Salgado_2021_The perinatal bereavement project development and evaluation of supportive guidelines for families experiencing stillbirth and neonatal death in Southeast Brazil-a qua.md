Abstract 
Background:  For most parents, getting pregnant means having a child. Generally, the couple outlines plans and has 
expectations regarding the baby. When these plans are interrupted because of a perinatal loss, it turns out to be a 
traumatic experience for the family. Validating the grief of these losses has been a challenge to Brazilian society, which 
is evident considering the childbirth care offered to bereaved families in maternity wards. Positively assessed care that 
brings physical and emotional memories about the baby has a positive impact on the bereavement process that fam-
ily undergoes. Therefore, this study aims to assess the effects supportive guidelines have on mental health. They were 
designed to assist grieving parents and their families while undergoing perinatal loss in public maternities in Ribeirão 
Preto, São Paulo state, Brazil.

Method:  A mixed-methods (qualitative/quantitative), quasi-experimental (before/after) study. The intervention is the 
implementation of bereavement supportive guidelines for women who experienced a stillbirth or a neonatal death. 
A total of forty women will be included. Twenty participants will be assessed before and twenty will be assessed after 
the implementation of the guidelines. A semi-structured questionnaire and three scales will be used to assess the 
effects of the guidelines. Health care professionals and managers of all childbirth facilities will be invited to participate 
in focus group. Data will be analyzed using statistical tests, as well as thematic analysis approach.

Discussion:  The Perinatal Bereavement guidelines are a local adaptation of the Canadian and British correspond-
ing guidelines. These guidelines have been developed based on the families’ needs of baby memories during the 
bereavement process and include the following aspects: (1) Organization of care into periods, considering their 
respective needs along the process; (2) Creation of the Bereavement Professional figure in maternity wards; (3) 
Adequacy of the institutional environment; (4) Communication of the guidance; (5) Creation of baby memories. We 
expect that the current project generates additional evidence for improving the mental health of women and families 
that experience a perinatal loss.

Plain English summary:  For many couples, getting pregnant does not only mean carrying a baby, but also having a 
child. Most of the time, the couple has already made many plans and has expectations towards the child. When these 
plans are interrupted because of a perinatal loss, it turns out to be a traumatic experience for the family.

In Brazilian culture, validating this traumatic grief is very difficult, especially when it happens too soon. The barriers 
can be noticed not only by the way society deals with the parents’ grief, but also when we see the care the grieving 
families receive from the health care establishment.

Creating physical and emotional memories might bring the parents satisfaction regarding the care they receive when 
a baby dies. These memories can be built when there is good communication throughout the care received; shared 
decisions; the chance to see and hold the baby, as well as collect memories; privacy and continuous care during the 
whole process, including when there is a new pregnancy, childbirth and postnatal period. With this in mind, among 
the most important factors are the training of health staff and other professionals, the preparation of the maternity 
ward to support bereaved families and the continuous support to the professionals involved in the bereavement.

This article proposes guidelines to support the families who are experiencing stillbirth and neonatal death. It may be 
followed by childbirth professionals (nurses, midwives, obstetricians and employees of a maternity ward), managers, 
researchers, policymakers or those interested in developing specific protocols for their maternity wards.

RESUMO 
Contexto:  Uma assistência avaliada positivamente por mães e pais que passaram pela perda perinatal permite a 
criação de memórias físicas e afetivas do bebê e possuem efeitos positivos no processo de luto da família. Este estudo 
avaliará os efeitos de uma diretriz de acolhimento na saúde mental de mulheres em processo de luto perinatal e 
neonatal em maternidades públicas do município de Ribeirão Preto (SP, Brasil).

Método:  Estudo de métodos mistos (quantitativo e qualitativo), quase-experimental (antes e depois). A intervenção 
é a implementação de diretrizes de acolhimento ao luto de mulheres que tiveram um natimorto ou óbito neonatal. 
Um total de quarenta mulheres serão incluídas. Vinte participantes serão avaliadas antes, e vinte após a implemen-
tação da diretriz de acolhimento nas instituições. Serão aplicadas três escalas e uma entrevista semiestruturada para 
avaliar os efeitos da diretriz. Profissionais da saúde e gestores serão convidados a participar de grupos focais. Os dados 
serão analisados por meio de testes estatísticos, e sob a metodologia de análise temática. A diretriz de acolhimento 
contará com material baseado em diretrizes canadense e britânica.

Discussão:  As diretrizes brasileiras de luto perinatal propostas são uma adaptação local das diretrizes canadense 
e britânica. Baseamo-nos na necessidade da família por memórias físicas e afetivas da criança morta para facilitar a 
vivência do processo do luto. Elas incluem os seguintes aspectos: (1) organização dos períodos da assistência a partir 
de suas respectivas necessidades, (2) criação do papel do Profissional do Luto, (3) ambientação das instituições, (4) 
disseminação das diretrizes e (5) criação de memórias do bebê. Espera-se que o projeto gere evidências adicionais 
para melhorar a saúde mental de mulheres e famílias que vivenciam uma perda perinatal.

Background
The death of a baby during pregnancy, birth or postpar-
tum is a traumatic experience to a woman and her fam-
ily [1, 2]. However, it may be also a traumatic experience 
to  the  attending  health  care  workers  [2,  3].  Several  fac-
tors make this a complex and marginalized issue, putting 
it  at  the  bottom  of  the  political  agenda:  stillbirths’  rates 
are not included in the Millennium Development Goals, 

nor tracked by the UN, nor in the Global Burden of Dis-
ease metrics [4], making it an invisible issue. Besides that, 
miscarriage, stillbirth and neonatal death lead to parental 
bereavement, resulting in a complex and eventually trau-
matic  experience  [5],  a  challenging  issue  to  health  pro-
fessionals and to the family to cope. According to Parkes 
[6] “For most people in the Western world, the death of a 
child is the most tormenting and painful source of grief ”.

Secondly,  the  belief  the  death  of  a  child  during  preg-
nancy  or  after  birth  would  be  less  difficult  to  deal  with 
compared  to  the  death  of  an  older  child  is  not  true  [1]. 
Actually,  the  main  difference  between  these  two  situ-
ations  is  that  society  does  not  acknowledge  perinatal 
losses; conversely, society minimizes it, makes it invisible 
and  silences  the  experience  parents  are  going  through. 
This kind of grief is named disenfranchised grief, known 
as  “(…)  a  loss  that  is  not  or  cannot  be  openly  acknowl-
edged,  publicly  mourned,  or  socially  supported”  (Doka, 
1989)  [7].  Therefore,  parents  do  not  have  their  feelings 
of grief, sorrow, emptiness and helplessness socially vali-
dated [8]. Last but not least, parents, families and health 
care professionals do not expect pregnancy interruption, 
or a baby´s sudden death, which turns it in a more trau-
matic and difficult to cope situation [6].

It  is  estimated  that  a  total  of  2.6  million  stillbirths 
took place globally in 2016 [9], and the estimates could 
be  even  higher  considering  underreporting  of  fetal 
death,  and  even  higher  if  including  perinatal  deaths 
[3,  4].  The  numbers  by  themselves  make  the  issue  a 
global priority. Nevertheless, they are just the tip of the 
iceberg.

A  perinatal  death  impacts  parents’  mental  health 
and  may  trigger  depressive  symptoms,  anxiety,  post-
traumatic  stress  disorders,  suicidal  ideation,  panic  and 
phobias  [10].  It  has  also  consequences  in  the  social  and 
economic spheres, with family crises, occupational diffi-
culties and problems regarding high health care costs [3].
Women  who  had  a  stillborn  baby  may  express  guilt 
and  question  their  competence  for  bearing  a  healthy 
baby. Besides, not only the grieving process may last for 
months and years, but it also impacts subsequent preg-
nancies [10, 11].

Given  the  importance  of  physical  and  mental  health 
for women who are undergoing this process, health care 
professionals  have  to  consider  their  feelings,  helping 
them cope with the guilt and relieve negative emotions 
[12]. Likewise, the fact that caring for bereaved parents 
brings additional stress to the health care staff must be 
taken into consideration [5]. It is difficult for the staff to 
deal with negative outcomes in maternity wards, espe-
cially when there are no specific institutional protocols 
[13]. To be able to offer a better assistance, the profes-
sional  also  needs  comfort  [5],  training,  debriefing  and 
professional support [2].

Guidelines  and  regimentation  regarding  pregnancy 
loss,  stillbirth  or  baby  death  aren´t  a  new  issue.  In  the 
UK,  Sands  (Stillbirth  &  Neonatal  Death  Charity)—a 
 charity1  that  works  with  grieving  families  and  health 
care  professionals  published  a  very  complete  docu-
ment  [14]  about  this  issue.  Canada  [15]  and  Australia 
& New Zealand [16], among other countries, also have 

their  own  and  specific  guidelines  and  France2  has  spe-
cific  laws.  Those  documents  recognize  the  importance 
of  late  children,  and  ensures  this  care  has  permanent 
effects [1].

Until  now,  Brazil  had  sparse  literature  about  this  sub-
ject.  Recently,  a  book  based  on  the  Canadian  guideline 
which  orients  health  care  providers  was  published  [17]. 
Research  work  was  also  conducted:  a  study  about  com-
plicated grief comparing Brazilian and Canadian women 
who had lost their babies found that Canadians undergo 
a  less  complicated  bereavement  process  than  Brazilian 
women, suggesting that professional supporting bereave-
ment  groups,  which  is  an  incipient  culture  in  Brazil, 
could had made de difference [18].

A recent Brazilian study brought to light the unrecog-
nizable  pain  of  fathers  that  experienced  perinatal  losses 
[19],  discussing  the  male  perspective.  Another  study 
from the same group highlighted lactation in the context 
of perinatal loss [20]. The latter is an important issue in 
Brazil,  once  pharmacological  lactation  suppression  is 
usually the only available option offered to women. Pre-
liminary discussion of The Perinatal Bereavement Project 
led  to  a  publication  in  a  nationwide  circulation  news-
paper  including  several  narratives  of  obstacles  grieving 
mothers came across while trying to donate  breastmilk3. 
Both the media report and the narratives from the book 
“Como  Lidar:  Luto  Perinatal”  [17]  surfaced  women´s 
understanding that donating breastmilk could help them 
cope with the loss of their babies.

In  the  2000  document  “Managing  Complications  in 
Pregnancy  and  Childbirth:  A  guide  for  midwives  and 
doctors” (reprinted in 2007), the WHO presented princi-
ples to be considered when a baby dies, such as to avoid 
maternal sedation, to encourage women seeing and hold-
ing their babies, to collect babies’ mementos, among oth-
ers [21].

In  2019,  the  action  “Why  we  need  to  talk  about  los-
ing  a  baby”  was  launched  [22],  aiming  to  turn  miscar-
riage,  stillbirth  and  neonatal  death  visible  worldwide,  as 
well  as  to  depict  the  need  for  best  practices  and  skilled 
professional  healthcare.  The  initiative  was  grounded  on 
women´s  experiences  of  perinatal  losses  and  epidemio-
logical  data,  and  proposed  the  end  of  “the  unaccepta-
ble  stigma  and  shame  women  face  after  baby  loss”  [22], 
claiming  for  empathy,  respect  and  support  during  the 
care  for  those  women.  This  is  the  beginning  of  a  very 
important  conversation  about  supportive  guidelines  for 
families experiencing stillbirth and neonatal death.

The  development  of  evidence-based  protocols  may 
positively  impact  the  health  of  parents  who  under-
went  perinatal  loss.  This  protocol  must  be  grounded 
on  evidence  provided  by  the  hospital  and  health  care 
professionals,  and  it  must  focus  on  creating  memories

Fig. 1  Supporting guidelines: stillbirth and perinatal death

regarding the late baby. A North American study exam-
ined  40  women  who  had  a  miscarriage  between  12  and 
20 weeks, and received support based on mediating pro-
tocols [23]. After  the interventions, they felt  diminished 
despair  and  reported  feeling  cared  for  and  assisted. The 
findings may probably apply to pregnancy losses regard-
less of gestational age.

When a baby dies or a pregnancy is lost, parents expe-
rience multiple losses, such as the plans they have made 
for  the  live  baby,  and  the  dreams  and  expectations  they 
had towards growing a family. Death also alters parents’ 
previous expectations about parenthood [15]. If we look 
to parents’ bereavement through the lens of Rando’s the-
ory (1993) [24], “The Six ‘R’ Processes of Mourning”, we 
can  find  in  the  third  process,  “recollecting  and  re-expe-
riencing the deceased and the relationship” huge difficul-
ties  for  parents,  due  to  the  scarce  or  even  absent  actual 
memories  of  the  baby  who  died,  or  of  the  lost  preg-
nancy  [15].  With  this  in  mind,  collecting  memories  is  a 
key  point  within  comprehensive  perinatal  bereavement 
guidelines.

Additionally,  performing  farewell  rituals  and  facing 
grief in a realistic way are key aspects to cope with death: 
“Seeing and holding a live baby right after the birth is a 
normal parental response. Seeing and holding a stillborn 

baby  is  also  a  normal  response,  and  there  is  much  evi-
dence  showing  that  it  can  be  a  valuable  and  cherished 
experience”  [25].  A  2015  systematic  review  analyzed 
health  outcomes  associated  with  parents  who  could  see 
and  hold  their  stillborn  children.  Results  revealed  that 
allowing families to have physical contact with their chil-
dren  is  beneficial,  which  opposes  previous  concepts  by 
which  health  care  professionals  should  discourage  such 
behavior [26].

Locally,  there  is  evidence  in  national  studies  corrobo-
rating  the  importance  of  having  contact  with  the  baby, 
even after death. Parents mentioned the wish to hold the 
child close. They also reported that their pain was dimin-
ished due to this incomparable and fundamental experi-
ence [27]. Another national investigation concludes that 
rituals  that  included  naming,  seeing  and  touching  the 
baby, as well as having funeral services, contributed to a 
healthy mourning [28].

In  order  for  health  care  professionals  to  guarantee 
adequate  assistance  to  bereaved  parents,  it  is  necessary 
that  they  are  emotionally  and  technically  trained  and 
equipped  [18].  Dealing  with  women  suffering  from  the 
loss of a child can pose an enormous challenge, consider-
ing  the  cultural  and  personal  uniqueness  of  each  one  of 
them  [29–32].  Notably,  taking  care  of  the  team  enables 

Salgado et al. Reprod Health            (2021) 18:5 

Page 5 of 17

the  preservation  of  the  continuity  and  quality  of  future 
care in situations of loss [31, 32].

Research question

Do  bereavement  guidelines  designed  to  assist  parents 
who  are  experiencing  stillbirth  or  neonatal  death  in  a 
Brazilian  childbirth  facility  promote  supportive  care 
that  provides  a  healthy  bereavement  experience  for  the 
woman and her family?

Underlying hypotheses

This  investigation  presupposes  that  local  institutional 
protocols  developed 
from  bereavement-supportive 
guidelines may offer better assistance in the perinatal loss 
scenarios. It is based on the assumption that the physical 
and  emotional  care,  as  well  as  the  moments  spent  with 
the  baby  and  the  collection  of  mementos,  enhance  the 
chances of a healthy bereavement experience.

Conceptual framework

The document “Pregnancy loss and the death of a baby: 
Guidelines for professionals—4th Edition” [14] published 
by  SANDS  was  used  to  outline  the  conceptual  frame-
work  for  the  present  study. The  authors  considered  that 
the  main  prerequisites  for  offering  supportive  care  to 
bereaved  parents  are  time,  training  and  support.  Good 
communication,  shared  decision  and  individual  care 
are  important  elements  to  provide  high  quality  grieving 
assistance. These are the grounding aspects for support-
ing guidelines and, for this reason, are on the top of the 
conceptual theoretical matrix, according to Fig. 1.

Initially,  the  first  level  of  the  matrix  contemplates  the 
work with staff and health care professionals. It involves 
three  elements  concerning  professional  qualification, 
meeting  professionals’  emotional  needs  (including  psy-
chological  support)  and  an  effective  and  efficient  staff 
communication.  Considering  the  Brazilian  scenario, 
where guidelines and orientation are needed, the follow-
ing tripod is significantly important to outline a starting 
point  for  planning  a  supportive  bereavement  guideline: 
(1)  prioritize  initial  capacitation  regarding  the  guide-
lines and situation management; offer continuous devel-
opment  to  both  qualified  and  novice  staff  members  so 
all  are  aligned  with  the  care  model  to  be  followed;  (2) 
understand  that  the  health  care  professionals  are  above 
all  humans  and,  therefore,  subjected  to  grief,  death  and 
bereavement in their professional and private lives. They 
may also be more affected by a grief situation while assist-
ing patients. Consequently, they need institutional space 
to address their own emotional needs. With this in mind, 
the Bereavement Professional is allocated to provide care 

and sensitive listening without any judgment. This action 
aims to meet the professional/staff needs; (3) offer good 
communication,  among  professionals  and  among  staffs 
who will also provide the families good communication. 
This is the core aspect to ensure parents are being given 
what  they  need  during  the  bereavement  process.  Good 
communication  consists  of  establishing  and  following 
protocols with which the whole staff is aligned.

The  second  level  of  the  matrix  is  related  to  the  infra-
structure  of  the  health  care  establishment  that  will  pro-
vide  the  family  physical  and  emotional  memories  of  the 
baby.  Some  of  the  infrastructure  items  consist  of  the 
family’s  individual  accommodation,  resources  to  col-
lect memories, a refrigerator to preserve the corpse and 
a  local  to  keep  the  memory  boxes.  The  aforementioned 
items  are  fundamental  and  most  Brazilian  maternity 
wards need to restructure according to the following: (1) 
individual  accommodation  is  one  of  the  issues  Brazil-
ian grieving parents mention the most. It protects them 
from curiosity; it prevents them from having to share the 
grieving  moment  with  other  families  who  are  celebrat-
ing the arrival of a healthy baby next to them; it also gives 
them privacy to meet their child moments before sending 
them to funeral rituals. Even with logistics challenges in 
Brazilian childbirth facilities, some privacy must be con-
sidered  and  offered;  (2)  resources  to  collect  mementos 
inside the maternity ward, such as a camera to take pic-
tures of the baby and the family or material to register the 
handprints  and  footprints,  and  a  lock  of  the  baby’s  hair, 
when available. A box to keep the items is important for 
the  process  of  creating  memories  and  should  be  offered 
to the family before hospital discharge; (3) refrigerator to 
preserve the corpse is one of the least useful items, but it 
might be essential at some point.

In childbirth facilities where complex cases are assisted, 
many  women  need  sedation  or  are  unconscious  for  a 
period of time (days or even weeks). When the woman is 
awake, after being unconscious during birth and the first 
hours or days after childbirth, the impact of the news may 
be devastating, especially when the baby has already been 
buried or cremated. In such situations, having the chance 
to  keep  the  baby  so  the  mother  can  recover  from  seda-
tion/unconsciousness  may  have  a  positive  outcome  for 
her mental health; (4) having a place to keep the memory 
boxes that were not taken by the family after hospital dis-
charge, is also important. Chances are these families will 
return  the  following  weeks  or  months  to  take  the  boxes 
with them once decision may change over time.

Health  care  attributes  are  on  the  third  level  of  the 
matrix.  They  highlight  the  essential  aspects  of  the  care 
given  to  parents:  privacy  (previously  mentioned);  indi-
vidual  care,  that  adapts  assistance  to  a  family’s  physical, 
social and emotional needs. These adjustments are based 

 Salgado et al. Reprod Health            (2021) 18:5 

Page 6 of 17

on beforehand locally developed alignments of care. This 
is  a  delicate  matter  and  health  care  professionals  have 
to  observe  ethical  and  non-judgmental  values  when  it 
comes to the family’s decisions, beliefs and feelings. It is 
also  challenging  since  the  professionals  themselves  are 
personally and individually affected. They have their own 
mechanisms to deal with grief and that has to be consid-
ered, as discussed in the previous level of the matrix. Our 
suggestion to solve this problem is teamwork. Therefore, 
professionals are supported by the health care establish-
ment  and  the  structured  protocols  and  may  follow  the 
pre-established  recommendations.  Informed  and  con-
scious  decisions,  evidence-based  care,  pre-established 
institutional  protocols  and  uniform  technical  behavior 
are  part  of  this  approach  to  produce  safe  assistance  and 
continuous care.

The praxis is described on the fourth level. It highlights 
the need to decide the birth as the first move. This con-
sists  of  an  issue  regarding  vaginal  birth  versus  cesarean 
section,  since  the  Brazilian  scenario  has  worrying  num-
bers of C-sections. In some cases, when the woman’s life 
is  at  stake,  cesarean  sections  are  actually  needed.  How-
ever, in most stillbirth cases, vaginal births are the safest 
choice.

The mode of birth is a mother’s decision. Nevertheless, 
health  care  professionals  should  explain  the  risks  and 
benefits of each option. Women should have the chance 
to experience labor and vaginal birth. This may help them 
start  grieving,  since  time,  hormonal  and  physical  ques-
tions may be addressed. Moreover, when the woman opts 
for a vaginal birth, she will actively participate in the bio-
logical parturition process and she will be able to see and 
hold  the  baby,  as  well  as  have  a  farewell  moment,  since 
childbirth.  Additionally,  she  will  probably  have  a  better 
physical condition to participate on rituals (funeral, bur-
ial  ceremonies  or  cremation)  and  to  get  pregnant  again 
sooner, if she wishes. Lastly, C-sections increase risks in 
future  pregnancies  and  childbirth  when  compared  with 
vaginal birth. Thus, all of the staff ’s efforts should involve 
providing the best health care, avoiding physical and psy-
chological risks for the mother. As a result, vaginal birth 
tends to be a better option whenever possible, but some-
times, especially when there is a psychological trauma, a 
C-section  should  be  considered.  In  any  case,  if  a  C-sec-
tion is performed, holding the baby is recommended and 
should be encouraged. In all cases, the staff will organize 
the baby’s memory box and help with the decision-mak-
ing  process  regarding  the  baby’s  corpse.  It  is  also  advis-
able,  whenever  possible,  to  have  written  plans  for  labor 
and postpartum and for all decisions related to the baby.

In  Brazil,  post-mortem  examinations  are  hard  to  be 
run.  Yet,  whenever  possible,  they  should  be  suggested 
by health care providers. Finding the cause of death may 

help the family mourn, even though clearly stating diag-
nosis is infrequent. Funerals, burial ceremonies or crema-
tions  should  be  postponed  so  necroscopic  examinations 
may be run. Notably, even when the death occurs before 
fetal viability (20 weeks and/or 500 g), the family may opt 
for  funerals,  according  to  Brazilian  law  and  the  Federal 
Council of Medicine technical reports [33]; it is essential 
that  the  family  have  all  the  information  they  asked  for 
(e.g.,  procedures,  clinical  questions),  which  will  support 
their decision-making.

The  intermediate  elements  of  the  matrix  transcend 
the objective aspects described here. They include creat-
ing  positive  memories  that  are  associated  with  the  baby 
and its death, which is challenging and complex. For this, 
we recommend personalizing the approach and respect-
ing  the  woman’s  decisions,  aiming  to  lessen  anxiety  and 
uncertainties.  An  institutional  protocol  that  is  uniform 
and well-structured is essential. An open dialogue among 
all the people involved in the care and emotional support 
given by the professionals are fundamental points.

The end of the matrix regards the primary objective of 
this proposal: to offer care that facilitates healthy perina-
tal bereavement. This may be achieved when all the meas-
ures mentioned above are transversally contemplated.

Rationale for developing supporting guidelines 
for stillbirth and perinatal death in Brazil
So far, there are no supportive guidelines for stillbirth or 
neonatal death in Brazil. Health care services and health 
care  professionals  deal  with  each  situation  according  to 
their  own  belief.  Sometimes  the  professional  offers  care 
based on what suits him/her, since dealing with bereave-
ment patients promotes stress and anguish. Additionally, 
there is no institutional support available to help hospital 
staff care for grieving patients. Health care assistance fre-
quently ends fast and close contact is avoided, once deal-
ing with grieving families is often challenging. Therefore, 
outlining  supportive  guidelines  is  urgent.  Health  care 
establishments  will  be  able  to  create  local  protocols  to 
care  for  families  who  are  going  to  experience  the  death 
of a baby. Likewise, these protocols will lessen health care 
professionals’ stress.

Supporting guidelines are supposed to be used as a ref-
erence to those who want to adapt and implement them 
in  different  health  care  contexts  and  scenarios  and  use 
them  locally.  These  tools  may  promote  the  structure  of 
the care given to families who are experiencing perinatal 
loss. Notwithstanding, the focus is not only the pregnant 
or puerperal women’s well-being, but also the health care 
professional’s welfare.

Objectives
The primary objective of The Perinatal Bereavement Pro-
ject  is  to  assess  the  effects  of  international  bereavement 
guidelines adapted to the Brazilian context in the mental 
health and grief experience of mothers who have under-
gone a perinatal loss. The secondary objective is to verify 
the  prevalence  of  postpartum  depression,  anxiety,  stress 
and grief adaptation symptoms, as well as assess the care 
received  in  two  different  moments:  before  and  after  the 
health care professionals are trained and maternity wards 
are prepared.

Methods
Study design

This  is  a  quasi-experimental  study  that  uses  qualitative 
and quantitative methods. It also uses a before-and-after 
analytical approach.

Setting
Data collection procedures

Study phases:  Preparation: This is the phase where the 
meetings  with  the  maternity  ward  staff  will  take  place 
and  the  Reference  Professionals  for  each  maternity  will 
be  assigned.  Reference  Professionals  will  be  responsible 
for keeping in touch with the researchers who will answer 
any questions about the project; for organizing training/
courses; informing the list of stillbirth and neonatal death 
cases; etc. They are also going to recommend a Bereave-
ment  Professional  for  the  maternity  ward.  The  Bereave-
ment  Professional  is  responsible  for  bereavement  issues 
regarding  the  families  and  the  staff.  The  same  person 
may be both the Reference Professional and the Bereave-
ment  Professional.  Reference  Professionals  may  be  any 
professional  who  works  at  the  maternity  ward,  and  has 
significant  experience  with  the  maternity  ward  routine 
and  procedures,  and  with  the  staff.  There  could  be  two, 
both responsible for managing, professional training and 
guiding. They will be in contact with the family when the 
allocated professional is absent or ask for guidance. They 
should be a physician, a nurse or a midwife.

The  Bereavement  Professional  should  have  experience 
and  skills  to  offer  emotional  and  technical  support  to 
the  staff.  They  may  be  available  to  support  the  families 
as  well.  Accordingly,  the  maternity  ward  managers  may 
decide if one or two Bereavement Professionals will suf-
fice.  Ideally,  a  psychologist  should  be  the  Bereavement 
Professional,  but  professionals  with  further  skills  may 
assume  the  position.  The  Bereavement  Professional  will 
be  trained  in  theoretical  and  practical  contents  to  offer 
assistance as required.

The  time  has  come  to  promote  awareness  for  manag-
ers,  Bereavement  and  Reference  Professionals  regarding 
perinatal mourning processes. It is also time to elaborate 

what in Brazil is called Standardized Operational Proce-
dure  (SOP)  (in  Portuguese,  “Procedimento  Operacional 
Padrão”—POP), and professional qualification.

Pre‑intervention

This phase will consist of two actions: (a) meetings with 
the focus group and (b) interviews with the women.

a)  The pre-intervention focus group

  During 

the  pre-intervention 

focus  group,  an 
informed  consent  form  will  be  signed,  and  partici-
pants will answer sociodemographic and work expe-
rience questionnaires. The meeting will last no longer 
than 1h30min.

b)  The pre-intervention interview with women

The pre-intervention interview with the women will be 
carried out by one of the researchers, based on the still-
birth  and  neonatal  death  list  provided  by  the  Reference 
Professional  from  the  maternities  ward. They  will  get  in 
touch to schedule an in-person interview in a place to be 
defined.  Information  to  verify  inclusion  and  exclusion 
criteria will be covered. After inclusion criteria are met, 
the women will receive information concerning the study 
and  will  be  invited  to  participate.  If  they  accept,  the  in-
person interview will be scheduled. During this meeting, 
the  informed  consent  form  will  be  signed.  Afterwards, 
mental  health  scales  will  be  applied.  A  qualitative  inter-
view will cover socioeconomic, demographic and behav-
ioral data regarding the loss the woman went through.

Intervention

The  intervention  will  be  based  on  two  publications:  the 
Brazilian book “Como lidar—luto perinatal: acolhimento 
em situações de perda gestacional e neonatal” [17], based 
on the Canadian “Guidelines for health care professionals 
experiencing  a  perinatal  loss”  [15]  and  the  manual  pro-
vided  by  SANDS  (Stillbirth  &  Neonatal  Death  Charity) 
“Pregnancy  loss  and  the  death  of  a  baby:  Guidelines  for 
professionals” [14]. Both offer a framework to coordinate 
important actions to assist families as shown in Fig. 2.

Additional material will be published during the inves-
tigation  and  produced  along  the  process.  Based  on  the 
British  manual  aforementioned,  the  initial  content  will 
be  broadened.  This  material  will  be  available  on  www. 
saude. fmrp. usp. br/ lutop erina tal.  All  documents  staff 
should  use  during  hospitalization  (Perinatal  loss  and 
Memory creation files) will also be available on the same 
site. The perinatal loss file will hold relevant information 
about  women’s  health  and  the  guideline  step-by-step.  It 
will  help  professionals  share  information.  The  memory 
creating file will provide guidance about the steps taken

regarding the baby memory box. A summary of the main 
actions  regarding  the  supportive  guidelines  is  available 
on Table 1.

Regarding  the  model  Training  of  Trainers,  an  expert 
teaches a professional who works in a health care estab-
lishment.  The  one  who  receives  the  instructions  will 
teach  the  others. Therefore,  after  the  implementation  of 
the Project, the qualified professional will continue pro-
viding  refreshment  courses  to  those  who  need  it.  For 
this  specific  project,  the  expert  will  be  the  researcher. 
Another professional will participate in the qualification 
process and will be in charge of the regional staff after the 
expert finalizes the project.

The training method consists of the following events:

•  Perinatal Bereavement Event—training: An in-person 
event that will be organized with the Regional Health 
Department XIII. Although it will be focused on spe-

cific  professionals,  managers  and  Reference  Profes-
sionals, it will be open to all local professionals. Esti-
mated duration: 3 h.

•  Reference Professional Meeting: This in-person event 
aims to prepare and help the Reference Professionals 
get ready to start the project and write the Standard 
Operational Procedure (SOP). They will also plan the 
qualification of the professionals in their health care 
establishments.  Participants:  professionals  indicated 
by maternity ward managers (physicians, nurses and 
psychologists). Estimated duration: 3 h.

•  Bereavement  Professional  Meeting:  An  in-person 
event  aiming  to  offer  the  Bereavement  Profession-
als  theoretical  content  about  bereavement,  the  fam-
ily’s  and  professional’s  points  of  view,  so  they  may 
carry  out  their  functions.  Participants:  professionals 
indicated  by  maternity  ward  managers  (physicians,

What to do to provide continuous care:

Discuss family planning;
Schedule regular appointments to assess mental and physical health, and discuss new findings 

about what happened to the baby (when applicable);

In the case of a new gestation, follow health care guidelines for pregnant women who had previ-

ously experienced the loss of a baby;

Arrange to assist woman during the new puerperium

Guidelines for assisting pregnant women who had 

Remember: this is no longer an ordinary pregnancy, and may be considered a risk pregnancy 

previously experienced the loss of a baby:

from the mental health point of view;

The previous loss may impact the following bereaved mother’s gestation, from antenatal care 

through puerperium and breastfeeding;

Fear and complaints are expected responses and must be acknowledged;
Some parents may prefer to be cared for in a different hospital or by different staff members, 

which should not be a problem;

Mental health screening should be available for both parents;
Specialized mental health support or psychological appointments should be encouraged at any 

time during pregnancy and postpartum;

Consider avoiding standard antenatal classes, prioritizing individual preparation sessions for labor, 

birth and caring for a newborn baby;

A special sticker can be used on both notice board and at room’s door wherein a bereaved 

mother is in labor, so that the staff is aware of her condition;

Encourage the writing of a birth plan, so that parents’ preferences can be easily shared with all 

staff during labor, birth and postpartum

Consider scheduling extra and longer antenatal appointments. Extra screening options should be 

considered whenever necessary or demanded;

Set aside a weekly day or time at your institution for pregnant women who had previous 

perinatal losses to seek assistance if they have questions about their baby’s well-being or their 
pregnancies´ normality;

A C-section without clinical recommendation may be considered, when fear from natural birth 
could not be dealt with after several psychological and communication interventions, as long 
as the women acknowledge associated risks

1. Assure the mother/family privacy;
2. Deliver bad news properly;
3. Give the family all requested and necessary information;
4. Encourage the preparation of a Care Plan for the women and the baby. This Care Plan includes 

a birth plan, whenever possible, and a palliative care for the baby, whenever necessary;
5. Choose and prepare a private room, to avoid contact with other mothers and their babies;
6. Apply special stickers on both notice board and at the bereaved mothers’ room door, so that 

the staff is aware of her condition;

7. Avoid sedation;
8. Respect initial plans – whenever possible;
9. Encourage the mother/family to see the baby;
10. Encourage the mother/family to touch the baby, and to spend time with her/him;
11. Provide the memory box

What to do when there is:
Stillbirth
Neonatal death or imminent neonatal death
Severe malformation (incompatible with life or high 

death probability)

nurses, psychologists and social work professionals). 
Estimated duration: 4 h.

•  Coordination meeting: An in-person meeting will be 
held in each maternity before the staffs are formed. It 
aims to raise professionals’ and team work awareness 
on the subject. A video will be produced and will be 
available  to  the  professionals  who  could  not  be  pre-
sent.

•  Support network to answer any questions and guide 
professionals  involved:  During  the  whole  time  the 
project  is  being  carried  out,  the  researchers  and  the 
health  regional  representative  can  be  reached  by 
phone,  WhatsApp  (general  group  chat,  maternity 
ward group chats and private messages);

•  In-person  and  virtual  follow-up  will  be  provided 

until the end of the project.

Among  the  actions  in  accordance  with  the  training 
methodology,  some  items  will  be  given  to  the  families. 
Additionally, the following are to be given to the staff: A 
box to keep the memories, a polaroid camera and polar-
oid  paper,  card  for  handprints  and  footprints,  a  small 
plastic bag to keep the hair lock, a big plastic bag to keep 
baby’s  clothing  items,  a  blanket  that  is  used  when  the 
baby is too small for conventional clothes.

Post‑intervention

This phase consists of two actions: interviews with each 
woman in the post-intervention group and meetings with 
the post-intervention focus groups.

One focus group consists of the nurses in each mater-
nity ward and the other is formed by the managers. The 
interviews and the meeting will mirror the steps taken in 
the pre-intervention phase.

Study participants
Participants

Women  who  experienced  stillbirth  and  neonatal  death 
in  one  of  the  four  public  maternity  wards  in  Ribeirão 
Preto City, in São Paulo State, southeast region of Brazil. 
Health  care  professionals,  employees  and  managers  of 
the respective maternity wards will also participate.

a) Participants and eligibility criteria

All  four  public  maternity  wards  in  Ribeirão  Preto  were 
invited  to  participate  in  this  project  and  all  of  them 
accepted.

1  Due  to  the  Covid-19  pandemic,  the  period  for  recruiting  women  will 
change.

No exclusion criteria were outlined for health care pro-

fessionals, employees and managers.

The inclusion criteria for women are:

a)  To  live  in  one  of  the  municipalities  of  the  Ribeirão 
Preto region (XIII Regional Health Department, São 
Paulo State)

b)  Have  experienced  a  stillbirth  or  a  perinatal  death 

during the estimated period1;

c)  Have faced the death of her baby in the following cir-

cumstances:

d)  Pregnancy that lasted more than 20 complete weeks;
e)  Had a baby weighing at least 500 g;
f )  Had a baby that died no later than twenty-eight days 

after the birth (neonatal death).

Women exclusion criteria are to not understand Portu-

guese and have severe mental health impairment.

The  main  difference  between  the  pre-  and  post-inter-
vention groups is the training process health care profes-
sionals will receive, together with preparing the maternity 
ward  to  implement  local  protocol.  It  is  estimated  that 
women  who  had  a  baby  born  in  the  pre-intervention 
group  did  not  receive  a  care  based  on  the  supportive 
guidelines regarding perinatal bereavement.

The first 20 women from each group who accept to take 

part in this study will be interviewed.

B) Research instruments and data sources

Data will be collected from women interviewed and from 
the  focus  group  offered  to  professionals.  We  will  use  a 
questionnaire  specially  designed  for  this  project,  as  well 
as  validated  tools  used  in  previous  mental  health  and 
bereavement  studies.  Pilot  interviews  were  performed 
as  a  way  to  validate  the  questionnaire  and  organize  the 
interview process.

Three scales, that were adapted and validated to Brazil-

ian Portuguese, will be applied:

Perinatal Grief Scale (PGS)

  The  PGS  presents  33  self-applicable  psychomet-
ric assertions, divided into three subscales, related to 
perinatal  grief  adaptation  symptomatology.  Involves 
a  five-point  Likert  Scale  ranging  from  “strongly  dis-
agree”  to  “strongly  agree”.  The  cut-off  score  that  we 
will use is 90, as validated by Paris et al. [34, 35] for 
the Brazilian population.
Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale (EPDS)
  The EPDS is a set of 10 self-applicable screening 
questions,  each  of  them  with  four  multiple  choice 
responses,  which  indicates  the  intensity  of  depres-
sive signs and symptoms that are present during the 

Salgado et al. Reprod Health            (2021) 18:5 

Page 11 of 17

last  seven  days  before  the  application.  The  cut-off 
score that suggests the woman is probably depressed 
(or  with  depression  symptoms)  is ≥ 11,  as  validated 
by Santos for the Brazilian population [35].
Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21)

Variables
Variables of interest (Table 2)

Bias (Table 3)

DASS-21  is  a  self-applicable  scale  with  seven  items 
each.  It  assesses  depression,  stress  and  anxiety,  con-
sidering  the  previous  week.  The  answers  are  given 
in a four-point Likert Scale that vary from 0 (totally 
disagree)  to  3  (totally  agree).  Score  variations  cor-
respond  to  symptom  levels  such  as  “normal”  and 
“severe”.  The  global  scores  for  the  three  constructs 
(depression, stress and anxiety) will be calculated as 
validated  by  Vignola  et  al.  for  the  Brazilian  popula-
tion [36].

Calculation of sample size or available sample sufficiency

Considering  the  financial  and  human  resources  for  the 
project  as  well  as  the  low  prevalence  of  events  of  inter-
est, we chose to establish the sample size by convenience 
(pragmatic  sample  size).  In  this  context,  time  to  select 
women  who  will  participate  was  the  decisive  factor  for 
sample  size.  Sample  size  in  one  study  in  the  same  field 
was 44. Given the amount of available resources, we fixed 
the post-intervention time in six months. Thus, given the 
selection  period  of  time,  40  women  is  the  number  esti-
mated (20 before intervention and 20 after intervention).

A sociodemographic questionnaire designed to collect 
personal  data,  behavioral  information,  medical  history 
and information about care received will also be applied.
Each  maternity  ward  will  assign  the  Reference  Profes-
sionals  and  the  Bereavement  Professionals  among  their 
employees.

Data  will  be  provided  by  each  health  care  establish-
ment.  They  will  send  a  list  containing  the  stillbirth  and 
neonatal death list, provided by the respective Reference 
Professionals. The researcher will contact each candidate 
to verify eligibility for this study, inviting them to partici-
pate and scheduling a meeting.

Focus groups will be conducted by the researchers, and 
the health care professionals who will participate will be 
contacted  by  the  Reference  Professional  of  each  mater-
nity ward.

Primary and secondary outcomes
Primary outcomes

A composite of a grief state (grief adaptation symptoms) 
and rates of depression, stress and anxiety.

Secondary outcomes

•  Absence from work due to bereavement
•  Psychiatric treatment due to bereavement
•  Maternal admission to psychiatric health facilities
•  Suicide attempt
•  Suicide

Ethical and equity aspects

This  study  is  in  accordance  with  the  Helsinki  Declara-
tion  [37]  and  follows  the  guidelines  and  norms  of  the 
National Health Council [38] order number 4666/12. The 
data collected (interviews, scales that were translated to 
Brazilian Portuguese, scales that were validated by Brazil-
ian  investigations)  will  be  exclusively  used  for  academic 
research. The identity and privacy of the participants will 
be respected.

Each  participant  (women  who  lost  their  child,  pro-
fessional  and  managers)  will  receive  two  copies  of  the 
informed  consent  form.  They  will  provide  information 
about  the  study  and  the  research  staff ’s  phone  number 
and  emails.  This  document  will  be  read  and  signed  in 
case  of  agreement.  The  participant  and  the  researcher 
will keep one copy.

Women  who  present  any  risk  to  their  mental  health 
will  be  forwarded  to  psychological/psychiatric  assis-
tance  according  to  their  city  of  origin.  In  case  they  are 
diagnosed  by  the  health  care  establishment  staff,  the 
respective  protocols  will  be  followed.  Should  diagnosis 
be  known  during  the  second  interview,  the  researcher 
will  send  the  participant’s  personal  information  (name, 
birthday,  national  health  identification,  mother’s  name, 
and hometown) to the XIII Regional Health Department, 
under the care of the respective health care professional. 
This  professional  will  take  the  appropriate  measures  so 
the case may be followed up accordingly.

Notably,  this  study  will  not  offer  participants  any  sig-
nificant risks. The results will be applied to benefit peri-
natal  loss  assistance  all  over  the  country.  Additionally, 
this investigation aims to promote equity, which might be 
reached when local protocols are used. They will take into 
consideration the most important aspects of the support-
ive guidelines, as the assistance provided is personalized,

Data management and analysis
Data analysis plan

The data will be analyzed by the project staff and, when-
ever  necessary,  by  experts.  The  analysis  plan  as  well  as 
a  detailed  plan  for  statistical  analyses  will  be  designed 
before data collection starts. Qualitative thematic analy-
sis  will  be  applied  on  the  data  from  the  questionnaire, 
considering the pre-determined categories  and  new cat-
egories  the  analysis  will  provide. The  data  regarding  the 
focus groups will be treated likewise.

Descriptive analysis

Descriptive analysis will be based on the qualitative the-
matic analysis and harm frequency identified by The Peri-
natal  Bereavement  Safety  Thermometer  developed  for 
this investigation (Fig. 3).

The perinatal bereavement safety thermometer provides 
a  harm  checking  of  10  important  aspects  that  impacts 
the  maternal  mental  health  and  the  grieving  process.  It 
is based on the British Safety Thermometers tools devel-
oped  by  the  National  Health  Service  (NHS)  created  for 
harm checking in five different areas [39].

According to the tool proposed for this study, low tem-
peratures of harm offer a better chance for a healthy peri-
natal  bereavement,  once  it  promotes  better  memories 
for  the  mourning  process  and  the  bereavement  experi-
ence.  In  the  same  way,  we  assumed  that  an  ideal  health 
care assistance should avoid situations that may be inter-
preted  as  harm.  All  the  ten  items  predicted  on  this  tool 

are considered central and take part on British [14] and/
or Canadian [15] guidelines.

Descriptive  analysis  will  be  performed  to  reveal  harm 
frequencies (Fig. 3) caused by health care assistance that 
did  not  observe  the  supporting  guidelines  for  perinatal 
loss.  This  analysis  will  also  show  the  relation  between 
these  harms  and  the  findings  provided  by  the  three 
tools used to verify women’s mental health and grieving 
process.

Thematic analysis will also be carried out by exploring 
the findings related to the objectives of this investigation. 
They  will  be  compared  with  each  group  and  among  the 
groups.  The  analysis  will  consider  cultural  and  gender 
issues.  It  will  also  contemplate  institutional  specifici-
ties that will guide the implementation of the protocol in 
each maternity ward involved in the project.

The qualitative thematic analysis was chosen due to the 
fact  that  it  is  possible  to  map,  analyze  and  identify  pat-
tern (topics) in the data. It has the following steps: 1) data 
organization; 2) pattern, topic and category mapping; 3) 
emerging  hypotheses  testing  and  4)  alternative  explana-
tions  gathered  from  (pre-intervention,  post-intervention 
and  focus)  groups,  as  well  as  from  comparative  analysis 
of the groups.

Quantitative analysis

A  detailed  plan  for  statistical  analysis  will  be  developed 
by the researchers before data collection starts. A model-
ling plan will be developed and implemented by a team of 

 Salgado et al. Reprod Health            (2021) 18:5 

Page 14 of 17

experts  that  includes  biostatisticians,  psychologists  and 
obstetricians.

Simple  frequencies  will  be  calculated,  and  a  compari-
son method will be used (T Student or Chi Square tests).

Publishing the findings and results dissemination plan

Our findings will be published in peer-reviewed scientific 
journals (in English and Brazilian Portuguese). Moreover, 
the  results  will  be  locally  shared  with  those  involved  in 
the design of the project, as a way to promote debates and 
reflections  on  the  present  praxis.  It  will  also  help  create 
new  measures  for  better  outcomes  in  the  future,  which 
will affect the families who will experience stillbirth and 
neonatal death.

Discussion
Projection of the main findings

The  approach  to  women  and  families  who  lost  their 
babies  during  gestation,  labor  or  post-partum  period 
must follow a specific supportive guideline, which has to 
be locally adapted by Brazilian maternity wards. The way 
this issue has been addressed by health care professionals 
and  the  maternity  wards  may  impact  the  process  either 
positively  or  negatively.  When  negative  emotions  pre-
vail,  the  technical  approach  might  produce  long-lasting, 
adverse psychological effects that might remain for a long 
time, sometimes even a lifetime.

The development of Brazilian supportive guidelines for 
perinatal  loss,  based  on  international  experiences,  may 
fill in an important gap regarding women’s health. It will 
be contemplated from a perspective focused on women’s 
sustainable development of wellbeing and empowerment. 
Additionally, our guidelines cover professional qualifica-
tion. The staff that will be involved with this specific kind 
of care will interact to elaborate situational and contextu-
alized scenarios to promote a better relationship between 
health care professional and patient.

The  qualification  of  the  bereavement  professional  is 
another relevant aspect of these guidelines. The Bereave-
ment  Professional  will  not  only  help  professionals  deal 
with specific and complex questions regarding grief, but 
also assist grieving families. He/she will address the pri-
vate  and  individual  matters  of  staff  and  professionals. 
These questions may be raised along with the assistance 
given  to  the  families  during  the  bereavement  process. 
Among the Bereavement Professional’s tasks are the reor-
ganization  of  staff,  psychological  support  and  empathic 
listening, whenever necessary.

death.  This  assistance  is  grounded  on  empathy  and  effi-
ciency  during  this  challenging  time.  Moreover,  it  pro-
poses  continuity  of  care,  including  comforting  the 
woman and her family, assisting the birth and designing 
care procedures after hospital discharge. This might con-
tribute  to  the  woman’s  wellbeing  and,  consequently,  her 
quality of life, as well as her mental and physical health. 
Likewise,  the  creation  of  standardized  hospital  proce-
dures may provide the professionals more satisfaction at 
work, since occupational stress and communication anxi-
ety  are  reduced,  and  unwanted  obstetric  outcomes  are 
better managed. Notably, these guidelines will offer prac-
tical orientation towards technical routines related to the 
death  of  a  baby  during  gestation.  It  will  include  corpse 
handling, memory box, among other routines.

Obstetric applicability

The applicability of these guidelines will result in a pilot 
study. This way, the guidelines might be applied in simi-
lar  scenarios.  Moreover,  based  on  our  guidelines,  other 
maternity  wards  or  organizations  will  be  able  to  design 
their  own  proposals  for  perinatal  loss  approach.  They 
may use our findings to contemplate regional differences 
regarding  perinatal  bereavement,  such  as  the  ones  in 
indigenous communities, quilombolas, favelas, and other 
groups.

Anticipating main problems and proposing solutions

Dealing with death in childbirth facilities is a delicate sit-
uation. It might cause discomfort and privacy disruption 
in  patients  and  professionals.  We  will  try  to  minimize 
these problems and offer a clear outline of the objectives 
of the present investigation. We will highlight the benefits 
the  project  will  bring  to  the  family  who  is  experiencing 
this trauma, and to the ones who will be in this situation 
in the future.

All  participants  will  be  granted  the  right  to  privacy 
throughout the research project. They may also stop par-
ticipating  any  time  they  want.  Authors/researchers  who 
will  deal  directly  with  the  participants  are  prepared  to 
listen to them empathically and professionally and avoid 
any  kind  of  embarrassment  and  discomfort  this  investi-
gation may cause.

Finally,  any  problem  or  challenge  professionals  might 
have  regarding  bereavement  will  be  addressed  kindly, 
inside the health care establishment and, whenever nec-
essary, will be handled by a qualified psychologist.

Research sustainability
Environmental impact estimates

The environmental impact of the present research will be 
calculated  by  the  tool  available  at  https:// www. tjpr. jus. 
br/ web/ gestao- ambie ntal/ calcu lador aco2.  The  Environ-
mental  compensation  plan  will  be  designed  with  a  local 
institution based in Ribeirão Preto that donates seedlings 
and resources to plant trees. In the future, based on the 
carbon  dioxide  emission,  the  seedlings  will  be  planted 
according to the instructions given by the Ribeirão Preto 
City Hall. The number of trees will compensate the CO2 
emissions that happened during this investigation.

The tree planting will happen during an event similar to 
ones that have already been held in other Brazilians cit-
ies—Araraquara (São Paulo State), Goiânia (Goiás State), 
Recife  (Pernambuco  State)—where  the  parents  who  had 

experienced stillbirth or neonatal deaths will plant a tree 
to honor the child they lost. Thus, a park/garden/groove 
of  memories  will  be  created.  This  event  is  intended  to 
take place annually, so more parents can join those who 
have already planted their trees. It has a positive outcome 
considering  not  only  the  bereavement  perspective,  but 
also the environmental one.
