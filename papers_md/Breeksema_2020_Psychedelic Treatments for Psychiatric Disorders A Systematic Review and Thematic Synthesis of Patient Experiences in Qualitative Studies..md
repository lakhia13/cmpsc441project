Abstract
Introduction  Interest in the use of psychedelic substances for the treatment of mental disorders is increasing. Processes that 
may affect therapeutic change are not yet fully understood. Qualitative research methods are increasingly used to examine 
patient accounts; however, currently, no systematic review exists that synthesizes these findings in relation to the use of 
psychedelics for the treatment of mental disorders.
Objective  To provide an overview of salient themes in patient experiences of psychedelic treatments for mental disorders, 
presenting both common and diverging elements in patients’ accounts, and elucidating how these affect the treatment process.
Methods  We systematically searched the PubMed, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and Embase databases for English-language 
qualitative literature without time limitations. Inclusion criteria were qualitative research design; peer-reviewed studies; 
based on verbalized patient utterances; and a level of abstraction or analysis of the results. Thematic synthesis was used to 
analyze and synthesize results across studies. A critical appraisal of study quality and methodological rigor was conducted 
using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP).
Results  Fifteen research articles, comprising 178 patient experiences, were included. Studies exhibited a broad heterogene-
ity in terms of substance, mental disorder, treatment context, and qualitative methodology. Substances included psilocybin, 
lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), ibogaine, ayahuasca, ketamine and 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA). 
Disorders included anxiety, depression, eating disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder, and substance use disorders. While 
the included compounds were heterogeneous in pharmacology and treatment contexts, patients reported largely comparable 
experiences across disorders, which included phenomenological analogous effects, perspectives on the intervention, therapeu-
tic processes and treatment outcomes. Comparable therapeutic processes included insights, altered self-perception, increased 
connectedness, transcendental experiences, and an expanded emotional spectrum, which patients reported contributed to 
clinically and personally relevant responses.
Conclusions  This review demonstrates how qualitative research of psychedelic treatments can contribute to distinguishing 
specific features of specific substances, and carry otherwise undiscovered implications for the treatment of specific psychi-
atric disorders.

The recent resurgence of clinical interest in the use of psych-
edelics for the treatment of mental disorders is evidenced by 
a sharp increase in studies and publications. After a decades-
long research hiatus, psychedelics have been investigated 
as potentially effective treatments for several mental dis-
orders, including substance use disorders (SUDs) [1–4]; 
post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) [5–10]; anxiety, and 
depression secondary to a life-threatening illness [11–14]; 
social anxiety in autistic adults [15]; obsessive–compul-
sive  disorder  (OCD)  [16];  depression  [17– 22];  and  sui-
cidal ideation [23]. Psychedelic drugs include a range of

Key Points 

Patients compare psychedelic treatments favorably with 
conventional treatments, emphasizing the importance 
of non-pharmacological factors such as trust, safety, 
interpersonal rapport, attention, the role of music, and 
the length of treatment sessions.

Pharmacologically distinct psychedelics exhibit overlap-
ping therapeutic processes for different mental disorders, 
including insights, altered self-perception, increased 
feelings of connectedness, transcendental experiences, 
and an expanded emotional spectrum.

Patients frequently report on clinical effects beyond their 
own psychiatric diagnosis, which may be indicative of 
the cross-diagnostic action of psychedelic drugs, by 
setting in motion therapeutic processes that address core 
elements of a shared psychopathology across mental 
disorders.

pharmacologically diverse substances comprising ‘classic’ 
serotonergic psychedelics (psilocybin, lysergic acid diethyla-
mide [LSD], and the dimethyltryptamine [DMT]-containing 
ayahuasca), entactogens (e.g. the serotonin-releasing drug 
3,4-methyenedioxymethamphetamine [MDMA]), the atypi-
cal psychedelic ibogaine and dissociative anesthetics such as 
the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist ketamine. All 
these substances can induce alterations of conscious states, 
as well as a wide range of psychological, cognitive, emo-
tional, and biological effects that may be relevant for their 
therapeutic action, when administered within a (psycho)
therapeutic context [24–28].

The safety, clinical benefits and therapeutic outcomes of 
these interventions are thought to be fundamentally reliant 
on a supportive environment [29, 30], with ‘set’ and ‘set-
ting’ playing a crucial role [31, 32]. ‘Set’ includes internal, 
psychological variables such as personality, expectations, 
suggestibility, preparation, intentions, and mood and psycho-
pathology, while ‘setting’ is understood to mean the external 
environment in which the experiences take place, including 
the physical, interpersonal, and broader social and cultural 
contexts [33–36]. Therapeutic use of psychedelics takes 
place in different settings. Modern clinical research with 
psilocybin, LSD and MDMA is typically conducted in the 
context of so-called ‘psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy’, 
which is a complex and variable modality that involves the 
administration of a psychedelic drug to facilitate or catalyze 
a therapeutic process [37]. Typically, this takes place in the 
presence of one or two therapists, and often involves the use 
of music to facilitate an introspective experience [33, 38, 

J. J. Breeksema et al.

39]. The Amazonian brew ayahuasca is typically consumed 
in traditional shamanic, religious, and hybrid ceremonial set-
tings [40], whereas ibogaine is administered in both unli-
censed ‘medical subcultures’ [41] and in private clinics such 
as in Mexico and New Zealand [42, 43]. On the other hand, 
the atypical psychedelic ketamine is normally administered 
as a standalone pharmacotherapy in a clinical setting [44].
It has been suggested that the influence of these extrap-
harmacological variables contributes significantly to the 
substances’ pharmacological qualities [33, 35], as evidenced 
by the high variability of individual experiences. Studies 
have emphasized the importance of the subjective experi-
ence [29], and several potential psychological mediators for 
therapeutic outcomes have been postulated in treatments 
with  psychedelics,  e.g.  (sustained)  changes  in  openness 
[45–47], prosocial feelings [45, 48], increases in suggestibil-
ity [49], meaning making [50], self-efficacy [51], and con-
nectedness [52, 53]. Furthermore, psychological flexibility 
[54], emotional breakthroughs [55], psychological insights 
[51], the loss of sense of self (‘ego dissolution’) sometimes 
resulting from mystical or peak experiences [29, 56–58], and 
experiences of awe [59] have been mentioned.

A close examination of patients’ experiential accounts 
could increase our understanding by providing more detailed 
insight  into  these  and  other  underlying  (psychological) 
mechanisms. Given the highly personalized nature of psy-
chedelic-induced patient experiences, quantitative measure-
ments might not capture the full spectrum of phenomena 
experienced by patients. Qualitative inquiry is typically 
concerned with understanding the how, what, or why of a 
particular phenomenon and can generate a more holistic 
account of the issue being studied [60, 61]. This is espe-
cially relevant in this emerging field of research. This makes 
qualitative research well-suited to explore the rich subjec-
tivity of respondents’ inner experiences, their attributions 
of meaning, the treatment context, and help inform a more 
detailed understanding of these complex interventions and 
underlying psychological mechanisms. These may in turn 
better tailor future research as well as inform and improve 
therapeutic effectiveness. Qualitative inquiry can also com-
plement quantitative research by generating, rather than vali-
dating, hypotheses, which can be tested using quantitative 
instruments.

While  some  qualitative  research  efforts  have  been 
directed at exploring the role of the subjective psychedelic 
experience in the treatment of mental disorders, to date no 
systematic review exists. This article aims to address this 
lacuna by presenting an overview of the available quali-
tative research. Identifying salient themes across studies, 
this review presents both common and diverging elements 
in patients’ accounts of their experiences, how they relate 
to their disorders, therapeutic processes, and personally 
and clinically significant outcomes. A systematic literature 

review was conducted of qualitative studies that address 
what patients report after taking a psychedelic substance in 
the context of treatment of a mental disorder.

2   Methods

We  systematically  identified  and  reviewed  the  selected 
studies using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic 
Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, which 
offer an extensive checklist and flowchart to improve the 
quality of systematic reviews [62].

2.1   Selection Criteria

For this systematic review we selected papers that described 
patient experiences after taking a psychedelic for the pur-
pose of treating a mental disorder. The eligibility criteria 
for inclusion in the review were qualitative research design; 
peer-reviewed  studies  in  English;  based  on  verbalized 
patient utterances; and a level of abstraction or analysis of 
the results. Eligibility criteria for inclusion were based on a 
modified PICo framework for qualitative reviews [63]. We 
employed a broad definition of psychedelics (see Table 1).

2.2   Search Strategy and Study Selection

We conducted a systematic search between 5 and 12 March 
2019. The PubMed, MEDline, PsycINFO, and EMBASE 
databases  were  searched  extensively  and  systematically 
without time limitations, using combinations of both index 
terms  (Medical  Subject  Headings  [MeSH]  in  PubMed, 
Emtree in Embase, and Thesaurus in PsycINFO) and free-
text terms in two categories. The first category included a 
broad range of psychedelic substances, including the atypical 
psychedelics ketamine, ibogaine, and MDMA. The second 
category involved the type of data that were gathered (e.g. 
“patient experience*”, “phenomenology”, “patient perspec-
tive*”, “participant experience*”, “subjective experience*”) 
and the qualitative methodology (e.g. “qualitative research”, 
“semi-structured  interview*”,  “focus  group*”,  “qualita-
tive  methods”,  “thematic  analysis”,  “grounded  theory”, 

927

“interpretative phenomenological analysis”). All databases 
were searched using “OR-relations” within these categories, 
and “AND-relations” between categories. A detailed account 
of the searches can be obtained from the first author upon 
request. The systematic search was complemented by hand 
searching, including reference lists of identified articles as 
well as relevant, non-indexed journals. The selection pro-
cess was conducted according to the eligibility criteria as 
presented in the PRISMA flow diagram in Fig. 1.

2.3   Data Analysis and Synthesis

Qualitative research seeks to develop a contextual under-
standing of behavior in the natural environment it observes. 
This does not mean that generalizability is impossible, but 
rather that theoretical generalization, i.e. transference, must 
be separated from statistical significance [64]. Whereas sys-
tematic review methods are well developed for randomized 
controlled trials (RCTs), no single preferred methodology 
exists to guide analysis and synthesis of qualitative data [65, 
66] or to guide critical appraisal of study methodology and 
validity [67–69]. For this review, we employed thematic syn-
thesis [70], based on thematic analysis [71], as this approach 
is particularly useful for bringing together heterogeneous 
studies [72]. Since we did not want to exclude potentially 
relevant articles a priori, we conducted a post-synthesis 
sensitivity analysis [68] using the Critical Appraisal Skills 
Programme (CASP) checklist, also in order to assess the 
methodological rigor of the studies [73].

Thematic synthesis took place in three stages. First, all 
included articles were read and re-read carefully several 
times by the first author, allowing him to become thoroughly 
familiar with the content of the material. We were primarily 
interested in patient experiences, therefore, as our primary 
data, we took the results sections of all articles, including the 
categories and subthemes identified by the articles’ authors. 
The first author then interpreted the data, and assigned pri-
mary codes. Parallel, he noted down comments, observa-
tions and reflections. Second, these codes were examined 
for similarities and differences, and were rewritten with 
a higher level of (psychological) abstraction into themes. 
Finally, these themes were subsequently reanalyzed and

grouped together by all authors, based on conceptual simi-
larities; these clusters comprised major themes and were 
given a descriptive label. We paid specific attention to poten-
tial similarities and differences by substance. All authors 
discussed additional analyses, and, where needed, categories 
were refined.

3   Results

3.1   Study Selection

The initial literature search identified a total of 1660 results 
(PubMed,  n =1025;  PsycINFO, n =232;  and  EMBASE, 
n =403,  and  additional  hand  searches  yielded  five  extra 
records. After removal of duplicates, the remaining 1472 

publications were screened. Screening titles and reading 
abstracts resulted in the exclusion of 1375 titles. Ninety-
seven full-text articles were obtained and read. Relevant 
information was extracted and assigned an additional code of 
yes/no/maybe, according to the inclusion criteria. Seventy-
nine additional articles were excluded for not meeting the 
criteria (see Fig. 1 for a further breakdown of the reasons). 
Three articles were excluded at a late stage: one study on 
the clinical use of MDMA [74] was ultimately excluded as 
it did not target a specific mental disorder and had unclear 
research methodology and study aims. Two recent psilocy-
bin studies [75, 76] were also excluded as they presented a 
series of case studies, without additional analysis. Finally, 
15 studies, with a total of 178 patients, were included in the 
systematic review.

3.2   Study Characteristics

All articles were published between 2014 and 2019. Where 
reported, respondents’ ages ranged from 21 to 67 years, and 
the number of included subjects ranged from 4 [77] to 22 
[78, 79]. Studies were heterogeneous in terms of substances, 
population/mental  disorders,  contexts,  and  qualitative 
research methodologies. For an overview of all substances 
and disorders, please see Table 2.

All studies on psilocybin, LSD, ketamine, and MDMA 
took  place  in  the  context  of  clinical  research  in  the  US 
[80–84], Switzerland [85] and the UK [53]. Ibogaine treat-
ments took place in treatment centers in Mexico [86] and 
Brazil [78, 79], while ayahuasca was used in ceremonial [87, 
88], religious [89] or treatment contexts [90].

3.3   Critical Appraisal of Study Quality

The quality of the included studies varied. Based on the 
CASP criteria [73], one study could be considered as low 
to medium quality [78] and two as medium quality [86, 89]. 
The majority of the studies were rated as medium/high [79, 
80, 85, 90] to high quality [77, 81–84, 87, 88, 91]. Overall, 
we found the validity, ethical considerations, and value of 
the studies to be of high quality. Critical reflections on the 
researchers’ roles and relationship with participants var-
ied widely, but this was not reflected in the overall quality 
assessment. Across the board, the rigor of the data analysis 
varied most and had the most room for improvement. An 
overview of the quality assessment of all included papers is 
presented in Appendix A. In order to examine the extent to 
which quality variations may have influenced the thematic 
synthesis, we conducted a post hoc sensitivity analysis. 
Assessing the relative contribution of the included studies 
to the thematic synthesis and overall themes, we found that 
lower-quality studies and studies with divergent research 
aims contributed comparatively less to the synthesis. The 
specific study aims and objectives correlated most clearly 
with the thematic synthesis. For instance, studies that aimed 
to address patients’ subjective experience of a substance’s 
psychoactive effects [79,  84,  86,  88] contributed mostly 
to the phenomenology section. The studies that focused 
on patient experiences of the therapeutic process [82, 85, 
88], aimed to increase the understanding of these complex 
treatments [81, 82, 85, 90], or (also) aimed to characterize, 
describe, or determine potential therapeutic mechanisms, 
effects, and processes [53, 82, 83, 85, 87, 90] contributed

most to the perspectives on the intervention, therapeutic pro-
cesses and outcomes. While we found quality differences, 
no articles were excluded based on our quality assessment. 
A complete overview of study aims, qualitative methodol-
ogy and other study characteristics can be found in Table 3.

3.4   Nature of Patient Experiences

We primarily assessed descriptions and narratives of patient 
experiences. Our analysis revealed that all authors discussed 
one or more of the following: (1) phenomenology of the 
experience; (2) perspectives on the intervention; (3) thera-
peutic  processes;  and  (4)  outcomes  of  the  intervention. 
Below we elaborate on each of the subthemes falling under 
these main themes, and provide key examples of each of the 
themes and results. In many instances, themes were reported 
for different substances and/or disorders. Where this was not 
the case, this is made explicit in the text. Quotes are included 
to illustrate patient experiences.

3.4.1   Phenomenology of the Psychedelic Experience

Several, but not all, studies explicitly addressed the phenom-
enology of the acute, inner experience induced by different 
psychedelic substances [79, 81, 82, 84, 86]. In this review, 
we report phenomena that were not characterized as thera-
peutic processes alone or that did not constitute separate 
themes in the synthesis, while recognizing that both the-
matic categories are closely intertwined. Phenomenological 
experiences were reported on the level of altered sensory 
perception (including synesthesia and the perception of 
time), visions and visuals, and somatic effects. Respond-
ents frequently alluded to the ineffability of the experience.
A slowed (or completely absent) perception of time and 
unusual bodily sensations were specifically mentioned by 
participants taking ketamine [84], while auditory effects, 
such as zapping or buzzing sounds, were only mentioned for 
ibogaine experiences [79, 86]. Abstract and transient visual 
phenomena (such as seeing animals, complex patterns, land-
scapes) and visions (immersive and personally meaningful) 
were reported by respondents in studies with psilocybin and 
ibogaine [79, 81, 82, 86]. To varying degrees, these visions 
contained autobiographical, relational, imaginary, dream-
like, indigenous, religious, and other elements.

“It sent me back to when I was very first born and felt 
like I was inside the womb … I fought the devil … he 
was telling me to give up and die, but I didn’t want to 
and I somehow beat him. And that I thought was my 
addiction at the time … I was able to float up in the 
atmosphere and I felt my grandma, I just felt her pres-
ence everywhere and I realized that she was all around 
the whole time.” [86] [ibogaine, SUD].

Notably, participants who had taken ibogaine reported 
physically unpleasant sensations, neurological effects and 
perceptual alterations that were not described in other stud-
ies [79, 86], although unusual and strange bodily sensations 
were also reported for ketamine [84]. Experiences of the 
brain being reorganized, accompanied by ‘zapping’ sensa-
tions, were described in studies with ibogaine [79, 86] and 
psilocybin [91].

“There was a little NASA space guy that came flying 
in and he was zapping my brain … it felt like they were 
scrubbing my brain, they were just doing surgery… it 
felt like brain receptors being cleaned.” [86] [ibogaine, 
SUD].

Somatic experiences were often connected to meaningful 
insights for participants with eating disorders, as evidenced 
by the following quote:

“I saw myself as a rotting, decaying skeleton and then 
I saw myself as this beautiful full-bodied, just beauti-
ful woman with this long hair, and I, like, I wanted to 
be that woman. I wanted to be that full, loving woman 
that has so much to offer my family and world. It was, 
and then I felt my ribs and I could feel them, they 
were so hollow and I was just, I was like, I can’t wait 
to get back and just start gaining some weight.” [87] 
[ayahuasca, eating disorder].

Several respondents, especially in studies with psilocy-
bin [77, 81, 82], and also with other substances, remarked 
on the ineffable nature of the experience, their inability to 
adequately put it into words, leading some to mention that 
it was easier to describe the emotional impact of the experi-
ence than the specific content.

“It was a feeling beyond an intellectual feeling—it was 
a feeling to the bottom of my core … that’s one reason 
that it’s hard to talk about … it’s beyond words.” [81] 
[psilocybin, end-of-life anxiety].

3.4.2   Perspectives on the Intervention

How the treatment itself was experienced proved an impor-
tant aspect for many of the respondents. This main category 
encompasses the following subthemes: (a) the context and 
structure of the treatment, and (b) comparisons with con-
ventional treatments.

3.4.2.1  Context  and  Structure  of  the  Intervention  Inde-
pendent  of  substance  or  disorder,  many  patients  reported 
how they experienced the treatment, and the ways interven-
tions were structured. Trust and a good connection or rap-
port  with  study  guides,  therapists  and  ceremonial  leaders

were explicitly mentioned as important therapeutic aspects 
[53, 80, 83, 87, 89].

“It’s not just the psilocybin sessions [but] it’s that 
human connection, and the support that comes with 
that human connection, that ultimately leads to suc-
cess at the end of the day.” [83] [psilocybin, smoking 
cessation].

Many respondents also noted the importance of the pre-
paratory sessions [53, 80, 83, 90]; for example, in prepar-
ing them for the potential of having challenging experiences 
[53]. The added value of integration sessions was also men-
tioned frequently [53, 80, 82, 83, 87].

“I  mean  besides  the  ayahuasca  itself,  besides  the 
medicinal quality of you know, chemically what aya-
huasca can do, I would say that (the most important 
therapeutic elements were) the trust, therapeutic trust 
in the medicine men and as well, the follow-up. The 
psychotherapy follow-up was crucial. And before and 
after (ceremony) I would say. I don’t know if I would 
ever recommend an ayahuasca ceremony without that 
therapeutic, the first one at least, without that thera-
peutic follow-up.” [87] [ayahuasca, eating disorder].

Music was used in all studies with psilocybin, MDMA, 
and LSD, as well as in ayahuasca ceremonies. One ibogaine 
study was conducted in silence [78, 79]; the third ibogaine 
study [86] and the ketamine study [84] did not report on 
this aspect. Only patients in various psilocybin studies (for 
end-of-life anxiety, depression, and smoking cessation) [53, 
82, 83] reflected on the role and function of music, stating 
that it served as a conduit, enabling them to experience and 
surrender to painful emotions or memories.

“Music was really how everything was conveyed to 
me, it all came through the music … like everything 
that I experienced did not really happen in the English 
language, it kind of happened through the music, like 
the music was the conduit for this experience to hap-
pen.” [82] [psilocybin, end-of-life anxiety].

In  contrast  with  many  other  classes  of  psychoactive 
substances (ketamine being a possible exception [92, 93]), 
psychedelics do not lead to addiction or dependence [25, 
94], and some respondents with SUDs remarked on these 
notable differences [79, 83]. In two of the studies that pro-
vided a single psilocybin session, several patients expressed 
the wish for additional sessions [82], and one study reported 
that several patients actively sought out extramedical psilo-
cybin sessions for this reason [53].

3.4.2.2  Comparisons with Other Treatments  Irrespective of 
disorder or substance, respondents reflected on different ele-
ments of the intervention, comparing these with previously 

935

experienced  conventional  treatments.  Many  also  reflected 
on  previous  strategies  in  coping  with  their  disorder,  and 
how these were addressed, often less effectively, in previous 
treatments [53, 78, 81]. Below, we provide some examples 
of particular personalized experiences of psychedelic treat-
ments. These are often juxtaposed generally with standard 
treatments,  although  respondents  did  not  always  specify 
what these treatments entailed.

“Standard approaches—I guess to summarize—are 
very top-down … like suppressing symptoms so that 
you can become functional, whereas the work with 
the medicine [ayahuasca] … is more of a bottom up 
approach that is very much really rewiring things, 
it’s  getting  to  the  root  cause  and  bringing  in  what 
was missing and resolving it on a deep, deep level 
that  doesn’t  I  don’t  think  really  get  fully  explored 
or touched upon in standard approaches.” [88] [aya-
huasca, eating disorder].

Respondents from across the spectrum of disorders and 
substances compared their psychedelic treatments favorably 
to previously undergone conventional treatments, calling it, 
for example, more effective [88], less normative [89], or 
more rapid [78], by focusing on inner processes as opposed 
to talk therapy [85] and by providing healing beyond what 
they found in conventional treatments [80]. Patients also 
favored the length of the sessions and attention they received 
[53].

“In usual psychotherapy it is mainly about talking, 
about  words.  In  LSD-assisted  psychotherapy  it  is 
mainly  about  inner  processes,  inner  change,  inner 
experience, it gets enriched by it.” [85] [LSD, end-of-
life anxiety].

Many respondents reflected upon the intervention’s effec-
tiveness for the specific disorder they were struggling with 
[78, 80, 88, 90]. In the below quote, a patient with PTSD 
mentions several crucial elements that together enabled him 
to address his (war-related) trauma.

“I think that the MDMA gave me the ability to feel as 
though I was capable and safe of tackling the issues. 
Whereas before I feared those thoughts and I tried to 
avoid them at all times, and avoid things that reminded 
me of those thoughts, I think it allowed me to feel safe 
in my space. Of being able to fight it. I felt like I had 
the ability and tools, whereas before I was unarmed, 
unarmored, and had no support. And this type of envi-
ronment, with [the therapists], the catalyst drug, and 
everything else, it felt as though I had backup. Now it 
was safe and I had my tools and weapons to be able 
to tackle the obstacles that I never had before.” [80] 
[MDMA, PTSD].

Psychedelic Treatments for Psychiatric Disorders: A Systematic Review and Thematic Synthesis of Patient Experiences in Qualitative Studies936 

J. J. Breeksema et al.

Multiple patients who underwent ayahuasca ceremonies 
to treat eating disorders provided suggestions for integrat-
ing these with conventional eating disorder treatments [88]. 
Respondents in one study, when prompted, actually stated 
becoming more open towards future conventional therapies, 
despite having undergone multiple therapies without suc-
cess [80].

3.4.3   Therapeutic Processes

Potential psychological or therapeutic processes or mecha-
nisms of action constituted a major theme that, in one way 
or another, recurred in all studies included in this review. 
These cover several categories, which overlap to a certain 
degree. Often, there was no clear-cut distinction between 
the different therapeutic mechanisms, and elements of one 
therapeutic mechanism blended into others. Acknowledging 
their interrelatedness, in this review we report on the follow-
ing categories: (1) insights; (2) altered self-perception; (3) 
feelings of connectedness; (4) transcendental experiences; 
and (5) expanded emotional spectrum. These are briefly dis-
cussed below.

3.4.3.1  Insights  One  of  the  most  frequently  mentioned 
themes was achieving insights, most crucially into one’s self, 
alternatively called improved self-awareness or self-under-
standing. This was also frequently mentioned as an outcome 
of  the  intervention.  For  various  disorders  and  substances, 
patients reported improved insights in their disorder, its root 
causes, and related behaviors [80, 83, 87, 88, 90].

“I remember having a ceremony where I really saw 
that at the time binging and purging and restricting 
were actually adaptive coping mechanisms; at the time, 
they were the only coping mechanisms that I actually 
knew to use to deal with the difficulty that I was expe-
riencing, that I had no words for and that no one was 
asking about.” [87] [ayahuasca, eating disorder].

These insights resulted in an improved understanding 
of the underlying disorders, the root psychological causes 
[87], an improved understanding of the underlying causes 
of addiction [90], and, more specifically for patients with 
eating disorders, somatic insights [87]. Respondents also 
gained crucial insights into their behavior towards others 
with regard to relationships with friends, family or part-
ners [78, 82]. Specific examples of these mechanisms were 
visions of an autobiographical nature [79], a new under-
standing of death and dying [81], and changes in perspec-
tive, also referred to as ‘de-schematizing’ [85]. In one study, 
patients describe how insights continued to evolve across 
and between psilocybin sessions [83].

3.4.3.2  Altered  Self‑Perception  Alterations  in  how  the 
self was experienced during the sessions played an impor-
tant  role  in  many  studies  in  this  review.  The  emphasis  on 
changed  perceptions  of,  and  perspectives  on,  one’s  self 
was  mentioned  variably  as  increased  self-efficacy  [78], 
decreased  self-criticism  [86],  facilitated  by  a  lowering  of 
psychological defense mechanisms [53], and increased self-
awareness [78, 80, 87]. Closely associated were experiences 
of  greater  self-love,  self-care,  self-confidence,  self-accept-
ance,  self-awareness,  self-worth,  self-control,  self-esteem, 
self-compassion, and self-forgiveness.

“I learned a lot. I learned a lot about myself. I’d gotten 
to the point of questioning myself, my own morals, 
and for someone who hasn’t done this stuff, they’re not 
going to understand. You can see yourself like you can 
read a book and see everything that you stand for and 
kind of analyze your own self, your own thought, your 
own reasoning.” [80] [MDMA, PTSD].

Related to this were experiences of a dissolving or loos-
ening sense of self, which often gave way to a wider per-
spective, which was linked to transcendental experiences 
(see below).

“Ayahuasca helped me deeply connect with myself so 
that self-love has been the prevalent priority over self-
criticism that […] self-love became more important 
and more prevalent. And that to me is the antidote for 
an eating disorder.” [87] ⁠ [ayahuasca, eating disorder].

3.4.3.3  Connectedness  Increased  connection,  or  connect-
edness, was a central theme in one study on psilocybin treat-
ment  for  depression  [53].  Across  other  studies  with  psilo-
cybin, as well as with ibogaine and ayahuasca, respondents 
also  describe  (re)connection  on  different  levels;  internally 
(with  their  emotions,  senses,  parts  of  their  self  and  their 
identity),  as  well  as  externally  (with  others,  i.e.  partners, 
family  members,  friends  [53,  78,  83,  88],  and  also  with 
nature and the world at large [53, 81, 82].

“(The psilocybin) just opens you up and it connects 
you … it’s not just people, it’s animals, it’s trees—
everything is interwoven, and that’s a big relief … I 
think it does help you accept death because you don’t 
feel alone, you don’t feel like you’re going to, I don’t 
know, go off into nothingness. That’s the number one 
thing—you’re just not alone.” [81] [psilocybin, end-
of-life anxiety].

Experiences of interconnectedness, a felt sense of the 
unity of all things, were described explicitly by patients in 
various psilocybin studies [53, 81–83].

“(During the dose) I was everybody, unity, one life 
with 6 billion faces, I was the one asking for love and 

giving love, I was swimming in the sea, and the sea 
was me.” [53] ⁠ [psilocybin, depression].

ing to feel something that was such a change from what 
I normally feel.” [84] [ketamine, depression].

937

3.4.3.4  Transcendental  Experiences  Mystical, 
religious 
or  spiritual  aspects  of  healing  were  widely  reported  in 
patients’  healing  experiences  in  treatment  with  ayahuasca 
[88, 90], ibogaine [79, 86], and psilocybin [53, 81–83], as 
well as for different mental disorders. These were related to 
transpersonal  experiences,  feelings  of  awe  and  transcend-
ence, a dissolving of the self, a connection to greater forces, 
an interconnectedness with all life, and the unity of all and 
everything.

“It was like being inside of nature, and I could’ve just 
stayed there forever—it was wonderful. All kinds of 
other things were coming, too, like feelings of being 
connected to everything, I mean, everything in nature. 
Everything—even  like  pebbles,  drops  of  water  in 
the sea … it was like magic. It was wonderful, and it 
wasn’t like talking about it, which makes it an idea, it 
was, like, experiential. It was like being inside a drop 
of water, being inside of … a butterfly’s wing. And 
being inside of a cheetah’s eyes.” [82] ⁠ [psilocybin, 
end-of-life anxiety].

3.4.3.5  Expanded  Emotional  Spectrum  Across  substances 
and  disorders,  respondents  report  on  the  wide  emotional 
scope of the experience, the increased access to a range of 
emotions,  and  the  importance  of  the  emotional  content  of 
their experiences. Emotions ranging from bliss, joy, peace, 
and love on one end of the spectrum, to anger, anxiety, ter-
ror, dysphoria, and paranoia on the other end, were reported 
by respondents in the majority of the articles.

“Emotionally it was a roller coaster ride … The first 
time it was very brutal, painful, at least emotionally 
very painful. I could not even say in which direction—
it just hurt, like heartache, like being disappointed, 
like everything you once had experienced as a nega-
tive feeling. … It was pure pain. Pain of memories, 
well, or memory of pain. … it was quite hard. During 
the second time it was sublime. Really. Love, expan-
sion, holding, I knew that this sometimes happens, that 
participants talk about spiritual experiences. I thought 
they just meant this dissolution of oneself – everything 
is okay, everything is great. That was a very important 
experience for me. Very, very important.” [85] [LSD, 
end-of-life anxiety].

Sometimes a change in mood from their usual emotional 

state was considered therapeutic in itself.

“That place was um, serene and peaceful, and um, just 
such a burden was lifted from me. And it was refresh-

In addition to accessing previously inaccessible emotions, 
some respondents also describe an improved ability to pro-
cess unresolved emotions [87, 88]. Participants regularly 
mentioned that experiential sessions could be challenging 
or painful. These emotionally difficult experiences were 
often considered therapeutically useful, especially when 
participants managed to transform negative into positive 
emotions, which often had a lasting impact [53, 78, 81, 82, 
85, 88]. Closely related was the therapeutic importance of 
emotional catharsis, or the release of often painful emotions 
or memories [53, 77, 79, 82, 85]. This tied in closely with 
participants’ ability to accept, and surrender to, the difficult 
emotions they experienced [53, 81, 82, 85, 88].

“Excursions into grief, loneliness and rage, abandon-
ment. Once I went into the anger it went ‘pouf’ and 
evaporated. I got the lesson that you need to go into 
the scary basement, once you get into it, there is no 
scary basement to go into (anymore).” [53] [psilocy-
bin, depression].

In addition to accepting challenging emotional states, 
accepting one’s situation (or more specifically, one’s body 
and illness), particularly in the face of one’s impending 
demise, appeared to play an important role for patients with 
a terminal diagnosis [81, 82, 85].

“I kind of accepted my body for what it is, and I think 
up until that point I resisted that … I saw this body for 
what it’s worth. I picked it, it’s mine. It’s more matter-
of-fact—this is what it is. I think that acceptance has 
been liberating.” [81] [psilocybin, end-of-life anxiety].

3.4.4   Outcomes of the Intervention

It sometimes proved difficult to distinguish outcomes of the 
treatment from processes participants underwent and the 
mechanisms described above. In many cases these over-
lapped: aspects that were experienced during the experien-
tial sessions proved to have a lasting impact. Subthemes in 
this category include (1) symptom relief; (2) perspectives 
of self; (3) sense of connectedness; (4) mood and emotional 
changes; and (5) quality of life.

3.4.4.1  Symptom Relief  In many studies, participants expe-
rienced significant relief from the disorder they were treated 
for, including reductions in eating disorder-related thoughts 
and  symptoms,  PTSD  symptoms,  anxiety,  depression,  and 
substance  use.  Reductions  in  withdrawal  and  reduced  (in 
some  cases  completely  vanished)  craving  were  mentioned 
by participants in all studies on SUDs [77, 78, 83, 86, 89, 
90]. Remarkably, decreased drug, alcohol, and medication

use were also reported in studies with MDMA, ayahuasca 
and psilocybin that did not deal directly with substance use 
[53, 80, 87].

“When I first started [the study] I was taking 10 dif-
ferent things. And now no blood pressure medicine, 
no anxiety pills, no pain pills.” [80] [MDMA, PTSD].

More  broadly,  outcomes  were  often  seen  beyond  the 
realm of the initial diagnosis, and, in fact, participants often 
considered these other results to be more significant.

“This  is  about  a  smoking  study,  I  keep  forgetting 
that. Because there’s so much more that happened… 
(Smoking) just seems so petty compared to some of 
the stuff that was happening.” [83] [psilocybin, smok-
ing cessation].

3.4.4.2  Perspectives  of  Self  Therapeutic  outcomes  were 
often  discussed  in  the  realm  of  the  self.  Previously  men-
tioned shifts in self-perception as therapeutic process often 
remained with patients, who described being better able to 
understand,  reflect  on,  or  be  aware  of  themselves  [53,  80, 
83, 87], experienced greater self-confidence and self-esteem 
[87], as well as self-acceptance [86], and found themselves 
better able to feel love and compassion for themselves [80, 
87, 88], leading to better self-care [88].

“[Ibogaine] gave me more self-love … I’m not so hard 
on myself.” [86] [ibogaine, SUD].

3.4.4.3  Sense of Connectedness  Enhanced  (inter)connect-
edness  was  reported  across  substances,  both  during  ses-
sions and afterwards, with respondents alluding to positive 
changes in friendships and improved relationships with fam-
ily  members  [53,  78,  80].  One  article  describes  increased 
altruism and prosocial activities in general [83].

“[I feel] love, compassion, and it’s not just for family, 
it’s for everyone…[my parents and I] have a much bet-
ter relationship now, no doubt… the study helped me 
really get there.” [80] [MDMA, PTSD].

“I think right after the trips … certain changes hap-
pened  …  Same  things  were  not  equally  important 
anymore. A shift in values. … To take time to listen 
to music, to listen to music consciously. Maybe that 
material values were not that important anymore. That 
other values have priority. Health and family, such 
things… When you have a job and the job has prior-
ity and the family comes last. You don’t even notice it 
anymore. To realize there, stop, what is actually impor-
tant? That the family is fine, that the kids are doing 
well …” [85] [LSD, end-of-life anxiety].

reported 

3.4.4.4  Emotions  Participants  also 
improved 
mood, greater optimism, an increased emotional repertoire, 
and  positive  emotional  changes  [53,  78,  82,  84].  In  some 
cases,  this  included  increased  confidence  in  dealing  with 
future adverse situations, such as a relapse in symptoms or 
the recurrence of their illness [53, 81].

“Though my problems obviously have not stopped to 
happen and appear, I changed in the face of them. So, 
I get to the end of my day very grateful, very happy.” 
[78] [ibogaine, SUD].

3.4.4.5  Quality  of  Life  Across  the  board,  respondents  in 
these studies describe positive and often lasting changes in 
quality of life and well-being [78, 82, 85], experiencing an 
increased sense of peace and mental space in daily life [53, 
81, 84]. Respondents also mentioned an increased sense of 
purpose or meaning in life [81]. Increased appreciation of 
beauty in art, music, and nature was reported by several par-
ticipants [53, 83].

“A veil dropped from my eyes, things were suddenly 
clear, glowing, bright. I looked at plants and felt their 
beauty. I can still look at my orchids and experience 
that: that is the one thing that has really lasted.” [53] 
[psilocybin, depression].

In one study, participants report being able to maintain 
this sense of well-being even after relapsing or after symp-
toms return [53]. These positive changes in quality of life 
were reflected in the positive changes participants made, 
such as re-engaging with previously enjoyed activities such 
as practicing sports, changing nutritional habits, reading 
poetry and other hobbies. Changes in quality of life seemed 
associated with revised priorities in life or more clarity 
around values, as exemplified by one participant.

“I had lost desire to do anything, I lacked will to go to 
the gym, to the park, the cinema, I only wanted to stay 
home. After ibogaine the first thing I wanted to do was 
going to the park, to the movies” [78] [ibogaine, SUD].

4   Discussion

This paper is the first to systematically offer an overview 
and thematic synthesis of the qualitative empirical litera-
ture that describes patient experiences of treatments using a 
psychedelic substance for the treatment of a mental disorder. 
All included qualitative studies were published in the last 
5 years, which is indicative of both the increasing interest 
in therapeutic applications of psychedelics and a growing 
appreciation of qualitative methods in clinical research; half 
of the studies complemented quantitative measurements in 
clinical trials. We used a broad definition of psychedelics 

that included a range of pharmacologically diverse sub-
stances: the ‘classical’ serotonergic psychedelics psilocy-
bin, LSD, and ayahuasca; MDMA; ibogaine; and ketamine, 
which were used to treat several distinct mental disorders. 
This was driven by the presumed shared phenomenology 
of psychedelics [26], combined with the strong phenotypic 
overlap or high comorbidity between psychiatric diagnostic 
categories [95], the genetic overlap between mental disor-
ders [96], as well as the absence of reliable biomarkers [97] 
or natural boundaries [98, 99] to distinguish disorders, and 
also the fact that diagnostic categories can change over time 
[99–101]. Furthermore, there is evidence to support the idea 
that the subjective experience induced by these compounds 
is relevant for their therapeutic effect. To some degree, this 
also holds true for ketamine, which is nevertheless predomi-
nantly administered as a standalone pharmacotherapy [2, 
27, 102–104]. In some instances, a single substance (e.g. 
psilocybin) was used for the treatment of varying mental 
disorders: depression, nicotine dependence, alcohol use dis-
order and end-of-life distress. Similarly, different substances 
(psilocybin, LSD, ayahuasca and ketamine) were studied for 
the treatment of the same disorder (e.g. depression).

Despite  the  oft-reported  ineffability  (the  inability  to 
adequately verbalize the phenomenological content of their 
experiences), respondents in several studies did offer rather 
detailed descriptions of their experiences, as well as reflec-
tions on the intervention. Not all studies described phenom-
enological aspects of the acute experience; this is most likely 
related to the specific methodology used or the researchers’ 
areas of interest.

For a critical appraisal of the qualitative assessment of 
the participants’ experience, it is important to understand 
when, by whom, and how data collection and analysis were 
performed. Given the timing of interviews, which varied 
considerably (from 1 week to 1 year post-session; for an 
overview  see  Table  3),  also  within  studies,  respondents 
may not always have had enough time or distance to gain a 
broader perspective on their experiences, or to experience 
longer-term changes in the first place. As some respondents 
alluded to, insights were not always gained during the inter-
ventions themselves, but rather between sessions, or follow-
ing (integrative) sessions [83].

Interestingly, in some studies, treatment-resistant patients 
in placebo groups reported enduring, clinically significant 
improvements (see, for example [8]). This may illustrate 
the importance attributed to extrapharmacological factors 
that were mentioned by respondents: trust, interpersonal 
rapport, attention, the length of treatment sessions, and a 
safe treatment setting. However, since several studies were 
uncontrolled or open-label, contextual factors could not be 
discriminated from drug effects. Music was also frequently 
mentioned as an important element. This is in line with the 
role of music in both traditional ceremonial psychedelic use 

939

and present-day clinical psychedelic research [105], suggest-
ing that therapeutic benefits may be promoted not only by 
the drug but by its interaction with music [106]. Music is 
typically used to elicit personally meaningful experiences by 
intensifying emotions and mental imagery; guiding or sup-
porting emerging experiences; and by providing non-verbal 
structure, grounding, and continuity [33, 105, 106].

Therapeutic alliance is considered a strong predictor of 
treatment success in conventional psychotherapy [107]. The 
value respondents attributed to surrendering to and over-
coming intense, emotionally challenging experiences sug-
gests that therapeutic alliance may be crucial in establishing 
patient safety. Participants also stressed the importance of 
preparatory and integration sessions in this respect.

This review revealed several therapeutic mechanisms, all 
reported for multiple substances and disorders. Mechanisms 
include gaining insights, altered self-perception, increased 
feelings of connectedness, transcendental experiences, and 
expanded emotional spectrum. These mechanisms often 
overlapped; elements of one therapeutic mechanism also 
featured in descriptions of others. For example, insights into 
relationships with family or friends related to experiences 
of connectedness, while experiences of interconnectedness 
can also be labeled as mystical. Likewise, an emotional 
breakthrough can follow insight into the origins of one’s 
depression and may be prompted by having surrendered to a 
particularly challenging experience. It is plausible that mul-
tiple mechanisms, or elements thereof, may act together in 
producing therapeutically relevant outcomes.

Descriptions of therapeutic processes were closely inter-
twined with the phenomenology of the subjective experi-
ence, and were often difficult to distinguish from treatment 
outcomes. This can be explained by the presumed thera-
peutic effect of the subjective experience itself, making it 
difficult to disentangle the two. It is also partially inherent 
to the interpretative process of analyzing and synthesizing 
qualitative data. Patient reports can be ambivalent and it is 
not always clear whether they refer to acute experiences or 
longer-term outcomes. Patients reported a range of insights, 
changed perspectives and increased understanding, into the 
self and (root causes of) their disorder. Insights and altered 
self-perception were related to outcomes such as increased 
self-love, self-worth, and self-compassion. Again, these 
were described irrespective of a specific disorder or sub-
stance. Some participants reported experiences of ego dis-
solution, often linked to feelings of connection to larger exis-
tential powers. These spiritual or mystical aspects of healing 
were also mentioned across substance and disorder. Both 
early [108–110] and present-day psychedelic studies [13, 
14, 51, 111, 112] have found significant relations between 
mystical experiences and therapeutic outcomes. Experiences 
of interconnectedness emerged as a theme in all psilocybin 
studies; ‘connectedness’ constituted a major theme in one

study [53], prompting new hypotheses and the development 
of new scales [52]. Psychedelics may intensify emotions 
and have been used for this purpose since early psychother-
apy research in the 1950s [113]. Patients also considered 
improved access to a greater range of emotions and emo-
tional content important, particularly being able to process 
and release previously unresolved or inaccessible emotions. 
The fact that catharsis or emotional breakthrough may act 
as a mediating determinant in long-term positive changes 
in well-being is partially validated by recent online surveys 
[55]. Furthermore, patients explicitly attributed value to 
overcoming difficult experiences. These are thought to be 
a mediating factor in both negative and positive long-term 
effects of treatment with psychedelics [114–116]. Evidence 
from survey studies indicated that the peak intensity of chal-
lenging experiences was associated with positive long-term 
outcomes, provided resolution was achieved, as longer dura-
tion was predictive of negative outcomes [116].

Respondents  reported  both  clinically  and  personally 
meaningful outcomes. An interesting finding was that many 
patients reported benefits beyond symptom reduction. In 
fact, they did not always consider symptom reduction to be 
the primary benefit. In all studies on SUDs, respondents 
reported decreases in craving and withdrawal symptoms 
[77–79, 83, 86, 89, 90]. Interestingly, these reductions were 
also reported by patients with depression, eating disorders, 
and PTSD. While there has been substantial anecdotal, albeit 
not clinical, evidence to suggest that ibogaine in particular is 
capable of attenuating (opioid) withdrawal [43, 117], reduc-
tion and elimination of craving and withdrawal symptoms 
were also reported in studies with ayahuasca [90], psilocybin 
[83] and MDMA [80]. Since many mental disorders have 
high comorbidity with SUDs [118–121], this may explain 
why the therapeutic action of psychedelics may need not be 
limited to a specific disorder or (set of) symptoms.

This  review  had  several  limitations.  First,  studies 
included in this review varied in terms of design, qualita-
tive  research  methodology,  analysis  methods,  timing  of 
the interviews, and overall quality. These factors may have 
influenced results and reduced comparability. Second, we 
considered mental disorders non-specifically. Compounded 
by the diversity of substances and heterogeneity of treat-
ment contexts, it could be argued that this review compared 
orchard-grown apples with indoor-cultivated oranges. Given 
the overlap in phenomenology of these diverse substances, 
the various mental disorders, and combined with the nov-
elty of this field, and the relative paucity of the available 
evidence, this review was meant to serve an exploratory 
purpose and was not intended to yield comparative results 
(as, indeed, this would require more studies per substance 
and per disorder, as well as a multidimensional matrix). As 
a result, substance-specific characteristics for the treatment 

of specific disorders could not be teased out. It has been sug-
gested that MDMA, for example, possesses characteristics 
that make it uniquely useful for the treatment of PTSD [122]; 
the same has been argued for ibogaine in the treatment of 
SUD [42]. The high heterogeneity of the articles included 
in this review do not provide sufficient evidence to establish 
these relations. While this review does not suggest that all 
substances have the same effect, its results do indicate that 
psychedelics—perhaps with the exception of ketamine (as 
there were insufficient qualitative data)–may induce states 
of consciousness that are considered valuable by patients, 
suggesting a broad applicability of different psychedelics 
for mental disorders. More research is needed to substanti-
ate this claim, or to establish whether some substances are 
indeed more qualified for the treatment of specific disorders. 
Third, it is possible that respondents’ favorable reports of 
their psychedelic treatments, when contrasted with previ-
ous (unsuccessful) conventional treatments, may be attrib-
uted to selection or expectation bias. Indeed, a substantial 
proportion of participants reported prior experience with 
psychedelics; this ranged from 10% with LSD [12] to 23% 
with ecstasy (MDMA) [7], and 25% [20], 55% [13] and 67% 
[4] reported prior experience with psilocybin. None of the 
studies on ibogaine and ketamine reported on this; all stud-
ies on ayahuasca, where reported, included participants who 
had undergone between one and 30 ceremonies. Addition-
ally, in various studies, patients were self-selected, meaning 
they may not be representative for the larger population in 
seeking out these novel treatment modalities. Lastly, it is 
possible that research in this field, as in any new (or reap-
pearing) research topic, overvalues positive aspects of these 
treatments [123]. Patient selection in pioneer studies is often 
(unintentionally) biased towards positive outcomes, and 
study samples are still small and non-generalizable. More 
studies in larger and more heterogeneous patient samples 
would be needed to appraise the real impact and ecological 
validity of these treatments.

The advent of psychedelic treatments has recently been 
labeled a new paradigm for psychiatry [124]. Patients fre-
quently report on clinical effects beyond their psychiatric 
diagnosis, and pharmacologically distinct substances appear 
to exert comparable therapeutic processes for the same men-
tal disorders. Psychedelic treatments may well contribute to 
a new sort of non-specific ‘precision medicines’ [125] or 
‘targeted psychotherapies’ of mental disorders, by setting 
in motion subjective therapeutic processes that address root 
causes or core elements of a single psychopathology dimen-
sion (also called p-factor [126]) that manifest differently as 
different mental disorders. Since it is not well understood 
how psychotherapies contribute to change [127], it remains 
important to study these complexities more closely.

5   Conclusions

Treatments for mental disorders involving psychedelics are 
receiving renewed attention and scrutiny. The therapeu-
tic mediators and mechanisms through which these com-
pounds contribute to treatment outcomes remain insuffi-
ciently understood. Our review revealed several connected 
therapeutic processes—seen across substances and for dif-
ferent disorders—that contributed to clinically significant 
and  personally  meaningful  outcomes.  Exploring  patient 
experiences can increase our understanding of underlying 
therapeutic mechanisms and processes, the role of (extra)
pharmacological factors in these treatment modalities, which 
may contribute to optimizing treatment context, and lead to 
improved clinical responses and personal benefits. Despite 
the heterogeneity of substance, setting, and population, these 
studies also suggest that, in addition to a shared phenom-
enology, psychedelic treatments exhibit similar therapeutic 
processes and result in comparable outcomes. As this review 
demonstrates, qualitative research of psychedelic treatments 
can contribute to distinguishing specific features of these 
compounds, and show potential for elucidating otherwise 
undiscovered implications for the treatment of distinct men-
tal disorders.
