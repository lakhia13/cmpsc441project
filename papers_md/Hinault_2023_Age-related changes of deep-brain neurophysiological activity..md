Cognitive decline with age is associated with brain atrophy and reduced brain activations, but the underlying neurophysiological
mechanisms are unclear, especially in deeper brain structures primarily affected by healthy aging or neurodegenerative processes.
Here, we characterize time-resolved, resting-state magnetoencephalography activity of the hippocampus and subcortical brain
regions in a large cohort of healthy young (20–30 years) and older (70–80 years) volunteers from the Cam-CAN (Cambridge Centre
for Ageing and Neuroscience) open repository. The data show age-related changes in both rhythmic and arrhythmic signal strength
in multiple deeper brain regions, including the hippocampus, striatum, and thalamus. We observe a slowing of neural activity across
deeper brain regions, with increased delta and reduced gamma activity, which echoes previous reports of cortical slowing. We also
report reduced occipito-parietal alpha peak associated with increased theta-band activity in the hippocampus, an effect that may
ref lect compensatory processes as theta activity, and slope of arrhythmic activity were more strongly expressed when short-term
memory performances were preserved. Overall, this study advances the understanding of the biological nature of inter-individual
variability in aging. The data provide new insight into how hippocampus and subcortical neurophysiological activity evolve with
biological age, and highlight frequency-specific effects associated with cognitive decline versus cognitive maintenance.

Key words: aging; subcortical; hippocampus; oscillatory activity; cognition; MEG.

Introduction

The course of healthy aging is associated with preserved
daily life autonomy, although the efficiency of cognitive
functions such as memory and executive control
diminishes (Hinault and Lemaire 2020). Age-related
cognitive decline is heterogeneous across individuals
as brain functions are affected differentially across the
population from the same age group (Reuter-Lorenz and
Park 2014; Jauny et al. 2022b). Older individuals, relative
to young adults, show variable amounts of decline of
cognitive performance, brain atrophy and reduced brain
activations (Spreng and Turner 2019). The hippocampus
and subcortical structures have been extensively studied
in cognition research (Olsen et al. 2013; Bourgeois et al.
2020). Their early involvement in age-related neurode-
generative pathologies is also now better understood
(Gulyaeva 2019). Yet, age-related changes of rhythmic
and arrhythmic neurophysiological activity have been
seldom investigated in these brain regions.

Task-free, spontaneous fluctuations of brain activity at
rest have long been considered as unwanted background
noise, yet recent works highlight their potential as
useful indicators of individual cognitive performance

(Uddin 2020; Waschke et al. 2021; Wiesman et al. 2021).
Some of the rich dynamical features of magnetoen-
cephalography and electroencephalography (M/EEG;
Buzsáki 2019; Hinault et al. 2019b) activity change with
biological age (Cheng et al. 2015; Courtney and Hinault
2021). Indeed, the aging brain expresses increased slower
activity below 4 Hz (delta frequency band), negatively
associated with cognitive performance (Kumral et al.
2020; Jauny et al. 2022a). Recent tools have emphasized
the distinction between rhythmic (oscillatory periodic
activity, that can be specifically defined over limited
frequency bands) and arrhythmic (non-oscillatory, aperi-
odic broadband components often associated with back-
ground neurophysiological signal) signal components in
electrophysiology (Voytek et al. 2015; Donoghue et al.
2020). The magnitude of arrhythmic activity increases
with aging (Merkin et al. 2021), a possible expression
of increased neural noise associated with cognitive
decline (Thuwal et al. 2021). However, most of these age-
related electrophysiological observations so far are from
neocortical activity.

Here, we sought

to identify specific deep-brain
neurophysiological signal features associated with the

heterogeneity of cognitive aging. A growing body of
work demonstrates MEG activity stemming from deeper
structures (Coffey et al. 2016; Müller et al. 2019;
Gorina-Careta et al. 2021; Samuelsson et al. 2021). We
retrieved MEG data from younger and older individuals
from the Cam-CAN (“Cambridge Centre for Ageing and
Neuroscience”; Shafto et al. 2014; Taylor et al. 2017)
repository to investigate time-resolved resting-state
neurophysiological fluctuations in the hippocampus,
striatum, and thalamus. Because these structures are
critical for short-term and working memory functions
and show age-related changes (O’Shea et al. 2016; Valdés
Hernández et al. 2020), we expected cognitive changes
to be associated with slower, reduced, or more variable
neurophysiological activity in older adults. We also
hypothesized that preserved cognitive performances in
healthy older adults would be associated with increased
deep-brain activity.

Methods
Participants’ characteristics
The structural MRI and resting-state MEG data from the
Cam-CAN repository (Shafto et al. 2014; Taylor et al.
2017; were available from http://www.mrc-cbu.cam.
ac.uk/datasets/camcan/). All participants gave written
informed consent for the study. The research protocol
has been conducted in compliance with the Helsinki Dec-
laration, and has been approved by the Cambridgeshire
Research Ethics Committee (reference: 10/H0308/50).
The retrieved sample consisted of 47 young adults (20–
30 years, 30 females) and 47 older adults (65–75 years,
30 females; Table 1). Details on the demographic and
behavioral data are available online (https://camcan-
archive.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/dataaccess/). All older adults
scored within normal range at the mini-mental state
evaluation (MMSE score > 27; Folstein et al. 1975).
No participants reported a history of neurological or
cognitive disorders, traumatic brain injury, or major
psychiatric disorders.

Behavioral tasks
Because deep-brain regions are essential to short-term
memory and working memory performance (McNab and
Klingberg 2008), we investigated age-related changes in
the visual short-term memory (VSTM) task. In this task,

participants were briefly presented 1–4 colored discs
on a computer screen and asked to recall the color of
the target disc at a cued location. Participants reported
their delayed response on a color wheel using a touch-
screen input (further detail concerning the task is avail-
able online; https://camcan-archive.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/
dataaccess/).

Neuroimaging data
The MRI data consisted of T1-weighted image volumes
(field of view: 256 × 240 × 192 mm, 1 × 1 × 1 mm voxel
size, repetition time: 2,250 ms, echo time: 900 ms, and flip
angle: 9◦). MEG data consisted of ∼9 min of eyes-closed
resting-state recordings acquired with a 306-channel
Elekta Neuromag Vectorview MEG system (102 mag-
netometers and 204 planar gradiometers), with 1-kHz
sampling rate, and a 0.03–330 Hz online band-pass filter.
Registration of MEG and MRI used digitized anatomical
landmarks (i.e. fiducial points; nasion and left/right
preauricular points; and additional scalp points). The
electro-occulogram (EOG) and electrocardiogram (ECG)
were recorded to capture eye movements and heartbeats,
respectively.

MEG data analysis
The retrieved data were already partly preprocessed
using the temporal signal-space separation approach
(tSSS): 0.98 correlation, 10-s window; bad channel correc-
tion: ON; motion correction: OFF; and 50 Hz + harmonics
(mains) notch. We performed further artifact detection
and attenuation (on continuous data), band-pass filter-
ing (0.3–100-Hz FIR filter (filter type: Kaiser; filter order:
3,626), 60-dB stopband attenuation, also on continuous
data), and source estimation using “Brainstorm” (Tadel
et al. 2011), all with default parameters, unless noted
below. Remaining physiological artifacts (e.g. eye blinks
and saccades) were identified and removed with bespoke
signal-space projections (Uusitalo and Ilmoniemi 1997).
For each participant, we identified defective sensors
(M = 0.02 in young adults and M = 0.17 in older adults)
and defined individual alpha peak frequencies (IAF)
from power-spectrum density (PSD) estimates (Welch’s
method, 1-s sliding window length, with 50% overlap)
across the duration of the recordings. We defined IAF
as the average frequency of the PSD spectral peaks
in the alpha frequency range (7–13 Hz) observed over

3962 | Cerebral Cortex, 2023, Vol. 33, No. 7

occipito-parietal gradiometers and magnetometers. No
difference in IAF was observed between sensor types
(P > 0.08). To account for individual brain atrophy and
inform MEG source imaging (Baillet 2017), we used
“Freesurfer” (Fischl 2012) to produce segmentations of
head tissues, including cortex and subcortical structures,
and to compute the intracranial volume from each
participant’s MRI.

We modeled MEG brain source activity using elemen-
tary volume current dipoles (15,000 elementary source
locations across the entire brain without orientation con-
straint; Baillet et al. 2001). To that end, we used the
Desikan/Kiliany atlas (“aparc” + “aseg” segmentation;
Desikan et al. 2006). Both gray and white matter struc-
tures were imported from Freesurfer’s individual cor-
tical parcellation, and sources were distributed across
the entire head volume. We then used the overlapping-
sphere approach to MEG forward head modeling (Baillet
et al. 2001). The distributed source model was defined
across the entire brain volume (Attal and Schwartz 2013;
Recasens et al. 2018), and outer gray matter surface was
used. Because the orientation of major cell assemblies
in deeper brain structures is not as homogenous as for-
pyramidal cells of the cortex, we have opted to relax
the surface location and orientation constraints in our
source modeling analyses.

We could not explicitly account for environmental
and instrumental noise, as empty-room recordings were
not available. We used a noninformative prior as a
substitute of the noise statistics, which assumed unit
and independent noise variance across sensors. We
derived MEG imaging kernels for each individual using
the dynamic Statistical Parametric Mapping approach
(dSPM; Dale et al. 2000; Hauk et al. 2011) to estimate the
source time-series of each region of interest (ROI; left
and right hippocampus, thalamus, nucleus accumbens,
caudate, and putamen). To determine the specificity
of deep-brain effects, we performed control analyses
on a subset of cortical regions of the “aparc” atlas (see
Supplementary Fig. S1), which were previously reported
as showing changes in neurophysiological activity asso-
ciated with age-related short-term and working memory
performance alterations (e.g. Hinault et al. 2020).

We performed time-frequency decompositions of
MEG source time-series using the Hilbert transform
in frequency bands of interest. The width of each
frequency band was based on the surface IAF value
of each participant (Toppi et al. 2018): delta (IAF-
8/IAF-6), theta (IAF-6/IAF-2), alpha (IAF-2/IAF + 2), beta
(IAF + 2/IAF + 14),
low-gamma (IAF + 15/IAF + 30), and
high-gamma (IAF + 31/IAF + 90). We used the first princi-
pal component of the time-series within each subcortical
ROI as a summary statistic of distributed neurophysio-
logical activity, which reduces cross-talk between regions
(Sato et al. 2018). Signals were normalized for group
comparisons through spectrum normalization (i.e. the
power of each frequency bin is expressed as a ratio to
the total power of the spectrum).

We used “specparam” to perform a parametric decom-
position of the power-spectrum of each ROI into rhyth-
mic and arrhythmic components (Donoghue et al. 2020).
The model was fitted in fixed mode (default parameter
in Brainstorm), without a knee parameter. The result-
ing arrhythmic components comprise 2 characteristic
parameters, the offset and the slope of its 1/f decay
(Merkin et al. 2021). More specifically, the slope accounts
for the steepness of the decay of arrhythmic signal power
with increasing frequencies, from the offset value of
signal power at the lowest accessible frequency bin. The
offset describes the broadband offset of the spectrum.

We used nonparametric inferential statistics based on
permutation tests, false discovery rate (FDR) corrected
(N = 10,000; Maris and Oostenveld 2007) and correlation
analyses, also FDR-corrected. To limit the number of
comparisons, only regions and frequencies showing sig-
nificant between-group differences in permutation tests
(P < 0.05, FDR correction across regions of interest, time,
and frequency dimensions) were further considered for
possible association with cognitive performance.

Results
Behavioral differences between age groups
The younger and older adults’ groups had similar biolog-
ical sex ratios and showed normal general cognitive per-
formance (above the MMSE > 27/30 cutoff; see Table 1).

Between-group differences in neurophysiological
activity
IAF, recorded over parieto-occipital sensors, was lower
in older adults relative to younger adults (Table 1).
We found steeper slopes of arrhythmic activity in
older adults relative to younger adults,
in all ROIs
(Mall = 0.78 (S.D.all = 0.25), relative to 0.56(0.15), Ps < 0.001).
Delta-band activity was larger (0.16(0.09), relative to
0.08(0.03), Ps < 0.001), with reduced gamma-band activity
(0.13 (0.03), relative to 0.15 (0.02), Ps < 0.005), in older
adults (Fig. 1A and B), in line with the slowing of the
dominant activity reported at the sensor/cortical level.
Larger offsets in older relative to younger adults were
also observed in bilateral striatum (0.97 (0.051), 0.59
(0.64), and Ps < 0.003, respectively) and hippocampus
(1.1 (0.7), relative to 0.7 (0.6), Ps < 0.007; Fig. 2A and B).
Importantly, in the right hippocampus only, theta-band
activity was stronger in older adults (0.13 (0.02), relative
to 0.11 (0.02), P < 0.003). Control analyses replicated
previously reported effects of cortical increases of delta-
band activity and reduced gamma-band activity at rest
across cortical regions. Increased theta-band activity,
however, was not significant in cortical regions (see
Supplementary Fig. S1), suggesting that the changes
observed in the hippocampus are specific to that
structure. Additional analyses including individuals’
level of education revealed that partialling out the
effect of education did not change the effect of age on
neurophysiological activity.

The plots show the average regional activity of left and right homologous structures.

With the exception of the correlation between slope
and offset arrhythmic parameters observed in both
groups (Ps < 0.001), no correlation between neurophys-
iological activity measures was observed in young
adults. In older adults, a lower occipito-parietal IAF was
associated with stronger deep-brain delta-band activity
(all P < 0.009) in all ROIs (Fig. 2C and D). Importantly, a
lower surface IAF was also associated with a stronger
right hippocampus theta activity (r = −0.34, P = 0.021).

Associations of deep-brain neurophysiological
activity with cognition in older adults
No correlation between neurophysiological activity mea-
sures and VTSM or MMSE scores (Ps > 0.3) was observed
in young adults. Stronger right hippocampus theta
activity was associated with higher VSTM performance
in older adults (r = 0.49, P < 0.001). We also found a

positive association between the slopes of arrhythmic
activity in the right hippocampus and VSTM perfor-
mances (r = 0.62, P < 0.001; Fig. 2E). Partialling out the
effect of did not change this correlation. No correlation
involving the MMSE score was observed.

Discussion

We believe this study is first to report aging effects
on human deep-brain neurophysiological activity. We
used recent methodological advances in source modeling
of resting-state M/EEG signals (Samuelsson et al. 2021),
and spectral parametrization of rhythmic and arrhyth-
mic brain neurophysiological activity (Donoghue et al.
2020). Overall, older adults showed stronger and more
temporally-variable neurophysiological activity in lower
frequency bands (Fig. 3). These effects were reversed in
higher frequency bands, in line with a slowing of the

dominant activity with advance age. Changes were asso-
ciated with declined short-term memory performance;
however, we also found that theta-band signal strength
in the right hippocampus were positively associated with
VSTM performance.

Our study replicates and extends previous findings of
decreased IAF measured from scalp (Scally et al. 2018),
and of cortical slowing across the typical frequency
bands of electrophysiology with age (Courtney and
Hinault 2021; Wiesman et al. 2022). Indeed, in older
adults, stronger signal power was observed over the lower
frequency bands of the neurophysiological spectrum,
with concurrent reduced power over higher frequencies.
Our present results point at possible deeper brain origins
of such overall slowing of brain activity, and are in
line with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
findings of age-related subcortical changes (Daugherty
et al. 2015). Our data show that with aging, subcortical
signal is reduced in older adults for the fastest frequency
bands. Symmetrically, power was more pronounced in
the slower delta frequency band, in association with
reduced IAF. These effects have been previously asso-
ciated with decreased cognitive performances (Rossiter
et al. 2014; Jauny et al. 2022a).

(Voytek et al. 2015; Merkin et al. 2021; Thuwal et al. 2021),
and discussed as ref lecting larger amounts of neural
noise in brain communications with advancing age. Age-
related brain noise is possibly related to alterations
of the excitation/inhibition balance in neural circuits
(Voytek and Knight 2015; Donoghue et al. 2020), and
would impact information processing and the efficiency
of cognitive processes (Merkin et al. 2021). At the cortical
or the sensor level, both slope and offset have been
shown to be reduced in older compared with younger
participants (Thuwal et al. 2021). These changes have
mainly been observed in frontal regions (Cesnaite
et al. 2021). Noisier communications could impact
information processing and the efficiency of cognitive
processes (Merkin et al. 2021). Here, both slope and offset
of subcortical rhythmic activity were larger in older
adults relative to younger. Differences in the observed
shift in power spectra between cortical and deeper
regions in older adults could ref lect the differential effect
of aging on structures. Indeed, previous work revealed a
linear structural atrophy of cortical regions with aging,
whereas a curvilinear evolution was observed for deeper
regions such as the hippocampus (Walhovd et al. 2005;
Fjell et al. 2013).

mic versus arrhythmic deeper brain activity. Changes
in arrhythmic cortical signal have been reported

and working memory (Axmacher et al. 2010). Here, we
found that the spectral slope of hippocampus activity is
positively associated with VSTM performance, suggest-
ing that hippocampal activity is positively associated
with short-term memory performance. Closely linked
to the hippocampal network (Herweg et al. 2016), theta
activity in the thalamus has previously been associated
with the maintenance and encoding of task-relevant
information (Sweeney-Reed et al. 2016), and could also
contribute to preserved performance with advancing age.
Our data show that preserved cognitive performance
with advancing age is associated with the strength of
hippocampus theta-band rhythmic activity. This aspect
is in line with previous fMRI work that showed an
association between preserved cognitive performance in
older adults and higher hippocampal activity (e.g. Lister
and Barnes 2009). These theta-band changes were not
observed in control cortical regions, suggesting that these
changes (but not changes in other frequency bands) are
hippocampal-specific. We anticipate that these results
contribute to future investigations of the interindividual
variability in cognitive performances in aging (Cabeza
et al. 2018; Hinault et al. 2019a). We emphasize though
that hyper-activity is not always of a compensatory
nature (Hillary and Grafman 2017) and may be indicative
of subsequent cognitive decline. Future longitudinal
studies will need to clarify these aspects.

We also discuss some limitations to the present
study. Courtney and Hinault (2021) and Finn (2021)
recently discussed how resting-state activity is less
directly associated with cognitive functioning than task-
related activity. Moreover, the Cam-CAN cognitive tests
did not specifically target executive functions that
are associated with frequency-specific brain activity

(Hinault et al. 2020, 2021), and a more detailed cognitive
investigation could help identify additional associations
with cognitive performance. Analyses of task-related
activity,
involving for example memory or reward-
learning tasks (Geddes et al. 2018), could more efficiently
identify specific patterns in each region. Regarding
methodological aspects, the absence of empty-room
recordings may have limited the accuracy of source
reconstruction analyses. We used a noninformative prior
as a substitute of the noise statistics, which assumed
unit and independent noise variance across sensors, in
line with previous work investigating hippocampus and
subcortical sources (Attal and Schwartz 2013; Gauthier
et al. 2020; Piastra et al. 2021). Nevertheless, recent work
with simultaneous MEG and intracerebral recording
(Pizzo et al. 2019; López-Madrona et al. 2022), showed the
reliability of source reconstruction of hippocampus and
subcortical regions’ signal. Finally, the investigation of
age-related changes in deep-brain activity would benefit
from the investigation of longitudinal brain changes,
which was not possible with the present dataset.

Recent fMRI work has highlighted the major role of
hippocampus and subcortical brain activity in higher-
(Chiu and Egner 2019;
order cognitive functions
Bourgeois et al. 2020). Our results reveal that aging effects
on these regions are characterized by changes in both
rhythmic and arrhythmic signal strength, with an overall
slowing of deeper neural activity. Individual differences
were also observed, with specific increased theta-
band activity in the right hippocampus associated with
preserved short-term memory performances. Relative
to healthy aging, the deep-brain regions investigated
here are further impaired in age-related pathologies
(Gulyaeva 2019), which we anticipate may be associated

3966 | Cerebral Cortex, 2023, Vol. 33, No. 7

with further alterations of
their neurophysiological
activity. The precise investigation of their respective
activity could lead to the identification of new markers
of the heterogeneity of cognitive aging and cognitive
decline.
