Background: The impact of emotion regulation (ER) interventions on mental
health and wellbeing has been extensively documented in the literature,
technologies been incorporated in
although only recently have digital
intervention design. The aim of this review is to explore available published
literature relating to the efficacy, barriers and facilitators of digital technologies
in enhancing emotion/mood regulation skills.

Methods: A review of the literature was performed to explore the effectiveness
of digital technology in enhancing ER skills. MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO
and Web of Science databases were searched from inception to 31st August
2020. In addition, the ﬁrst 10 pages of Google Scholar were examined for
relevant articles. The following MeSH term and key words were used to identify
relevant articles: “emotion regulation OR mood regulation” AND “intervention
OR treatment OR program$ OR therap$” AND “digital technologies OR
web-based OR mobile application OR App.” Reference lists of retrieved
papers were hand searched to identify additional publications. Findings were
summarized narratively.

Results: Titles and abstracts were reviewed by one reviewer in two phases,
and conﬁrmed by a second reviewer; discrepancies were resolved through
discussion. First, the retrieved titles and abstracts were reviewed to identify
relevant studies. Full texts of retrieved studies were then read to determine
eligibility. The search resulted in 209 studies of which 191 citations were
identiﬁed as potentially meeting the inclusion criteria. After reviewing the
title and abstract of the 191 papers, 33 studies were identiﬁed as potentially
meeting the inclusion criteria. Following full-text review, 10 studies met the
inclusion criteria. Findings indicated the potential effectiveness of online,
text-messaging, and smartphone interventions for enhancing ER skills.

Conclusion: There is encouraging evidence that digital technologies may be
beneﬁcial for enhancing ER skills and providing personalized care remotely.
Digital technologies, particularly the use of smartphones, were instrumental
in facilitating assessments and delivering online self-help interventions such
as cognitive behavioral therapy. Continued research is required to rigorously

have
integrated into everyday life, providing the potential
to
deliver mental health interventions more eﬃciently, while
increasing accessibility (1). Since early 2020, to support the
current public health response to the global coronavirus disease
(COVID-19) pandemic, digital technologies are being harnessed
at an unprecedented scale, for case identiﬁcation, population
surveillance and contact tracing (2).

Digital technologies include smartphones, virtual reality,
wearable sensors, biofeedback techniques, web-based training
technologies
programmes and mobile applications. Digital
generate, store and process numeric data using devices such
as smartphones, computers, and multimedia (3). Interventions
targeting ER using digital technologies have several advantages;
they provide researchers and clinicians with new
namely,
platforms to oﬀer support, monitor patient progress, as well
as increasing patients’ access to tailored treatment (4). Digital
technologies are increasingly being used to manage and
positively inﬂuence people’s aﬀective states including their
emotions, mood, and stress levels. Several studies have found
that digital technologies are a commonly used tool for ER,
such as the use of videogames for relaxation, managing stress
and controlling negative feelings (5). Social media and instant
messaging services can provide a medium for ER, by regulating
depressive emotions, reducing anxiety in stressful situations
and/or reducing loneliness through social networking sites (6).
ER is a complex process which involves the ability to initiate,
inhibit and regulate one’s emotions in a given situation. ER is
an integral part of how we feel, think about and experience

our daily lives. ER is not aimed at eliminating emotions from
our lives, but rather using them intelligently and ﬂexibly to
control their inﬂuence and produce desired responses to our
mood (7). Several existing therapeutic approaches have been
helpful with emotion regulation disorder. Such interventions
are generally practical
in nature and have a high success
rate. One approach that is commonly used to help with ER
is dialectical behavioral therapy (DBT). DBT is a type of
cognitive behavioral therapy that focuses on enhancing ER and
consists of individual therapies delivered by a trained therapist
with occasional telephone follow-up consultations (8). Another
approach involves acceptance-based behavioral therapy (ACT).
This approach exposes individuals to experience problematic
emotions in the context in which the function of language
enhances the experience of unpleasant emotion in view to strip
those emotions away. The focus of the treatment is facilitate
individuals to adapt to those negative emotions and move
toward a more fulﬁlling life (9). A further treatment approach is
the mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT). This 8-week
treatment programme targets emotion reactivity associated with
stress by allowing individuals to break the dysfunctional cycle of
rumination emotion regulation and self-criticism (10).

measurement of cognitive, emotional, physiological, and
behavioral responses in a variety of ‘real-world’ situations while
allowing for full experimental control (11). They can improve
an individuals’ ability to positively enhance their emotion
skills and better manage mental health issues by training
them to adopt contextually adaptive ER strategies. ER plays a
key role in the development, maintenance, and treatment of
various mental health problems (e.g., depression, borderline
personality disorder, substance-use disorders, eating disorders,
somatoform disorders) (12). Thus, the delivery of ER using
digital technologies may be an important therapeutic target.

However,

the eﬃcacy and beneﬁt of ER intervention
using digital technologies to address mild to moderate and
sub-threshold mental health conditions in adults is not yet
established. The area of digital ER intervention has not been

comprehensively reviewed to date. We therefore aimed to
explore the published literature to better understand the eﬃcacy
of digital technologies in enhancing ER skills.

Objectives

The objective of this review is threefold:

sensors, biofeedback techniques, web-based training
programmes and mobile Apps).

2. Data sources from personal devices which are for non-
medical purposes (e.g., smartphones, digital watches).
3. Web services and passive modes of data collection which
do not require any speciﬁc action or intervention from the
user associated with enhancing ER.

1. To summarize and map out the diﬀerent types of ER
interventions that are delivered using digital technologies.
2. To ascertain how diverse digital technologies can be

applied to the delivery of ER interventions.

3. To explore barriers,

facilitators, beneﬁts, and caveats
of using and implementing digital technologies in ER
interventions (e.g., personalized care, blended treatment),
and any impacts on clinical practice/services.

Methods

Search strategy

A literature search of the following databases MEDLINE,
CINAHL, PsycINFO, and Web of Science was conducted
from inception to 31st August 2020, and updated on 14th
of October 2021. Additionally, the ﬁrst 10 pages of Google
Scholar were examined for relevant articles. The search
included peer reviewed journals in the English language.
The following MeSH terms and key words were used to
identify relevant articles:
(emotion regulation OR mood
regulation) AND (intervention OR treatment OR program OR
therapy) AND (digital technology OR web-based OR mobile
application). A detailed Medline search strategy is provided
(Supplementary Appendix 1). Reference lists of retrieved papers
were manually searched to identify additional publications.
The gray literature (opengrey.eu) was also searched to identify
further relevant publications.

Study selection

This

review considered randomized controlled trials,
cohort studies (retrospective and prospective), case-control
studies (including nested case control), cross-sectional studies,
feasibility studies and pre-post within-study designs. Included
studies focused on ER for wellbeing utilizing digital technologies
in adults with a diagnosed mental health disorder. Since we
are interested in the potential value of ER interventions using
digital technologies, papers considered eligible for inclusion in
this review included:

Results

A record of the searches is provided in Figure 1. A total
of 209 records were identiﬁed by database searches and a
further 36 were sourced following the open gray database
search. A further eight were retrieved by hand searching
from references and one additional study was identiﬁed in
the review update searches. Of
the 209 studies, 18 were
duplicates and the title and abstract of the remaining 191
studies were reviewed. Most exclusions were due to the article
having no clear reference to ER intervention using digital
technologies within the title or abstract. At this stage, 34
articles were further reviewed for inclusion, upon reviewing
the full text of these studies, a further 23 were excluded
speciﬁcally because they did not present ER interventions using
digital technologies in an adult population. The remaining 10
studies were synthesized, a summary is provided in Table 1.
Four randomized controlled trials (RCT) (14, 17, 19, 21), two
feasibility studies (13, 15), two case-control studies (16, 22),
1 cohort study (18) and 1 pre-post within-study design (20)
were identiﬁed. Five studies (13, 15, 16, 20, 21) were from
the United States, one from Australia (14), one from Israel
(17), and three from Slovenia (18), Portugal (19) and Canada
(22) respectively.

A summary of the database searches that were performed
during the process of conducting the review is set out below
(Table 2). The search terms were reliable in identifying the most
relevant articles related to digital technology relationship to ER.

Mobile technologies

To date, only a few studies have examined the role of
mobile applications in enhancing ER skills. These studies
show that mobile phone technology usage varies according to
types of intervention/approach and ER strategies. Six out of
the 10 studies included in this review tested a psychological
intervention module using diﬀerent approaches such as social
connection, text messages or a downloadable App. A mobile
App is a type of application designed to run on mobile phones
including smartphones or tablets/computer. Mobile health
(mHealth) applications are contemporary approaches providing
psychological support through mobile devices, without the
involvement of a therapist or face-to-face intervention (10).
mHealth allows the possibility of providing personalized
interventions based on the current needs and aﬀective state of
the user. Many mHealth applications are mainly centered on
cognitive behavior change (11), mindfulness (12) and cognitive
behavioral therapy (CBT) (23). Morris et al. (15) examined the
eﬀect of self-reporting mood using the “Mobile Heart Health.”
The programme involved using a Mood Map (charting mood for

at least 1 week by identifying good, bad and indiﬀerent mood)
to self-report mood as well as physiological sensors to measure
heart rate. Ten participants were recruited and indicated having
signiﬁcant stress but were otherwise mentally healthy. The aim
of the study was to explore whether usage of this App would
help reduce stress and related risk of cardiovascular disease.
Participants’ mood was assessed every morning, evening, and
several times during the day over a month using the mood
map App prompted via their mobile phones. Results showed
a signiﬁcant improvement in stress and a greater control over
their emotions compared baseline measured by mood reporting
scales (24).

A recent mHealth technology (Calm Mom) consisted of
a mobile App and a wearable sensor band speciﬁcally aimed
at enhancing ER through the integration of data from self-
reports and electrodermal activity (variation of the electrical
properties of the skin in response to sweat secretion) measured
during adolescent mothers’ daily lives. Both the quantitative
and qualitative data showed that participants highly valued
the accessibility of
the Calm Mom App, both alone and
in combination with the sensor band. For many adolescent

mothers, the App became an integral part of the way in
which they dealt with heightened emotions (e.g., fear, anger)
in stress-inducing situations. The qualitative ﬁndings showed
that the Calm Mom App helped to increase young mothers’
understanding and ability to identify their emotions in a variety
of stressful situations with their children, peers, and family,
which in turn helped them engage in more adaptive ER and
behavioral strategies (25). A recent study used a smartphone
application to monitor daily and weekly mood ratings in
young adults with bipolar disorder and healthy controls. Forty
participants aged 18–30 years (n = 35 bipolar disorder; n = 5
control) were recruited and monitored for a total of 2401 daily
and 744 weekly ratings. The researchers used The Ginger IO
behavior platform to collect self-report data from participants
(user input). The user receives notiﬁcations of available surveys
and upon clicking they are transferred to the survey. The survey
(visual analog scale) recorded time series scores collected from
participants while under antidepressant treatment for mood
instability. The primary outcome was to identify the number
of survey ratings that can detect mood instability among Major
Depression Disorder participants at high risk and those at
low risk of developing bipolar disorder compared to healthy
controls. A priory criterion to deﬁne mood instability included
daily and weekly measurement of subthreshold hypomania
scores in a clinical setting which consisted of a priori deﬁned
criteria for spikes in scores (>2 threshold and >25% increase
from baseline) and ﬂuctuations (change in two consecutive
ratings of more than 25%).

Results

showed that

smartphone survey ratings can
adequately capture mood instability in bipolar disorder and
subjects at risk of major mood disorder compared to those at low
risk of developing dipolar disorder and healthy controls (26).
A study by Agyapong et al. (27) found that daily supportive
text messages were a reliable and acceptable way of delivering
adjunctive psychological interventions to people with mental
health problems. Text4Mood is an innovative service designed
to provide support
to people on waiting lists for mental
health services, or to individuals living in remote communities
who have diﬃculty accessing care. Subscribers receive daily
supportive text messages, for example:

1. Today, I will focus on what I have, instead of what I

have not.

and timely manner to individuals with a mental health
issue who are unable to attend clinics (e.g., self-isolating).
Short Messaging Service (SMS) mood monitoring has been
validated against the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-
9), a standardized measure of depression. Findings from
a study by Aguilera et al.
(28) demonstrated signiﬁcant
relationships between depression and daily mood scores,
measured via SMS 1-week average mood scores and PHQ-
9 scores captured on a daily basis controlling for linear
change in depression scores. This study shows that SMS mood
ratings could serve as a reliable proxy for in-clinic mood
assessment (28).

Furthermore, Bush et al. (29) found that a smartphone
application “The Virtual Hope Box” was more eﬀective than
print materials at improving military service men’s ability to
cope with negative emotions and thoughts and acceptability of
treatment. Veterans in the study were receiving mental health
treatment and had recently reported suicidal
ideation. The
App was modeled around a cognitive behavioral approach that
uses a physical box containing various items which remind
participants of positive experiences, reasons for living, coping
mechanisms and people who care about them. Participants were
randomly allocated to either the control (standard treatment and
supplemental print materials) or intervention group (treatment
as usual plus the Virtual Hope Box App). Compared to the
control group, those assigned to the intervention group reported
the App as being “somewhat helpful?” or “very helpful” (84%)
and that they would be “somewhat” or “very likely” to use

it again (87%) or recommend it to others (90%). The most
frequent reasons for using the App were to cope with distress,
overwhelming emotions, and thoughts of hurting themselves as
well as for relaxation, distraction, or inspiration (29).

The Mood Mission App (30), developed by a team of
researchers at Monash University (Australia), was designed to
provide standalone help to individuals in response to how
they are feeling at that time. The App was designed as a
supplement to conventional face-to-face CBT. It provides the
user with self-help strategies aimed at reducing feelings of
anxiety and depression (30). This mobile App serves the
purpose of preventing and coping with low level anxiety
and depression. Results showed that users of Mood Mission
experienced decreases in their depression and anxiety compared
to baseline (30).

Another study aimed to evaluate a new App named Music
eScape (14). This App aimed to teach young adults who were
experiencing depression, anxiety and stress symptoms ways to
identify and manage their emotions using music from their own
music library. Participants were randomly assigned to either the
“Tuned In” intervention (eScape mood management music App)
or a wait-list control receiving the intervention after a 1-month
delay. Participants in the intervention group were emailed a
link to the App. The study evaluated ER, distress and well-
being at 1, 2, 3- and 6-months intervals. Potential moderators to
App outcomes, including the amount of music use and healthy
(“protective” music which gives participants the energy to get
going) or unhealthy (reminding participants of bad memories)
music use, were examined. No signiﬁcant diﬀerences between
groups on ER, distress, or well-being were found at 1 month
between groups. Both groups achieved signiﬁcant improvements
in 5 of the 6 ER skills, mental distress, and well-being at 2, 3, and
6 months compared to controls (14).

A study by Porat et al. (17) examined the feasibility of
a mobile App “ReApp,” a mobile, multiplayer game aimed at
training people in emotional regulation, speciﬁcally in cognitive
reappraisal. Seventy Jewish-Israeli participants were randomly
assigned to either an experimental (ReApp) or a control
condition. Participants in the experimental condition played
ReApp, while participants in the control condition played
‘Connect Four’, a two-player game played on a mobile device
but which did not teach any cognitive skill. Results indicate that
people who played ReApp experienced lower levels of anger and
disgust compared to the control group.

Over the years, mindfulness-based interventions delivered
via phone application have been examined. Tong et al. (22)
showed mindfulness stress reduction in combination with
virtual reality (virtual meditative walk) was signiﬁcantly more
eﬀective in reducing reported levels of chronic pain and
post-traumatic stress disorder compared to Mindfulness-Based
Stress Reduction (MBSR) Meditation standalone. Furthermore,
Cikajlo e al. (18) evaluated a novel system of a meditation-based
stress and anxiety reduction therapy mindfulness and found

that scores on both the Mindfulness Attention Awareness Scale
(MAAS) and the Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS) improved
after 8-weeks.

participants practiced mindfulness on average 3.4 times per day,
completed 72% of prompted reports and submitted 68% carbon
monoxide videos as requested. Participants reported that daily
mindfulness practice was helpful for both managing mood and
quitting smoking (31).

Additionally, Ying et al. (32) set out

to examine the
eﬀectiveness of online mindfulness-based interventions on
psychological distress (depression and anxiety). Seventy-six
participants were randomized to either a group mindfulness-
self-direct mindfulness-based
based intervention (GMBI),
intervention (SDMBI), discussion group (DG) or a control
group (Blank Control Group). Results showed that participants
in GMBI and SDMBI had signiﬁcant pre- and post-test scores
on mindfulness, ER diﬃculties, and psychological distress, with
medium to large eﬀect sizes in both groups.

Several studies have demonstrated the eﬃcacy of App-
based interventions to enhance ER. Morris et al. (15) developed
an App that alert users to record their mood several times
during the day over a month via their mobile phones. Users
reported increased emotional self-awareness, and some were
able to identify patterns of dysfunction and modify these
patterns by modifying their routine. Anand et al. (16) used
a smartphone self-monitoring programme to prompt users to
complete a survey and report their emotional state on a weekly
basis. Results showed that the mood ratings captured mood
instability and oﬀer a prudent way to monitor development
of serious manic disorder. Both monitoring systems were,
however modeled around the study participants and oﬀered little
constructive feedback about participant’s mood history. A recent
attempt using a mobile App speciﬁcally aimed at enhancing ER
through the integration of self-reported data and electrodermal
activity (13). Limitations of these studies were the small number
of trial participants reporting mood disorders. There is a
need to further investigate the impact of smartphone-based
programme on larger more representative samples reporting
ER and associated mental health outcomes which is also
relevant to non-clinical users. Mobile phone technologies, in
particular text messaging has transformed the way mental health
interventions are delivered. Recent studies (27, 28) ﬁnd text
messaging interventions associated with reducing the stigma
associated with mental health treatment and increase positive
patient attitude and satisfaction as well as improved treatment
adherence, increase appointment attendance (33). Despite high

accessibility described in these studies, their applications were
limited to patients with anxiety and depression, services such as
addictions service delivery is relatively limited.

Web-based interventions

Several studies have addressed the eﬀectiveness of web-based
and other computerized interventions in treating depression and
anxiety symptoms (15, 23–26) but very few studies explored
these technologies in supporting interventions to enhance ER.
Internet technologies play a signiﬁcant role in people’s everyday
lives especially social media and messaging App, and the
remarkable uptake in video conferencing Apps, given people’s
widespread reliance of these technologies during the COVID-
19 pandemic. Of the 10 studies included in this review, three
reported web-based self-guided ER intervention, two were
randomized controlled trials (RCT) and 1 was a pre-post within
subject study. The use of the Internet an adaptation of face-
to-face protocol is gradually becoming a favored platform in
which ER plays an important role (34). A two-phase pilot
project evaluating the MARIGOLD intervention (Mobile Aﬀect
Regulation Intervention with the Goal of Lowering Depression),
a web-based, self-guided intervention based on “Stress and
Coping” and “Broaden and Build” theories of positive emotion
(21). The intervention was designed to teach individuals positive
emotion skills for handling elevated depressive symptoms.
Skills include noticing and amplifying positive events, gratitude,
activation, mindfulness, positive reappraisal, strengths, and acts
of kindness. Additionally, an internet-based ER training (iERT)
aimed to enhance ER skills at reducing the risk of victimization
in depressed patients is currently being investigated in a
multicentre randomized controlled trial (35). Furthermore,
researchers at the Traumatic Brain Injury Model System Center
(New York, USA) enrolled 91 participants with traumatic brain
injury in a study. Participants were enrolled in an experimental
program, called Online EmReg, which was adapted from a face-
to-face group therapy program. Over 12-weeks, participants
received 24 1-h ER skills training sessions via videoconferencing,
held twice a week for 12-weeks. The group sessions were held by
experienced facilitators (i.e., rehabilitation neuropsychologists).
The programme was designed to provide a learning platform
for participants to learn how traumatic brain injury aﬀects
emotional functioning and provide strategies for improving
ER skills in everyday life. During the ﬁnal 16 programme
sessions, participants practice their skills in individual and
group exercises. At
the 12-week programme,
participants showed meaningful improvements in ER on all
aspects measured by the Diﬃculties in Emotion Regulation Scale
(DERS) (20).

could out performed verbal ability focused CCT. This study
aimed to explore the impact the cognitive functioning and mood
of young adults with depressive symptoms. To test this, 46 young
adults aged 18–29 years, with mild to moderate depression,
were randomized to either the computerized cognitive training
group or a verbal ability group. Participants trained on their
mobile device 5 days per week for 8-weeks. Depressive severity,
everyday functioning, and cognition were evaluated pre- and
post-training. Results indicate that the computerized cognitive
group had greater gains in executive functioning and processing
speed than the verbal group. There were no di?erences between
groups in mood or everyday functioning improvement.

Ouweneel et al. (37) evaluated the eﬀect of an online positive
psychology intervention to promote positive emotions, self-
eﬃcacy, and engagement at work. The online modules consist
of three types of online assignments: happiness, goal setting,
and resource building (intervention group) compared to a
self-monitoring control group. Results revealed that the self-
enhancement group showed a stronger increase in positive
emotions and self-eﬃcacy compared to the control group,
but not on engagement. Additional analyses showed that the
positive eﬀects of the self-enhancement intervention are present
for employees who are initially low in engagement (diary
completion, survey, and online modules), but not for those
medium or high in engagement.

Stubbings et al. (38) conducted a randomized controlled
trial with 26, primarily Caucasian, adults aged 18–65 years.
Participants were randomized to receive 12 sessions (60 min)
of weekly sessions of CBT via videoconference (n = 14)
or CBT delivered in person (n = 12) for participants with
mood and anxiety disorders. Diagnoses were determined using
the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders,
4th edition text
revision (DSM-IV-TR). The Depression
Anxiety Stress Scale (39) was used as the primary outcome
measure. Signiﬁcant reductions were found across time for
symptoms of depression. The study found no signiﬁcant
diﬀerences between treatment conditions for any of
the
outcome measures.

Furthermore, Fonseca et al. (19) conducted a randomized
controlled trial to test a self-guided, web-based CBT intervention
to examine the feasibility, acceptability and eﬃcacy of the “Be a
Mom, web-based self-guided CBT intervention” an intervention
aimed at preventing persistent post-partum depression in
both at risk post-partum women and women presenting
with early onset post-partum depressive symptoms. Eligible
participants were either randomized to receive the intervention
or randomized in a waitlist control group. Results showed a
greater decrease in levels of ER diﬃculties in the intervention
group and signiﬁcant
increased levels of self-compassion
compared to the control group and signiﬁcant decrease in
depressive symptoms in the intervention group.

A wide range of interventions targeting ER has greatly
beneﬁted from incorporating online-based interventions. These

Frontiers in Psychiatry

Jadhakhan et al.

10.3389/fpsyt.2022.809332

recent developments include computerized (21) and (35) studies
and videoconferencing technology (20). These technologies have
a range of advantages, such as the possibility to reach larger
audience in need of psychological treatment and hard to reach
group, particularly young adults (40). In addition, online based
interventions have increasingly been found to be cost eﬀective in
comparison to face-to-face active treatment (41), although some
literature shows inconclusive results in this regard (42).

Virtual environment

The rapid emergence of new technologies and the growing
interest in applying them in the ﬁeld of psychology have led
to the development of novel virtual reality technology in the
ﬁeld of neuro-rehabilitation (43) and the treatment of various
mental health disorders (44). Virtual reality uses computer
technology to create a simulated environment in which a person
can interact within an artiﬁcial three-dimensional environment
using electronic devices such as head mounted display or
biosensors to increase realism in the virtual world (13). To
date, very few studies explored the potentiality of virtual reality
impact on enhancing ER. Furthermore, the available studies are
often small and conducted on speciﬁc populations. Evidence
suggests that eﬀective ER strategies lead to several important
outcomes associated with mental health and psychological
wellbeing (45). Therefore, beneﬁcial changes in ER are crucial
outcome in mental health interventions and the availability of
new technology such as virtual reality technology can facilitate
or even increase positive outcome of such strategies (46).

(22)

Tong et al.

showed that virtual meditation in
combination with mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR)
was signiﬁcantly more eﬀective in reducing reported levels
of chronic pain (e.g., ﬁbromyalgia) and post-traumatic stress
disorder and a higher level of participants satisfaction and
experience of higher level of satisfaction. This virtual reality
system was designed for chronic pain patients to learn
mindfulness based MBSR and incorporates biofeedback sensors,
an immersive virtual environment and stereoscopic sound.
Additionally, Cikajlo et al. (18) evaluated a novel system, the
Realizing Collaborative Virtual Reality for Wellbeing and Self-
Healing (ReCoVR) system for remote acquisition of a mediation
based stress and anxiety reduction therapy and mindfulness
course. The system is based on a cloud server web-interface and
remote clients, using immersive head-mounted display Samsung
Gear and Samsung Smartphone S6 and Note. The application
enables group sessions in the virtual world, 3D videos and
real-time interactions, as well as standalone meditation. An 8-
week mindfulness-based stress reduction course was designed
for this virtual reality application. The course was tested with
8 participants: 4 employees (age range 27–40 years) and four
patients (age range 24–48 years) with traumatic brain injuries.
Their outcomes were evaluated using the Mindful Attention

Awareness Scale (MAAS),
the Satisfaction with Life Scale
(SWLS), and the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE). The
results were encouraging, patients achieved very high level of
satisfaction (SWLS) at the end of the study. A slight increase in
MASS score was also noticeable. Most patients had MMSE score
of 30 suggesting normal cognitive function.

Although virtual reality (VR) is not new,

the recent
incorporation of such technology into ER treatment delivery
is rather novel. In the studies presented, virtual reality has
been utilized in various ways to deliver ER strategies to
promote mental health and wellbeing. Some authors (18, 22)
used mindfulness-based stress reduction intervention as a non-
pharmacological approach to enhance participants ER and boost
their wellbeing. Additionally, Tong et al. (22) showed that
immersive virtual reality can be used to manage and control
chronic pain in the long term.

Discussion

This review aimed to investigate the available digital
technologies that may be used to enhance ER skills and reduce
the risk of mental health disorders or attenuate their eﬀects. All
the described digital technologies in this review were utilized to
oﬀer a diﬀerent avenue of managing ER or enhance a current
approach to improving knowledge about ER skills. Based on the
reviewed studies, the current evidence suggests that most digital
ER approaches lead to beneﬁcial eﬀects in reducing/enhancing
ER by providing people with the ability/opportunity to regulate
their emotions through enabling these practices at virtually
any time and place. Only one study (14) did not report a
signiﬁcant diﬀerence between intervention and waitlist control
on mean Diﬃculties in Emotion Regulation (DERS) scale at 1
month post intervention. Yet, both groups achieved signiﬁcant
improvements in 5 of the 6 ER skills, mental distress, and
wellbeing at 2, 3, and 6 months compared to controls. However,
other research suggests that some ER approaches can lead to
poor outcomes based on how and when they are used (47),
which highlights the need for future research to further explore
issues of implementation and engagement. Our review included
mostly feasibility studies and RCT’s with small sample sizes
and non-diverse populations, limiting the generalisability of
the ﬁndings.

Emotion regulation intervention
delivered using digital technologies

In recent years, advances in information technology have
facilitated the emergence of several digital mental health
interventions, delivered via the internet, smart phones, virtual
reality and videoconferencing. The wide use and availability
of mobile technologies such as smartphones means that a

wide range of people are able to access these technologies;
this increases research opportunities in digital ER (34). Recent
application of digital platforms to study ER has provided
some fresh perspectives about this process (48) and a more
complex representation and understanding of how people
regulate their emotions (49). Considering the multi-faceted
construct of health and well-being, this review provides an
overview of the available literature and seeks to unravel the
complex picture provided by the included studies. Overall,
these studies show that digital
technology is a promising
method of delivering a group or individual intervention to
improve ER following newly diagnosed or recurrent mental
health disorders. Digital technologies can provide an eﬀective
alternative approach for diagnosis, assessment, and management
of mental health disorders that appears to be comparable to
in-person care. Furthermore, the connectivity, mobility and
multi-functionality aﬀorded by digital technologies provides
greater access
to a multitude of aﬀordable technologies
than ever before and the ease with which the user can
navigate through apps allowing people to ﬁne-tune their own
strategies for particular situations and to engage in digital
ER (50).

Five of the studies in this review applied mobile technologies
in depressive disorder, traumatic brain injury ER and stress
reduction (13–16, 21). Overall, most of the studies included in
this review had design and/or methodological limitations (e.g.,
feasibility studies, no control group, small sample sizes). In
addition, it is unclear which elements of the mobile application
were the most beneﬁcial, for example, the short therapies
which were delivered in addition to the mobile application
intervention, or the mobile application intervention itself as the
mechanism for intervention delivery.

Diverse digital technologies application
in emotion regulation intervention

There is growing interest in the application of psychological
interventions using digital technologies,
likely because they
are highly eﬀective and scalable. This section describes some
of these existing digital technologies used to enhance ER.

Illustrative examples include web-based intervention such the
Online EmReg (20) and Be a Mom mobile app (19) or
the emerging ﬁeld of virtual reality (18, 22). For instance,
the Online EmReg has been shown to help people with
traumatic brain injury improve their ER skills and reported
high satisfaction with the intervention, as it provided treatment
and support that these people would not normally have access
to. Furthermore, virtual reality technique has been used to
allow participants to learn mindfulness-based stress reduction
technique and has been shown to signiﬁcantly reduce pain
in users (22). This goes to show that technological platforms
such as web-based technologies and virtual reality can make
evidence-based ER intervention that are currently conducted in
therapy sessions more accessible and scalable with a far wider
reach. Furthermore, advanced technological progress meant
that seldom heard populations are now more accessible. For
example, the “Be a Mom” intervention for postpartum women to
prevent persistent postpartum depression symptoms (PPD) in at
risk women presenting with early onset postpartum depressive
symptoms. This self-guided web-based intervention grounded
in cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has demonstrated a
decrease in the levels of ER diﬃculties and a greater increase in
in the levels of self-compassion in postpartum women receiving
the “Be a Mom” intervention, compared to a control group (19).

treatments (52). Researchers have recently started to explore
how individuals shape their aﬀective states using digital
technologies such as smartphones. The vast majority of digital
emotion regulation approaches are in the form of cognitive
behavior therapy. Most have been adapted from face-to-face
treatment modalities; some are simpliﬁed versions of
the
original treatment whereas some combined both the treatment
procedures and the strategies that govern their use. However,
application of digital technologies has a number of beneﬁts.

with patients and healthcare professionals. These data can be
analyzed, and accurate reports can be derived making clinical
decision-making easier. Additionally, digital technologies may

lead to greater treatment adherence due to the accessibility of
biofeedback participants receive in real time. “Do-it-Yourself ”
(37) is an example of the positive eﬀect of digital solution
to promote positive emotion, self-eﬃcacy and engagement
at work that allow participants to complete online modules
including happiness, goal setting and resource building while
gathering biofeedback reports for healthcare professionals
to always monitor progress. Although it is clear that digital
technology has great potential within emotion regulation
interventions, there are signiﬁcant barriers preventing uptake
of such mode of delivery. For example, digital literacy and
accessibility barriers are often overlooked in the drive toward
digital communication. Digital communication is eﬀective only
when it is inclusive in design - when recipients feel comfortable
using technology with relation to their health, and when people
of all abilities can access and understand the information
being communicated. For example, some participants in the
MARIGOLD study preferred to use pen and paper to record
the study skill lessons instead of the MARIGOLD study website
(21). There are technical considerations, for example, stable
internet connectivity and in the case of mobile app, android
with Bluetooth may be the only system supporting ER modules,
which could be problematic for some participants to access.
Most of the ER modules have only been designed and written
in the English language limiting scalability across communities
and geographical regions.

Strength and limitations

This

review has

some limitations which should be
acknowledged. The review primarily focuses on published
articles, although gray literature and Google Scholar were
searched, only articles published in the English language were
reviewed, possibly missing peer reviewed papers published in
other languages. Secondly, there is signiﬁcant variation in the
terminology of ER which may have led to omissions in our
key words and MeSH terms. Thirdly, only 10 studies met
our review criteria. The small number of available studies and
the design and methodology limitations of included studies
limits the potential for in-depth synthesis. The strength of
this review includes searches across a broad range of medical
databases, gray literature and Google Scholar and that study
types were used to identify potential papers for inclusion.
Our broad search strategy encompassed a wide spectrum
of search terms, including emotion/mood regulation, digital
technology, including mobile application, virtual reality, sensor
bands and web-based psychological treatment modalities. The
present review was broad in its approach because the main
emphasis was on emotion regulation strategies using digital
technologies, rather than the broader context of enhancing
ER to better manage mental health disorders. The review
considers individual diﬀerences in the digital approach used

to enhance emotion regulation. For instance, if an emotion-
regulation strategy is commonly used by certain individuals
using a particular digital technology approach to target speciﬁc
symptoms, highlighting this can bring into sharper focus
the best treatment approach involved. Future studies may
explore personalized treatment approaches targeting speciﬁc ER
symptoms, as digital technology and assessments tools becomes
more sophisticated so will our ability to provide better and more
personalized treatment.

Conclusion

Despite diﬀering approaches that have been used to
conceptualize ER and the use of various digital technologies to
deliver complex ER strategies, ER using digital platforms has a
broad and signiﬁcant heuristic value in mental health research.
The studies examined show that digital technology is likely
to be an appropriate mechanisms for assisting individuals to
enhance their ER skills and manage mental health issues better
by accessing more adaptive ER strategies. The use of digital
technology in this sense is promising because it allows the user
to learn complex emotion regulation strategies in the context of
life-like digital environments. For the aforementioned reasons,
the pursuit of
integrated prototypes of technologies could
lead to a successful understanding, assessment, and training
of emotion regulation and reduce the risk or better manage
pre-existing mental health problems. The review highlights
the importance of diverse digital technologies as platforms
for enhancing emotion regulation and conveying individually
tailored, emotional, physiological, and behavioral responses in
a variety of ‘real-world’ situations in ‘real-time’. There remains a
need to explore which types of digital technologies provide better
results, and why.
