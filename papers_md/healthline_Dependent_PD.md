Dependent personality disorder (DPD) is an inability to be alone and excessive reliance on others for comfort and support. Unlike insecurity, which is common, there’s a need for reassurance to function.

According to theCleveland Clinic, people with this condition normally first show signs in early to mid-adulthood.


## Causes and symptoms of DPD


A condition must fall into one of the following clusters to be classified as apersonality disorder:

- Cluster A:odd or eccentric behavior

- Cluster B:emotional or erratic behavior

- Cluster C:anxious, nervous behavior

DPD belongs to cluster C. Signs of this disorder include:

- behaving submissively

- relying on friends or family for decision-making

- needing repeated reassurance

- being easily hurt by disapproval

- feeling isolated and nervous when alone

- fearing rejection

- being overly sensitivity to criticism

- being unable to be alone

- having a tendency to be naive

- fearing abandonment

People with DPD may require constant reassurance. They can become devastated when relationships and friendships are severed.

When alone, a person with DPD may experience:

Some of these symptoms are the same for people withanxiety disorders. People with medical conditions such asdepressionormenopausemay also experience some of these symptoms. Contact your doctor to receive a specific diagnosis if you experience any of the above symptoms.

It’s unknown what causes people to develop DPD. However, experts cite both biological and developmental factors.


## What are the risk factors?


Some risk factors that might contribute to the development of this disorder include:

- having a history of neglect

- having an abusive upbringing

- being in a long-term, abusive relationship

- having overprotective orauthoritarianparents

- having a family history of anxiety disorders


## How’s DPD diagnosed?


Your doctor will give you aphysical examto see if a physical illness could be the source of symptoms, particularly anxiety. This may include blood tests to check forhormone imbalances. If tests are inconclusive, your doctor will likely refer you to amental health specialist.

A psychiatrist or psychologist usually diagnoses DPD. They’ll take your symptoms, history, and mental state into account during diagnosis.

Diagnosis begins with a detailed history of your symptoms. This includes how long you’ve been experiencing them and how they came about. Your doctor may also ask questions about your childhood and your present life.


## How’s DPD treated?


Treatment focuses on alleviating symptoms. Psychotherapy is often the first course of action. Therapy can help you better understand your condition. It can also teach you new ways to build healthy relationships with others and improve your self-esteem.

Psychotherapy is usually used on a short-term basis. Long-term therapy could put you at risk of growing dependent on your therapist.

Medications can help relieveanxietyanddepression, but are generally used as a last resort. Your therapist or doctor may prescribe you a medication to treat panic attacks that result from extreme anxiety. Some medications for anxiety and depression are habit-forming, so you may have to see your doctor regularly while taking them to preventprescription dependence.

People with DPD generally improve with treatment. Many of the symptoms associated with the condition will decrease as treatment continues.


## Supporting someone with DPD


DPD can be overwhelming. As with other personality disorders, many people are uncomfortable seeking help for their symptoms. This can affect quality of life and increase the long-term risks for anxiety and depression.

If you suspect a loved one might have DPD, it’s important to encourage them to seek treatment before their condition worsens. This can be a sensitive matter for someone with DPD, especially since they seek constant approval and don’t want to disappoint their loved ones. Focus on the positive aspects to let your loved one know they’re not being rejected.
