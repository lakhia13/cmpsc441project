Abstract
PERMA  is  a  multidimensional  framework  that  explains  well-being  through  five  hedonic 
and  eudaimonic  psychological  elements–Positive  emotions,  Engagement,  Relationships, 
Meaning,  Accomplishment.  Soon  after  the  PERMA  framework  was  proposed,  PERMA-
Profiler  was  introduced  as  a  validated  assessment  tool  for  measuring  these  five  elements 
of well-being from a global perspective. The current study aimed to shed further light onto 
the  measurement  of  PERMA  elements,  extending  it  beyond  global  evaluations,  to  daily 
life  assessments  and  the  examination  of  individual  differences  in  their  dynamic  charac-
teristics.  We  introduce  mPERMA  (momentary  PERMA),  as  an  EMA-adapted  version  of 
the  PERMA-Profiler  measure,  to  assess  well-being  in  daily  life.  Using  data  collected  in 
an  Ecological  Momentary  Assessment  (EMA)  study  (N = 160),  we  first  demonstrate  the 
factor structure of mPERMA through a multilevel factor analysis and next examine within-
person means and the dynamics of change (e.g., intra-individual variability) in the PERMA 
elements.  Findings  revealed  that  mPERMA  displays  convergent  validity  with  two  global 
measures of hedonic and eudaimonic well-being, namely Flourishing and Subjective Well-
Being.  Moreover,  dynamical  characteristics  of  the  five  elements  of  well-being  measured 
over time, map onto their corresponding hedonic or eudaimonic global measures of well-
being. Results of this paper present how dynamical features of well-being in daily life pro-
vide novel insights into predicting global well-being.

blocks  of  PERMA,  which  has  been  studied  and  discussed  extensively  in  the  Journal  of 
Positive  Psychology  (e.g.,  Donaldson,  et  al.,  2020;  Goodman,  et  al.,  2018;  Kern,  et  al., 
2015; merritt et al., 2023; Seligman, 2018). In the field of positive psychology, well-being 
is generally viewed as containing two dimensions: hedonic well-being (i.e., seeking pleas-
ure and enjoyment) and eudaimonic well-being (i.e., virtuous living and functioning well). 
Whereas some theories of well-being approach the examination of well-being from one of 
these dimensions, the PERMA theoretical perspective views well-being as a multidimen-
sional  construct  containing  both  hedonic  and  eudaimonic  dimensions.  PERMA  explains 
well-being  through  five  elements–some  pertaining  to  the  hedonic  dimension  and  some 
to  the  eudaimonic–  that  all  together  contribute  to  individuals’  experiences  of  well-being 
(Seligman, 2011). The five elements of PERMA are:

Positive emotions: the hedonic experiences of positivity, contentment, and pleasure,
Engagement: the experience of being in flow while losing track of time,
Relationship: experiencing cared for and loved by others,
Meaning: having a sense of purpose in life, and
Accomplishment: the successes and achievements experienced in life.

While this theory incorporates certain elements of hedonic and eudaimonic well-being, 
it is important to recognize that it lacks certain elements found in other prominent theo-
ries of psychological well-being (e.g., personal growth and self-acceptance in Ryff’s (1989) 
theory of psychological well-being). A recent debate has transpired in the field around the 
redundancy of PERMA as a new conceptual framework of well-being and whether it is suf-
ficiently distinct from previous well-being frameworks. In a comparison study of PERMA 
and  Subjective  Well-Being  (SWB;  Diener,  1984),  Goodman  et  al.  (2018)  concluded  that 
measures  of  PERMA  and  SWB  were  so  highly  correlated  (r = 0.98)  that  they  “represent 
the  same  type  of  well-being”  (p.  327)  with  further  evidence  from  an  Exploratory  Struc-
tural Equation Modeling showing “considerable overlap between the two well-being mod-
els”  (P.  328).  Goodman  et  al.  (2018)  hence  argue  that  while  the  facets  described  within 
each framework are different, they both capture the same “type” of well-being. In response 
to Goodman et al. (2018), Seligman (2018) argued that Goodman and colleagues’ (2018) 
findings  were  in-line  with  his  own  hypotheses:  PERMA  captures  the  same  type  of  well-
being as SWB. However, Seligman (2018) posited that Goodman et al.’s (2018) “conclu-
sion that PERMA is redundant with SWB and theoretically arbitrary is [in his belief] incor-
rect” (Seligman, 2018; P. 1) and that “Goodman et al.’s (2018) data exactly confirm that 
PERMA constitutes (at least some of the) elements of well-being” and that these building 
blocks are interrelated in nature (cf. Heshmati et al., 2020). To further examine the sound-
ness of the PERMA framework and PERMA-Profiler (Butler & Kern, 2016) as its meas-
ure  of  well-being,  subsequently,  through  a  multi-trait  multi-method  (MTMM)  research 
design, Donaldson et al. (2021) addressed the mono-method and self-report biases in the 
measurement of well-being in relation to SWB and PERMA. This research examined both 
people’s self-reports as well as their colleagues’ reports (collateral) of their PERMA well-
being indicators in relation to their SWB. Donaldson and his colleagues (2020) found that 
even beyond the sole use of self-report measurement, PERMA and four additional building 
blocks (physical health, mindset, physical work environment, economic security) through 
collateral  reports  are  significantly  predictive  of  SWB  and  thus  constitute  a  sound  frame-
work of well-being.

Although previous empirical studies have addressed some of the confusion around the 
validity and reliability of measures of PERMA, in particular in relation to SWB, we still 
lack understanding on how the PERMA building blocks relate to well-being in daily life. 

1 3 
Namely, we do not know whether PERMA elements, as experienced in daily life, are dis-
tinct enough to be measured in a multidimensional manner rather than being examined as a 
global assessment of well-being.

1   Well‑Being Theories and Applications in Real‑World Settings

At the heart of most operationalizations of well-being lies a distinction between two fun-
damental components of well-being: hedonia and eudaimonia. Hedonia is the experience 
of  positive  emotions  or  the  “good  feeling”  (Henderson,  et  al.,  2014).  Eudaimonia  refers 
to virtuous living and “functioning well” (Boehm et al., 2016). By definition, hedonia and 
eudaimonia are interrelated where feeling good can be experienced in tandem with func-
tioning well.

In  the  field  of  positive  psychology,  some  frameworks  defining  well-being  have  only 
targeted  one  component  of  well-being,  either  hedonic  well-being  or  eudaimonic  well-
being. For example, Ryff’s theory of Psychological Well-Being (Ryff, 1989) is a multifac-
eted framework of well-being that expands on the elements comprising eudaimonia (e.g., 
purpose in life, autonomy, positive relationships, etc.). On the other hand, Diener et al.’s 
theory of Subjective Well-Being (1999) captures cognitive and affective evaluations—ele-
ments related to hedonia and feeling good. More recently, however, there has been a shift 
towards  understanding  well-being  by  combining  elements  of  hedonia  and  eudaimonia 
in  one  model.  For  instance,  Seligman’s  (2011,  2018)  PERMA  framework  of  well-being 
includes  elements  that  comprise  both  hedonia  (e.g.,  positive  emotions)  and  eudaimonia 
(e.g.,  meaning,  accomplishment,  etc.).  As  an  example,  a  person  who  experiences  a  high 
sense  of  meaning  (eudaimonia)  through  a  volunteering  experience  might  also  be  experi-
encing negative emotions (hedonia) at the time of volunteering at a hospital due to expo-
sure  to  other  people’s  ill-being.  Assessing  this  person’s  well-being  through  a  framework 
merely focused on eudaimonia will provide a different assessment of how they are doing 
compared to an assessment through a framework solely focused on hedonia. Thus, having 
a  picture  of  both  hedonia  and  eudaimonia  simultaneously  provides  more  nuances  to  our 
understanding of well-being.

In sum, theoretical perspectives on what entails a “good life” have grown exponentially 
in the past two decades (Rombaoa & Heshmati, 2023). We believe that no one theory can 
be  deemed  as  the  “superior”  framework  in  explaining  psychological  well-being.  Rather, 
clarifications  need  to  be  made  around  how  specific  theoretical  approaches  to  well-being 
may be differentially advantageous for operationalizing this multiplex construct as it relates 
to  people’s  lives.  A  first  step  towards  this  clarification  is  identifying  the  utility  of  these 
theoretically  driven  operationalizations  of  well-being  as  it  applies  to  people’s  real-world 
experiences. Whereas it is important to understand what makes up well-being, it is equally 
important to recognize the nature of change in these elements as they unfold in daily lives; 
while some elements may be more stable in the way they are experienced in people’s lives, 
some others may be more susceptible to change and be state-like in nature rather than trait-
like. Hence, assessments of well-being need to be in-line with the types of questions being 
asked  with  regards  to  the  good  life:  Do  we  want  to  understand  people’s  overall  sense  of 
well-being (e.g., a nation’s general quality of life), or do we want to understand the day-
to-day experiences of living a high quality life (e.g., fluctuations in experiences of positive 
emotions in their workplace).

2   Global Assessments of Well‑Being

Global  assessments  of  well-being  have  been  a  focus  of  research  for  decades,  and  have 
become  more  prevalent  with  the  advent  of  the  field  of  Positive  Psychology  (Seligman 
&  Csikszentmihalyi,  2000).  These  assessments  have  been  shown  to  be  useful  for  both 
researchers and clinicians in understanding the degree of an individual’s overall quality of 
life and ways to increase people’s general sense of well-being. World leaders and govern-
ments  have  also  shown  interest  in  these  assessments  to  monitor  their  citizen’s  quality  of 
life (Diener, et al., 2009; Stiglitz, et al., 2009). Well-being global assessments are typically 
focused on the totality of one’s positive experiences in life that requires retrospection via 
self-reports in survey-based measures.

Despite  the  ease  that  comes  with  answering  seemingly  straightforward  questions,  the 
emphasis  on  global  assessments  introduces  some  limitations  in  measurements  of  well-
being. First, the reliance on retrospective recall in global measures, introduces unreliable 
and biased responses; for instance, people are more prone to remember negative events and 
feelings in their lives when in a negative state (Clark & Teasdale, 1982). Second, global 
assessments  prevent  the  examination  of  people’s  dynamic  moment-to-moment  or  day-to-
day changes in feelings and experiences as a sequence of events over the course of time. 
Finally, the contextual governance of experiences is neglected in global measures, elimi-
nating  an  in-depth  understanding  of  how  well-being  varies  in  the  context  of  others  or  in 
interaction with the environment as life is lived in real-time and real-world settings (Shiff-
man  et  al.,  2008).  These  limitations  have  cast  some  doubt  in  the  validity  of  global  self-
report measures (Hudson et al., 2020; Kahneman, 1999; Schwarz & Strack, 1999). Expe-
riences of well-being, however, unfold in a momentary manner in people’s daily lives in 
their naturalistic context. Thus, examinations of people’s experiences of well-being as they 
live their lives day-to-day and moment-to-moment in real-world contexts, is imperative to a 
more precise understanding of well-being.

3   Momentary PERMA (mPERMA)

Capturing  well-being  in  real-time  and  real-world  contexts  is  an  important  new  direction 
to further our understanding of PERMA. People’s well-being undergoes dynamic changes 
governed  by  their  contextual  living  circumstances  and  interactions  with  their  immedi-
ate and extended environment as it unfolds over a sequence of events over both short and 
longer time scales (Donaldson et al., 2021). It is these momentary experiences that accu-
mulate  to  generate  global  evaluations  of  one’s  well-being  (Heshmati  et  al.,  2022).  As  a 
result, our understanding of the dynamic changes in well-being and its indicators over time 
and  across  contexts  are  lost  when  we  use  merely  global  assessments  of  well-being.  By 
using experience sampling methods (Csikszentmihalyi & Larson, 1987) such as Ecological 
Momentary Assessment (EMA; Stone & Shiffman, 1994) we can move beyond the limita-
tions of global assessments and take a dynamical modeling approach to measure how indi-
cators of well-being change in people’s momentary and daily experiences.

Specifically,  we  can  recognize  patterns  in  people’s  moment-to-moment  experiences 
of  elements  of  well-being  and  examine  how  those  varying  patterns  of  individual  differ-
ences relate to more long-term and stable reports of well-being. For instance, when using 
momentary reports of feeling loved – a measure of one of the PERMA elements, positive 

1 3

relationships – over short time-scales, we can examine love in terms of (a) mean levels: a 
person’s  average  levels  of  felt  love  across  time,  as  well  as  (b)  intra-individual  variability 
(IIV): how much a person’s levels of feeling loved fluctuate around their mean, over day-
to-day momentary experiences. With this, we can spot time-structured change patterns that 
amount to how much a person’s experience of positivity in their day-to-day relationships is 
related to longer term experiences of well-being (Oravecz et al., 2020).

Thus  far,  using  experience  sampling  methods,  researchers  have  made  great  advance-
ments  in  the  study  of  affect–an  important  component  of  subjective  well-being.  Through 
investigations  of  within-person  change  in  positive  and  negative  emotions  in  shorter  time 
scales and its manifestation as a momentary state in daily life, research has demonstrated 
links between mood variability and more stable states and traits such as depressive states 
(McConville  &  Cooper,  1996),  psychological  health  (Gruber  et  al.,  2013;  Goicoechea 
et  al.,  2023),  physical  health  (Hardy  &  Segerstrom,  2017),  emotional  eating  (Heshmati 
et al., 2023), lifestyle (Rombaoa et al., 2023); and age (Rocke & Brose, 2013; Larson et al., 
1980).  In  fact,  in  a  study  conducted  by  Eid  and  Diener  (1999),  the  validity  of  hedonic 
variability, as measured by positive and negative affect IIV across time, was examined in 
relation to average hedonic levels and personality traits. Eid and Diener (1999) found that 
hedonic variability, especially variability in positive emotions, is “sufficiently stable [and 
distinct] to be considered a psychological trait” (Eid & Diener, 1999; p. 662).

Whereas  examining  within-person  characteristics  of  momentary  changes  of  affect  has 
provided insight into hedonic well-being, less is known regarding within-person changes 
of eudaimonic elements of well-being. Moreover, within-person dynamics in both hedonia 
and  eudaimonia,  as  a  multidimensional  framework,  has  not  been  examined  in  relation  to 
more stable and global reports of well-being. For this purpose, we developed a momentary 
measure of PERMA (mPERMA)–as a momentary and multidimensional measure of well-
being–  by  adapting  the  PERMA-Profiler  (Butler  &  Kern,  2016)  items  for  the  Ecological 
Momentary Assessment paradigm (EMA; Stone & Shiffman, 1994).

The process we adopted in developing a state-measure of PERMA (i.e., mPERMA) was 
in  line  with  the  suggested  procedures  by  Horstmann  and  Ziegler  (2020).  Horstmann  and 
Ziegler  (2020)  suggest  that  for  constructing  measures  suitable  for  experience  sampling 
methods (i.e., state measures), researchers need to answer three questions that inform item 
construction  and  scale  development.  First,  we  needed  to  consider  what  is  the  construct 
that  is  being  measured.  We  aimed  at  measuring  both  hedonic  and  eudaimonic  elements 
that  make  up  well-being.  The  PERMA  theory  (Seligman,  2011,  2018)  incorporates  both 
aspects and has a validated trait-level measurement instrument, the PERMA-Profiler (But-
ler & Kern, 2016), therefore we chose this tool as a basis for ours.

Second, we considered the intended purpose of the measurement. Our goal was to cap-
ture  experiences  of  well-being  in  people’s  daily  lives  in  real-world  contexts  and  in-situ. 
The  PERMA-Profiler  validated  three  items  per  PERMA  element  for  measuring  PERMA 
as  a  trait  (Butler  &  Kern,  2016),  which  can  be  considered  parsimonious  given  the  com-
plexity  of  PERMA.  To  make  them  appropriate  for  momentary  assessments  where  par-
ticipants  respond  to  items  multiple  times  per  day,  we  adapted  the  phrasing  for  reflecting 
daily  life  states  of  well-being.  That  is  to  say  that  mPERMA  adopts  the  dimensionality 
of  the  PERMA-Profiler  scale  to  capture  the  five  PERMA  elements,  but  adapts  the  trait-
level language of the PERMA-Profiler items (e.g., “In general, how often do you feel joy-
ful?”) to momentary based assessments of well-being (e.g., “How joyful do you feel right 
now?”). Additionally, the measure should include items measuring each element of well-
being appropriate to different situations of a person’s life. For instance to capture Engage-
ment, we have situational-specific items such as “When I noticed the text message, I was

S. Heshmati et al.

absorbed in what I was doing” or “When I noticed the text message, I felt excited and inter-
ested in the things around me.”

Third,  we  considered  the  targeted  population.  The  mPERMA  measure  is  targeted  for 
the general population, specifically adults 18 years and older. There has been a plethora of 
research studies focusing on different elements of well-being in adults’ lives, both on the 
trait and state level. Specifically, PERMA-Profiler was originally validated using an adult 
population  (Butler  &  Kern,  2016)  and  subsequent  research  validating  this  measure  with 
participants 18 years and older (e.g., Bartholomaeus et al., 2020; Donaldson et al., 2021; 
Umucu et al., 2020) and tested globally (e.g., Giangrasso, 2021; Ryan et al., 2019; Wam-
merl et al., 2019). However, it is essential to acknowledge that the sample used in the cur-
rent study for the purpose of validation of the measurement was limited to college students 
18–22 years of age. This decision was primarily driven by the time-intensive nature of our 
measurements and the convenience of using a college student sample which is often more 
easily accessible for research involving detailed measurement designs. We elaborate on this 
further in the limitations section of this paper.

4   The Current Study

In the current study, we first aimed to test the factor structure of mPERMA, a momentary 
scale developed to measure the PERMA building blocks in real-time and real-world con-
texts. After validation of the measure, we examined how within-person dynamics of each 
of  the  PERMA  building  blocks—measured  via  mPERMA—were  associated  with  global 
measures of SWB, the Flourishing Scale (FS; Diener et al., 2009) and the Emotional Well-
Being subscale of the Short Form Health Survey (SF-36; Ware & Sherbourne, 1992). We 
selected  the  FS  as  our  global  assessment  of  psychological  well-being  because  through  a 
single  well-being  score  it  assesses  various  self-perceived  elements  of  well-being  (e.g., 
relationships, self-esteem, purpose, etc.) from a global perspective and has been shown to 
be strongly associated with other global well-being scales (see Diener et al., 2009). Addi-
tionally, the FS is proposed to be aligned with advancements in the psychological theories 
of  human  flourishing  that  have  emerged  in  recent  years.  The  authors  have  incorporated 
insights  from  multiple  contemporary  theories,  including  those  proposed  by  Ryff(1989), 
Ryff  &  Singer  (1998),  and  Ryan  and  Deci  (2000).  These  theories  emphasize  the  impor-
tance of universal human psychological needs, such as competence, relatedness, and self-
acceptance, which the FS is proposed to effectively capture (Diener et al., 2009). However, 
it should be noted that FS was not shown to be associated with autonomy, a component of 
eudaimonic well-being present in Ryff’s (1989) Psychological Well-Being framework and 
hence this element is missing from our examination of eudaimonic well-being. In addition 
to the FS that captures the global eudaimonic aspects of well-being, we used the Emotional 
Well-Being subscale of the SF-36 to capture the global hedonic dimensions of well-being.

Specifically, we examined mPERMA in terms of mean levels and its dynamics of IIV. 
Previous research examining the dynamical characteristics of well-being elements demon-
strated  that  IIV  in  these  elements  (e.g.,  positive  emotions;  Eid  &  Diener,  1999)  are  suf-
ficiently  distinct  to  be  considered  as  unique  traits.  We  used  this  dynamical  characteristic 
of mPERMA (i.e., IIV) to explore whether there are systematic associations between this 
and more stable well-being measures. Specifically, we tested the association of mean levels 
and  fluctuations  (IIV)  in  each  PERMA  element  in  relation  to  globally  assessed  levels  of 
hedonic (i.e., emotional well-being) and eudaimonic (i.e., Flourishing) well-being.

1 3

Previous  reports  of  within-person  dynamic  correlates  with  physical  health  and  mental 
health  indicators  have  shown  that  higher  variability  in  affect  is  negatively  associated  with 
health indicators both short-term and long-term, while higher mean levels of positive affect 
is related to better mental health (e.g., Hardy & Segerstrom, 2017; Ram & Gerstorf, 2009). 
Moreover,  a  study  examining  intra-individual  variability  in  components  of  subjective  well-
being (e.g., life satisfaction, positive emotions, negative emotions) in relation to global assess-
ments  of  psychological  states  (e.g.,  social  support)  found  that  higher  IIV  is  negatively  cor-
related  to  social  support  and  positively  associated  with  adverse  life  events  (Gadermann  & 
Zumbo, 2007). A more recent study examining momentary experiences of love in everyday 
life in relation to more global assessments of psychological well-being (e.g., flourishing, emo-
tional well-being, gratitude) found that higher mean levels of momentary feelings of love were 
positively associated with psychological well-being (Oravecz, et al., 2020). Thus, we hypoth-
esized that higher mean levels and lower fluctuations (IIV) in the momentary experiences of 
the Positive emotions element of PERMA would be associated with higher levels of emotional 
well-being.  Similarly,  we  expected  that  higher  mean  levels  and  lower  IIV  in  the  other  four 
elements of the PERMA building blocks (i.e., E, R, M, A) would be associated with higher 
levels of Flourishing. By articulating building blocks of well-being in terms of dynamic char-
acteristics we can identify various ways through which well-being may be manifested and is 
experienced in a day-to-day manner that is related to and may lead to higher levels of global 
well-being.

5   Method

In this section, we report how we determined our sample size, all data exclusions (if any), and 
all measures in the study. The data collected in this study and the respective analytic codes are 
publicly available and can be accessed through the Open Science Framework (OSF;   https:// 
osf. io/ emyzp/? view_ only= 3370d c87c5 914b8 5870a 83ea2 2e3b5 3b).

6   Participants

Participants consisted of a total of 160 undergraduate students at a major public university in 
the North East, United States. Participants were recruited by a convenience sampling method 
through the university’s research website. Sixty-eight percent of the participants were female 
and 32% of the participants were male. Participants’ age ranged from 18 to 22 years old. Sev-
enty-four percent of the participants were White/Caucasian, 6% of them were Black/African-
American, 9% of them were Asian or Pacific Islander, and 4% of them were Hispanic/Latino. 
The remaining 1% identified themselves as other races. This project has been approved by The 
[blinded] Human Subjects Protection Program and IRB protocol number: STUDY00006362. 
Informed consent was obtained from all participants before they were involved in the study.

7   Study Design

This  study  is  part  of  a  larger  study  which  includes  a  56-day  intervention  study  using  a 
signal-contingent EMA design. In the current study we used the EMA data associated with 
the first 14 days of the larger study, the period before the intervention began. The aim of 

Momentary PERMA: An Adapted Measurement Tool for Studying…1 32448

S. Heshmati et al.

the  study  was  voiced  as  measuring  psychological  well-being  in  everyday  life  while  also 
completing some small exercises. On the first day of the study, participants completed an 
introductory survey on the online Qualtrics survey platform (Qualtrics, Provo, UT) which 
included  the  Flourishing  scale,  Short  Form  Health  Survey,  demographics  questions,  and 
other  psychological  scales  on  a  computer  in  the  lab.  Starting  from  the  next  day,  partici-
pants  received  the  EMA  surveys  via  text  messages  to  their  smartphones  six  times  a  day, 
semi-randomly during the day, for 14 days. The semi-random schedule of the text messages 
was  in  a  way  that  surveys  were  sent  to  participants’  phones  randomly  within  six  desig-
nated two-hour blocks across the day with no less than half an hour between each survey. 
In these surveys, participants gave structured self-reports on their momentary well-being 
(momentary  PERMA).  The  surveys  were  scheduled  based  on  the  participants’  waking 
hours, between the time in the morning that they reported waking up until the time they 
reported they usually went to bed. To reduce the participant workload in the momentary 
assessments,  two  items  out  of  the  three  items  for  each  element  were  randomly  selected 
and implemented within each momentary assessment and one item was kept missing sys-
tematically  using  the  random  missingness  paradigm.  Therefore,  in  each  session  partici-
pants answered 10 items (2 × 5). As missing data comes from the design, the missingness 
mechanism is considered completely at random (MCAR, Rubin, 1976). We used maximum 
likelihood methods to impute the missing data as it produces unbiased estimates of popu-
lation parameters (Davey, 2009; Enders, 2010; McKnight et al., 2007). Participants were 
prompted to respond to EMA surveys 6 times a day totaling to 84 survey prompts. On aver-
age, participants responded to 75 of the 84 prompts (~ 89% compliance rate). participants 
were incentivised with payments for their time based on the number of surveys they com-
pleted by the end of the study duration.

8   Measures1

8.1   mPERMA

mPERMA items were adapted for EMA data collection from the PERMA- profiler scale 
(Butler  &  Kern,  2016).  To  this  end,  the  15  items  from  the  PERMA  Profiler,  three  items 
corresponding to each PERMA element, were reworded for the present moment replacing 
the  “general”  wording  of  the  items.  For  example,  the  PERMA  profiler  item  “In  general, 
how often do you feel joyful?” was converted to the statement “I am feeling joyful” with 
response options ranging from “Not at all” to “Extremely” using a sliding scale of 0 to 100. 
The Cronbach’s alpha coefficients were 0.88 for positive emotions, 0.85 for engagement, 
0.91 for relationship, 0.92 for meaning and 0.92 for accomplishment.

8.2   Flourishing

We used the Flourishing scale (Diener et. al., 2009) to measure participants’ global assess-
ments of well-being. This scale has eight items corresponding to one’s own perception of 

1  All measures reported here are a selection of measures from the larger study that were relevant for the 
current study. The larger study included additional measures related to participants’ health, emotions, mind-
fulness, and life satisfaction.

success  in  important  domains  of  well-being  such  as  relationships,  purpose,  self-esteem, 
and  optimism.  Example  items  of  this  scale  include:  “I  lead  a  purposeful  and  meaning-
ful life.” and “I am optimistic about my future.” The final scale score was calculated over 
eight items that ranged between 1 (Strongly disagree) to 7 (Strongly agree) where higher 
scores correspond to better well-being. The Cronbach’s alpha coefficient for this scale was 
0.93  indicating  high  reliability.  Overall,  participants’  average  flourishing  score  was  5.86 
(SD = 1.11).

8.3   Emotional Well‑Being

The emotional well-being subscale of the 36-item short-form health survey (SF-36; Ware 
&  Sherbourne,  1992)  was  used  to  provide  a  hedonic  global  assessment  of  well-being. 
This subscale included five items around people’s emotional experiences with the prompt 
“These  questions  are  about  how  you  feel  and  how  things  have  been  with  you  during  the 
past 4 weeks. For each question, please give the one answer that comes closest to the way 
you have been feeling.” Items began with “How much of the time in the past 4 weeks…” 
with example items such as “have you felt downhearted and blue?” or “have you felt calm 
and  peace?”  or  “have  you  been  a  happy  person?”  with  a  response  scale  ranging  from  1 
(All of the time) to 6 (None of the time). After reverse coding some items, we rescaled the 
responses  to  0–100  to  match  other  measures.  Final  scores  were  calculated  by  aggregat-
ing across the five items to form one score representing participants’ emotional well-being 
score with higher scores indicating higher emotional well-being. This scale demonstrated 
substantial reliability with a Cronbach’s alpha of 0.82. Overall, participants’ average emo-
tional well-being score was 71.79 (SD = 16.64).

9   Data Analysis

The sample size was determined based on the larger intervention study with recruiting suf-
ficient  samples  for  each  of  the  three  experimental  groups.  We  tried  to  adhere  to  general 
sample size guidelines for conducting factor analysis in the multilevel framework (Comrey 
& Lee, 1992; Kline, 1994; Maas & Hox, 2005). From the recruited sample of 165, 5 were 
excluded  due  to  incomplete  data  (below  80%  completion  of  all  surveys)  and  participant 
attrition. The analysis was conducted on the final sample of N = 160 with a total of 10,979 
observations.

The  data  analysis  for  this  study  involved  two  steps.  First,  multilevel  factor  analysis 
(MFA)  was  conducted  to  validate  the  five-factor  structure  of  mPERMA.  The  multilevel 
approach was chosen due to the nested nature of the EMA measurements that were clus-
tered within-person. Second, a Bayesian regression analysis was conducted to investigate 
the  association  between  global  levels  of  flourishing  and  within-person  means  and  the 
dynamical characteristics of mPERMA elements such as fluctuations of the five mPERMA 
elements. The factor analysis was conducted in the R statistical software (Version 4.2.2., 
R Core Team, 2022). Specifically, the lavaan package (Rosseel, 2012) was used for MFA, 
and the psych (Revelle, 2021), stats (Bolar, 2019), and ggplot (Wickham et. al, 2016) pack-
ages were used for descriptive statistics. JASP (JASP Team, 2022) was used to conduct the 
Bayesian regression analysis.

9.1   Multilevel Factor Analysis

To  address  the  nested  nature  of  our  data  and  to  be  able  to  consider  both  levels  simul-
taneously,  we  conducted  a  Multilevel  Factor  Analysis  (MFA).  Traditional  single  level 
Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) uses the total covariance matrix of within-person 
indicators  pooled  across  occasions,  time  points,  or  groups.  MFA,  on  the  other  hand, 
decomposes  the  total  covariance  matrix  into  two  covariance  matrices:  within-level 
 (Spw)  and  between-level   (Sb)  and  enables  us  to  test  factor  structures  at  each  level 
simultaneously.

In the current study, the within-level covariance matrix corresponds to the within-person 
indicators pooled across different time points, and between-level covariance matrix corre-
sponds to the person-level indicators (aggregated over individuals). We hypothesized that 
at both within- and between- levels, the five-factor PERMA structure would be preserved.

We followed Muthen’s (1994) five-step procedure and defined the models in each step 
based on Huang (2017). These steps are mainly hierarchical and require some degree of 
model fit or misfit at each step to continue to the following steps. These steps are briefly 
explained below. Detailed information about the steps and corresponding models can be 
found in Huang (2017).

Step 1: The first step is fitting a single level (level 1) conventional CFA model using 
within-level covariance matrix  (Spw). This step enables researchers to test different fac-
tor structures under the theory. Although the nested nature of the data may cause biased 
parameter  estimates,  an  acceptable  model  fit  is  required  to  follow  the  next  steps.  We 
tested the 5-factor PERMA model in this step.

Step 2: A null model is defined and tested in the second step. The null model includes 
within-level   (Spw)  and  between-level   (Sb)  covariance  matrices  in  a  multigroup  setting 
and  the  model  defined  in  Step  1  is  tested  with  all  equality  constraints  set  to  be  equal. 
The poor model fit in this step implies that there is a need for multilevel modeling.

Step 3: This step requires fitting an independence model. In this step we start to model 
between-level factor structure by creating group-level factors for each item. These group-
level  factors  are  estimated  only  for  the  between-level  and  must  be  scaled  to  map  onto 
observed  between-level  variance.  This  is  achieved  by  fixing  each  group-level  factor  to  a 
scaling factor (approximately N/g for balanced groups). This scaling factor is used to scale 
the biased estimator using the data’s between-level variance so we can estimate the popula-
tion’s between-level covariance matrix. The population covariance matrix is expected to be 
comprised of 1 unit of within-group variance and the scaling factor number of units of the 
between-group variance. Poor model fit in this level indicates that there is a between level 
variance that needs to be modeled, leading to the next step.

Step 4: In this step, a saturated model is tested. A saturated model includes the model 
defined in step 3 and expands that model by allowing covariations in between level fac-
tors. One should expect an acceptable model fit similar to step 1 in this step.

Step 5: The final step requires modeling the between-level factor structure as hypoth-
esized.  Our  hypothesized  model  is  the  five-factor  PERMA  model  both  within  and 
between levels.

Conventional  fit  indices  were  used  in  our  model  fit  evaluation:  root-mean-square 
error of approximation (RMSEA), and standardized root-mean-square residual (SRMR) 
comparative fit index (CFI), and Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI). Hu and Bentler’s (1999) cut 
off values were considered (CFI and TLI ≥ 0.95; RMSEA and SRMR ≤ 0.08). Moreover, 
level-specific reliability values were calculated for the final model.

dark black line illustrates the mean level of their positive emotions. Person A (left plot) demonstrates high 
mean levels and Person B (right plot) demonstrates lower mean levels in their reported positive emotions

9.2   Calculating Intra‑individual Characteristics of mPERMA

The intra-individual characteristics of interest for the current study were (1) within-person 
mean levels and (2) IIV in the mPERMA elements.

10   Mean levels

For each mPERMA element, we calculated a mean value for every individual separately. 
Mean levels correspond to the mean value of each individual’s scores over measurements 
across time. Figure 1 illustrates two individuals’ mPERMA scores over time. The straight 
black  line  indicates  the  mean  level  of  each  example  person’s  data  across  time.  The  plot 
on the left demonstrates person A with a high mean score in positive emotions across the 
study time, and the plot on the right shows Person B with a low mean score in their positive 
emotions.

11   Intra‑Individual Variability (IIV)

Besides  mean  levels,  we  also  calculated  people’s  fluctuations  around  the  mean  (IIV) 
individually for each person. The IIV values correspond to standard deviations of each 
person’s scores over measurements across the study duration. Figure 2 shows two exam-
ple  individuals  who  demonstrate  different  patterns  in  IIVs  for  the  Positive  emotions 
element of mPERMA: Person A (left plot) demonstrates high variability and person B

fluctuating line illustrates the amount of variation in positive emotions across moments and days. Person A 
(left plot) demonstrates high intra-individual variation levels and Person B (right plot) demonstrates lower 
intra-individual variation levels in their reported positive emotions

(right plot) shows low variability respectively. Note that although mean levels (straight 
black line) of both people are pretty similar, their experiences of positive emotions fluc-
tuate differently over time.

11.1   Bayesian Regression Analysis

We  conducted  Bayesian  regression  analysis  (see,  e.g.,  Wagenmakers  et  al., 2017;  Gel-
man et al., 2013) to study whether an individual’s general levels of flourishing is related 
to mean levels and intraindividual variations in the different mPERMA elements. Bayes-
ian linear regression aims to determine the most optimal posterior distribution of model 
parameters,  where  the  posterior  distribution  is  derived  based  on  the  likelihood  (data) 
and  prior  distribution.  As  we  did  not  have  any  assumptions  about  the  prior  distribu-
tion of the variable, we used default priors in the analysis. When estimating models in 
the  Bayesian  framework  using  JASP,  we  need  to  manually  specify  the  prior  distribu-
tions  for  each  model  parameter.  Current  regression  analysis  consists  of  estimating  10 
regression  coefficients  (mean  and  intraindividual  variability  of  mPERMA  factors),  the 
intercept, and residual variance. We utilized the default “uninformative” priors provided 
in JASP. The Bayesian approach to linear regression is useful in our case as we want to 
explore the effects of several (ten) predictors simultaneously. The inferential output of 
the  Bayesian  regression  allows  us  to  compare  different  regression  models  correspond-
ing to different numbers and combinations of predictors, and evaluates the most optimal 
combination  in  terms  of  predicting  our  outcome  variable  (flourishing).  We  conducted 
our analysis in JASP. The files containing the analysis and the data are available at the 
paper’s OSF site.

There were a total of 10,979 observations for 160 participants with an average of 75 obser-
vations per participant. Descriptive statistics for each item and its corresponding intra-class 
correlations are reported in Table 1. As shown in Table 1, the ICC values are between 0.20 
and  0.62  indicating  a  considerable  amount  of  between-level  variance  among  individuals. 
Typically, the norm for state measures is to show ICCs ranging from 0.20 to 0.50 (Podsa-
koff et al., 2019; Sherman et al., 2015; Sun & Vazire, 2019). Variations in the ICCs demon-
strated in Table 1 indicate that some of the mPERMA elements may have better sensitivity 
to situational or contextual factors (e.g., Engagement and Positive emotions) compared to 
others with higher ICCs (e.g., Meaning and Relationship) that may be more attributable to 
the person. Further descriptive statistics for the IIVs and mean levels of each PERMA ele-
ment is presented in the supplementary material.

Model resulted in negative variance estimates in between-model. However, they are not significantly differ-
ent from zero for α = .01

to  test  the  between-level  variance  factor  model.  The  fit  statistics  for  the  null  model,  as 
expected, showed a poor fit indicating that there was a between-level variance that we need 
to  take  into  consideration  (RMSEA = 0.162,  SRMR = 0.695,  CFI = 0.548,  TLI = 0.526). 
This encouraged us to fit the independence model to test whether this variance is important 
enough to define a between-level model. The independence model indicated an acceptable 
model fit for two of the fit indices (RMSEA and SRMR), and the CFI and TLI fit indices 
were also close to a good fit (RMSEA = 0.074, SRMR = 0.027, CFI = 0.913, TLI = 0.902). 
Therefore,  for  quality  assurance,  we  moved  onto  the  fourth  and  fifth  steps  of  the  MFA 
modeling  to  test  group  level  modeling.  In  the  saturated  model,  we  got  an  acceptable 
model fit and moved on to test the hypothesized model (RMSEA = 0.024, SRMR = 0.018, 
CFI = 0.996, TLI = 0.989).

The  hypothesized  model  included  a  five-factor  structure  for  both  within  and  between 
models. Of note, we updated the scaling of our latent factors via manifest items that pro-
duced interpretable factor loadings. The results showed that the hypothesized model fits the 
data  well  (RMSEA = 0.021,  SRMR = 0.021,  CFI = 0.994,  TLI = 0.992).  The  standardized 
factor loadings are reported in Table 3. The factor loadings in both within and between lev-
els were significantly larger than zero (p < 0.00). Factor correlations are shown in Table 5. 
At  the  within-level,  factor  correlations  range  from  highest  magnitude  of  0.498  (Positive 
emotion with Relationship) to lowest magnitude of 0.129 (Engagement with Meaning). At 
the  between-level,  factor  correlations  range  from  highest  magnitude  of  −  0.880  (Mean-
ing  with  Accomplishment)  to  lowest  − 0.302  (Engagement  with  Meaning).Results  indi-
cate  that  the  items  “I  am  feeling  positive”  (Positive  emotion),  “I  lead  a  purposeful  and 
meaningful life” (Meaning), and “I am making progress towards accomplishing my goals” 
(Accomplishment) show standardized factor loadings > 1 (Table 3) and negative between-
level residual variances (Table 4). The between-level variance for “I am feeling positive” 
(p = 0.076), and “I lead a purposeful and meaningful life” (p = 0.670) were not significantly 
different from 0, however, “I am making progress towards accomplishing my goals” was 
(p = 0.017). Additional variances that were not significantly different from 0 include “I was 
absorbed in what I was doing” (Engagement; p = 0.699), “I feel helped and supported by 
others”  (Relationship;  p = 0.497,  and  “What  I  do  in  my  life  is  valuable  and  worthwhile” 
(Meaning; p = 0.399).

We conducted post hoc analyses to explore the three “Heywood cases” (e.g., estimated 
negative variances, standardized loadings > 1) and assess additional diagnostics regarding 
model misspecification (Kolenikov & Bollen, 2012). There were three estimated residual 
variances  that  were  negative  (Table  4):  for  items  P2  (− 1.729,  p = 0.076),  M1  (− 0.174, 
p = 0.670) and A1 (− 0.756, p = 0.017). The first two were not significantly different from

zero,  however,  the  estimated  residual  variance  for  the  third  item  (A1)  was  significant 
(Table  5).  It  is  not  realistic  to  have  negative  variances  in  the  population,  thus,  there  is  a 
need to explore and identify causes. These Heywood cases often serve as error indicators 
to conduct deeper investigations into the parameter estimation process, data quality, model 
specification,  etc.  Common  causes  include  outliers,  small  samples,  or  model  misspecifi-
cation  (Bentler  &  Chou,  1987;  Chen  et  al.,  2001;  Kolenikov  &  Bollen,  2012).  Practical 
guidelines  suggest  that  some  Heywood  cases  are  not  problematic  after  conducting  diag-
nostic assessment (Bentler & Chou, 1987). Our data has a large sample to parameter ratio 
(greater than rule of thumb guidelines of 5 to 1; Bentler & Chou, 1987). To assess model 
specification, we conducted post hoc analyses with alternative model structures to assess 
factor structure at the between and within levels (see Table 6).

We  conducted  a  post  hoc  multilevel  exploratory  factor  analysis  to  identify  the  factor 
structure  at  both  levels.  First,  we  fit  a  modified  model  with  the  non-significant  residual 
variances in the hypothesized model fixed to 0. Model fit does not appear to be improving 
with these modifications. We conducted post hoc exploratory analysis to assess the factor 
structure  on  the  between-level  with  5-factor  structure  at  the  within-level.  Huang  (2017) 
suggests that higher order factor structures may be simpler or different from within-level 
factor  structures,  thus,  we  compared  model  fit  across  increasing  factor  structures  (See 
Table  6).  Exploratory  factor  analysis  of  the  total  covariance  matrix  guided  measurement 
model  specifications  in  the  exploratory  MFA.  Overall,  the  factor  correlations  are  higher 
in the between-level than  the within-level,  however,  the 5-factor  solution indicates better

13.1   Reliability

B + 𝜎2

W )−1𝜎2

Reliability  is  reported  for  each  factor  at  the  within  and  between  levels  of  the  model. 
Reported  above  in  Table  1,  ICC  is  computed  for  each  mPERMA  item  to  indicate  the 
amount of group-level variability to the total variance (Huang, 2017). Technically, the 
ICC is computed as 𝜌 = (𝜎2
B for each item. The ICC represents the amount of 
variability  attributable  to  the  between-individual  level  (Huang,  2017).  ICC  is  reported 
following  Koo  and  Li  (2016)’s  best  practices  guidelines  for  assessing  reliability  and 
reporting  appropriate  ICC  form.  As  this  study  involves  assessing  individuals  on  mul-
tiple measurements, reliability tests involve estimating the reliability in variance at the 
between and within levels. ICC estimates were calculated in R [Version 4.2.2; R Core 
Team  (2022)].  ICC  Reliability  estimates  were  based  on  each  repeated  measure  from 
each individual, defined as group-level variability of each mPERMA item, using MFA. 
ICC’s ranged from 0.200 to 0.616, indicating that there is variability to be modeled at 
the  between  and  within  levels.  Additional  estimates  of  level-specific  reliability  meas-
ures  are  computed  via  omega  coefficient  values  (McDonald,  1999).  Therefore,  we  can 
conclude that mPERMA measures may benefit by modeling in the multilevel framework 
and  have  adequate  reliability  in  both  levels.  MFA  results  also  imply  that  both  aggre-
gated and disaggregated measures have the same factor structure with slightly different 
factor  loadings.  Following  Geoldhof,  Preacher,  &  Zyphur  (2014)’s  recommendations 
for  assessing  multilevel  reliabilities,  within  and  between  reliabilities  were  estimated 
for  each  subscale  individually.  The  multilevel  alphas  (Cronbach,  1951)  and  omegas 
(McDonald, 1970) are provided in Table 7.

14   mPERMA Dynamic Characteristics in Relation to Flourishing 

and Emotional Well‑Being

We  conducted  a  Bayesian  regression  analysis  with  person-specific  characteristics  (i.e., 
mean  levels  and  IIV)  of  each  mPERMA  element  once  in  relation  to  Flourishing  and 
a  second  time  in  relation  to  Emotional  Well-Being.  We  report  the  correlations  among 
mPERMA  person-specific  characteristics  in  relation  to  Flourishing  along  with  Emo-
tional Well-being in Table 1 of the Supplemental Material.

14.1   mPERMA Dynamics and Flourishing

The results for the model comparisons predicting Flourishing are provided in Table 8. 
The  most  optimal  model  for  predicting  Flourishing  (i.e.,  eudaimonic  well-being)  is 
shown  in  the  first  row  of  Table  8.  This  model  included  within-person  means  of  rela-
tionship  (Relationship  iMean),  within-person  means  of  meaning  (Meaning  iMean), 
and  intra-individual  variations  of  accomplishment  (Accomplishment  iSD).  The  pos-
terior  probability  of  this  best  fitting  model  was  P(M|data = 0.212)  which  was  much 
larger than all other models. This model explained 63% of the variance in Flourishing. 
As  indicated  by  the  Bayes  Factor  on  the  model  odds  (BF  M = 354.143),  after  observ-
ing  data,  the  odds  in  favor  of  this  model  increased  by  a  factor  of  354.143,  which  can 
be  considered  substantial.  The  BF10  indicates  the  relative  predictive  adequacy  of  each 
model compared to this most optimal model. The model in the second row of Table 8 
[R(iMean) + M(iMean)]  has  a  BF  10 = 0.206.  By  taking  reciprocals  of  this  BF  of  the 
model  in  the  second  row  (1/0.206 = 4.85),  we  can  see  that  the  observed  data  are  4.85 
less likely under this model, when compared to the most optimal one in the first row [ 
R(iMean) + M(iMean) + A(iSD)]. Similar comparisons can be made throughout the dif-
ferent alternative models in this table.

Averaged  model  coefficients  for  each  variable  across  different  models  predicting 
Flourishing  are  summarized  in  Tables  9.  Averaging  enables  us  to  capture  the  overall 
effect  of  variables  across  all  models  which  provides  stronger  evidence  for  or  against 
the null hypothesis. The parameters displayed in the first six columns of Table 9 assist 
in determining whether to include each existing variable as a predictor in the model or 
not. The remaining columns on the right-hand side of Table 9 provide us with the coef-
ficients of each variable.

Based on the resulting inclusion Bayes Factors (BF  inclusion), which is calculated via 
dividing the posterior inclusion odds [P(incl|data)] by the prior inclusion odds [P(incl)], 
we found that there is very strong evidence for including within-person mean levels of 
Meaning  (Meaning  iMean)  as  a  predictor  in  the  model  (BF  inclusion = 43.654).  In  other 
words, a BF inclusion of 43.654 indicates that the data have increased prior odds by a fac-
tor of 43.654 for including Meaning iMean as a predictor in the model predicting Flour-
ishing. This is considered as very strong evidence (100 > BF  inclusion > 30) according to 
Jeffrey’s (1961) classification scheme for interpretation of evidence strength.

Moreover, inclusion of Relationship iMean (i.e., within-person mean levels of Rela-
tionship) as a predictor of Flourishing was also supported by the data. Results indicated 
that  there  is  evidence  for  including  Relationship  iMean  with  a  BF  inclusion = 6.472;  this 
means  that  the  data  increased  prior  odds  by  a  factor  of  6.472  for  including  this  vari-
able.  This  is  considered  as  moderate  evidence  (10 > BF  inclusion > 3)  for  the  alternative 
hypothesis  of  a  positive  association  being  present  between  mean  levels  of  momentary 
Relationship and global eudaimonic well-being (i.e., Flourishing).

While  intra-individual  variations  in  Accomplishment  (Accomplishment  iSD)  were 
also  included  in  the  most  optimal  model  presented  in  Table  8,  The  BF  inclusion = 1.441 
shown in the posterior summaries of coefficients in Table 9 indicated that the strength 
of this evidence is small (sometimes labeled as “anecdotal”). Importantly, this associa-
tion is negative (Mean = -0.560) meaning that higher fluctuations in reports of Accom-
plishment in people’s daily lives is related to lower levels of Flourishing.

With multiple predictors in the model and considering the intertwined characteristic 
of well-being, we assessed the best prediction model for Flourishing from the regression

Table displays only a subset of models in the order of most predictive to least. “P” stands for Positive emo-
tions, “E” stands for Engagement, “R” stands for Relationships, “M” stands for Meaning, and “A” stands for 
Accomplishment; all are elements from the PERMA model. “iMean” is the calculated within-person mean 
and “iSD” is the calculated intra-individual variability for each of the PERMA elements

analyses. With three variables in this model, we assessed for multicollinearity. We com-
puted  the  Variance  Inflation  Factor  (VIF)  values  and  tolerance  values  (Table  10)  for 
each variable to investigate multicollinearity (Belsley et al., 1980). The VIF values were 
below the threshold (VIFs < 4) indicating low correlations among each predictor varia-
ble with other predictor variables. The tolerance values are > 0.2 indicating the percent-
age of unique variables of each predictor that cannot be captured by the other predictor 
variables.

14.2   mPERMA Dynamics and Emotional Well‑Being

The  results  for  the  model  comparisons  predicting  Emotional  Well-Being  are  provided 
in  Table  11.  The  most  optimal  model  for  predicting  hedonic  well-being  as  measured  by 
Emotional  Well-Being  is  demonstrated  in  the  first  row  of  Table  11  which  only  included 
within-person  mean  levels  of  Positive  emotions.  The  posterior  probability  of  this  model 
(P(M|data) = 0.437) is much larger than all other models. This model explained 35% of the 
variance in Emotional Well-Being. The Bayes Factor on the model odds (BF  M = 84.595) 
indicates  that  after  observing  data,  the  odds  in  favor  of  the  model  containing  Positive 
emotions  iMean  as  the  independent  variable  increased  by  a  factor  of  84.595.  By  tak-
ing reciprocals of the BF  10 of the most optimal model and the second-best model in the 
second  row  (1/0.489 = 2.044)  we  find  that  the  observed  data  are  2.044  times  more  likely 
under  the  model  containing  P(iMean)  as  the  predictor  compared  to  the  model  with  both

P(iMean) + R(iMean).  Similar  comparisons  can  be  made  for  the  rest  of  the  models  with 
respect to the most optimal model.

Averaged model coefficients for each variable across different models predicting Emo-
tional Well-Being are summarized in Table 12. Based on the resulting inclusion Bayes Fac-
tor  for  Positive  emotion  iMean  (BF  inclusion = 35.892),  we  found  that  there  is  very  strong 
evidence (100 > BF inclusion > 30) for including this variable as a predictor in the model; that 
is, the data have increased prior odds by a factor of 35.892 for including Positive emotions 
iMean as a predictor of Emotional Well-Being.

On the other hand, based on the inclusion Bayes Factors reported for all the other vari-
ables in Table 12, we can conclude that including any other variables in the model predict-
ing Emotional Well-Being in fact decreases the prior odds. For example, data decreases our 
prior odds for including Engagement iMean by a factor of 1/0.204 = 4.90.

Table  12  also  provides  point  estimates  for  each  predictor’s  coefficient  as  well  as  the 
uncertainty via 95% credible intervals. However, it should be noted that estimates are con-
ditional on the underlying model–the estimate of the effect of Positive emotions will be dif-
ferent as a sole independent variable in the model compared to when accompanied by other 
independent variables. To solve this problem, Bayesian model averaging provides a solu-
tion: it provides a weighted average for the 95% credible interval such that each estimate is 
weighted by the posterior probability of including that independent variable in the model 
(Faulkenberry & Wagenmakers, 2020; Van den Bergh, et al., 2020). With this, the credible 
intervals reported in Table 12 account for the uncertainty within and across models. Hence, 
we can reliably conclude that the coefficient of Positive emotion has a posterior mean of 
8.580 indicating that with each increase in average levels of positive emotion experience, 
people’s levels of Emotional Well-Being increase by an average of 8.580 points. Based on 
the model averaged credible interval, we can say that this coefficient is 95% probable to be 
between 3.375 and 12.424.

15   Discussion

Although there have been steps made towards better understanding and validating building 
blocks  of  well-being  on  a  global  level,  research  on  daily  experiences  of  well-being  as  it 
unfolds in people’s naturalistic environments has been scarce. The current study aimed to 
bridge this gap by examining the PERMA building blocks of well-being in people’s day-
to-day lives through an EMA design. We followed the steps suggested by Horstmann and 
Ziegler (2020) to create a measure of PERMA suitable for EMA methods. We dub this new 
iteration of the scale “mPERMA” (momentary PERMA). First, we tested the factor struc-
ture of mPERMA through MFA. We then used the daily life data captured via mPERMA to 
examine the within-person mean-levels and dynamics of change (e.g., fluctuations) in each 
PERMA element and their relation to people’s globally assessed hedonic (i.e., Emotional 
Well-Being) and eudaimonic (i.e., Flourishing) well-being.

As hypothesized, the MFA for mPERMA revealed a five-factor structure, at both within- 
and between-levels, indicating a sound measure of the five PERMA building blocks at a 
momentary level. Specifically, all three items adapted to EMA assessments measuring each 
of the five PERMA elements loaded significantly onto the respective PERMA factor. More-
over, mPERMA measures indicated adequate reliability in both within and between levels 
of  analysis.  In  other  words,  both  aggregated  and  disaggregated  measures  have  the  same 
factor structure with slightly different factor loadings. This finding implies that well-being

can be assessed through various elements including both hedonic and eudaimonic aspects 
of well-being as a momentary experience in daily life. Additionally, considering that the 
reliability of the full scale is also relatively high [coefficient omega of 0.97 (between) and 
0.78 (within), McDonald, 1999]), researchers and practitioners can use either the subscale 
scores individually or the full scale score as a whole, having flexibility to choose the scor-
ing approach that best suits their research questions and client goals. This approach paves 
the way for further applied investigations of well-being as is experienced on a momentary 
basis and in a contextually and ecologically valid manner across different populations and 
in different life circumstances.

Factor  correlations  also  revealed  interesting  findings  about  the  relationships  between 
different factors of mPERMA. At the within-level, factors were moderately correlated and 
positively associated. This ranged from the highest magnitude of 0.498 between Positive 
emotions and Relationships to the weakest magnitude of 0.129 between Engagement and 
Meaning. In contrast, at the between-level correlations varied in strength, with the strong-
est correlation observed between Positive Emotion and Relationship (0.864) and the weak-
est  between  Meaning  and  Engagement  (0.310).  These  results  suggest  that  the  PERMA 
factors  may  have  unique  relationships  with  each  other  depending  on  the  level  of  analy-
sis, indicating the importance of considering the measurement timescale and item framing 
when examining the associations between different aspects of well-being.

Moreover,  the  estimated  factor  correlations  at  the  between-level  demonstrated  several 
interesting pairwise comparisons that shed light on the discriminant validity of the facets. 
Among  the  facets  demonstrating  greater  discriminant  validity,  Engagement  consistently 
emerged  as  a  distinct  factor.  Specifically,  the  pairwise  correlations  between  Engagement 
and Relationship, Engagement and Meaning, and Engagement and Accomplishment indi-
cated relatively lower factor correlations, suggesting a clearer differentiation between these 
facets. Conversely, facets with lower discriminant validity exhibited higher factor correla-
tions with each other. Notably, the pairwise comparisons of Meaning and Accomplishment, 
Positive Emotion and Relationship, and Relationship and Meaning demonstrated stronger 
factor  correlations,  indicating  a  greater  overlap  or  shared  variance  between  these  facets. 
In sum, these results suggest that Engagement consistently represents a distinct facet with 
relatively lower correlations with other facets, supporting its discriminant validity. On the 
other hand, facets such as Meaning, Accomplishment, Positive Emotion, and Relationship 
demonstrate  somewhat  higher  correlations,  indicating  a  certain  degree  of  overlap  in  the 
variance they capture.

To further our understanding of how different elements of well-being unfold over time 
in day-to-day life, we then used mPERMA to obtain within-person dynamic characteristics 
of  each  of  the  PERMA  elements  assessed  over  14  days  and  75  momentary  time-points. 
Using the within-person mean levels and dynamic characteristics (i.e., intra-individual var-
iability) we were able to examine what dynamics of change may be associated with global 
well-being for each PERMA well-being element. Using a Bayesian regression analysis, we 
first examined these associations in relation to people’s global reports of their eudaimonic 
well-being  as  measured  by  the  Flourishing  scale.  Next,  we  examined  all  five  mPERMA 
elements with regards to people’s hedonic well-being as measured by the Emotional Well-
Being scale.

As  hypothesized,  we  found  that  eudaimonic  elements  of  PERMA  (e.g.,  Relationship, 
Meaning, and Accomplishment), measured on a momentary level, in fact were meaning-
fully  associated  with  Flourishing—a  measure  of  eudaimonic  well-being.  Moreover,  with 
regards  to  hedonic  well-being  (Emotional  Well-Being),  the  momentary  Positive  emo-
tion element of PERMA indicated the only meaningful association. This finding provides 

1 3 
2465

further evidence that while various elements of well-being can be assessed individually on 
a momentary basis in people’s daily lives and natural environments, they also are meaning-
fully  associated  with  the  corresponding  aspect  of  people’s  global  reports  of  well-being. 
Most importantly, for each of these elements, the dynamic characteristic of change that is 
related to global reports of well-being is different.

Specifically, we found that in relation to global reports of eudaimonic well-being (i.e., 
Flourishing), people’s within-person mean levels of Relationship and Meaning are mean-
ingfully  and  positively  associated  with  Flourishing.  That  is,  regardless  of  within-person 
fluctuations, the higher a person’s overall average of moment-to-moment Relationship and 
Meaning  is,  the  higher  their  global  assessments  of  Flourishing  would  be.  These  results 
suggest that in order for individuals to experience overall high levels of eudaimonic well-
being, it is crucial for them to monitor their daily and momentary experiences of positive 
relationships (i.e., feeling loved and supported; Heshmati et al., 2019; Heshmati & Don-
aldson, 2020) and meaning in life (i.e., sense of purpose and value; Cohen & Cairns, 2012; 
Steger & Kashdan, 2007). It is important to note that maintaining consistently high levels 
of meaning and positive relationships is key, regardless of the fluctuations in these experi-
ences throughout one’s daily life. This finding is in line with previous research examining 
love in daily life, with similar results: within-person averages of moments of feeling loved 
in  daily  life  was  significantly  associated  with  psychological  well-being  (Oravecz  et  al., 
2020); this is while fluctuations in those experiences were not significantly associated with 
well-being.

On the other hand, our results indicate that it’s the within-person fluctuations in experi-
ences  of  Accomplishment,  rather  than  mean  levels,  that  is  meaningfully  associated  with 
Flourishing;  more  importantly,  this  association  is  negative.  In  other  words,  higher  levels 
of fluctuation in momentary experiences of accomplishment are related to lower levels of 
eudaimonic well-being. When contextualizing this finding in people’s daily lives, we can 
infer  that  having  a  steady  flow  of  accomplishment  and  feelings  of  success  towards  one’s 
goals is more relevant for people’s overall sense of eudaimonic well-being than having too 
many  ebbs  and  flows  in  feeling  accomplished  and  successful  in  handling  responsibilities 
and achieving goals. It may be that the high points experienced in this state does not offset 
the low points and therefore a gradual steady pace is more helpful, regardless of how on 
average they feel momentarily accomplished. We, however, do caution the reader that these 
implications  are  based  on  correlational  associations  and  examination  of  causal  relation-
ships is needed in future studies.

Additionally, we found that Positive emotion – a hedonic element of PERMA– was the 
only  element  that  highly  mapped  onto  people’s  global  reports  of  hedonic  well-being  as 
measured  by  the  Emotional  Well-Being  scale.  Specifically,  within-person  mean  levels  of 
Positive emotion were meaningfully associated with Emotional Well-Being, such that the 
higher on average people’s momentary experiences of positive emotions, the higher their 
reports of global emotional well-being would be; this is despite how much fluctuations was 
existent  in  their  momentary  experiences  of  Positive  emotions.  Contrary  to  our  expecta-
tions, variability in positive emotions in daily life was not meaningfully related to global 
reports of Emotional Well-Being. Prior research examining intra-individual variability in 
positive  and  negative  affect  in  relation  to  depressive  symptoms  (McConville  &  Cooper, 
1996) and health (Gruber et al., 2013) have found significant relationships. However, this 
association  might  not  entirely  be  true  for  positive  emotions  and  emotional  well-being. 
Most  recently,  Oravecz  et  al.,  (2020)  examined  intra-individual  characteristics  of  feeling 
loved  in  a  momentary  manner  as  it  related  to  emotional  well-being.  Love  was  treated  as 
a  micromoment  of  positivity  resonance  in  which  people  would  experience  moments  of 

Momentary PERMA: An Adapted Measurement Tool for Studying…1 32466

S. Heshmati et al.

positive emotions with another person. Similar to our findings regarding Positive emotions, 
Oravecz et al. (2020) also found that out of all the different within-person characteristics 
of momentary love (e.g., mean levels, IIV, inertia), only within-person mean levels of felt 
love was meaningfully associated with emotional well-being. While our analytic approach 
does not allow for causal inference, this finding may suggest that people’s global evalua-
tions of their emotional well-being is more sensitive to the average level of their daily life 
experiences of those emotions compared to the ebbs and flows. In other words, as long as 
people  experience  overall  higher  levels  of  positive  emotions  in  their  daily  life,  it  doesn’t 
matter that at times they might be low on those emotions. In fact, this might be an indica-
tion that when positive emotions are low for people, they are experiencing some level of 
negative emotions (Russel, 2003) which on its own is an important indicator of well-being. 
Unfortunately, in the current study, we did not include a measure of negative emotions and 
therefore  cannot  confirm  this  inferred  conclusion.  We  suggest  that  future  studies  explore 
the role of within-person experiences of negative emotions along with positive emotions in 
relation to global Emotional Well-Being.

Notably,  we  found  no  evidence  for  the  relationship  between  within-person  patterns  of 
Engagement in daily life and Flourishing; nor with Emotional Well-Being. Based on previ-
ous studies that have also examined Engagement on a momentary basis and its relation to 
other elements of PERMA (Heshmati et al., 2020), momentary engagement in daily life is 
not a central element in the network of PERMA. This is particularly true for the specific 
age group that comprised the participants of this study —early adults in the US. Rather, 
due  to  the  central  role  of  Positive  emotions  and  Relationship  in  early  adults’  network  of 
PERMA well-being (Heshmati et al., 2020), this finding may suggest that Engagement is 
indirectly related to individuals’ global well-being. In other words, it may be that increases 
in Engagement are related to increases in positive emotions which in turn relates to Emo-
tional  Well-Being.  Similarly,  momentary  experiences  of  Engagement  may  be  associated 
with  momentary  experiences  of  positive  relationships  which  in  turn  relates  to  Flourish-
ing.  Indirect  associations  among  these  momentary  elements  of  PERMA  warrant  future 
research.

Another possible explanation for this finding is that items representing Engagement in 
mPERMA  indicate  the  lowest  intra-class  correlations  (ICC ~ 0.20)  among  all  other  items 
in the current study. These low ICCs imply that Engagement item scores are most sensi-
tive to situational and contextual factors and less related to person-specific factors, hence 
the  lack  of  significant  association  between  momentary  Engagement  measures  and  more 
person-specific  and  trait-like  Eudaimonic  measures  such  as  Flourishing.  Worthy  of  note, 
items representing Positive emotions have the next lowest ICC (~ 0.30)– after Engagement 
items–  which  display  their  state-like  nature  and  sensitivity  to  situations  and  contexts  as 
well.  Although  all  ICC  values  for  all  items  were  in  the  normal  expected  range  (0.20  to 
0.50) for our purposes, Engagement and Positive emotion items’ ICCs lower values may 
reflect their transitory states as hedonic elements of well-being. On the other hand, Eudai-
monic elements of PERMA such as Relationship, Meaning, and Accomplishment fared on 
the  higher  range  of  ICCs  (Relationship ~ 0.50;  Meaning ~ 0.60;  Accomplishment ~ 0.40). 
ICC  values  for  state  scores  that  are  close  to  one  show  that  more  of  their  variance  could 
be  attributed  to  person-specific  factors  and  be  less  sensitive  to  situational  circumstances. 
Although still in the normal range, higher ICCs for the eudaimonic elements of PERMA 
(i.e.,  Relationship,  Meaning,  and  Accomplishment)  compared  to  the  hedonic  elements, 
may suggest that these items are more trait-like and eudaimonic experiences are less transi-
tory and prone to change due to circumstances and are more likely to be longstanding.

It should be noted that some items in the mPERMA item pool do not explicitly include 
the  “present  moment”  wording.  However,  in  our  opinion,  this  should  not  be  a  reason  as 
to  whether  participants  rated  these  items  based  on  their  momentary  experiences  on  the 
states  measured.  We  believe  that  several  factors  contribute  to  capturing  such  momentary 
evaluations  on  all  items  of  mPERMA.  Firstly,  the  initial  instructions  for  the  participants 
emphasize the importance of responding based on momentary experiences. Secondly, the 
removal of general wording pertaining to overall life evaluations such as items that begin 
with “in general…” helps focus participants on their present experiences. Lastly, the nature 
of the assessments and the frequency of prompts throughout the day ensures that partici-
pants  provide  responses  in  various  temporal  contexts.  While  we  understand  that  specifi-
cally  for  eudaimonic  items  (e.g.,  purpose)  demonstrate  lower  iSDs  and  higher  ICCs,  we 
interpret these findings as indicators of the stability and lesser variability of these specific 
well-being  elements.  In  fact,  our  expectations  regarding  the  stability  of  certain  PERMA 
elements due to their inherent nature were supported by these results.

While the present study has afforded opportunities for more contextualized and ecologi-
cally valid examinations of well-being, we also want to acknowledge that the current study 
has its limitations. This study is limited in that we used a college sample of early adults to 
conduct this EMA study, as conducting these types of intensive data collections (6 times 
a day for 14 days) through technology is more feasible with a population that is comfort-
able with having smartphones with them at all times. Moreover, the nature of our analysis 
was  a  correlational  approach  and  is  limited  in  making  causal  inferences.  Future  studies 
are  warranted  to  explore  the  causal  associations  among  mPERMA  elements  in  daily  life 
and  their  effects  on  global  assessments  of  well-being.  Furthermore,  our  study  was  only 
limited  to  the  investigation  of  direct  relationships.  We  also  encourage  future  research  to 
explore indirect relationships among these constructs, in addition to the direct associations. 
For instance, the role of momentary experiences of engagement and flow in daily life may 
be  further  clarified  with  investigations  of  indirect  mechanisms  through  which  flow  state 
may be related to overall reports of well-being. Additionally, this study encountered poten-
tial  Heywood  cases  (negative  residual  variances)  in  the  model  estimation  that  can  affect 
the analysis. Future studies should conduct rigorous assessments to diagnose the source of 
these Heywood cases and impact on analysis (Bentler & Chou, 1987; Kolenikov & Bollen, 
2012). This study was a first to examine the dynamics of daily PERMA through intensive 
data and we hope that it provides the foundation for future research to expand the examina-
tion of well-being as it is experienced in daily life in other age groups and to more repre-
sentative samples.

16   Implications

The  scientific  study  of  well-being  has  taken  big  steps  in  the  past  decade  with  more  and 
more  research  focused  on  cross-validation  of  prevalent  well-being  measures  (Donaldson 
et al., 2020; Goodman et al., 2018; Joshanloo, 2019). Most of these scientific endeavors, 
however, have been limited to global assessments of well-being in an attempt to understand 
people’s feelings and evaluations of their lives. These global assessments require retrospec-
tion  in  self-report  measures,  introducing  unreliable  and  biased  responses.  Additionally, 
global  well-being  measures  lack  ecological  validity,  neglecting  life  as  it  is  lived  in  real-
time and real-world settings (Shiffman et al., 2008). All in all, while advancements in the 
understanding of how people think and feel about their lives have been made, less research 

Momentary PERMA: An Adapted Measurement Tool for Studying…1 32468

S. Heshmati et al.

has  focused  on  how  well-being  is  experienced  in  people’s  lives  (Dolan  et  al.,  2017).  To 
bridge  this  gap,  this  study  took  a  step  toward  expanding  the  scientific  understanding  of 
well-being by examining how experiences of a good life unfold in people’s day-to-day lives 
and how these experiences relate to global evaluations of well-being. We used Ecological 
Momentary Assessment, as a study design that surpasses recall biases while also providing 
ecologically valid information regarding people’s experiences of well-being. Through this 
design, we were able to provide a snapshot of the within-person mean levels and dynamics 
of change ( IIV) in various elements of well-being (i.e., Positive Emotions, Engagement, 
Relationships, Meaning, Accomplishment) in people’s own daily contextual environments.
An  important  implication  of  the  findings  of  this  study  is  that  when  building  blocks 
of  well-being  are  broken  down  into  different  measurable  elements,  those  elements  can 
be  used  to  validly  measure  people’s  daily  experiences  of  well-being,  above  and  beyond 
their general thoughts and feelings (i.e., evaluations) of their lives. We can then use such 
momentary assessments of well-being to explore dynamic patterns of people’s lived expe-
riences of elements of well-being (e.g., within-person fluctuation) and study them in rela-
tion to other more stable individual characteristics. These kinds of dynamic investigations 
are often overlooked but are important because, it may be possible that for a specific well-
being element high (low) fluctuations of that experience in daily life is related to high (low) 
flourishing, regardless of their average levels of well-being over time. For example, in our 
investigation of daily experiences of well-being in college students, we found that momen-
tary  experiences  of  PERMA  elements  of  well-being  display  different  patterns  of  change 
as  they  unfold  over  time.  Moreover,  for  each  element,  different  aspects  of  their  dynami-
cal  change  is  related  to  people’s  overall  experiences  of  well-being:  while  high  averages 
of positive relationships across moments is important for people in relation to their global 
assessments of well-being, accomplishment, however, shows a different pattern; regardless 
of average levels, experiencing lower fluctuations is meaningfully related to higher global 
well-being.

Exploring the dynamic of change in momentary experiences of PERMA well-being has 
implications  for  applied  research  in  two  ways:  (1)  When  people  think  about  well-being, 
they are most likely to take a unidimensional approach to experiencing and enhancing well-
being. However, our research demonstrates that different elements of well-being (P-E-R-M-
A) experienced in daily life are related to different aspects of people’s global evaluations 
of well-being, which underscores the importance of richness in how well-being is experi-
enced in daily life. (2) When intervention scientists or practitioners prescribe practices for 
increasing global levels of life satisfaction and well-being in people’s daily lives, they usu-
ally focus on the types of activities that merely enhance average levels of various elements 
of well-being from one time to the next. However, this study highlights the importance of 
dynamics  of  change  in  each  element  of  well-being  as  experienced  in  daily  life  and  how 
those dynamics might be related to people’s overall sense of well-being.

For  instance,  a  most  recent  meta-analysis  on  the  effectiveness  of  interventions  in 
enhancing  eudaimonic  well-being  (van  Dierendonck  &  Lam,  2022)  found  that  targeted 
psychological practices and programs that were theoretically linked to Ryff’s Psychologi-
cal Well-Being (Ryff, 1989) dimensions can improve people’s eudaimonic well-being. This 
conclusion  was  however  made  based  on  pre-  and  post-  change  scores  from  intervention 
studies, with no information on what the dynamics of change looked like for each dimen-
sion of psychological well-being. The current study suggests that for various elements of 
well-being  it  may  be  more  beneficial  if  interventions  target  the  appropriate  dynamic  of 
change  for  that  element  as  it  relates  to  global  well-being.  For  example,  to  increase  posi-
tive  emotions,  meaning,  and  positive  relationships  in  people,  interventions  should  target 

1 3 
2469

increasing within-person average levels of these momentary experiences. However, for the 
accomplishment element, interventions should focus on decreases in extreme fluctuations 
in these experiences, perhaps by keeping people’s sense of achievement and success at a 
steady level. Thus, as a next step to this recent meta-analysis on effectiveness of psycholog-
ical well-being interventions (van Dierendonck & Lam, 2022), future research can examine 
daily dynamic change as a result of well-being interventions to ultimately inform psycho-
logical practices that are most effective in enhancing people’s daily experiences of a good 
life.

17   Conclusion

To  our  knowledge,  this  research  is  the  first  to  study  the  factor  structure  of  momentary 
assessments  of  the  PERMA  building  blocks  to  be  used  in  EMA  studies  of  well-being, 
while highlighting the importance of the dynamics of daily experiences of these building 
blocks in relation to global hedonic and eudaimonic assessments. This study also continues 
the conversation around the validity of PERMA in relation to other well-being measures, 
as presented in the Journal of Positive Psychology debate between Goodman et al. (2018) 
and Seligman (2018) followed by Donaldson et al. (2020).

With the advancements that this study and the mPERMA measure has made in the sci-
entific study of well-being in ecologically valid ways, we hope that the path is paved for 
the positive psychology scientific community to supplement global measurements of well-
being with more contextualized and experiential examinations of this multiplex construct. 
With this, we hope that a fuller understanding of well-being as it is lived in everyday life is 
achieved.
