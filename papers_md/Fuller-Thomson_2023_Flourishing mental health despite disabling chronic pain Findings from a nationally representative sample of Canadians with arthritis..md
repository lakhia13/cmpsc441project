Abstract

This study aims to determine the prevalence of, and factors associated with, the “absence
of psychiatric disorders” (APD) and “complete mental health” (CMH) among individuals
with arthritis who report disabling chronic pain. There are three aspects of CMH: a) APD;
b) happiness and/or life satisfaction in the past month on a daily or almost daily basis, and
c) high levels of psychological and social well-being. A secondary analysis of a nationally
representative sample (n = 620) of individuals with arthritis who report chronic and debili-
tating pain was conducted. Data were drawn from the Canadian Community Health Sur-
vey-Mental Health. The results of this study indicate that many people with arthritis who
are living with disabling chronic pain are free of psychiatric disorders (76%) and are in
CMH (56%). Factors associated with higher odds of APD and CMH among the sample
include having a confidant, being free from insomnia, and having no lifetime history of
major depressive disorder and/or generalized anxiety disorder. White respondents were
almost 3-fold more likely to be in a state of CMH compared to racialized individuals.
Respondents in the top 50% of household incomes were almost 4-fold more likely to be
APD compared to the lowest 10%. In conclusion, many individuals with arthritis have
excellent mental health despite disabling pain. Clinicians should be attuned to the mental
health of their patients, with particular focus on those who may be more vulnerable to
adverse mental health outcomes, such as racialized individuals, those in impoverished
households, and those who lack social support.

Introduction

Mental health problems, such as mood, anxiety disorders, suicidality, and substance use disor-
ders have been linked to arthritis in many previous studies [1–4]. The prevalence of major
depression among those with arthritis ranges from approximately 10% in representative com-
munity samples [1,5] to 40% in clinical samples of those with rheumatoid arthritis [6,7].

Flourishing mental health despite disabling chronic pain

Psychological well-being is lower in those with arthritis than those without, particularly in the
context of disabling pain [8].

In the general population, chronic pain and functional limitations are both associated with
poorer mental health and well-being [9–11]. In the context of arthritis, pain is often not suffi-
ciently managed [12,13]. Chronic pain related to arthritis can undermine mental health.
Among those with arthritis, chronic pain that limits most activities doubles the odds of depres-
sion in comparison to those whose pain does not limit activities [5]. Individuals with arthritis
who have chronic pain experience slower remission from depression in comparison to those
with arthritis whose pain is not chronic [14].

Research on mental health among individuals with arthritis has largely focused on mental

illness [15,16]. In a paradigm shift, the current research moves away from a deficit-focused
approach to mental health among individuals with arthritis, and instead uses a strengths-based
perspective to explore factors associated with resilience in individuals with arthritis who are
experiencing chronic and disabling pain. Resilience is defined as “a positive adaptation after
stressful situations and it represents mechanisms of coping and rising above difficult experi-
ences i.e. . .resists the negative impact of stressors” (P. S.226) In the current study, the authors
suggest that individuals who manage to retain excellent mental health despite chronic and dis-
abling pain are demonstrating resilience. For the operationalization of excellent mental health,
we draw upon Keyes’ measure of mental flourishing, known as “complete mental health”
(CMH) [17]. CMH encapsulates a more holistic view of mental health, combining the absence
of psychiatric disorder with the presence of mental well-being. The model of CMH utilized in
the current study is comprised of three components: 1) the absence of psychiatric disorders
(e.g., depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, suicidality, and drug or alcohol dependence); 2) the
presence of emotional well-being and high levels of psycho-social functioning; and 3) high lev-
els of happiness and/or life satisfaction.

The current research has two objectives: 1) to determine the prevalence of “absence of psy-

chiatric disorders” (APD) and CMH among individuals with arthritis who are experiencing
disabling chronic pain; and 2) to identify factors associated with APD and CMH among those
with arthritis who are in debilitating pain.

We are particularly interested in whether these positive mental health outcomes are less
common among racialized individuals and those living in poverty. There is a large literature
on physical health inequities among those with arthritis indicating that racialized individuals
with arthritis have greater pain severity and higher levels of disability than their white peers
[18], and those with lower socioeconomic status have worse outcomes and greater disabilities
than the more affluent [19]. Furthermore, many studies have highlighted inequities in mental
health among racialized and low-income individuals, largely due to less access to mental health
services and poorer quality of mental health care [20,21]. Our research will help establish if
mental health inequities are also apparent when the sample is restricted to those arthritis
patients with disabling pain.

Methods

The current study was undertaken using nationally representative data from the 2012 Cana-
dian Community Health Survey—Mental Health (CCHS-MH), and has been described fully
elsewhere [22,23]. The target population of the CCHS-MH includes 97% of the population
who are over the age of 15 and reside in the 10 Canadian provinces. The response rate was
68.9% nationally [24]. The analysis reported here was a secondary data analysis of a public use
data set which had been stripped of any individual identifiable information and therefore the
University of Toronto Ethics Board did not require the authors to submit this study through

the research ethics review process. The original ethics procedure was conducted by Statistics
Canada, the Canadian equivalent of the US Census Bureau. Informed consent was obtained by
Statistics Canada either by telephone or in-person depending on the mode of data gathering
(approximately 86% of the interviews were in-person).

Sample

A sub-sample of the full CCHS-MS dataset was restricted to those with arthritis who reported
debilitating chronic pain. Persons under age 18 and those with missing data on arthritis,
chronic pain or any of the other variables used in the fully adjusted model were excluded from
the analysis. The final sample size was 620 respondents.

Measures

Arthritis. Participants were asked if they had been diagnosed with arthritis by a health

care professional.

Debilitating chronic pain. Participants were asked two questions: 1) “Are you usually
free of pain or discomfort” (no/yes); and 2) “How many activities does your pain or discomfort
prevent?” (none, a few, some, most). Those who reported no to question 1 and ‘most’ to ques-
tion 2 were defined as having debilitating chronic pain.

Outcome variable. Two different outcome measures were evaluated; (a) APD in the past
year was based on no suicidal ideation in the past year nor depressive episode, anxiety disor-
ders, bipolar disorders, nor alcohol or drug dependence including cannabis and other drugs.
World Health Organization’s version of the Composite International Advances in Preventive
Medicine Diagnostic Interview (WHO-CIDI), a structured diagnostic interview that generates
past-year diagnosis according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders,
Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) and the international Classification of Disease (ICD-10) was used to
derive these variables. Finally, (b) CMH, measured as a binary variable, consisted of three
parts: (1) the absence of psychiatric disorders in the past year, as was described above; (2) emo-
tional wellbeing (i.e., life satisfaction and/or happiness), and (3) social and psychological well-
being. The latter two were assessed using the Mental Health Continuum—Short Form
(MHC-SF) [24]. The MHC-SF examines positive mental health using 14-items that assesses
psychological well-being (e.g., during the past month, how often did you feel that you liked
most parts of your personality?), emotional well-being (e.g., during the past month, how often
did you feel: happy and/or satisfied with your own life?), and social well-being (e.g., during the
past month, how often did you feel that you had something important to contribute to soci-
ety?) [24,25]. The MHC-SF has well established psychometric properties [25]. Respondents
were categorized as being in CMH if they stated at least 1 of the 2 measures of emotional well-
being (i.e., happiness and/or life satisfaction in past year) and a minimum of 6 of the 11 mea-
sures of psychological and/or social wellbeing “every day” or “almost every day” during the
past month in tandem with the absence of any of the above listed forms of mental illness in the
past year. Additional information can be found at Statistics Canada [24]. Our version was
slightly modified by removal of one-question from the original 14-item instrument. The origi-
nal version had included the question “interested in life?” in addition to “happy” and “satisfied
with life” in the “emotional well-being” category. We felt that it was possible to be interested in
life without being in optimal mental health and therefore removed it from the measure which
resulted in the instrument having only 13 items now. Furthermore, in a previous study of the
psychometric properties of the MHC-SF, ‘‘interest in life” had markedly lower factor loading
on emotional well-being than either ‘‘happy” or ‘‘satisfaction with life” [25]. The internal con-
sistency (Cronbach’s alpha) for the 13-items was high (0.89).

Socio-demographic variables. Participants were asked about their sex (male versus

female), self-reported race (Non-Aboriginal white versus racialized and/or Aboriginal), age (in
decades), and socioeconomic position (SEP). SEP was calculated based on the highest level of
education completed (less than high school, high school, some post-secondary school, post
secondary). In line with Statistics Canada’s measure of household income, this study used a
ratio associated with the national low-income cut-off, which takes into account the quantity of
people who reside in a home and the size of the neighbourhood (lowest 10% 11–50%; top 50%
of household income). Due to confidentiality issues, the CCHS-MH does not release informa-
tion on specific race/ethnicities.

Social support. Participants were asked about their marital status and having an advisor/

confidant available for critical life decisions and situations. Marital status was measured
according to the following two categories: Married/common-law versus divorced/widowed/
never married. Having a confidant available for critical life decisions and experiences was
ascertained using those who agreed or strongly agreed to the statement “There is someone I
could talk to about important decisions in my life.”

Adverse childhood experiences. Two adverse childhood experiences were investigated.
Childhood Sexual Abuse (CSA) was measured by the questions “How many times did an adult
force you or attempt to force you into any unwanted sexual activity, by threatening you, hold-
ing you down or hurting you in some way?" (never vs ever). Childhood Physical Abuse (CPA)
was assessed by asking respondents if an “adult had slapped them on the face, head or ears, or
hit or spanked them with something hard to hurt them at least three times and/or pushed,
grabbed, shoved or threw something at them to hurt them at least three times and/or an adult
had at least once kicked, bit, punch, choked, burned, or physically attacked them.”

Lifetime mental health factors. Participants were asked about lifetime mental health
diagnoses include anxiety and depression. Individuals were categorized as having an anxiety
disorder if they met the WHO-CIDI criteria for Generalized Anxiety Disorder at some point
in their lives. Respondents who met the criteria for lifetime Generalized Anxiety Disorder
reported “1) excessive anxiety and worry and anxiety about at least two different events or
activities that lasted at least six months; 2) finding it difficult to control the worry; 3) the anxi-
ety and the worry were associated with three or more of the symptoms associated with anxiety;
4) the focus of the anxiety and worry was not confined to features of an Axis 1 disorder; and 5)
the anxiety, worry, or physical symptoms caused clinically significant distress or significant
impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning” [24].

Respondents were categorized as having a depressive disorder if they met the WHO-CIDI
lifetime criteria for Major Depressive Episode. “Respondents who meet the criteria reported:
1) two weeks or longer of depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure and at least five symp-
toms associated with depression which represent a change in functioning; 2) that symptoms
cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational or other important
areas of functioning; and 3) that symptoms are not better accounted for by bereavement or
symptoms last more than two months or the symptoms are characterised by a marked func-
tional impairment, preoccupation with worthlessness, suicidal ideation, or psychomotor retar-
dation.” [24]. The WHO-CIDI has strong psychometric properties and excellent validity and
reliability [26].

Lifetime substance dependence. Participants were asked about lifetime alcohol and/or
drug dependence based upon WHO-CIDI scales. To be defined as substance dependent the
respondent must report a minimum of three of the following symptoms: tolerance, with-
drawal, increased consumption, attempts to quit, time lost, reduced activities, continued
drinking and “2) a maladaptive pattern of alcohol use as manifested by three (or more) symp-
toms occurring at any time in the same 12-month period” [24].

Statistical analyses

Frequencies were provided for both outcome variables (i.e., APD and CMH) and all the char-
acteristics described above. Two sets of bivariate analyses were conducted using chi-square
tests for categorical variable (e.g., sex, ethnicity) and independent t-tests for continuous vari-
ables (e.g., age) The first set of crosstabs examined each variable by APD status, and the second
set of bivariate analyses compared each characteristic by CMH status. Two logistic regression
analyses were conducted, one with APD as the outcome and one with CMH as the outcome.
All the variables described above were included in each logistic regression analysis.

Because the CCHS-MH uses a multi-stage sampling design, sample weights that were cre-
ated by Statistics Canada were needed to take into account the unequal probability of selection
of respondents in different provinces and the potential bias due to nonresponse. All preva-
lences and odds ratios are based on weighted data in order for the sample to be representative
of community dwelling adults in Canada. This weighting variable was then rescaled to a mean
of 1 for this sample, which is the standardized technique of normalizing weights so as to avoid
falsely narrowing the confidence interval. Sample sizes are presented in their unweighted
form.

Results

Table 1 presents the profile and prevalence of respondents with no mental illness in the past
year and prevalence of complete mental health in the past month by sociodemographic and
life history characteristics in a sample of Canadians with arthritis who reported chronic and
debilitating pain (n = 620). Three-quarters (76%) of those with arthritis and disabling chronic
pain were APD and more than half (55.6%) were in CMH.

The mean age of those in APD was 62.4 (SD = 12.8), which was significantly higher than
those who were not in APD (54.7; SD = 12.8; p < .001). The mean age of those in CMH (61.9;
SD = 12.8) was significantly higher than those who were not in CMH (58.9; SD = 13.7;
p = 0.005) As shown in Table 1, the prevalence of both APD and CMH was significantly higher
for married individuals (79.7% vs 71.1%, p < 0.05, and 62.1% vs 46.8%, p < 0.001, respec-
tively), white respondents compared to racialized respondents (80.1% vs 51.1%, p < 0.001, and
60.3% vs 27.3%, p < 0.001), those with higher income (86.0% vs 59.3%, p < 0.001, and 68.4%
vs 39.6%, p < 0.001) and those with no history of childhood physical (84.9% vs 60.3%,
p < 0.001, and 43.0% vs 63.0%, p < 0.001) or sexual abuse (81.5% vs 44.3%, p < 0.001, and
60.0% vs 31.6%, p < 0.001). The prevalence of both APD and CMH was also higher among
those who self-reported never to sometimes having sleep problems compared to those who
self-reported most of the time having sleep problems (89.7% vs 59.4%, p < 0.001, and 70.4% vs
37.7%, p < 0.001) and having a confidant compared to not having a confidant (81.6% vs
23.3%, p < 0.001, and 60.3% vs 8.3%, p < 0.001). Those without a post-secondary degree were
more likely to be APD than those with a post-secondary degree (80.5% vs 71. 60%; p < 0.01).
A similar trend for education was evident with respect with CMH but it failed to reach statisti-
cal significance, p < .10).

Table 2 provides the results of two logistic regression models examining the odds and 95%
confidence intervals (CI) of 1) being free of psychiatric disorders in the past year and 2) achiev-
ing complete mental health in the past month in a sample of Canadians with arthritis who
reported chronic and debilitating pain. The odds of APD were more than 3-fold higher in indi-
viduals in the top 50% of household incomes (OR = 3.67, CI = 1.55, 8.68), and more than dou-
ble among those whose income was between 10% and 49% (OR = 2.84, CI = 1.27, 6.36),
compared to those in the lowest 10% of household incomes.

Those in the highest 50% of household incomes were 77% more likely to be in a state of
CMH compared to those in the lowest 10% of household incomes. White respondents were
more than twice as likely to be in CMH (OR = 2.83, CI = 1.48, 5.41) compared to racialized
respondents. Individuals with a confidant were more than 5-fold more likely to be APD
(OR = 5.81, CI = 2.36, 14.26) and in CMH (OR = 6.10, CI = 2.10, 17.74) than those without at
least one confidant. Individuals without sleep problems were more than twice as likely to be in
APD (OR = 3.31, CI = 1.76, 6.21) and in CMH (OR = 2.32, CI = 1.55, 3.47). Individuals who
never previously had an episode of major depressive disorder were much more likely to be
APD (OR = 18.43, CI = 9.10, 37.31) and in CMH (OR = 8.12, CI = 4.44, 14.94) than those who
had ever had depression. Similarly, individuals without a lifetime episode of generalized anxi-
ety were more than 16-fold more likely to be APD (OR = 16.64, CI = 8.40, 32.97) and more
than twice as likely to be in CMH (OR = 2.70, CI = 1.60, 4.55) compared to those without a his-
tory of anxiety.

Discussion

The findings of this study indicate a high level of resilience among a nationally representative
sample of Canadians with arthritis who reported that most of their activities were restricted
due to pain. Fully three quarters of the sample were free of psychiatric disorders in the past
year, including depression, generalized anxiety disorders, bipolar disorders, serious suicidal
thoughts, and substance dependence, despite their debilitating pain. More than half (56%)
went beyond just being free of psychiatric disorders to achieving complete mental health,
which is indicative of happiness and/or life satisfaction in addition to psychological and social
well-being. These findings bring a hopeful message to those living with disabling pain and
arthritis and their families as well as to clinicians addressing their physical and mental health
care needs.

The resiliency observed among in the current study may not be unique to those with arthri-

tis. In another nationally representative Canadian survey of community dwelling adults, 57%
of individuals with chronic and disabling pain due to any health condition were in complete

PLOS ONEFlourishing mental health despite disabling chronic pain

mental health [27]. This suggests that those with arthritis and chronic and disabling pain have
comparable levels of CMH to other Canadians who have chronic and disabling pain due to
other health conditions.

On a less positive note, our findings indicate that those living in the poorest households and

racialized respondents have a lower prevalence of APD or CMH than their white and more
affluent peers. The magnitude of these health inequities is substantial. The observed negative
association between poverty and both APD and CMH exists despite the universal healthcare
system in Canada that is available to support patients’ arthritis-related needs, as well as their
mental health problems. This suggests that socioeconomic disadvantage may be playing a role
through other avenues than solely health care access. For example, individuals with debilitating
pain who do not have the financial circumstances to pay for helpful goods and services (e.g.,
massages, grocery delivery), may struggle more with their arthritis related disabilities. There is
a robust association in the literature between low socioeconomic status and severe depressive
illness [28]. Poverty, as a result of economic pressures like unemployment and a lack of afford-
able housing, is more likely to precede serious mental illness like depression and anxiety, oper-
ating through lack of opportunity, a reduction in the availability and accessibility of resources,
and a higher risk of encountering adversity [29].

White respondents with arthritis in our study were much more likely than racialized
respondents to be in a state of both APD and CMH in the bivariate analyses, despite the fact
that the whole sample reported that most of their activities were restricted because of pain.
These findings are in contrast with Keyes [30] study in the general population that found that
while black individuals tend to report lower levels of psychological well-being on measures of
life satisfaction and happiness [31], they report higher levels of CMH than white people. The
literature is in broad agreement that social contextual factors that reflect exposure to chronic
and acute stressors (e.g., racial discrimination) may play an important role in shaping mental
flourishing [32]. When we took into account household income and other characteristics, the
relationship between racialized status and APD was no longer statistically significant, suggest-
ing disadvantaged financial position, which is more prevalent among racialized individuals,
may be somewhat confounding the relationship. However, it is important to note that white
respondents still had almost triple the odds of CMH (p < .001) even when household income
and other factors were included in the analysis.

It is informative to compare our findings on racial differences to another Canadian study of

adults with some pain, attributable to any chronic condition including but not restricted to
arthritis. In Gilmour’s [27] study all levels of pain were considered (i.e., mild, moderate, and
severe) and individuals who were included whether or not their activities were restricted by
pain. In contrast to the large racial disparities in flourishing observed in our study, Gilmour’s
[27] study did not find significant racial differences in the odds of flourishing mental health.
This suggests that racial differences may be more pronounced among those with the most dis-
abling pain and/or among those with arthritis as opposed to those with other chronic condi-
tions. Further research is needed to provide insight into potential causes of racial discrepancies
in flourishing among those with arthritis who are experiencing chronic and disabling pain.

Those with a confidant were more likely to be in both APD and CMH compared to those
without a confidant. Confidants are an important source of emotional and instrumental sup-
port to help promote and maintain positive mental health outcomes [33]. Older adults who
have at least one confidant are less likely to be lonely [34,35]. Furthermore, having a confidant
is associated with a wide range of other positive outcomes including fewer physician visits
[36], enhanced immunological functioning [37], and reduced stress [38]. Although the exact
mechanisms by which a confidant supports mental health are not fully understood, it is

thought that a the provision of emotional support can help enhance self-esteem and help the
individual buffer general stress [39,40].

Consistent with earlier studies [10], this study found sleep problems to be negatively associ-

ated with CMH and APD. This underscores the importance of health professionals asking
about sleep problems, particularly as chronic pain can undermine the quality of sleep [41].
Among individuals with chronic pain, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has been shown to
significantly reduce insomnia [42]. CBT is an already established effective and relatively rapid
treatment for depression and anxiety in the general population [43] and among those with
chronic pain [44].

Those without a lifetime history of major depressive disorder and/or generalized anxiety
disorder had a substantially higher prevalence of APD and CMH than those with a lifetime his-
tory of either disorder. This suggests the need to provide effective treatment. In addition to
CBT, other interventions that are promising to deal with mental health issues among individu-
als experiencing chronic pain, includes operant-behavioral therapy [45], mindfulness-based
stress reduction [46], acceptance and commitment therapy [47], and motivational interview-
ing [48]. In a systematic review and meta-analysis, Knittle, Maes [49] found that self-regulation
psychological therapies significantly improved depressive symptoms and anxiety among indi-
viduals with rheumatoid arthritis and chronic pain. Technology is also being leveraged to
deliver interventions to individuals experiencing chronic pain with encouraging results. Text
message-based social support was found to reduce pain perception and interference, and to
increase positive affect [50], while web-based mindfulness has been shown to increase life satis-
faction [51]. Text- and web-based interventions offer the prospect of improved access to care
among individuals experiencing chronic pain.

There are several limitations to this study which should be considered carefully when
reviewing the current findings. First, multiple factors that could influence the findings were
not controlled for due to these variables not being included in the CCHS-MH. These include
the type of arthritis (e.g., osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis), age of onset of arthritis, and
how long participants have been coping with arthritis and chronic pain. Any current or past
treatments undergone for arthritis or for mental health problems were not available to be ana-
lyzed. Future research should include the type, severity, and duration of arthritis while examin-
ing their influences on CMH. It would also be beneficial to have chart reviews [52] rather than
self-report of a medical diagnosis of arthritis. Another limitation is the cross-sectional design
of the study, not allowing for causal inferences to be made. Given the bidirectional relationship
between chronic pain and mental illness [53], it would be beneficial for future longitudinal
studies to examine the relationship between chronic pain and mental health outcomes among
those with arthritis to better understand the direction of the relationship. Finally, the
CCHS-MH does not provide information on specific race/ethnicities. As a result, we were
unable to examine differences in APD and CMH among different ethnicities, beyond compar-
ing racialized respondents with white respondents. There are substantial differences in experi-
ences across racial/ethnic categories that may be homogenized by a binary race/ethnicity
variable. Future research should examine how disparities in mental health outcomes may vary
across different groups of racialized respondents.

Despite these limitations, this study provides a strengths-based examination of the mental
health of Canadians with arthritis who are in disabling pain using a nationally representative
sample. Approximately three quarters of individuals with arthritis who are in chronic and dis-
abling pain, are in APD and more than half of these individuals are in CMH, which demon-
strates substantial resiliency in the population. Social support is a particularly important factor
associated with better mental health outcomes. Those with sleep problems and a history of psy-
chiatric disorders are at a disadvantage, underlining the importance of providing appropriate

treatment for these issues. Of particular concern, impoverished and racialized respondents
were much less likely to be in APD or CMH than their more affluent and white peers suggest-
ing the well-documented health inequities observed in the physical health of those with arthri-
tis are also apparent in the mental health of disabled individuals with arthritis. In light of the
large observed differences in mental health outcomes, targeted outreach and treatment are
warranted for the most vulnerable individuals with arthritis.
