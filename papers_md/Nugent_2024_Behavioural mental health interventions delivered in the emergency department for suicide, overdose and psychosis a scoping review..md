ABSTRACT
Objective  To identify and describe evidence on brief 
emergency department (ED)- delivered behavioural and 
care process interventions among patients presenting with 
suicide attempt or acute ideation, substance overdose or 
psychosis.
Design  We employed a scoping review design and 
searched multiple data sources, clinical trial registries 
and references lists through March 2023. We included 
English- language trials and rigorously designed 
observational studies. In alignment with scoping review 
guidelines, we did not assess the quality of included 
studies or rate the strength of evidence of intervention 
effectiveness.
Population  Our population of interest was adults 
presenting to the ED with suicidality (eg, attempt or acute 
ideation), any substance overdose or acute psychosis from 
a primary mental health condition.
Intervention  We included studies of brief behavioural or 
care process interventions delivered in the ED.
Outcome measures  Health outcomes (eg, symptom 
reduction), healthcare utilisation and harms.
Results  Our search identified 2034 potentially relevant 
articles. We included 40 studies: 3 systematic reviews 
and 39 primary studies. Most studies (n=34) examined 
ED interventions in patients with suicide attempt 
or suicidal ideation, while eight studies examined 
interventions in patients with opioid overdose. No 
studies examined ED interventions in patients with acute 
psychosis. Most suicide prevention studies reported 
that brief psychological, psychosocial or screening and 
triage interventions reduce suicide and suicide attempt 
following an ED visit. Most clinical trial interventions 
were multicomponent and included at least one follow- 
up. All substance overdose studies focused on opioids. 
These studies often contained medication and referral 
or consultation components. Multiple studies reported 
increases in substance use disorder treatment utilisation; 
evidence on repeat overdose events was limited.
Conclusions  A wide range of multicomponent ED- 
delivered behavioural health interventions for suicidality 
and opioid use disorder show short- term improvement 
on primary outcomes such as suicide reattempt. Few 
studies on non- opioid substances and psychosis are 
available.

STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS OF THIS STUDY
 ⇒ This  scoping  review  summarises  behavioural  and 
care process emergency department (ED) interven-
tions for acute mental health events not covered in 
previous systematic or scoping reviews.

 ⇒ This  scoping  review  updates  evidence  summaries 
on brief ED suicide interventions from outdated sys-
tematic reviews.

 ⇒ Practising ED clinicians guided the research ques-
tions so that this review could inform ongoing care 
improvement.

 ⇒ The  broad  range  of  populations,  interventions  and 
outcomes  included  in  this  scoping  review  allows 
us  to  identify  opportunities  for  targeted  systemat-
ic  reviews  and  knowledge  gaps  for  future  primary 
studies.

 ⇒ The  scoping  review  design  did  not  include  risk  of 
bias  assessment,  preventing  us  from  synthesising 
the reported effectiveness of relevant interventions.

BACKGROUND
Suicide  and  substance  overdose  are  major 
public  health  concerns,1  2  for  which  care 
from  the  emergency  department  (ED)  is 
frequently sought. As of 2020, a mental health 
emergency was among the ten most common 
reason for an ED visit in the USA.3 In 2022, 
the  rates  of  non- fatal  overdose  presenting 
the ED were 180 per 100 000 and the rate of 
suicidal  ideation  was  400  per  100  000.4  5  In 
addition  to  suicide  and  substance  overdose, 
psychosis is an acute mental health event for 
which emergency services are often needed.6 
The ED is a critical healthcare touchpoint for 
individuals  experiencing  these  events,  and 
for some, it serves as their initial contact with 
healthcare services.

Discharge from the ED following an acute 
mental  health  event  is  considered  a  high- 
risk  period  during  which  symptoms  may 
reemerge.7  To  limit  this  risk  assessment, 
brief  screening  and/or  referral  interven-
tions  delivered  or  initiated  in  the  ED  are

used  to  more  effectively  link  individuals  from  inpatient 
to outpatient services.8 9 Given the high priority of suicide 
prevention and substance use disorder (SUD) treatment 
in  many  health  systems,  including  the  US  Department 
of  Veterans  Affairs  (VA),10  11  and  the  dire  public  health 
need to provide both medical and mental health services 
in  the  ED  context,  we  aimed  to  identify  and  describe 
available  evidence  on  brief  ED- delivered  interventions 
among patients presenting with suicide attempt or acute 
ideation, substance overdose or psychosis. Because there 
is a large and methodologically complex evidence based 
on  this  topic  and  a  need  to  understand  the  landscape 
of  emergency  behavioural  health,  we  chose  to  conduct 
a  scoping  review  that  could  identify  opportunities  for 
targeted systematic reviews, as well as knowledge gaps to 
be addressed with future research efforts.

METHODS
This  review  is  derived  from  a  report  produced  by  the 
VA Evidence Synthesis Programme that was intended to 
inform VA policy- making in the area of emergency medi-
cine.12 The following questions, which were developed in 
consultation with a panel of clinicians and researchers in 
emergency medicine and mental health, were the focus 
of the review:
1.  What  studies  have  examined  the  effectiveness  and 
harms of ED and urgent care centre screening, referral 
and  management  interventions  for  adults  with  acute 
mental  health  events  (eg,  suicidality,  substance  over-
dose or psychosis)?

2.  What  patient  factors  (eg,  demographics,  comorbidi-
ties, symptom severity), intervention features (eg, mo-
dality, duration, family involvement), or ED and urgent 
care centre setting characteristics have been identified 
as moderators of intervention effectiveness?
As a scoping review, the review protocol was not regis-
tered. We followed Preferred Reporting Items for System-
atic  Reviews  and  Meta- Analyses  Extension  for  Scoping 
Reviews guidelines (see online supplemental table S1) for 
a checklist of reporting items.

Patient and public involvement
No  patients  or  members  of  the  public  were  involved  in 
the conception or completion of this review.

Study eligibility criteria
We included studies enrolling adults presenting to the ED 
or urgent care centre with suicidality (ie, attempt or acute 
ideation),  substance  overdose  (opioids,  alcohol,  meth-
amphetamine,  kratom  or  benzodiazepines),  or  acute 
psychotic symptoms for conditions which psychosis which 
was  primary  diagnosis  and  was  not  secondary  or  due  to 
another  medical  condition  or  medication.  We  included 
brief mental health intervention that included screening 
or  risk  assessment;  triage;  referral  to  inpatient,  residen-
tial  or  outpatient  settings;  behavioural  interventions 
(eg,  safety  planning,  lethal  means  counselling,  caring 

2

in  outpatient,  residential  or 

contacts); or treatment of agitation related to substance 
withdrawal.  Included  studies  must  have  reported  on 
inpatient 
engagement 
mental  healthcare;  severity  of  acute  symptoms  (suicid-
ality, severity of psychosis, etc); ED or urgent care centre 
outcomes (eg, boarding times, ED utilisation), patient or 
staff safety outcomes (eg, self- directed violence attempts 
in  ED)  or  adverse  events  or  harms  of  interventions.  We 
included studies of randomised clinical trials and obser-
vational  research  which  examined  the  aforementioned 
interventions and outcomes.

Legal hold interventions, medication comparative effec-
tiveness trials, primary medical interventions and cardio-
pulmonary  stabilisation  (eg,  airway  management),  and 
critical  care  management  of  use  of  reversal  agents  (eg, 
naltrexone) were excluded because they were outside the 
scope of this behavioural and care process focused review.

Data sources and searches
To identify articles relevant to the key questions, a research 
librarian  searched  Ovid  MEDLINE,  Ovid  PsycINFO, 
CINAHL  and   ClinicalTrials. gov,  as  well  as  Agency  for 
Healthcare  Research  and  Quality,  Cochrane  Database 
of  Systematic  Reviews  and  Health  Services  Research 
and  Development  databases  through  March  2023  using 
terms for emergency department, suicide, overdose and 
psychosis (see online supplemental table S2 for complete 
search strategies). We limited the search to published and 
indexed articles involving human subjects available in the 
English  language.  We  limited  the  search  of  systematic 
reviews within the last 7 years, while the primary literature 
was  unlimited  by  publication  date.  Study  selection  was 
based  on  the  eligibility  criteria  described  above.  Titles, 
abstracts and full- text articles were reviewed by one inves-
tigator and checked by another.

Data abstraction and synthesis
All data abstraction was first completed by one reviewer 
and  then  checked  by  another;  disagreements  were 
resolved by consensus or discussion with a third reviewer. 
We used a standardised format to abstract relevant data, 
including  details  on  the  study  population  (ie,  mental 
health  condition,  treatment  setting,  timing  and  demo-
graphics),  intervention  (ie,  description  of  experimental 
practice, mode of delivery and interventionist/provider), 
comparator  and  outcomes  (ie,  description  of  outcomes 
reported  and  results  for  studies  with  comparators). 
Because  we  did  not  synthesise  the  findings  of  included 
studies,  studies  were  not  assessed  for  risks  of  bias.  We 
analysed  evidence  narratively  and  in  tables,  describing 
patterns in available evidence and knowledge gaps to be 
filled by future research.

preventing a repeat suicide within 12 
months (N=5319; pooled RR=0.83, 
95% CI (0.71 to 0.97)). However, the

interventions on preventing a repetition 
of suicidal behaviour remain unclear.
Brief psychological interventions 
appear to be effective in reducing 
suicide and suicide attempts. It is 
unclear to what extent the effect is due 
to specific psychological techniques/ 
components or to more frequent 
contacts.

Literature overview
Our  search  identified  2042  potentially  relevant  arti-
cles.  We  included  42  studies:  3  systematic  reviews  and 
39  primary  studies.  Most  studies  (N=34)  examined  ED 
interventions in patients with suicide attempt or suicidal 
ideation,  while  eight  studies  examined  interventions  in 
patients  with  opioid  overdose.  No  studies  examined  ED 
behavioural or care process interventions in patients with 
acute psychosis. We identified six underway studies: four 
in patients with suicide attempt or suicidal ideation, one 
in patients with opioid dependence and one in patients 
with psychosis.

Suicide
We  identified  three  systematic  reviews  that  examined 
interventions  among  patients  admitted  to  the  ED 
following  a  suicide  attempt  (table  1).  The  first  review 
examined the effects of interventions aimed at preventing 
repeat  suicidal  behaviour.13  This  meta- analysis  included 
24  randomised  controlled  trials  (RCTs)  and  found  that 
active  contact  and  follow- up  interventions  (ie,  attempts 
by providers to stay in contact with patients after ED visits 
through home visits, telephone calls, postcards or letters) 
were  effective  in  preventing  a  repeat  suicide  within  12 

months (N=5319; pooled risk ratio (RR) = 0.83, 95% CI 
(0.71 to 0.97)). However, the effect did not appear to be 
maintained  at  24  months  (N=925;  pooled  RR=0.98,  95 
CI  (0.76  to  1.22)),  although  considerably  fewer  studies 
followed patients to this time point.

Another  systematic  review  more  broadly  examined 
the  effectiveness  of  brief  psychological  interventions 
delivered  in  the  ED  in  reducing  suicidal  thoughts  and 
behaviour.14 This review defined brief interventions as ‘up 
to three sessions delivered in or soon after the presenting 
episode which can be supplemented by further follow- up 
contact’, and included two RCTs, one pilot RCT and one 
quasi- experimental  study.  The  authors  concluded  that 
brief psychological interventions appear to be effective in 
reducing suicide and suicide attempt, though they could 
not determine the number of sessions or interventional 
components  that  were  most  effective.  An  additional 
review15 that, in part, investigated whether risk assessment 
tools can identify patients who are safe to be discharged, 
concluded that risk assessment tools should not be used 
in isolation but instead in conjunction with clinical judge-
ment,  communication  with  the  patient  and  their  family

and  awareness  of  community  context  (eg,  availability  of 
postdischarge care resources).

We also identified 10 RCTs of interventions delivered or 
initiated in the ED to reduce suicide attempts and other 
related  outcomes  among  those  who  presented  with  a 
suicide attempt (tables 2 and 3).16–26 Across most studies, 
interventions were multicomponent, consisting of assess-
ment  and/or  intervention  and  follow- up.  Interventions 
included a single- session web- based lethal means counsel-
ling decision aid focused on reducing access to firearms 
and medications,18 safety planning in the ED with a peer 
recovery specialist,26 a single telemedicine mental health 
consultation  for  risk  stratification  and  connection  to 
services,27 a single telephone contact by a trained psychi-
atrist,25 a 10- session cognitive–behavioural therapy (CBT) 
intervention,19 a 6- session CBT intervention,24 a 6- session 
abandonment  psychotherapy  programme  with  an  anti-
depressant  medication  protocol,17  mobile  crisis  team 
assessment  and  triage,20  5  structured  consultations  with 
the patient’s general practitioner,22 a single brief informa-
tion session followed by telephone follow- up21 and 3 brief 
therapy sessions followed by regular personalised letters 
over  24  months.23  Interventions  with  a  postdischarge 
component  varied  greatly  in  timing,  delivering  this 
component at 48 hours20 or 24 months23 after discharge. 
Nine17–25  out  of  10  RCTs  compared  intervention  effec-
tiveness to that of usual care, while the remaining RCTs 
compared  safety  planning  with  a  peer  specialist  to 
safety  planning  with  an  ED  clinician.26  Of  the  six  trials 
that  examined  suicide  reattempt,  which  was  the  most 
common  primary  outcome  assessed,  five  found  a  treat-
ment  effect19  21  23–25  and  the  other  found  no  difference 
between  the  intervention  and  treatment  as  usual  (see 
tables 2 and 3).17 Treatment effect on suicide reattempt 
over time were mixed: one study24 no longer detected a 
difference at 12 months, while another19 still detected an 
effect at 18 months. Additional outcomes assessed across 
the studies were related to healthcare utilisation (eg, ED 
readmission  and  mental  health  consultation),  symptom 
severity (eg, depression) and feasibility (table 2).

Finally, we identified 21 relevant observational studies 
(online  supplemental  table  S3).  Two  larger  compara-
tive  cohort  studies  measuring  the  same  outcomes,  and 
with  similar  findings,  are  notable.  The  first28  (N=1376) 
consisted  of  a  universal  suicide  risk  screening,  coupled 
with  provision  of  resources  and  post- ED  telephone  calls 
delivered  by  a  physician  or  psychologist,  and  found  a 
reduction  in  suicide  attempts  at  1- month  postinterven-
tion compared with usual care (12% vs 22%, p=0.03). The 
second  study,29  which  included  1640  Veterans  and  was 
composed of a safety planning behavioural intervention 
in  the  ED  with  2  follow- up  monitoring  calls  completed 
by social workers or psychologists, also found a reduction 
in  suicidal  behaviour  over  6  months  (OR=0.56,  95%  CI 
(0.33 to 0.95), p=0.03)

Among  the  observational  studies,  there  were  many 
different  interventions  tested  (see  online  supplemental 
table S3). Although some consisted of a single encounter 

4

such  as  a  psychiatry  ED  consultation,29–32  psychosocial 
assessment32  or  observation  in  the  ED  using  a  mobile 
audio- visual  device,33  most  were  more  involved  with 
multiple  telephone  or  in- person  risk  assessment  and 
service  linkage  follow- ups  over  many  months  postdis-
charge.27–30  34–44  Several  of  the  multicomponent  inter-
ventions  included  a  safety  planning  or  lethal  means 
training  component  delivered  by  trained  mental  health 
professionals.29  39  43  44  Other  examples  of  interventions 
included  brief  solution  focused  therapy38  and  a  ‘caring 
contacts’ intervention that sent personalised expressions 
of kindness over the course of 12 months postdischarge.37 
There was a large range of follow- up times from time of 
ED discharge29 to 10 years postdischarge.30 The outcomes 
assessed  across  studies  also  varied  and  included  inter-
vention  feasibility  and  acceptability,  suicide  reattempt, 
suicidal  ideation,  knowledge  of  safety  plan,  depression, 
inpatient  and  outpatient  mental  health  treatment  util-
isation  and  ED- related  outcomes  such  as  length  of  stay, 
return  to  ED  and  wait  times  (see  online  supplemental 
table S4). Across all included primary studies, harms or 
adverse events of interventions were either not reported 
or  not  assessed.  Of  note,  several  observational  studies 
were focused on Veterans.29 37 43 44

Among  the  four  underway  studies  identified  on 
ED- based  interventions  for  individuals  with  suicide 
attempt or suicidal ideation, two studies examine psycho-
therapy  or  psychosocial  interventions,  one  study  exam-
ines  a  mobile  phone  application  and  one  investigates  a 
safety  planning  intervention.  Two  of  these  studies  are 
completed with results posted to  ClinicalTrials. gov but no 
identified publication, one is completed with no posted 
or  published  results,  and  another  is  in  progress  (see 
online supplemental table S5).

Overdose
All  studies  examining  ED  interventions  for  overdose 
included  patients  with  opioid  overdose,  and  we  did  not 
find  anything  specific  to  alcohol,  methamphetamine, 
two 
benzodiazepines,  nor  cannabis.  We 
RCTs45  46  addressing  behavioural  interventions  for  this 
population.  One  2019  RCT  (N=256)45  examined  the 
effects  of  a  multicomponent  intervention  featuring  one 
brief behavioural change counselling session (using moti-
vational interviewing), overdose education, and provision 
of a naloxone kit compared with an informational flyer. 
The  second  RCT  (N=648)46  compared  ED  behavioural 
interventions  and  follow- up  care  (daily  for  10  days  and 
then weekly for 3 months) delivered by a peer recovery 
specialist to a brief ED intervention delivered by a licensed 
clinical  social  worker  (table  4).  The  2019  study45  exam-
ined  subsequent  ED  visits,  subsequent  overdose  event, 
and time to first overdose event for 12 months following 
the intervention, while the 2022 study46 measured enrol-
ment in treatment within 30 days of their ED visit. Neither 
study found significant group differences for any of the 
primary outcomes (table 5).

The remaining six studies were case series47–50 or inter-

tion component (eg, take- home naloxone,51 52 naloxone 
training,47 in- ED naloxone50 or a buprenorphine prescrip-
tion48) was common, often accompanied by a referral to

or and referral for substance use treatment.48 49 51 52 Inter-
ventions were delivered by a range of ED providers (eg,

selling  and/or  motivational  interviewing.  Commonly 
assessed  outcomes  across  observational  studies  included 
receipt  of  take- home  naloxone,  agreement  to  being 
connected to recovery support, referral to substance use 
treatment and participation in substance use treatment. 
Only one study assessed hospital admission and death.50 
Four  studies  reported  only  postintervention  outcome 
data,  while  two  included  pre–post  intervention  data51  52 
(online supplemental table S7). Of studies with pre–post 
data,  one  reported51  an  increase  in  patients  receiving 
take- home  naloxone,  consultation  with  recovery  coach, 
and discharge with referral to treatment after implemen-
tation of programme. The second52 reported an increase 
in  number  of  patients  discharged  with  naloxone  after 
implementation of the intervention while fewer patients 
received behavioural counselling or referral to treatment 
after SUD treatment programme implementation. Again, 
no  studies  reported  on  or  assessed  adverse  events  from 
the interventions.

Finally,  one  observational  study  examined  a  combina-
tion of buprenorphine and referral for substance use treat-
ment  among  individuals  who  had  co- occurring  suicidal 
ideation  and  opioid  use  disorder  (OUD),  and  found  it 
was feasible to initiate buprenorphine and have patients 
remained engaged in outpatients OUD treatment for 30 
days.31  53  A  single  underway  study  was  identified  on  an 
ED- based case management intervention with screening,

assessment  and  referral  for  opioid  dependent  patients 
presenting to the ED. This study was completed in 2020 
with results posted to  ClinicalTrials. gov but no identified 
publication (see online supplemental table S5).

Psychosis
We did not identify any eligible literature examining brief 
interventions  for  psychosis  that  were  delivered  or  initi-
ated  in  the  ED.  A  single  underway  study  was  identified, 
focusing  on  ED- based  text  messaging  to  engage  young 
people  with  psychosis  while  waiting  for  an  ED  consulta-
tion with a non- ED psychiatrist after the patient has been 
discharged from the ED. All patients were then referred 
to an early psychosis intervention programme. This study 
appears to be in progress (see online supplemental table 
S5).

Intervention effect moderators
Suicide
A single study compared intervention effects of a manu-
alised  six- session  abandonment  therapy  intervention 
delivered  by  a  nurse  to  the  same  intervention  delivered 
by  a  psychotherapist,  finding  no  significant  differences 
in rates of suicide attempt, suicidal relapse, and suicidal 
ideation  between  groups  3  months  after  the  interven-
tion.17  Both  the  nurse- delivered  and  psychotherapist- 
delivered intervention groups showed improvements on 
the aforementioned outcomes compared with treatment 
as usual (table 3). Another observational study of a four- 
session  case  management  programme  to  link  patients 
to  services  compared  completers  (defined  as  those  who 
completed  all  four  sessions)  to  non- completers  (those 
who completed fewer than four sessions) and found that 
completers  were  more  likely  to  have  decreased  suicide 
risk (65.3% vs 46.9%, Adjusted OR (AOR) 2.13 (95% CI 
1.42  to  3.20))  and  fewer  untreated  stressors  (49.8%  vs 
61.1%, AOR 0.64 (95% CI 0.43 to 0.96), but no difference

Overdose and psychosis
We did not find any studies in overdose or acute psychosis 
populations that directly examined moderation effects.

DISCUSSION
The  present  scoping  review  identified  a  wide  range  of 
behavioural and care process interventions for suicidality, 
ranging from interventions delivered only during the ED 
stay  to  more  complex,  multicomponent  interventions 
that were initiated during the ED stay and continued for 
several  visits  after  discharge.  Common  components  of 
the  interventions  included  risk  assessment,  psychiatric 

consultation,  safety  planning  and  lethal  means  counsel-
ling. Most available RCTs reported a treatment effect in 
the  form  of  decreased  rates  of  suicide  reattempt  within 
a  short  time  following  an  intervention.  There  were  also 
several  interventions  that  did  not  involve  in- person 
contact  (eg,  were  delivered  via  telephone  or  web- based 
video);  most  commonly  this  applied  to  follow- up  visits 
rather  than  the  ED- delivered  intervention  component. 
Although  outcomes  of  various  modalities  were  not 
directly compared, this flexibility in intervention delivery 
may  assist  in  reaching  a  broader  population  and  the 
ability  to  be  implemented  in  EDs  where  trained  mental 
health professionals may not be present.

Importantly,  we  also  identified  several  qualitative 
studies  that  explored  barriers  and  facilitators  to  imple-
menting  ED  suicide  prevention  interventions  including 
screening/risk  assessment,43  54  55  psychiatry  consultation 
and  referral,56  and  lethal  means  counselling.57  Across 
these  studies,  common  themes  of  successful  implemen-
tation  of  these  strategies  included  the  clinician  having 
sufficient  time  and  privacy,  the  screening  protocol  or

intervention  being  integrated  into  the  ED  workflow, 
and  the  provider  possessing  rapport  with  patients  and 
collaborating  with  colleagues.  This  final  implementa-
tion  strategy—collaboration  with  colleagues—should 
not  be  overlooked  in  its  significance,  as  lack  of  trained 
mental  health  providers  is  a  barrier  across  EDs  to  the 
provision of behavioural interventions.58 Additionally, to 
our  knowledge,  there  are  at  least  three  prior  systematic 
reviews focused exclusively on ED- delivered behavioural 
interventions for suicidality,13–15 the most recent of which 
was conducted in 2018. A main finding across the studies 
examined  in  these  reviews  were  that  repeated  contacts 
with  someone  trained  in  suicide  prevention  decreased 
post- ED discharge suicidality.13 14 This kind of high touch 
intervention requires the support of additional resources 
or  better  integration  with  mental  health,  that  are  not 
readily available in many EDs, yet are needed.

Several  behavioural  interventions  for  opioid  over-
dose  were  associated  with  successful  linkage  to  specialty 
outpatient  care.  Most  interventions  studies  were  multi-
component,  with  the  most  common  components  being 
provision  of  naloxone  and  referral  to  SUD  treatment. 
Although  several  interventions  appeared  to  have  prom-
ising  effects  on  outcomes,  only  one  RCT  was  identified 
that investigated these interventions, suggesting the need 
for additional rigorous studies in this population. There 
appeared to be several other gaps, including a need for 
additional  research  on  brief  ED- delivered  interventions 
for non- opioid substances, such as alcohol.

We  did  not  identify  any  primary  studies  that  met  our 
criteria for psychosis- focused behavioural or care process 
in  the  ED.  Recommended 
interventions  delivered 

practices of care for emergency management of psychosis 
are  available,  though  they  are  based  on  primary  and 
community  care  research.  These  guidelines  state  that 
safety  and  violence  assessment  is  the  first  priority, 
followed  by  provision  of  medication  (antipsychotic  or 
others,  depending  on  aetiology  of  psychosis).59  These 
guidelines also emphasise the importance of early inter-
vention during the first psychotic episode to improve clin-
ical outcomes.60 61

Limitations
Overall, this scoping review adds to previously conducted 
reviews  by  including  a  broader  array  of  acute  mental 
health  events  and  intervention  types.  Nonetheless,  this 
review  is  limited  in  that  it  does  not  offer  a  synthesis  of 
available  evidence,  including  medication  only  interven-
tions and psychosis related to medication or other medical 
conditions. This was largely due to inconsistency in inter-
vention components and characteristics and in the timing 
of  outcome  assessment  across  included  studies.  Studies 
themselves  also  had  important  limitations,  particularly 
infrequent use of randomisation and comparison groups.

CONCLUSIONS
Existing  evidence  on  the  effectiveness  of  brief  ED- deliv-
ered behavioural or care processes interventions among 
patients presenting with suicide attempt or acute ideation, 
substance  overdose  or  psychosis  is  limited  by  method-
ological  inconsistency,  ethical  challenges  related  to 
randomisation and setting level barriers to implementa-
tion. Future studies in suicide could examine differences

in  effectiveness  by  patient  sociodemographic  and  clin-
ical  factors,  intervention  features  (eg,  modality  such  as 
telemedicine- delivered vs in- person, duration of interven-
tion, family involvement), and ED setting characteristics 
(eg, rural vs urban, staffing models, bed capacity). Future 
research in opioid overdose should employ more rigorous 
research designs that feature comparison groups, such as 
treatment as usual. When a comparator is not feasible or 
ethical, studies should compare outcomes before and after 
the intervention is delivered (ie, a pre–post design). More 
generally, consistent assessment and reporting of adverse 
events  is  recommended.  Finally,  there  appears  to  be  a 
paucity of research on ED behavioural and care process 
interventions  for  psychosis  and  non- opioid  substances, 
such  as  alcohol.  Future  research  could  examine  brief 
interventions for these conditions that are initiated in the 
ED  and  continued  in  outpatient  or  community  mental 
healthcare settings.
