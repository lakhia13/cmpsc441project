INTRODUCTION

Insomnia is one of the two most commonly diagnosed sleep disorders among military 
servicemembers and veterans, and both the Department of Defense (DOD) and Veterans 
Administration (VA) have embraced cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) as a 
valuable first-line approach to treatment, conducting large-scale provider training initiatives 
to meet the needs of individuals served by these two large healthcare systems.1

Insomnia disorder seldom occurs on its own in servicemembers and veterans; rather, it is 
typically seen in the context of other physical and mental health conditions. It is also more 
common among women servicemembers and veterans compared to men, although treatment 
studies with military populations have included a predominance of men (typically 80–90%) 
with some studies including exclusively men2,3 Results of randomized controlled trials and 
clinical implementation of CBT-I show that it retains its effectiveness when delivered to 
servicemembers and veterans in “real world” clinical practice, even in the context of 
comorbid conditions.1,4

MENTAL HEALTH COMORBIDITIES

In servicemembers and veterans, insomnia disorder commonly co-occurs with mental health 
conditions, an association which has adverse consequences for functioning. Disrupted sleep 
is also a risk factor for mental health disorders including posttraumatic stress disorder 
(PTSD) and depression. A recent study of active duty Army personnel found insomnia is 
highly comorbid with major depressive disorder (85%), generalized anxiety disorder (83%), 
and PTSD (70%).5 The relationship between insomnia and mental health symptoms is 
bidirectional and chronic in nature. Insomnia symptoms prior to deployment are predictive 
of a greater risk for development of depression, anxiety and PTSD,6 while sleep difficulties 
are also core diagnostic criteria of PTSD and depression.7 Younger veterans deployed during 
Operation Iraqi Freedom/Operation Enduring Freedom/Operation New Dawn (OEF/OIF/
OND) with premorbid psychiatric disorders are more likely to suffer from insufficient and 
poor quality compared to those without premorbid psychiatric conditions further supporting 
a bidirectional relationship between sleep and psychiatric illness.8

Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)

Insomnia is the most frequently endorsed symptom of PTSD in servicemembers 
postdeployment,9 and evidence suggests CBT-I is highly effective in improving sleep and 
reducing trauma symptoms in veterans with PTSD. Nearly half of Vietnam-era veterans with 
combat- related PTSD endorse regular difficulties with sleep onset and fragmentation.10 
Furthermore, insomnia is the most commonly reported enduring symptom following PTSD 
treatment in active duty servicemembers11 and in individuals exposed to trauma at night.12 
Insomnia is also a predictor of poor response to exposure therapy for PTSD.13 These 
findings suggest veterans meeting criteria for insomnia disorder and PTSD may benefit from 
sleep-focused interventions in multiple ways.

Some sleep symptoms present differently for individuals with military-related PTSD, 
particularly symptoms of hyperarousal at night. Veterans with PTSD show greater night-to-
night and person-to-person variability in sleep symptoms14 and distinctive maladaptive 
cognitions such as fear of reexperiencing nocturnal traumatic events or losing the ability to 
maintain vigilance during sleep.15 These hypervigilance-related features may be related to 
the context of the trauma (i.e. sexual assault in bed, nighttime combat), and manifest 
behaviorally through actions such as trying to avoid falling sleep, checking behaviors, and 
keeping weapons at the bedside. A theoretical model describing factors that predispose, 
precipitate, and perpetuate insomnia (the “3 P’s” model of insomnia)16 can be applied in the 
case of PTSD (see Table 1). Utilizing this conceptualization within insomnia treatment, it 
may be helpful to highlight factors such as regularity in sleep scheduling, addressing 
unhelpful thoughts with cognitive therapy, and employing coping strategies (e.g. relaxation, 
grounding, distraction) for distress and arousal at night.

CBT-I confers significant benefit for veterans with PTSD in terms of reducing insomnia 
severity across subjective sleep measures, general functioning, nightmares and sleep-related 
fear.17,18 Similar reductions in symptoms of insomnia severity have also been demonstrated 
for veterans with comorbid PTSD and insomnia in residential programs,19 and when CBT-I 
is delivered via telehealth.20 CBT-I is a robust treatment for individuals with co-occurring

Depression

insomnia and PTSD even when delivered to patient populations that may not be able to 
easily access outpatient mental health services.

Over 70% of patients with PTSD have chronic nightmares,21 and combining nightmare-
focused treatments with CBT-I is supported by several studies. Imagery Rehearsal Therapy 
(IRT) and Exposure, Rescripting and Relaxation Therapy (ERRT) have demonstrated 
positive results for veterans with PTSD and insomnia, when combined with CBT-I.22 
Combining CBT-I with IRT improved subjective sleep, insomnia severity, nightmare 
frequency and overall PTSD symptoms.23,24, Sleep measured objectively by actigraphy also 
improved in one study.25 Cognitive Behavioral Social Rhythm Therapy (CBSRT) utilized 
techniques from Social Rhythm Therapy, CBT-I and IRT and is associated with improved 
sleep-related and PTSD-related symptoms.24 Combining CBT-I with ERRT may also be 
beneficial for general sleep outcomes, nightmare frequency and nightmare-related distress.26 
Addressing nightmares and insomnia together therefore has significant advantages.

Depression is a common mental health condition among military personnel and veterans 
with insomnia. Sleep difficulties are both prodromal to and diagnostic of depression,27 and 
insomnia is a risk factor for suboptimal depression treatment response,28 chronicity29 and 
relapse after depression treatment.30 Even following successful depression treatment, 
insomnia symptoms frequently remain, even among individuals considered in remission.31 
In military populations, depression is often comorbid with other mental health diagnoses 
such as PTSD,32 further complicating the clinical picture.33,34,35 Additionally, in military 
personnel, poor sleep is related to increased suicidality and history of suicide attempts36 
over and above other risk factors.37

Patients with comorbid insomnia and depression may present with symptoms that 
complicate CBT-I delivery. For example, depressed individuals may have low motivation 
and may find it more difficult to adhere to treatment recommendations.38 Similarly, 
depressed individuals may have difficulty with components of CBT-I that require them to get 
out of bed when not sleeping. Patients with comorbid depression may benefit from better 
understanding and addressing common symptoms of depression, such as low mood and 
anhedonia, that are not considered core insomnia symptoms but can interfere with treatment 
progress. Behavioral activation through working together with the patient to identify 
previously enjoyable or mastery-oriented activities could address depression-related 
difficulty rising at a prescribed time as well as using the bed as coping strategy. Other 
modifications to CBT-I may be helpful, such as motivational interviewing to enhance 
adherence, early morning bright light exposure to improve mood and stabilize sleep, 
scheduled worry time to address rumination, and relaxation techniques. Collaborating with 
prescribing physicians around pharmacotherapy for depression is also essential to ensure 
sleep is not adversely impacted by antidepressant therapy. Results of VA’s CBT-I 
dissemination program shows that CBT-I reduces depression severity and suicidal ideation in 
the context of routine clinical care, suggesting CBT-I should be offered to individuals with 
comorbid depression and insomnia.39

Substance Use Disorders (SUD)

Insomnia and substance use often co-occur, frequently in conjunction with other mental 
health difficulties. Veterans often report using substances such as alcohol and marijuana to 
cope with insomnia symptoms,40,41 and insomnia symptoms predict alcohol relapse for 
military personnel and veterans.42 While mental health conditions are risk factors for 
substance use disorders, the relationship between depression or PTSD symptoms and 
alcohol use is mediated by insomnia severity among veterans, suggesting complex 
relationships among psychiatric conditions, substance use, and sleep.43 Importantly, sleep 
symptoms may not remit after PTSD treatment in dual-diagnosis substance use residential 
treatment programs,44 but there is evidence CBT-I may reduce risk of substance use relapse 
among individuals with comorbid mental health condition. While substances such as alcohol 
and cannabis may induce drowsiness or relaxation, sleep fragmentation is increased as 
substances are metabolized, and tolerance to sedation develops with continued use.45 CBT-I 
in substance users may require multi-model interventions for co-occurring diagnoses as 
problematic alcohol use is associated with reduced treatment adherence,46 and treatment for 
insomnia typically is not initiated until the recovery phase of substance use disorders. CBT-I 
techniques are practical and effective interventions for sleep disturbance in individuals with 
a history of substance use disorders. Although alcohol use relapse rates may not be reduced 
by CBT-I,47,48 a pilot study of veterans with cannabis use disorder found the CBT-I Coach 
mobile app was effective in reducing cannabis use and improving sleep.49 Despite evidence 
for the interrelationship between sleep disturbance and substance use, limited studies exist 
investigating the effectiveness of CBT-I for military populations with problematic substance 
use patterns.

MEDICAL ISSUES

Pain

There exists a bidirectional relationship between insomnia and chronic pain, suggesting that 
symptoms of both must be addressed to improve functioning. Among individuals with 
chronic pain, 50%−70% report significantly disrupted sleep.50 Chronic pain may cause 
patients to remain in lighter stages of sleep,51 and interrupted sleep can, in turn, decrease 
pain thresholds.52,53 Insomnia is a risk factor for chronic pain after acute injury,54 and 
experimentally induced pain disrupts sleep.55 In older veterans, poor sleep is associated with 
worse next-day subjective pain ratings.56 Sleep difficulties are endorsed by 90% of 
Operation Iraqi Freedom/Operation Enduring Freedom (OIF/OEF) veterans who present 
with the “polytrauma clinical triad” of chronic pain, TBI, and PTSD.5758 PTSD-related 
hyperarousal can disrupt sleep59,60 and lower pain thresholds as well61 (see Figure 1). This 
underscores the complexity of sleep in relation to polytrauma and overall health.

Multiple factors complicate insomnia treatment in the context of chronic pain. Assessing 
medication use and working with prescribers is important as pain medications may lead to 
disruptions in sleep,62,61 worsen sleep apnea,63 and impair cognition.50 Dysfunctional 
beliefs about the pain-sleep relationship, and behaviors such as extended time in bed for 
“rest” may be linked to poorly managed pain and contribute to insomnia symptoms.

Aging

recommendations (i.e., separate “sleep” and “rest” locations), using cognitive therapy 
techniques to challenge unhelpful beliefs, employing behavioral activation with activity 
pacing, and providing relaxation strategies may be helpful for chronic pain patients with 
insomnia.

There is a positive effect of CBT-I on sleep and mood outcomes in chronic pain patients;
64–66 however, despite improvements in sleep, differences in pain ratings from pre-to post-
intervention are not always achieved.67 Among OIF/OEF veterans with polytrauma, 
modified CBT-I in combination with prazosin reduced headache intensity and frequency, 
reduced daytime sleepiness, and improved cognitive performance.68 Overall, improvements 
from CBT-I in sleep indices for comorbid insomnia and pain suggests CBT-I is a viable 
treatment option for patients with comorbid chronic pain and may improve their overall 
function.

Approximately one half of older veterans endorse disturbed sleep,69 and chronic, untreated 
sleep disturbances are associated with increased risk for negative physical,70 psychological,
71 cognitive,72–74 and social75 outcomes. CBT-I is effective first-line treatment for insomnia 
in older adults,76–78 and hypnotic medications are not recommended due to risk for adverse 
effects.79 The likelihood of taking sedative-hypnotic medications to treat sleep difficulties is 
higher in older adults, although they increase risk for falls,80,81 fractures,82 strokes,83 and 
mortality.84 Studies of older veterans show benefit of CBT-I,4,69 although older veterans 
underutilize behavioral health services, posing unique challenges in delivering CBT-I to 
older veterans.

4,78,85

Adaptations to CBT-I can be made to accommodate the physical and cognitive changes 
associated with advanced age.86 Older adults may adopt unhelpful expectations regarding 
sleep and aging,87 and psychoeducation is important to address these maladaptive thoughts. 
In addition, engagement in stimulating evening activities and eliminating activities that 
increase risk of evening dozing are important tools in implementing CBT-I. To accommodate 
physical limitations and maintain safety from falls at night, modification to stimulus control 
instructions may be required. A recent study showed that CBT-I, delivered by trained non-
mental health providers, produced significant improvements in sleep initiation and 
maintenance in older veterans and that benefits were sustained over a 12-month follow-up.69 
A second study explored benefits of an adapted version of CBT-I for older veterans in and 
Adult Day Health Care program and found benefits for this population in which mild 
cognitive impairment, functional limitations and limited social milieu are all commonplace.
86

Sleep Apnea

Insomnia and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) frequently co-occur88 and contribute to 
impairments in functioning and quality of life, over and above either disorder in isolation.89 
Risk factors for OSA include obesity, use of central nervous system depressants (i.e., 
opioids, alcohol), older age, male gender, and smoking.90 Data from active duty military 
personnel indicate increases in medical encounters for both insomnia and OSA.91 Over 65%

of active duty personnel with PTSD have comorbid OSA,92 and OSA is the most commonly-
diagnosed sleep disorder among VA users.2 OSA is typically comorbid with medical 
conditions such as hypertension, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and is associated with 
increased mortality,93,94 and psychiatric disorders including depression, anxiety and PTSD.
90,95 While the first line treatment for OSA, positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy,96 can 
improve sleep-related symptoms and health,97 comorbid insomnia is associated with lower 
PAP adherence.98 This suggests CBT-I is an appropriate adjunctive treatment for OSA 
patients with insomnia.

Special treatment considerations or modifications may be needed to address compliance 
with PAP in veterans with comorbid OSA and insomnia. Early PAP use is predictive of long-
term PAP adherence;99 therefore, to encourage long-term PAP use, early intervention for 
insomnia is important. A Cochrane review reported that behavioral and educational 
interventions effectively improve PAP adherence,100 and this can easily be woven into CBT-
I treatments. In fact, interventions targeting veterans with co-existing OSA and insomnia 
have demonstrated positive sleep and PAP adherence outcomes.101,102 Taken together, the 
literature provides support for using CBT-I in veterans with comorbid insomnia and OSA 
and significant sleep-related benefits can be achieved. The available literature is currently 
limited in terms of studies assessing the role of CBT-I in OSA for active duty populations 
where additional challenges to PAP use are present.

ACCESS TO CARE

Because insomnia is highly prevalent in the veteran population, and CBT-I has demonstrated 
effectiveness in patients with complex medical and mental health histories, a system-wide 
dissemination has been implemented by the VA and DOD.1 The CBT-I dissemination 
program utilizes didactic and competency training components through lectures and 
telephone-based consultation about ongoing cases for mental health providers from a variety 
of disciplines. Outcomes demonstrate high success rates for provider competency1 and self-
efficacy,103 in addition to large effects for improvement in insomnia symptoms for veterans.4

Despite these efforts, there are still barriers to engaging CBT-I for military populations such 
as the limited access to care and the stigma of mental health care. VA/DOD guidelines 
recommend CBT-I as a first-line treatment for insomnia disorder in PTSD;104 however, 
veterans with insomnia and PTSD remain likely to receive sedative-hypnotic medications 
instead.105 It may be the case that providers are unaware of CBT-I or the service may not be 
readily available (e.g. limited to weekday sessions during standard work hours and larger, 
urban clinics). In addition to provider training initiatives described above, alternative 
delivery modalities have been explored as a means of increasing access to CBT-I. There is 
evidence that small-group CBT-I is as effective as individual CBT-I for veterans.106 
Telehealth interventions for veterans in rural areas are also effective and may enable trained 
providers to more easily reach veterans living inremote areas.20 While internet-based 
delivery may further increase access, available evidence suggests it is inferior to face-to-face 
treatment for active duty military personnel.107

Aside from systemic barriers to accessing CBT-I, there are also individual beliefs about 
mental health treatment, which are more prevalent in veterans who have been diagnosed 
with a mental health condition such as PTSD or depression, are younger, or identify as a 
racial/ethnic minority.108 Nonetheless, one study of women veterans reported that patients 
actually prefer behavioral over pharmacological insomnia treatment.109 Connecting active 
duty military personnel and veterans with CBT-I through primary care or non-mental health 
settings may be a means of reducing stigma and promoting engagement.

SUMMARY

Insomnia is commonly reported by military populations, especially those with comorbid 
mental and physical health conditions. Co-occurring conditions may result in an altered 
presentation of insomnia symptoms, and complicate provision of CBT-I, requiring 
supplementary assessment or modifications to traditional CBT-I techniques. CBT-I has 
consistently demonstrated positive outcomes for active duty military personnel and veterans, 
even in the context of significant comorbidities such as PTSD, depression, sleep apnea, and 
chronic pain. Despite its promise, studies of CBT-I in some military populations, including 
women active duty service members and active duty and veteran patients with substance use 
disorders, remain relatively lacking. Access to care remains a challenge, which is being 
addressed via provider training initiatives and exploration of alternative delivery modalities.

SYNOPSIS:

Insomnia is commonly reported by military populations, especially those with comorbid 
mental and physical health conditions. Co-occurring conditions result in an altered 
presentation of insomnia symptoms, and complicate provision of Cognitive Behavioral 
Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I), requiring supplementary assessment or modifications to 
traditional techniques. CBT-I has consistently demonstrated positive outcomes for active 
duty servicemembers and veterans, even in the context of significant comorbidities such 
as posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, sleep apnea, and chronic pain. Despite its 
promise, studies of CBT-I in some populations, including women and individuals with 
substance use disorders remain relatively understudied in active duty and veteran 
populations.

KEY POINTS

•

•

•

•

•

Insomnia is frequently reported by active duty military personnel and veterans

There is a bidirectional relationship between insomnia and mental and 
physical heath disorders that commonly occur in military populations

Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I) is efficacious to improve 
sleep and functioning in military populations from active duty service 
members to older veterans

Military personnel and veterans with complex presentations including 
posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, sleep apnea, and chronic pain 
benefit from CBT-I

Data evaluating CBT-I are limited in in women servicemembers and veterans 
and among those with substance use disorders despite high prevalence and 
risk of sleep difficulties in these subgroups

3 P’s Model of Insomnia and PTSD in Military Populations

Table 1.

Predisposing factors

Precipitating factors

Perpetuating factors

Elevate risk for developing insomnia and 
PTSD

Trigger insomnia and PTSD

Maintain insomnia and PTSD

Family history of sleep or anxiety problems Military trauma exposure (e.g. combat, 

Early-life trauma exposure

sexual or interpersonal assault)

Change in military status (e.g. 
deployment, discharge)

Behaviors (e.g. irregular sleep/wake schedule, 
hypervigilance - checking locks)

Cognitions (e.g. fears of vulnerability or 
nightmares leading to sleep avoidance, distress 
regarding daytime consequences of sleep loss)

Mental health symptoms (e.g. high stress 
reactivity, anxiety, depression)

Social/interpersonal life stressors (e.g. 
divorce, childbirth)

Maladaptive coping strategies (e.g. napping, 
substance use including alcohol or caffeine)

Medical conditions (e.g. apnea, pain)

Economic/occupational stressors (e.g. job 
loss, shift work)

Environmental factors (e.g. light, temperature)
