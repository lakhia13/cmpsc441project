Abstract

Purpose of review—To review the recent literature on eating disorders, disordered eating 
behaviors, and body image dissatisfaction among sexual and gender minority populations, 
including, but not limited to, gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender people.

Recent findings—Overall, eating disorders, disordered eating behaviors, and body 
dissatisfaction are common among sexual and gender minority populations. Lifetime prevalence 
for anorexia nervosa (1.7%), bulimia nervosa (1.3%), and binge-eating disorder (2.2%) diagnoses 
are higher among sexual minority adults compared to cisgender heterosexual adults in the US. 
Lifetime prevalence of eating disorders by self-report of a health care provider’s diagnosis are 
10.5% for transgender men and 8.1% for transgender women in the US, including anorexia 
nervosa (4.2% and 4.1%) and bulimia nervosa (3.2% and 2.9%), respectively. Disordered eating 
behaviors may be perpetuated by minority stress and discrimination experienced by these 
individuals. Body dissatisfaction may be a core stressor experienced by transgender people; gender 
dysphoria treatment has been shown to increase body satisfaction. A particular clinical challenge 
in caring for transgender youth with eating disorders is the standard use of growth charts based on 
sex.

Summary—Novel research demonstrates that sexual and gender minorities with eating disorders 
have unique concerns with regards to disordered eating and body image.

INTRODUCTION

Page 2

The purpose of this article is to review recent literature on eating disorders (ED) and 
disordered eating behaviors (DEB) among sexual and gender minority populations. We first 
review literature in sexual minorities (e.g. gay, lesbian, bisexual), and then in gender 
minorities (e.g. transgender, gender nonconforming). Eating disorders (ED) can affect 
people of all sexual orientations and gender identities. ED diagnoses include, but are not 
limited to, anorexia nervosa (AN), atypical anorexia nervosa (AAN), bulimia nervosa (BN), 
binge eating disorder (BED), other specified feeding or eating disorder (OSFED), and 
avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID), according to the Diagnostic and 
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition (DSM-5) (1).

Table 1 describes key terms used in this article. Sexual orientation is a multidimensional 
construct made up of at least three dimensions: sexual identity, attractions to the same or 
other sexes, and sex/gender of sexual partners (2,3). A sexual minority is a person whose 
sexual orientation differs from the majority of the surrounding society, and can include gay, 
lesbian, and bisexual identities. Transgender people have a gender identity that differs from 
their sex assigned at birth, whereas cisgender people have a gender identity or gender 
expression that matches their sex assigned at birth. For instance, a transgender man identifies 
and expresses his gender as a man, but was assigned a female sex at birth. A transgender 
woman identifies and expresses her gender as a woman, but was assigned a male sex at birth 
(2). Cisgender refers to an individual whose gender aligns with their sex assigned at birth.

FINDINGS

Sexual Minority Individuals and Eating Disorders

Results from a recent nationally representative study in the United States shows that sexual 
minority adults had between 2–4 times greater odds of experiencing a DSM-5 eating 
disorder diagnosis of anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, or binge-eating disorder compared 
to cisgender heterosexual adults (4)**. This study represents one of the first to specifically 
investigate lifetime prevalence of DSM-5 eating disorder diagnoses among a nationally 
representative sample of United States adults. Overall, lifetime prevalence for anorexia 
nervosa (1.7%), bulimia nervosa (1.3%), and binge-eating disorder (2.2%) were higher 
among sexual minority adults compared to cisgender heterosexual adults (4). While this 
study adds important information about the lifetime prevalence of DSM-5 eating disorder 
diagnoses among sexual minority adults in the United States, the study was unable to report 
findings separately by gender. Similarly, another study found that sexual minority young 
adults had higher odds (1.53, 95% CI 1.02–2.29) of engaging in unhealthy weight control 
behaviors (e.g. fasting, skipping meals, vomiting, using laxatives, diuretics, or weight loss 
pills) than their heterosexual counterparts (5). The following research provides specific 
information about eating disorders and body dissatisfaction among sexual minority men and 
women. When appropriate, we have noted which studies in this section explicitly describe 
the gender status (e.g. cisgender) of their samples.

Sexual Minority Boys and Men—Overall, research continues to suggest that gay and 
bisexual adolescent boys and adult men have a greater prevalence and increased likelihood

of eating disorder behaviors. For example, among a national sample of United States 
adolescents from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) Youth Risk 
Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS), gay adolescent boys had a greater prevalence of 
fasting (24.8%), diet pill use (15.4%), purging via vomiting or laxative use (17.3%) during 
the past 30 days at the time of the study, and lifetime anabolic-androgenic steroid use 
(13.1%) compared to adolescents who identified as heterosexual, bisexual, or unsure (6). 
These results are similar to a sample of adolescents in Minnesota, where researchers found 
that gay and bisexual boys reported higher rates and greater odds of fasting or skipping 
meals to lose weight, using diet pills, speed, or other drugs to lose weight, and vomiting on 
purpose after eating to lose weight compared to their heterosexual peers across three time 
points (1998, 2004, and 2010) (7). Similarly, among a sample of adolescents in Connecticut, 
gay adolescent boys had nearly six-fold higher odds of fasting, vomiting, or taking diet pills 
to lose weight compared to their heterosexual peers in adjusted models (8).

Eating disorder behaviors among sexual minority adolescent boys also occurs in the United 
Kingdom. Calzo, Austin, and Micali (2018)* found that at age 14 years, gay or bisexual 
boys in the United Kingdom had greater past-year prevalence of any purging behavior 
(2.5%), binge eating (7.5%), and any restricting behavior (22.5%) compared to heterosexual 
boys. Gay or bisexual boys also endorsed greater body dissatisfaction and pressures to 
increase muscularity (9). Lastly, gay or bisexual boys had greater odds (2.67, 95% CI 1.03, 
6.92) of engaging in any dieting, while mostly heterosexual boys (those who identify as 
primarily attracted to the opposite sex, but are also attracted to their own sex) had greater 
odds of overeating without the loss of control (1.97, 95% CI 1.07, 3.61) and binge eating 
(2.52, 95% CI 1.02, 6.27), compared to completely heterosexual boys (9). This study shows 
that eating disorder symptoms are already pronounced among sexual minority boys by age 
14 years. Moreover, eating disorder symptoms persisted among the sample at age 16 years.

Sexual minority adult men also experience greater rates of eating disorder behaviors and 
body dissatisfaction compared to heterosexual men. For example, recent research has shown 
that cisgender gay men in the United States score relatively high on the Eating Disorder 
Examination Questionnaire (EDE-Q), a commonly used eating disorder measure. 
Specifically, 6% of cisgender gay men in the United States scored in the clinically 
significant range on the EDE-Q restraint subscore, 2% on the eating concern subscore, 11% 
on the weight concern subscore, 21% on the shape concern subscore, and 4% on the EDE-Q 
global score (10)**. Importantly, any occurrence of eating disorder behaviors and attitudes 
were relatively common among the sample, including 20% engaging in dietary restraint, 
11% endorsing objective binge episodes, and 10% engaging in excessive exercise (10). 
Among a sample of undergraduate college students, Von Schell et al. (2018) found that 28% 
of gay college men reported subclinical levels of objective binge eating, 8% reported self-
induced vomiting, and 21.5% and 14% reported subclinical and clinical excessive 
exercising, respectively, over the past 28 days (11). Bisexual college men also experienced 
similarly high rates of clinical and subclinical eating disorder behaviors, with 10.5% 
reporting subclinical levels of self-induced vomiting, 15% reporting clinical levels of 
excessive exercising, and 30% engaging in objective binge eating behaviors over the past 28 
days (11).

It is important to note that eating disorder behaviors among sexual minority men do not 
occur in isolation. Bell, Reiger, and Hirsch (2019)* found that depression, perceived stigma 
associated with sexual orientation status, and lower self-compassion predicted a positive 
eating disorder screen, as measured by the Eating Disorder Screen for Primary Care, among 
cisgender gay men (12). Furthermore, gay men with eating disorders also report high 
psychiatric comorbidity, including depression (13). This research suggests that, among 
sexual minority men, psychiatric comorbidity may complicate treatment and prognosis.

Sexual Minority Girls and Women—Adolescent girls and adult women who identify as 
lesbian or bisexual are also at risk of eating disorder behaviors. Among a national sample of 
adolescent girls in the United States from the CDC’s YRBSS, lesbian adolescent girls had a 
greater prevalence of using diet pills (15.3%) and purging via vomiting or laxative use 
(16.7%) during the past 30 days at the time of study, and had a greater prevalence of lifetime 
use of anabolic-androgenic steroids (9.3%) compared to adolescent girls who identify as 
heterosexual, bisexual, or are unsure. Bisexual adolescent girls had the greatest prevalence 
of fasting during the past 30 days at the time of study (28.0%) compared to heterosexual, 
lesbian, and unsure girls (6). Mostly heterosexual adolescent girls had higher odds (OR 1.76, 
95% CI 1.04–2.98) of engaging in muscularity-oriented disordered eating behaviors than 
exclusively heterosexual adolescent girls (14).

Similar results have been shown in studies of single states in the US. For example, among 
adolescent girls in Minnesota, bisexual girls had higher rates of fasting or skipping meals to 
lose weight, using diet pills, speed, or other drugs to lose weight, or vomiting on purpose 
after eating to lose weight compared to their heterosexual peers (7). Bisexual adolescent 
girls also had greater odds of vomiting on purpose after eating to lose weight compared to 
heterosexual girls across three time points (1998, 2004, and 2010) (7). Similar results have 
been shown among adolescent girls in the United Kingdom. At age 14 years, sexual minority 
girls had greater past-year prevalence of eating disorder behaviors compared to completely 
heterosexual girls. Mostly heterosexual (4.5%) and lesbian or bisexual (4%) adolescent girls 
engaged in any purging behaviors, while 17% of lesbian or bisexual girls engaged in binge 
eating (9)*. At age 14 years, mostly heterosexual (49%) and lesbian or bisexual (41%) girls 
engaged in any dieting. As with sexual minority adolescent boys, eating disorder symptoms 
persisted at age 16 years (9).

Among a sample of Black- and White-identified young adult women in the United States 
from the Pittsburg Girls Study, a longitudinal cohort study starting in 2000–2001, Jones et 
al. (2019) found that women who identify as a sexual minority reported greater body 
dissatisfaction and had a greater eating pathology as measured by the Eating Attitudes Test 
(EAT- 26) compared to heterosexual women (15). Results also showed that White sexual 
minority young adult women had greater eating pathology compared to Black sexual 
minority young adult women, as well as both White and Black heterosexual women (15). 
Among a sample of undergraduate college students, Von Schell et al. (2018) found that 
lesbian and bisexual women have high rates of subclinical and clinical disordered eating 
behaviors (11). For example, among lesbian women, 15% reported clinical levels of 
objective binge eating, 15% reported subclinical levels of self-induced vomiting, 10% 
reported clinical levels of self-induced vomiting, and 17.5% reported subclinical levels of

excessive exercising and laxative misuse over the past 28 days. Among bisexual women, 
12% reported clinical levels of objective binge eating and 17.5% reported both clinical and 
subclinical excessive exercising over the past 28 days (11).

High prevalence of eating disorder behaviors continues into adulthood among sexual 
minority women. Among a sample of 267 sexual and gender minority United States adults, 
cisgender lesbian women had a greater likelihood of a positive eating disorder screen, as 
measured by the Eating Disorder Screen for Primary Care, compared to cisgender gay men 
(12). Importantly, depression was a significant predictor of a positive eating disorder screen 
among lesbian women (12). Further, cisgender lesbian women reported dietary restriction 
(13.5%), objective binge episodes (8.7%), and excessive exercise (5.3%) over the past 28 
days (16).

Contributing Factors—Minority stress theory has been used to explain the 
disproportionate rates of eating disorder behaviors and body dissatisfaction among sexual 
minorities compared to heterosexual individuals. In a systematic review, Mason, Lewis, and 
Heron (2018) show that experiences related to gender and sexual orientation, such as 
minority stress, heterosexism, and sexual objectification, may lead to eating disorder 
behaviors and body dissatisfaction among sexual minority (e.g. lesbian and bisexual 
identified) women (17)*. Similarly, among gay men, perceived stigma, a major component 
of minority stress theory, is positively associated with eating disorder behaviors (12). 
Furthermore, sexual minority adult men and women who have experienced discrimination 
based on their weight at any point in their life had a greater risk of eating disorder behaviors 
compared to those who did not experience weight discrimination (18). It appears that the 
social experiences of sexual minorities are a contributor to eating disorder behaviors and 
body dissatisfaction among this population.

Transgender People

Although transgender people are underrepresented in eating disorder research, a small but 
growing literature indicates that transgender people may uniquely experience body image 
dissatisfaction and eating disorders (19). Gender norms and sociocultural body image ideals 
of femininity and masculinity can influence eating disorders among transgender people in 
unique ways (20). Traditional masculine body ideals are associated with muscularity 
whereas traditional feminine body image ideals are associated with thinness (21). A 
perceived mismatch with one’s own body and sociocultural body ideals may lead to body 
dissatisfaction. Body dissatisfaction may be a core stressor experienced by transgender 
people; gender dysphoria treatment has been shown to increase body satisfaction (22). 
Disordered eating behaviors in transgender men and transmasculine individuals may be 
partially due to the desire to suppress menstruation and secondary female sex characteristics 
in gender-affirmed transgender men (23). Specific social standards, such as thinness, may 
lead to a drive for weight loss in transgender women, which may also manifest in eating 
disorder pathology (24). In parallel, transgender women may use weight loss to repress 
secondary male characteristics (22). Furthermore, social stigma and minimal social support 
may exacerbate disordered eating behaviors for transgender people (25)*. Disordered eating 
in transgender people may also be related to objectification theory, where one internalizes an

observer’s perspective as a primary view of one’s physical self (25). Finally, gender minority 
stress, or discrimination targeting gender minority status, may contribute to disordered 
eating among transgender people (25).

Risk factors for eating disorders among transgender people include high body 
dissatisfaction, perfectionism, anxiety symptoms, and low self-esteem (22). Transgender 
people with eating disorders may present clinically with complex psychiatric comorbidity 
and an increased risk for self-harm (26). A particular clinical challenge in caring for 
transgender youth with eating disorders is the standard use of growth curves based on sex; 
providers may consider consulting growth curves for both the young person’s birth-assigned 
sex and gender identity to establish appropriate treatment goal weights (26,27)*. Finally, 
though one Massachusetts-based study found that gender nonconforming individuals 
assigned a female sex at birth appear to have a heightened lifetime risk of eating disorders 
relative to transgender women (24), there is limited clinical guidance for eating disorders in 
this understudied population.

Transgender Men—Transgender men may desire a masculine-appearing build and engage 
in muscle-enhancing behaviors, such as bodybuilding (28). Transgender men may 
experience dissatisfaction with several body features such as genitalia, body hair, body 
shape, facial features, and extremities (29). Young adult transgender men have been shown 
to report high rates of binge eating (35%), fasting (34%), and vomiting (7%) (30). 
Transmasculine individuals (those identifying among the masculine spectrum and assigned a 
female sex at birth) demonstrated clinically significant eating pathology levels on the Eating 
Attitudes Test (EAT-26) (31). A US-based study that administered the EDE-Q to 312 adult 
transgender men found that they reported any occurrence of dietary restraint (25.0%), 
objective binge episodes (11.2%), excessive exercise (8.0%), and self-induced vomiting 
(1.6%) (32). Among transgender men, the highest of the four EDE-Q subscales were shape 
concerns and weight concerns (32). In this sample, 10.6% of transgender men reported being 
told by a health care provider they had an eating disorder, including anorexia nervosa (4.2%) 
and bulimia nervosa (3.2%) (32).

Transgender Women—A US-based study administering the EDE-Q to 172 transgender 
women found that they reported any occurrence of dietary restraint (27.9%), objective binge 
episodes (12.8%), excessive exercise (8.1%), and self-induced vomiting (1.7%) (32). Among 
transgender women, the highest of the four EDE-Q subscales were shape concerns and 
weight concerns (32). In this sample, 8.1% of transgender women reported being told by a 
health care provider they had an eating disorder, including anorexia nervosa (4.1%) and 
bulimia nervosa (2.9%) (32).

Conclusion—Novel research demonstrates that sexual and gender minorities with eating 
disorders have unique concerns with regards to disordered eating and body image. Research 
informing clinical guidance is especially important to ensure that sexual and gender 
minorities are receiving adequate and affirming treatment. Current treatment protocols 
should be updated to be more inclusive (e.g. sex-based growth charts may need adjusting to 
apply to transgender individuals). Future research could develop individualized screening, 
treatment guidance, and interventions to improve health outcomes in underserved sexual and

Key Points

•

•

•

Eating disorders, disordered eating behaviors, and body dissatisfaction are 
more common among sexual minorities compared to heterosexual individuals

Body dissatisfaction may be a core stressor experienced by transgender 
people; gender dysphoria treatment has been shown to increase body 
satisfaction

A particular clinical challenge in caring for transgender youth with eating 
disorders is the standard use of growth charts based on sex.

Key Terms

Page 11

Table 1.

Bisexual/Pansexual: a person emotionally, romantically, or sexually attracted to more than one sex, gender, or gender identity, although not 
necessarily simultaneously or to the same degree.

Cisgender: people whose gender identity aligns with the sex assigned at birth.

Gay: a person emotionally, romantically, or sexually attracted to members of the same gender. Lesbian or gay may not be the terms used by 
many younger people or racial/ethnic minorities.

Gender dysphoria: Clinically significant discomfort or distress that a person experiences because of a discrepancy between their gender identity 
and the sex assigned at birth.

Gender expression: the many ways people externally show their gender, or are perceived by others, such as the clothing, haircuts, and activities 
they choose or mannerisms they may possess.

Gender identity: a person’s internal sense of being man or boy, woman or girl, or sometimes a blend of both or neither. Gender identity does 
not necessarily correspond to the sex assigned at birth.

Lesbian: a woman who is emotionally, romantically, or sexually attracted to other women.

LGBTQ: This abbreviation is often used as a stand-alone term to include all sexual and gender minorities. Literally, it stands for lesbian, gay, 
bisexual, transgender, and queer.

Sex: Classification of people as male, female, or intersex based on combinations of physical characteristics (genitalia, gonads, chromosomes, or 
sex hormone levels). Sex is independent of gender.

Sexual Orientation: a multidimensional construct made up of at least three dimensions: sexual identity, attractions to the same or other sexes, 
and sex/gender of sexual partners. Identity, attractions, and sex/gender of sexual partners are not always concordant.

Transgender: when gender identity differs from the sex assigned at birth. Being transgender does not imply any specific sexual orientation.
