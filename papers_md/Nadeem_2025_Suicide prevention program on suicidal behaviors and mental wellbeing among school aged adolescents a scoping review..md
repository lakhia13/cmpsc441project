Introduction: Suicide is a significant public health concern among school-aged 
adolescents. This scoping review aimed to synthesize evidence-based literature 
on suicide prevention interventions designed to enhance mental wellbeing and 
reduce suicidal behavior in this population.

Methods: Following the PRISMA-ScR guidelines and Arksey and O’ Malley’ s five-
phase  framework,  a  systematic  search  was  conducted  across  five  databases 
(PubMed, Psych Info, Google Scholar, Science Direct, EBSCO, and ProQuest) to 
identify relevant studies meeting the inclusion criteria. Key findings from 37 peer-
reviewed papers on effective strategies and interventions were synthesized.

Results:  The  reviewed  studies  encompassed  diverse  interventions,  including 
school-based programs like Signs of Suicide (SOS) student training and digital 
platforms, as well as therapeutic and family-based approaches for school-age 
adolescents.  Outcomes  consistently  demonstrated  significant  improvements 
in  mental  wellbeing,  self-efficacy,  and  help-seeking  behaviors.  Furthermore, 
reductions  in  suicidal  ideation  and  self-harm  were  observed  across  these 
interventions.

Discussion: The findings highlight the effectiveness of various suicide prevention 
interventions  for  school-aged  adolescents.  Future  research  should  focus  on 
integrating diverse and culturally sensitive school-based mental health services 
and  risk  screening  programs,  adapting  interventions  to  align  with  specific 
cultural  norms  and  values,  particularly  in  low-  and  middle-income  countries 
where  research  is  lacking.  Enhancing  access  to  support  and  implementing 
resilience-building  initiatives  at  the  primary  school  level  are  crucial  for 
empowering  adolescents  with  essential  help-seeking  skills  and  resources, 
fostering a supportive environment for mental wellbeing and suicide prevention. 
A  limitation  of  this  review  is  the  exclusion  of  non-peer-reviewed  literature. 
Policymakers  and  school  administrators  should  consider  these  findings  when 
developing and implementing suicide prevention programs.

Introduction

Suicide is a significant concern among older adolescents, ranking 
as the fourth leading cause of death, worldwide (1). Due to heightened 
risk-taking  behaviors  and  mental  health  challenges,  instances  of 
suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STBs) are more prevalent during 
adolescence (2, 3). Moreover, suicide prevention, unlike road safety, 
currently lacks a comprehensive strategic framework to effectively 
reduce mortality and morbidity. This gap is partly attributed to the 
insufficient evidence base surrounding potentially successful strategies 
across  diverse  settings.  Although  previous  reviews  have  evaluated 
youth  suicide  and  self-harm  prevention  initiatives  within  specific 
settings such as schools or clinical environments, there is currently no 
recent,  comprehensive  synthesis  of  the  outcomes  across  these 
intervention-based strategies (4). Interventions aimed at preventing 
youth  suicide  have  been  deployed  across  various  settings,  such  as 
schools, communities, and healthcare systems around the world (5). 
However, they are tailored to diminish risk factors associated with 
suicidal behavior or to identify individuals at risk and facilitate access 
to treatment or assistance (6). The school-based suicide prevention 
(SSP),  therefore,  encompasses  various  preventive  strategies.  These 
include  universal  approaches,  aimed  to  reach  the  entire  school 
population and selective strategies, that identify and support at-risk 
groups showing signs of suicidal thoughts or behaviors (STBs) (7).

The journey from childhood to adulthood requires navigating 
through diverse developmental milestones and experiences, which 
exerts substantial influence on the physical, emotional, social, and 
mental wellbeing of adolescents. Throughout the transition phase, 
from  childhood  to  adulthood,  adolescents  undergo  an  increasing 
number of mental health issues (8). Globally, suicide ranks as the 
fourth major cause of death for adolescents and young adults aged 
10–19 years (9). Prioritizing mental health interventions during this 
period is, therefore, essential, to combat the high burden of mental 
disorders prevailing in this age group (10).

Adolescent  suicide  remains  a  significant  global  public  health 
concern,  ranking  as  the  second  leading  cause  of  death  among 
individuals aged 15–29 (11, 12). In this age group, the family serves as 
the primary influencer, shaping adolescents’ beliefs, attitudes, and 
knowledge. Moreover, this period, marked by profound biological, 
cognitive,  and  social  changes,  is  crucial  for  development,  as 
adolescence is viewed as a transition from childhood to adulthood, 
which prepares them for adult roles (13). Additionally, Erikson (14) 
highlights another fundamental factor, the development of personal 
identity during this stage, which typically occurs in the 12–15 years of 
age. Besides this, mood swings are also common during adolescence, 
due to hormonal changes (13).

Suicidal  behaviors  frequently  involve  self-harming  thoughts 
(suicidal ideation), suicide planning, and suicide attempts. Latter are 
a strong indicator of the suicidal risk (15). Suicidal ideation ranges 
from the notion that life is meaningless, to persistent and intrusive 
thoughts of self-destruction (16). A meta-analysis of global suicide 
pooled analysis trends (2010–2020) found an overall rate of 3.77 per 
100,000 people, with Estonia, New Zealand, and Uzbekistan reporting 
the highest rates. Suicide was more prevalent among older adolescents 
and males (17). Only 7% of those experiencing suicidal thoughts made 
an attempt to take their own life (18). Yet, the occurrence of suicidal 
thoughts and attempts exceeds the number of actual suicide fatalities 
(19). Research indicates that for every suicide death, there are about 
50–100 suicide attempts among young individuals (20). Both suicide 

attempts  and  severe  suicidal  ideation  can  lead  to  significant 
consequences, such as deep psychological impact, heightened risk of 
future suicide attempts, and even death (19).

The  range  of  suicide  prevention  interventions  in  the  review 
consisted of primary prevention, such as public awareness initiatives; 
secondary  prevention,  like  gatekeeper  training  programs;  tertiary 
prevention, including counseling, therapy; and postvention, such as 
survivor support groups. Expanding the conventional classification, 
these suicide prevention strategies can be categorized into universal 
(targeting the general public), selective (aimed at specific groups with 
elevated lifetime risk (such as, adolescents), and indicated prevention 
(targeting  high-risk)  groups  with  already  elevated  risk  (such  as, 
psychiatric inpatients) (21). Suicide prevention interventions aims to 
reduce the overall risk and promote mental wellbeing at the population 
level. Preventive strategies may also encompass direct interventions, 
particularly during crises, to prevent imminent suicide risk (22). In 
this review, suicide-specific prevention (SSP) focuses on addressing 
suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STBs) as primary outcomes, while 
pursuing broader health, and wellbeing as secondary outcomes.

Given the limited organized knowledge on the implementation of 
suicide prevention interventions for school-age adolescents, the goal 
was to identify and chart the empirical literature on the strategies of 
SPI as well as outcomes for this age group. Previous reviews have 
explored  suicide  prevention  interventions  within  specific  settings, 
such  as  schools  (23)  or  healthcare  (24),  or  focused  on  particular 
approaches like clinical or community-based programs. However, a 
comprehensive  analysis  of  intervention  outcomes  across  multiple 
settings,  along  with  key  implementation  barriers  and  facilitators, 
is lacking.

This  review  fills  that  gap  by  systematically  mapping  suicide 
prevention strategies for school-age adolescents, emphasizing their 
impact  on  suicidal  behaviors  and  mental  wellbeing.  Unlike  prior 
reviews that focus on a single setting, this current study synthesizes 
cross-sector interventions and highlights contextual factors shaping 
implementation. By identifying barriers and facilitators, we provide 
insights to guide policy and practice across diverse economic and 
healthcare contexts. The findings could guide the development and 
design of best evidence base effective interventions to reduce suicidal 
behavior and improve mental wellbeing among youth.

Methods

This  study  employed  a  scoping  review  methodology  to  assess 
suicide prevention programs, identify research gaps, and compare 
interventions  and  outcomes  across  different  contexts.  It  aimed  to 
capture diverse strategies to inform school-based suicide prevention 
efforts. The review process was guided by Arksey and O′Malley’s five-
stage framework, which includes formulating the research question, 
locating relevant studies, establishing selection criteria, organizing 
data, and summarizing findings (25). This review is registered in open 
science framework in 2022 ID:osf-registrations-6w8d9-v1.1

The PRISMA SCR guideline was used in developing this scoping 
review (26). The scoping review provided a structured summary, 
detailing  the  background,  objectives,  methods,  results,  and

conclusions in relation to the review questions. The findings were 
synthesized,  linked  to  key  groups,  and  discussed  in  terms  of 
relevance,  limitations,  and  future  implications.  Scoping  reviews 
draw  on  a  diverse  range  of  evidence  and  research  techniques 
through  a  clear,  methodical,  and  reproducible  process.  The 
proposed scoping review will follow the standard protocols outlined 
in the JBI Manual for Evidence Synthesis, including six phases: (1) 
outlining  objectives  and  research  questions,  (2)  developing 
inclusion criteria, (3) formulating the search strategy, (4) selecting 
data  sources,  (5)  extracting  information,  and  (6)  analyzing  and 
presenting the results.

Inclusion criteria

Participants

Following the WHO adolescent age range, this review will include 
studies that focus on school-aged adolescents between the ages of 10 
and  19 years  (27).  Eligible  studies  specifically  targeted  school  age 
adolescents, without restrictions based on gender, ethnicity, or other 
sociocultural factors.

Concept (C)

The primary focus was on the implementation and effectiveness 
of suicide prevention interventions (SPI) for school aged adolescents. 
Eligible interventions included educational, supportive, counseling, 
therapeutic,  and  psychological  strategies,  while  pharmacological 
interventions were explicitly excluded. Outcome measures assessed 
changes  in  suicidal  behaviors  (Self  injuries,  self-harm  attitudes, 
suicidal  thoughts,  and  completed  attempts)  and  overall  mental 
wellbeing. Eligible studies were scholarly, peer-reviewed articles that 
detailed  an 
intervention  study  with  pre-and-post  outcome 
assessments, focused primarily on suicide prevention interventions 
targeting  any  type  of  suicidal  behavior,  involved  school-aged 
adolescents (10–19 years), and were published in English between 
2015 and February 2025.

Context (C)

The  review  included  studies  from  all  geographical  regions, 
focusing  on  interventions  implemented  within  school  settings  in 
both high income countries and low- and middle-income countries 
(LMICs).  No  restrictions  were  placed  on  provider  type,  delivery 
methods,  duration,  or  implementation  strategies.  A  systematic 
approach was employed to examine and compare suicide prevention 
strategies across diverse contexts, assessing intervention effectiveness 
through narrative synthesis. Both quasi-experimental studies and 
randomized  controlled  trials  (RCTs)  were  included,  given  their 
ability to provide robust evidence. Systematic and scoping reviews 
were  also  considered  to  capture  broader  insights  into  existing 
intervention strategies. However, qualitative studies, cross-sectional 
studies, study protocols, pilot studies, conference proceedings, and 
non-peer-reviewed 
to  maintain 
methodological rigor.

Identifying the research question
The review sought to address the question,

  1  What  is  the  current  evidence  on  suicide  prevention 

interventions for school aged adolescents?

  2  How do these interventions impact outcomes suicidal behaviors 
(attitudes, thoughts, and attempts) and mental wellbeing?
  3  What  are  the  key  barriers  and  facilitators  in  implementing 
suicide prevention strategies for school-age adolescents across 
different contexts?

This question was framed by merging a broad research question 
with  a  clearly  defined  scope  (25,  28).  In  this  context,  the  search 
encompassed any intervention or program that aimed at preventing 
suicide  and/or  improving  wellbeing  among  adolescents  aged 
10–19 years and had its program details published in international 
peer reviewed journals.

Identification of relevant studies

In February 2025, a comprehensive search of five different databases 
Pub Med, EBSCO, Science Direct, Psych-info and ProQuest. Then, gray 
literature  searches  will  be  conducted  through  the  Open  Gray,  Gray 
Matters, and Google Scholar platforms, using the Chrome browser in 
private browsing mode to lessen geographical bias. Finally, we explored 
the  reference  lists  of  systematic  reviews  to  uncover  further  relevant 
studies. Two researchers reviewed the identified articles (YP, RN and 
MA). The selection process was guided by increasing familiarity with the 
literature,  and  by  applying  the  inclusion  criteria  iteratively.  The 
PRISMA-ScR tool was utilized for transparency in reporting.

Study selection process and criteria

A comprehensive literature review was conducted to examine the 
research topic from multiple angles. Data were retrieved using Boolean 
operators (AND, OR) with a combination of key terms; for example, 
(“Prevention  Program”  OR  “strategies”  OR  “intervention”  OR 
“measures”) combined with (“Adolescent” OR “Teenage” OR “school 
age”), along with terms related to self-injurious behavior and suicide 
(e.g., “suicide,” “suicidal,” “suicidality,” “Suicidal Behaviors”) and mental 
health aspects (e.g., “mental wellbeing,” “mental health,” “psychological 
health”),  further  paired  with  (“interventional”  OR  “Reviews”).  A 
20-year filter was applied. For Science Direct, the search was modified 
to “Suicide” AND “Mental Wellbeing” AND (“Prevention Program” 
OR “intervention”) AND (“Adolescent”) (see Appendix).

A  total  of  1,571  articles  were  initially  obtained,  after  applying 
additional  filters:  English  language,  last  20 years,  human  subjects, 
adolescents,  and  full  text,  Of  these,  961  articles  were  removed  from 
various  databases,  leaving  610  articles  after  duplicate  removal  and 
screening titles. After applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria and 
screening abstract, 87 publications were determined to be relevant and 
included in the review. The 87 articles were then screened full text in 
detail, which narrowed the pool to 62 articles. Following this, 25 articles 
were excluded because they did not address the specific research topic, 
lacked rigorous methodology, or did not align with the required study 
types, with some being dismissed for insufficient data or low quality.

Ultimately, 37 articles were fully reviewed to extract meaningful 
data. These articles included 14 quantitative studies, comprising, 11

randomized controlled trials (RCTs), 3 quasi-experimental studies 
and 11 reviews (including systematic and meta-analytic studies) that 
synthesized  evidence  from  multiple  primary  studies  to  assess  the 
effectiveness of various interventions. Figure 1 represents a summary 
of the search strategy process.

Charting the data

Data  from  studies  were  compiled  using  a  descriptive  analytical 
approach, which is commonly used in scoping reviews. The information 
was compiled into an Excel spreadsheet, recording key details such as 
author(s),  location,  purpose,  study  design,  participants,  outcomes, 
findings.  Specific  program  details  were  also  gathered,  including  the 
program  name,  type  of  intervention,  target  audience,  duration, 
frequency, requirements, delivery methods, and expected outcomes.

Collating, summarizing, and presenting the findings
In  scoping  reviews,  the  stage  of  gathering,  synthesizing,  and 
presenting  findings  is  essential  for  compiling  and  interpreting 
extracted  data  to  provide  a  broad  understanding  of  the  research 
landscape.  This  process  typically  involves  both  quantitative  and 
qualitative analyses (29). Quantitative analysis includes measuring the 
distribution  of  studies  based  on  factors  such  as  publication  year, 

geographic origin, or research methodology, often illustrated through 
tables  or  graphs  to  emphasize  key  aspects  of  the  review  (30,  31). 
Narrative analysis entails reviewing textual data to identify recurring 
themes  or  patterns  related  to  the  research  question,  using  coding 
techniques  to  categorize  these  insights.  This  combined  approach 
ensures that the results are methodically structured and clearly aligned 
with  the  review’s  objectives,  offering  meaningful  insights  into  the 
existing body of research. After generating the codes, the research 
team refined them further through discussions (32).

Data analysis

Data  was  collected  from  the  studies  included  in  the  scoping 
review by two independent reviewers using a data collection template. 
It includes information on study identifiers, such as the first author, 
title, year of publication, country of study, and article type. The form 
also collects data on the type of intervention or prevention, including 
its preventive components, clinical outcomes, frequency and duration, 
setting, and target audience. In addition, the methods section captures 
the aims and objectives of the study, as well as its design. Information 
on the measures or tools used in the study, along with process and

sample characteristics, is also documented. Finally, the results section 
gathers details on characteristics and outcomes, process outcomes, 
fidelity  or  adaptation  of  the  intervention,  any  contextual  changes, 
facilitators,  barriers,  potential  harms,  and  recommendations  for 
future research.

depression,  anxiety,  suicidal  attitudes,  and  ideations.  Although 
statistically significant improvements were observed, the findings were 
inconsistent, with most studies highlighting enhanced confidence, 
improved attitudes, and higher trainee satisfaction rather than clear, 
tangible reductions in suicide or self-harm behaviors.

Narrative synthesis was employed to summarize the findings by: 
(1)  constructing  an  initial  synthesis  of  the  included  studies  by 
organizing data into codes that enhance the researchers’ ability to 
detect patterns across studies; (2) analyzing relationships within the 
data  while  considering  various  factors  that  could  influence  the 
magnitude or direction of the intervention’s effects across studies; and 
(3) evaluating the reliability of the data by discussing its strengths and 
identifying  study-specific  factors  or 
limitations,  as  well  as 
implementation  barriers  that  may  account  for  inconsistencies  in 
findings (33).

Results

The results from the reviewed studies encompass a total of 37 
research papers, including 14 randomized controlled trials (RCTs), 14 
review including systematic reviews, 9 quasi-experimental studies, 
and  pretest-posttest  studies.  These  studies  span  multiple  regions, 
providing  insights  into  adolescent  mental  health  and  suicide 
prevention across diverse cultural and socio-economic contexts. In 
Europe, research has been conducted in the Netherlands, the UK, 
Germany, Austria, France, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Romania, Slovenia, 
Spain,  and  Sweden.  In  Asia,  studies  cover  India,  China,  Lebanon, 
Jordan,  Bengkulu,  and  broader  Upper  and  Low  Middle-
Income Countries.

North America is represented by research from the United States, 
while Australia has contributions from New South Wales and Victoria. 
Additionally, multinational studies, such as the SEYLE project, have 
examined interventions across 11 European nations, further enriching 
the  global  understanding  of  effective  mental  health  strategies 
for adolescents.

A significant gap identified in the literature was the scarcity of 
research  carried  out  in  LICs  and  LMICs.  Majority  of  the  studies 
included in this review were conducted both in high-income countries 
(HICs),  focusing  on  adolescents  from  relatively  homogeneous 
socioeconomic backgrounds. Hence, most of the evidence gathered 
originates  from  high-income  countries,  as  depicted  in  Table  1, 
potentially limiting its applicability to other regions. Suicide and/or 
self-harm  prevention  training  varied  among  the  studies,  typically 
spanning either from half to a full day, or sometimes 1–2 days. The 
modular  delivery  methods  were  common,  often  incorporating 
didactic  training,  supplemented  by  group  work,  scenario  based 
discussion,  and  individual  or  group  reflection.  Moreover,  trainers 
predominantly possessed backgrounds in psychology or healthcare.

The  training  content  generally  varied  across  studies;  but  it 
typically included defining self-harm and suicide, presenting suicide 
facts  and  prevalence  statistics,  addressing  attendees’  attitudes  and 
perceived  attitudes  of  others,  and  challenging  negative  attitudes. 
Training focused on risk factors for self-harm and suicide, including 
interpersonal relationships, along with risk assessment and mental 
health  screening  for  healthcare  professionals.  Across  the  studies, 
outcome measures comprehensively captured changes in participants’ 
attitudes,  knowledge,  and  confidence,  while  a  subset  of  studies 
employed  validated  instruments  to  assess  constructs  including 

Suicide prevention interventions

Suicidal literacy and gate keeper trainings

Mental health literacy forms the basis for promoting, preventing, 
and  providing  care  related  to  mental  health  issues,  ultimately 
enhancing  mental  wellbeing  (34).  Effective  gatekeeper  training  is 
ongoing or repeated suicide prevention programs, rather than being 
carried out through one-time sessions. These trainings typically target 
the entire adolescent school aged population, and include education 
on  identifying  risk  factors,  warning  signs,  and  appropriate  help-
seeking behaviors, for themselves and for their peers. In a systematic 
review of Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of the Signs of Suicide 
(SOS)  program  have  shown  a  decrease  in  suicide  attempts  over  a 
3-month  period  (35).  The  Signs  of  Suicide  (SOS)  program,  a 
prominent  evidence-based  initiative,  features  a  comprehensive 
program focused on enhancing suicide awareness, and identifying key 
risk  factors,  such  as  depression  (36).  Additionally,  a  large-scale 
randomized  controlled  trial  (RCT)  of  the  Youth  Aware  of  Mental 
Health (YAM) program, which included over 11,110 secondary school 
students from 10 European countries, demonstrated a 55% reduction 
in suicide attempts and a 50% decrease in severe suicidal ideation 
compared to the control groups, 12 months after the intervention (19).
Another  program,  the  Suicide  Prevention  Initiative  (SPI),  in 
Rhode  Island,  mentions  collaborations  with  clinicians  to  help  the 
school staff manage student suicide risk; it included three tiers: (1) 
training  school  staff  in  assessing  suicide  and  depression,  (2) 
connecting schools with a clinical care coordinator, (3) conducting 
follow-up check-ins with families. The coordinated framework enables 
comprehensive  care  and  monitoring,  integrating  education  and 
healthcare systems for optimal support (37). Similarly, the Safety Plan 
Intervention  (SPI)  is  a  concise,  evidence-based  approach  that 
addresses suicide crises with strategic components: reducing lethal 
means, enhancing problem-solving, coping skills, social support, and 
emergency contact identification. SPI is a collaborative strategy for 
managing suicidality and reducing access to lethal means. It includes 
identifying warning signs, coping strategies, social support, available 
of emergency contacts and professional resources, and methods to 
create a safe environment. Moreover, the plan is revisited and revised 
periodically. On the other hand, Brodsky et al. (38) have proposed 
Crisis Response Planning (CRP), entailing individuals to list steps for 
recognizing personal warning signs, using coping strategies, seeking 
social support, and accessing professional services on a small card. 
Both these interventions promote prioritizing safety, by discussing 
suicidal  thoughts,  impulses,  and  behaviors  upon  identifying  the 
warning signs.

health  promotion  in  adolescents  can  yield  positive  outcomes. 
Moreover,  evidence  indicates  that  school-based  socio-emotional 
learning (SEL) programs effectively lower depression, anxiety, and 
suicidal  behaviors  in  adolescents  (39).  Enhancing  adolescents’ 
awareness  of  mental  health  resources  and  social  support,  while 
fostering help-seeking skills, is a critical component of effective suicide 
prevention  in  schools,  addressing  the  prevalent  reluctance  among 
youth to seek assistance (40–42). Whereas, there is limited research 
on school-based interventions in LMICs, despite their potential to 
reach large numbers of adolescents (43). Moreover, in New Delhi, 
India,  a  randomized  trial  evaluated  the  effectiveness  of  a  concise 
problem-solving intervention for common adolescent mental health 
concerns. Conducted in six government schools with 251 participants, 
the  study  found  that  non-specialist  counselors,  aided  by  printed 
materials, achieved notable psychosocial benefits on adolescents (44).
A trial by Bryant et al. (45) with Syrian refugee adolescents in 
Jordan, revealed that the Early Adolescent Skills for Emotions (EASE) 
intervention, as compared to the enhanced usual care (EUC), reduced 
problem internalizing in adolescents, and improved psychological 
wellbeing  and  parenting  consistency  in  caregivers.  Another  trial 
conducted  in  Lebanon,  on  adolescents  aged  10  to  14,  who  were 
experiencing  emotional  distress,  revealed  that  the  WHO’s  EASE 
intervention,  was  found  to  be  acceptable  and  feasible  in  reducing 
psychological distress (46).

A  multi-center,  cluster  randomized  controlled  trial,  called  the 
Saving  and  Empowering  Young  Lives  (SEYLE)  was  conducted  by 
Feldman et al. (47) in Europe, involved 11,110 adolescents from 168 
schools  across  10  European  Union  countries.  The  schools  were 
randomly allocated to one of three interventions or designated as a 
control  group.  The  three  interventions  included:  (1)  Question, 
Persuade, and Refer (QPR) gatekeeper training for teachers and school 
staff; (2) the Youth Aware of Mental Health Program (YAM) aimed at 
students; and (3) professional screening (ProfScreen) that provided 
referrals  for  at-risk  students.  At  the  three-month  follow-up,  no 
significant differences were observed between the intervention and 
control  groups.  However,  at  the  12-month  follow-up,  YAM  was 
associated  with  a  significant  decrease  in  the  number  of  suicide 
attempts (OR 0.45, 95% CI 0.24–0.85; p = 0.014) and severe suicidal 
ideation  (OR  0.50,  95%  CI  0.27–0.92;  p = 0.025)  compared  to  the 
control  group.  These  results  underscore  the  efficacy  of  YAM  in 
lowering suicide attempts and severe suicidal thoughts among school-
based  adolescents,  highlighting  the  advantages  of  this  universal 
suicide prevention program in educational settings (47). Thus, these 
interventions  can  be  strongly  considered  as  a  part  of  any 
comprehensive  package  of  public  health  strategies  focused  on 
promoting overall health and preventing diseases. The Mental Health 
First Aid (MHFA) training in the United-States provided adolescents 
with skills and enhanced their mental health literacy. Tailored for

students, the training focused on recognizing warning signs, initiating 
conversations,  seeking  help,  involving  responsible  adults,  and 
responding to crises. Students who received the training demonstrated 
increased  willingness  to  provide  supportive  first  aid  and  reduced 
likelihood of harmful responses, such as ignoring suicidal peers or 
keeping their thoughts secret (48). These results highlight the efficacy 
of universal training programs for adolescents, to enhance their ability 
to  identify  peers  with  mental  health  issues.  Moreover,  those  who 
received these trainings exhibited improved helpful first aid intents 
and  reduced  blaming  attitudes  toward  peers  facing  mental 
health challenges.

Mental wellbeing is essential for optimal mental health, impacting 
health-seeking 
interpersonal 
communication, and resilience in crisis. Moreover, it plays a vital role 
in  the  overall  wellbeing  of  an  individual  by  enhances  emotional 
wellbeing, promoting proactive management of mental illness and 
fostering  a  culture  of  acceptance  (49).  A  pilot  study,  to  assess  the 
impact of the suicide prevention intervention “Kooth,” that focuses on 
the  wellbeing  of  young  individuals  by  instilling  purpose  through 
helping  others  and  by  boosting  self-help  strategies  and  social 
confidence in adolescents, was found to be cost-effective preventive 
mental  health  support  (50).  Likewise,  a  review  of  15  studies 
underscores the benefits of school mental health programs focusing 
on holistic wellbeing, revealing enhanced mental health outcomes for 
adolescents when emphasis shifts from prevention to promotion (51). 
Whereas, school based mental health interventions are mostly school-
based life skills and resilience programs, which have shown positive 
effects on students’ self-esteem, motivation, and self-efficacy (51).

Furthermore, a four phase LEAP (Learn, Explore, Assess Your 
Options, and Plan) intervention, rooted in the cognitive-behavioral 
theory, was designed to address perceived burdensomeness among 
adolescents (52). In the Learn phase, adolescents were taught how 
thoughts, emotions, and actions influence each other, and that these 
can  be  intentionally  modified  to  promote  positive  mental  health. 
During  the  Explore  phase,  adolescents  were  taught  to  identify 
individuals and situations that felt like a burden. While, during the 
“Assess Options” phase they were involved in challenging distorted 
cognition through reality-checking, and by scheduling activities that 
were aimed at reducing perceptions of burdensomeness. In the Plan 
phase, adolescents were asked to schedule specific activities, and to 
plan reminders to ensure completion, which was likely to increase the 
likelihood of completing the planned activities (52).

Yet another study was done by Pannebakker et al. (53), to evaluate 
the  impact  of  the  Skills  4  Life  (S4L),  Social  Emotional  Learning 
program on secondary school students. The intervention focused on 
mental wellbeing and associated risk factors, such as self-esteem, self-
efficacy, and social skills. The initial four lessons of the S4L curriculum 
aimed to introduce students to its center rules, by enhancing their 
cognizance of thoughts, feelings, and behavior, providing alternatives 
for  thinking,  and  correcting  illogical  thinking.  The  program  was 
found  to  be  particularly  effective  for  adolescents  with  lower 
educational  levels,  emphasizing  the  value  of  implementing  Social 
Emotional Learning programs for this vulnerable group.

Refer  to  Tables  2,  3  for  details  and  Nature  of  intervention  in 

empirical and non-empirical record.

Table  1  offers  a  comprehensive  overview  of  the  focus  areas 
embedded in various suicide prevention programs, categorizing each 
study  based  on  whether  it  addressed  dimensions  such  as  suicidal 
ideation/planning, suicidal attempt, suicidal behavior/action, suicidal 
death,  self-injury  risk,  suicidal  stigma,  health-seeking  intention/
behavior, and suicide literacy (with a “y” indicating inclusion). The 
analysis reveals a predominant emphasis on early intervention, as 
evidenced by the majority of studies (54, 55) focusing on early-stage 
indicators like ideation and attempts, suggesting that these programs 
are designed primarily to detect and intervene before the escalation of 
suicidal  behavior.  In  contrast,  fewer  studies  address  later-stage 
outcomes such as suicidal behavior/action and suicidal death, likely 
due to the challenges in measuring these outcomes or a deliberate 
focus  on  earlier  prevention.  Moreover,  while  some  programs 
incorporate dimensions of self-injury risk and psychosocial factors 
such as suicidal stigma, health-seeking behavior, and suicide literacy, 
these elements are not uniformly represented, indicating that although 
they are recognized as important, they remain underemphasized. This 
variability  in  program  scope  points  clear  need  for  integrated 
approaches in future research that combine clinical indicators with 
broader psychosocial factors and adopt standardized metrics to better 
evaluate and compare the effectiveness of suicide prevention strategies.
The scoping review reveals a diverse array of suicide prevention 
interventions organized by target population and delivery method. 
Universal prevention efforts target the general population for mental 
health promotion through multimodal, school-based programs that 
combine screening, gatekeeper training (e.g., QPR), and interactive 
educational modules (56), as well as specific programs like YAM, SOS, 
and SEYLE, which incorporate classroom sessions, role-plays, lectures, 
and digital videos to promote mental health awareness and behavior 
change  (41,  42,  57,  123).  Selective  prevention  strategies,  aimed  at 
at-risk groups, include personality-targeted psychoeducation delivered 
through  face-to-face  sessions  in  schools  (59)  and  mind-based 
interventions  with  group  and  individual  sessions  (60),  as  well  as 
cognitive  behavioral  therapy  with  peer  leadership  (61).  Indicated 
prevention  interventions  focus  on  individuals  exhibiting  early 
symptoms  in  past  or  at  high  risk,  utilizing  approaches  such  as 
motivational 
text  messages  and 
individualized safety plans (62), family-focused SAFETY interventions 
(63),  telehealth  education  via  audiovisual  connections  (64),  and 
cognitive  behavioral  therapy  combined  with  skills  training  (24). 
Additionally,  the  STAT-ED  intervention  integrates  motivational 
interviewing, family engagement, and structured follow-up calls (61). 
This spectrum of interventions, varying in strategy and frequency; 
from  weekly  sessions  to  follow-up  messaging,  underscores  the 
multifaceted and context-specific nature of suicide prevention efforts.
Table 3 categorizes a wide range of suicide prevention interventions 
in non-empirical records, primarily emphasize preventive, educational, 
and  systemic  approaches,  underscoring  the  importance  of  mental 
health literacy, resilience-building, and community engagement. A 
recurring  theme  is  the  universal  application  of  interventions, 
advocating  for  school-wide  implementation  rather  than  targeting 
at-risk individuals alone. The literature supports gatekeeper training 
for educators, structured socio-emotional learning (SEL) programs, 
and  multi-tiered  interventions,  such  as  the  SEYLE  model,  which 
integrates awareness, screening, and referral mechanisms. Additionally,

emphasis is placed on cross-sector collaboration, highlighting the role 
of  teachers,  caregivers,  and  healthcare  professionals  in  a  holistic, 
school-based mental health framework.

Barriers and facilitators of suicide 
prevention programs

There  are  several  barriers  in  the  implementation  of  suicide 
prevention  programs  for  adolescents.  These  include  individual, 
organizational, socio-cultural, and ethical barriers. Individual barriers 
can be sleeping problems, chronic illness, engagement in self-harming 
behaviors,  and  developmental  disabilities.  Organizational  barriers 
encompass limited availability of qualified personnel, brief follow-up 
periods, and lack of specialized training for teachers and counselors 
(65). Socio-cultural barriers include inadequate parental involvement, 
stigma surrounding mental health issues, and differing perspectives 
between parents and adolescents. Ethical barriers include concerns 
about  privacy,  confidentiality,  and  obtaining  parental  consent  for 
young  adolescents  (Tables  4,  5).  These  barriers  can  hinder  the 
effectiveness and accessibility of suicide intervention efforts (66).

Nonetheless, various personal, organizational/institutional, socio-
cultural, and ethical, facilitators can help overcome the challenges 
mentioned above. These include implementing school-based suicide 
awareness programs, early identification and management of high-risk 
groups, fostering socio-emotional life skills, and involving families in 
prevention plans. Additionally, the use of validated screening tools, 
collaboration among multidisciplinary teams, and the provision of 
long-term post-discharge support can enhance the sustainability and 
effectiveness  of  suicide  prevention  efforts  (67).  Furthermore, 
contextually  relevant  interventions,  digital  health  tools,  and 
individualized safety plans can address specific needs and promote 
engagement and ongoing support for at-risk adolescents.

Thematic analysis

A  diverse  array  of  interventions  targeting  adolescent  mental 
health  and  suicide  prevention  has  been  evaluated  using  multiple 
research  designs.  The  studies  encompass  school-based  programs, 
digital and online approaches, therapeutic/psychosocial treatments, 
family  and  community-based  initiatives,  as  well  as  screening  and 
comprehensive  review  efforts.  Outcomes  were  measured  using 
standardized  instruments  such  as  the  Strengths  and  Difficulties 
Questionnaire, Beck scales, Hamilton Depression Scale, and various 
mental health literacy and help-seeking questionnaires.

Studies on school-based interventions

School settings emerged as a primary venue for suicide prevention, 
with  numerous  studies  evaluating  structured  programs  targeting 
adolescents.  The  Youth  Aware  of  Mental  Health  (YAM)  program 
demonstrated effectiveness in reducing suicidal ideation and attempts 
through psychoeducation, interactive discussions, and role-playing 
exercises. Other school-based interventions, such as Kooth (50) and 
Skills 4 Life (53), showed improvements in mental health literacy, self-
efficacy,  and  social  connectedness.  Similarly,  the  Early  Adolescent 
Skills for Emotions (EASE) intervention in refugee populations (46) 
was  effective  in  reducing  internalizing  symptoms  and  improving 

family  relationships.  A  meta-analyses  confirmed  the  small  but 
significant impact of school-based interventions on reducing suicidal 
ideation and behaviors. However, limitations include challenges in 
long-term impact assessment and integration into school curricula 
(51,  68).  The  Teen  Mental  Health  First  Aid  program  successfully 
trained students to recognize suicidality and support peers, reinforcing 
the role of laypersons in crisis intervention (69).

Studies on digital and online interventions

the  LEAP  program  effectively 

The  rise  of  digital  platforms  has  facilitated  accessible,  scalable 
interventions for adolescent mental health. Web-based interventions, 
such  as 
targeted  perceived 
burdensomeness, a key risk factor for suicidal ideation (52). Online and 
mobile psychosocial interventions showed moderate effects on reducing 
suicidal ideation and depression, though more rigorous empirical studies 
are  needed  to  assess  their  long-term  efficacy  (70).  Telehealth-based 
interventions  demonstrated  that  telehealth  programs  significantly 
reduced  depressive  symptoms  and  suicidal  ideation,  with  sustained 
improvements  over  a  year  (64).  Similarly  The  HEYLiFE  program 
improved help-seeking behaviors and reduced stigma, highlighting the 
potential for digital tools in suicide prevention by (40).

Studies on psychosocial and therapeutic 
intervention

Multiple studies underscored the efficacy of Cognitive Behavioral 
Therapy (CBT) and its adaptations in suicide prevention. Brief CBT 
interventions  successfully  reduced  non-suicidal  self-injury  and 
suicidal ideation (71). Similarly, Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT-A) 
also demonstrated effectiveness in reducing self-harm behaviors (72). 
Motivational  interviewing-based  interventions  enhanced  mental

(57). Similarly, mind–body interventions improved mental wellbeing 
and reduced self-harm behaviors (60). These findings suggest that 
structured,  evidence-based  therapies  can  significantly  impact 
adolescent suicidality, though program accessibility remains a concern.

family  and  community 
dimensions emphasized the importance of community engagement 
and open discourse in suicide reduction, advocating for strategies 
that  foster  a  supportive  social  environment  (13).  Similarly,  the 
AIM-SP model, a comprehensive framework designed to translate 
suicide prevention research into clinical practice by integrating risk 
assessment, brief interventions, and ongoing monitoring (38). In a 
related vein, (63) utilized a cognitive behavioral family intervention 
with adolescents who had recently attempted suicide or engaged in 
in  depression, 
self-harm,  achieving  significant  reductions 
hopelessness, and suicidal behavior, along with improved parental 
outcomes. Furthermore, Grupp-Phelan compared a motivational 
interviewing–based intervention (STAT-ED) to enhanced usual care 
in  a  randomized  controlled  trial,  finding  that  while  STAT-ED 
improved the initiation and continuation of mental health treatment, 
it  did  not  significantly  impact  suicidal  ideation  or  depressive 
symptoms in the short term (57). Furthermore, systematic reviews 
highlighted  the  protective  role  of  school  connectedness  and 
supportive  adult  relationships  in  mitigating  suicide  risk  (73). 
Programs emphasizing parent and teacher training improved suicide 
literacy,  though  evidence  for  behavioral  change  remained 
limited (74).

Studies focusing on screening

Screening initiatives and broader systematic reviews have also 
provided valuable insights. The SEYLE study, implemented a two-stage 
school-based screening across 11 European countries and found that 
such screening increased service utilization and lowered suicidality 
among adolescents (71). Similarly, screening interventions aimed at 
preventing  self-harm  and  suicide,  concluding  that  school-based 
approaches can effectively prevent short-term suicidal ideation and 
attempts  (75).  Meanwhile,  some  studies  across  multiple  low-  and 
middle-income countries (LMICs), underscoring the necessity for 
culturally tailored interventions, as no single strategy was found to 
be universally effective (24). Furthermore, Czyz et al. (62) highlighted 
the value of daily self-report surveys in monitoring non-suicidal self-
injury, finding that increases in the intensity and duration of suicidal 
ideation were linked with heightened self-injury risk, emphasizing the 
need for continuous monitoring to inform timely interventions.

Discussion

This scoping review provides a comprehensive synthesis of suicide 
prevention interventions aimed at improving the mental wellbeing of 
school-going adolescents. The findings highlight the effectiveness of 
various  approaches,  including  school-based  programs,  digital 
interventions,  and  community-driven  strategies.  However,  suicide 
prevention  remains  a  multifaceted  challenge  due  to  difficulties  in 
achieving  long-term  impact,  reducing  stigma,  and  ensuring  the 
sustainability of interventions (74).

Barriers in suicide prevention interventions 
in LMICs

Research consistently shows that school-based interventions can 
enhance help-seeking behaviors and reduce suicidal ideation among 
adolescents  (76).  However,  their  implementation  faces  significant 
barriers, largely due to persistent misconceptions such as the belief that 
discussing suicide may increase suicidal thoughts (77). Contrary to this 
concern, evidence suggests that structured screening programs do not 
heighten distress or suicidal behavior. However, screening for suicidal 
thoughts  and  behaviors  does  not  have  harmful  effects  or  increase 
distress  (56,  68).  Suicide  literacy  involves  understanding  its  four 
components;  warning  signals,  causes,  risk  factors/treatments,  and 
preventive approaches. Ludwig et al.’s study among German adults 
revealed average literacy with low stigma and minimal normalization 
(78), while research among Arab youth noted high stigma, limited 
literacy, and negative views on seeking mental health support (79). 
Similarly,  a  cross-sectional  study  involving  616  participants  in 
Bangladesh  revealed  that  increased  understanding  of  suicide  was 
associated  with  reduced  stigmatizing  attitudes  (80).  Hence,  future 
studies  should  place  greater  emphasis  on  exploring  the  potential 
benefits of suicide prevention interventions to increase suicidal literacy 
and enhancing wellbeing for young populations in developing countries.
A major research gap exists in the underrepresentation of studies 
from low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), which make up 73% 
of the global population (81) Despite accounting for 75% of suicides, 
LMICs receive limited attention in suicide prevention research. Around 
90% of suicide cases involve a psychiatric condition, with untreated 
severe depression being the most common at the time of death (82). 
Given that two-thirds of countries fall into the LMIC category, there is 
an  urgent  need  for  targeted  research  and  culturally  relevant 
interventions to address depression and suicide in these regions (24).

Addressing stigma and cultural barriers

Stigma remains a significant barrier to effective suicide prevention. 
Although increasing public awareness and psychological health literacy 
has helped diminish the stigma around mental illness, enhancing the 
availability  of  mental  health  services  remains  essential  to  effectively 
support  adolescents  and  young  adults  (43).  Moreover,  taboos 
surrounding suicidal thoughts often instill fear of societal judgment and 
discrimination  among  those  having  such  thoughts,  which  further 
discourage seeking essential professional intervention (83). These taboos 
and stigmas influence attitudes and behaviors toward seeking assistance 
especially in LMICs (41, 42). The stigma surrounding suicide has led to 
a hidden crisis, preventing many individuals from seeking support for 
the psychological distress that often precedes suicidal behavior (84).

Research  among  Arab  youth  and  South  Asian  communities 
underscores  deeply  ingrained  stigma  and  limited  suicide  literacy, 
which  discourage  help-seeking  behaviors  (85).  Suicide  prevention 
efforts must incorporate educational programs to enhance awareness, 
challenge misconceptions, and foster open discussions about mental 
health (76). Additionally, culturally tailored interventions such as role-
playing exercises, peer-led discussions, and gatekeeper training for 
educators  have  shown  promise  in  indigenous  and  marginalized 
communities,  reinforcing  the  importance  of  context-sensitive 
approaches (86).

Role of parents, educators, and community 
engagement

Parents, educators, and communities play a crucial role in suicide 
prevention. Studies indicate that equipping parents and teachers with 
knowledge  on  recognizing  warning  signs  and  fostering  open 
communication can significantly reduce suicide risk among adolescents 
(74).  Furthermore,  school-based  gatekeeper  programs  have 
demonstrated  effectiveness  in  improving  early  detection  and 
intervention  (87).  Despite  their  proven  benefits,  sustaining  and 
systematizing  these  programs  remains  a  challenge.  Strengthening 
school-based  support  systems  through  collaboration  with  mental 
health professionals can enhance intervention effectiveness, particularly 
in resource-constrained settings. Educating parents and teachers on 
effectively responding to, and supporting, youth experiencing suicidal 
thoughts  or  self-harm  can  play  a  pivotal  role  in  fostering  open 
communication and reducing suicide risk. As Adolescents are greatly 
impacted by societal factors, with isolation being a major predictor of 
self-harm tendencies especially in LMIC’s (88). Nurturing family bonds 
and  stable  parental  wellbeing  lower  suicide  risk,  whereas  parental 
mental disorders and self-inflicted death heighten susceptibility (89).

To alleviate parental apprehensions about revealing suicide risks, 
school-based SPI should maintain strict confidentiality and participation 
protocols  while  ensuring  both  parents  and  adolescents  are  well-
informed. Strengthening gatekeeper programs for educators is crucial, 
as they play a significant role in detecting both risk and protective factors 
related  to  adolescent  suicide  (90).  Cooperation  among  government 
agencies, communities, religious leaders, schools, and parents is vital for 
setting  long-term  objectives  and  effective  strategies  for  adolescent 
suicide prevention and intervention. Furthermore, research on school-
based SPI must be more systematic and comprehensive.

Culturally sensitive and contextual relevant 
program

Various  approaches  like  cultural  resource  personnel,  teacher 
capacity-building, and culturally tailored role-playing for problem-
solving  with  peer  feedback.  A  study  supported  this  point  that 
culturally  adapted  suicide  prevention  programs  in  schools  and 
communities are particularly vital for indigenous youth, given the 
limited availability of primary healthcare in indigenous areas (11). 
Although  culturally  tailored  and  community-based  psychosocial 
programs,  along  with  engagement  with  skilled  mental  health 
professionals, could greatly benefit the most at-risk young individuals. 
However, implementing such strategies may be challenging in low- 
and middle-income countries (LMICs) due to limited resources and 
restricted access to qualified healthcare providers and services, suicide 
prevention in these regions must remain a top priority (91).

Successful cross-cultural adaptation in suicide prevention requires 
aligning  initiatives  with  local  principles,  customs,  and  needs. 
Nevertheless, low and middle-income nations encounter difficulties 
in prioritizing suicide deterrence due to scarce assets (92). Merely 10% 
possess a national suicide prevention framework, and the availability 
of mental health personnel is considerably lower than in developed 
nations (91). Given these limitations and the fluctuation of suicide 
occurrences, regionally suitable, culturally sensitive, and economical 
solutions are crucial (92).

A  study  of  134,228  youths  aged  14  in  LMICs  revealed  that 
harassment exposure tripled the likelihood of suicide attempts in 47 
out of 48 nations. This connection appeared dose-responsive, with a 
12-month attempt rate of 5.9% for non-victims, surging fivefold to 
32.7% for those harassed 20–30 days monthly (93). The punishment 
of suicide attempts in 35 LMICs, with consequences like fines or jail 
time, is linked to higher suicide rates, especially among women in 
less-developed  countries.  Fear  of  punishment  stops  people  from 
seeking help, delays medical care, and may lead to more deadly suicide 
methods and inaccurate reporting (94).

In Pakistan, implementing universal suicide risk screening for 
adolescents in schools could help early detection, and 24/7 rapid and 
prompt access services but challenges remain due to stigma, lack of 
mental health policies, and limited healthcare resources (95). Suicide 
rates  differ  significantly  between  countries, 
indicating  that 
sociocultural factors may play a role in suicidal behavior. Goldston 
et  al.  (96)  emphasize  the  need  to  consider  cultural  differences  in 
suicide triggers, responses, help-seeking behaviors, and risk/protective 
factors.  Thus,  research  should  focus  on  interventions  tailored  to 
diverse cultural environments, ensuring that programs are culturally 
relevant and thoroughly assessed. The absence of culturally sensitive 
prevention  programs  in  educational  settings  represents  a  major 
limitation, potentially leading to both economic and human costs, 
highlighting the importance of addressing this gap to develop more 
effective and inclusive suicide prevention approaches (97).

Gatekeeper  training  utilizes  peer-to-peer  support,  equipping 
non-mental health professionals to intervene during suicidal crises, 
making it a practical approach in resource-limited settings with a 
shortage  of  mental  health  specialists.  It  aligns  with  task-shifting 
strategies, underscoring the necessity for more randomized controlled 
trials (RCTs) in LMICs (33). Likewise, several universal interventions 
focus  on  enhancing  help-seeking  behaviors  and  disseminating 
information about available services, but they assume the presence of 
accessible and affordable mental healthcare, which may be lacking in 
certain regions (87).

Culturally and socioeconomically tailored 
mental health interventions

Mental health interventions must be tailored to reflect cultural 
contexts, societal conditions, and specific perceptions of depression 
and suicidal behaviors. Numerous low- and middle-income countries 
allocate minimal resources to mental health care, with India investing 
only  $0.22  per  capita  and  Pakistan  designating  merely  0.4%  of  its 
healthcare  budget  to  these  services  (98).  Future  research  should 
prioritize examining the potential impact of a country’s economic 
standing on mental health prevention and intervention outcomes, 
particularly for adolescents experiencing depression and/or suicidal 
tendencies  (24).  Integrating  mental  health  into  primary  care  has 
several benefits. First, it helps provide more complete, patient-centered 
care by addressing both physical and mental health needs together. 
Second, it can reduce stigma and encourage more people and their 
families  to  seek  mental  health  support.  Additionally,  combining 
therapy with skills like communication, problem-solving, and social 
development may be more effective than therapy alone (24). A review 
of suicide prevention interventions in South Korea emphasizes the 
importance of culturally tailored SPI modifications to better assist

researchers,  mental  health  professionals,  educators,  parents,  and 
policymakers (90).

Government recognize that fostering adolescent health leads to 
healthier adults who contribute to their communities while reducing 
costs associated with lost productivity and healthcare. Therefore, they 
support and invest in preventive mental health interventions. It is 
essential to develop comprehensive mental wellbeing programs that 
are effective in low- and middle-income countries (99).

A  review  of  27  studies  recommended  that  Suicide  prevention 
programs are most effective in enhancing awareness and helping skills, 
with comparatively smaller effects on suicide behavior, psychological 
wellness, and distress (100).

Integrating suicide prevention into national health primary care 
programs necessitates the design and implementation of evidence-
based  interventions  both  established  and  innovative  (19).  While 
comprehensive mental health care is crucial, it is equally imperative 
to have access to timely, responsive, and quality clinical care for early 
recognition  and  referral  to  counselors,  for  individuals  showing 
suicidal behaviors (101).

The economic classification of countries, as defined by the World 
Bank,  significantly  influences  healthcare  investment  and  access  to 
mental health services. Nations with a Gross National Income (GNI) 
of $1,005 or less are categorized as low-income, while those with a 
GNI between $1,006 and $3,955 fall into the lower-middle-income 
bracket (102). Many LMICs struggle to prioritize suicide prevention 
due  to  financial  constraints,  with  only  10%  possessing  a  national 
suicide  prevention  strategy  (91).  The  availability  of  mental  health 
professionals remains significantly lower in these regions compared to 
high-income countries, further exacerbating gaps in care. Given these 
limitations,  suicide  prevention  efforts  in  LMICs  must  focus  on 
developing  cost-effective,  culturally 
scalable 
interventions. Regional adaptation of strategies such as: community-
based gatekeeper programs, integration of mental health into primary 
care, and the use of digital health solutions can enhance intervention 
sustainability (92).

sensitive,  and 

Policy and structural considerations in 
LMICs

A  stark  disparity  exists  between  high-  and  low-income 
countries in suicide prevention efforts. Only 10% of LMICs have a 
national  suicide  prevention  strategy,  and  mental  health  funding 
remains critically low (1). For instance, India allocates only $0.22 
per capita to mental health care, while Pakistan dedicates a mere 
0.4%  of  its  healthcare  budget  to  mental  health  services  (103). 
Integrating  suicide  prevention  into  primary  healthcare  and 
adopting task-shifting strategies—such as gatekeeper training for 
non-specialist  health  workers,  could  help  bridge  this  gap  and 
expand access to care (104).

Moreover, in 35 LMICs, suicide attempts remain criminalized, 
deterring individuals from seeking help and exacerbating suicide-
related  mortality  (105).  Legislative  reforms,  coupled  with  public 
awareness campaigns, are necessary to shift societal perceptions of 
suicide from a criminal offense to a public health priority. Restricting 
access to lethal means—such as pesticides, firearms, and high-risk 
locations—has been identified as one of the most cost-effective suicide 

India’s  2011  endosulfan  prohibition  resulted 

prevention strategies worldwide (21). In Bangladesh, the 2000 ban on 
WHO Class 1 pesticides led to a 37% drop in self-poisoning fatalities, 
preventing an estimated 35,000 suicides between 2001 and 2014 (106). 
Likewise, 
in 
approximately 28,600 fewer pesticide-related suicides. In Sri Lanka, 
successive restrictions on Class 1 pesticides in the 1980s and 1990s, 
followed  by  additional  bans  (2008–2010),  led  to  a  50%  decline  in 
pesticide  suicides  (2011–2015),  particularly  among  young  adults. 
Conversely, Iran reported a rise in aluminum phosphide poisonings 
after banning the substance in 2007 (107). The elimination of highly 
hazardous pesticides from agricultural use is expected to be a more 
effective  suicide  prevention  strategy  in  rural  Asia  (108).  While 
pesticide bans substantially reduced suicide rates, some declines were 
counterbalanced by increases in other suicide methods, emphasizing 
the need for comprehensive prevention strategies.

Future implications

Contextually relevant and tailored interventions, addressing the 
unique needs of adolescents, coupled with ongoing evaluation, and 
collaboration among stakeholders, are essential for advancing suicide 
prevention efforts. Recommendations include the implementation of 
school-based  mental  health  services,  screening  programs,  and 
interventions targeting specific risk factors, such as substance use and 
interpersonal conflicts. Additionally, efforts are needed to destigmatize 
mental health issues, enhance access to support services at the school 
level,  and  to  empower  adolescents  through  resilience-building 
programs, for promoting mental wellbeing and for preventing suicide 
among this vulnerable population. To effectively prevent adolescent 
suicidality in LMICs, practitioners should collaborate across fields 
such as nursing, teaching, and counseling for capacity building to 
strengthen school-based support and improve access to care for at-risk 
youth (109). Mental health challenges significantly affect individuals, 
families, and communities, influencing societal aspects such as social 
and economic stability (104). Addressing this issue requires not only 
healthcare  interventions  but  also  school-based  mental  health 
programs, which play a vital role in promoting wellbeing and fostering 
a more equitable society (110).

Online interventions be utilized as a cost-effective and scalable 
means to support at-risk individuals. Additionally, the potential of 
passive  smartphone  monitoring  as  an  inexpensive  method  for 
assessing  risk  warrants  further  investigation  to  establish  its 
effectiveness (82). Limiting access to highly fatal suicide methods is a 
proven prevention approach especially in LMICs, as most survivors 
do  not  attempt  again  (82).  Globally,  restricting  pesticides  has 
significantly reduced suicide rates, particularly in rural areas of China, 
India, and Sri Lanka. Installing barriers, safety nets, surveillance, and 
conducting  regular  patrols  at  high-risk  drowning  sites  can  help 
prevent impulsive suicides (111).

Future suicide prevention efforts should focus on contextually 
relevant,  culturally  adapted,  and  sustainable  interventions. 
Longitudinal  studies  are  necessary  to  assess  the  long-term 
effectiveness  of  school-based,  community-driven,  and  digital 
interventions  in  various  socio-economic  settings  (112).  The 
integration  of  digital  innovations,  including  AI-driven  mental 
health support, passive smartphone monitoring, and telehealth

services, offers scalable and cost-effective solutions to bridge gaps 
in mental health care (113). Policy development remains crucial, 
with  LMIC  governments  needing  to  prioritize  national  suicide 
prevention  strategies  and  integrate  mental  health  services  into 
primary healthcare (1). Moreover, cultural adaptation is essential, 
as  interventions  must  align  with  local  beliefs,  traditions,  and 
economic  conditions  to  maximize  impact  and  community 
engagement  (86).  Improving  mental  health  literacy  through 
awareness campaigns is another key approach to reducing stigma 
and fostering proactive help-seeking behaviors (114). Additionally, 
limiting access to lethal means, such as pesticide bans, firearm 
control,  and  safety  barriers  at  high-risk  locations,  has  proven 
effective in reducing suicide rates, particularly in rural areas of 
China,  India,  and  Sri  Lanka  (82,  111).  Lastly,  multisectoral 
collaboration  among  governments,  educators,  healthcare 
professionals, and policymakers is essential to develop sustainable, 
evidence-based strategies that comprehensively address adolescent 
suicide prevention.

Strengths

This  scoping  review  provides  a  robust  synthesis  of  peer-
reviewed literature on adolescent suicide prevention interventions, 
with  a  particular  emphasis  on  LMICs.  The  review  employed  a 
rigorous methodology, utilizing systematic searches across major 
health databases to ensure a comprehensive evaluation of available 
interventions. One of the primary strengths of this study is its 
focus on suicide prevention strategies tailored to resource-limited 
settings, offering critical insights into culturally and economically 
viable approaches. Additionally, the review identified the use of 
validated outcome measures, ensuring reliability and accuracy in 
assessing 
incorporating  an 
interdisciplinary  perspective,  the  review  highlights  the  crucial 
roles of educators, mental health professionals, policymakers, and 
researchers  in  designing  and  implementing  suicide  prevention 
programs.  Moreover,  the  emphasis  on  school-based  and 
community-driven  interventions  reinforces  the  importance  of 
engaging  adolescents  directly  in  mental  health  promotion  and 
suicide prevention efforts.

Limitations

Despite its contributions, this review has several limitations. 
The exclusion of non-English studies may have resulted in the 
omission  of  valuable  research,  particularly  from  LMICs  where 
regional languages dominate academic discourse. Additionally, 
while  multiple  databases  were  searched,  the  inclusion  of  gray 
literature,  unpublished  dissertations,  and  institutional  reports 
could  have  further  enriched  the  analysis.  The  limited  scope  of 
included  studies  and  the  40%  inclusion  threshold  may  have 
restricted the dataset, potentially impacting the generalizability of 
findings.  Furthermore,  the  review  does  not  conduct  direct 
assessments  of  intervention  effectiveness,  relying  instead  on 
secondary  data,  which  may  introduce  biases  related  to  study 
design and reporting. Given the vast socio-economic and cultural 
diversity  among  LMICs,  the  generalizability  of  findings  across 

different  regions  remains  a  challenge,  necessitating  localized 
research to tailor interventions more effectively.

Conclusion

This  scoping  review  underscores  the  urgent  need  for 
comprehensive,  evidence-based,  and  culturally  sensitive  suicide 
prevention interventions for adolescents, particularly in LMICs. The 
findings highlight the effectiveness of school-based programs, digital 
mental  health  interventions,  and  resilience-building  initiatives  in 
reducing adolescent suicide risk. While high-income countries have 
implemented  universal  psychosocial  programs, 
successfully 
significant gaps remain in LMICs, where limited resources and a lack 
of mental health infrastructure pose considerable challenges. School-
based interventions, including socio-emotional learning programs, 
peer support initiatives, and mental health literacy campaigns, have 
demonstrated promising results in enhancing adolescent wellbeing 
and reducing suicidality. Additionally, integrating suicide prevention 
strategies  within  primary  healthcare,  strengthening  community 
support systems, and addressing structural barriers to mental health 
services are crucial steps toward reducing adolescent suicide rates 
globally.  Future  research  should  focus  on  longitudinal  studies, 
culturally adapted interventions, and multi-sectoral collaboration to 
enhance suicide prevention efforts. By prioritizing sustainable and 
inclusive strategies, LMICs can make significant strides in improving 
adolescent mental health and mitigating the global burden of suicide.
