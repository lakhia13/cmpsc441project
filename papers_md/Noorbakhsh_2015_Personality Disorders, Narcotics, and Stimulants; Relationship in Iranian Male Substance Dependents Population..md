Background: 

Individuals  with  certain  personality  disorders,  especially  the  antisocial  and  borderline  personality  disorders,  are  more 

prone to substance use disorders.
Objectives: 

Regarding  the  importance  of  substance  use  disorders,  this  study  aimed  to  explore  the  association  between  personality 

disorders and types of used drugs (narcotics and stimulants) in Iranian male substance users.
Patients and Methods: 

The current study was a correlation study. We evaluated 285 male substance users and excluded 25 according 
to exclusion criteria. A total of 130 narcotic users and 130 stimulant users were recruited randomly in several phases from January 2013 
to October 2013. All participants were referred to Substance Dependency Treatment Clinics in Tehran, Iran. Data collection process was 
accomplished by means of clinical interview based on DSM-V criteria for substance use disorders, Iranian version of addiction severity 
index (ASI), and Millon clinical multi-axial inventory-III (MCMI-III). Data were analyzed by SPSS 21 using Pearson correlation coefficient and 
regression, the.
Results: 

There was a significant correlation between stimulant use and histrionic personality disorder (P < 0.001) and antisocial and 
narcissistic personality disorders (P < 0.05). In addition, correlation between avoidant, histrionic, and narcissistic personality disorders 
(P < 0.05) and depressed, antisocial, and borderline personality disorders (P < 0.001) with narcotics consumption were significant. In 
clusters, there was a significant correlation between cluster B personality disorders, and narcotic and stimulants consumption (P < 0.001). 
In addition, this association was explored between cluster C personality disorder and narcotics (P < 0.001).
Conclusions: 

The results of this study in terms of personality disorders and types of used drugs were in accordance with the previous 

studies results. It is necessary to design appropriate treatment plans for medical treatment of those with personality disorders.

1. Background

Before the third edition of DSM, substance and alcohol 
dependency  were  considered  as  symptoms  of  personal-
ity  disorders  (PDs).  However,  in  the  third  edition,  drug 
consumption was identified as “substance use disorders” 
(SUD) (1). From then on, psychologic comorbidities have 
been viewed as an important subject in drug consump-
tion  (2).  The  PDs  are  rigid,  inflexible,  and  maladaptive 
behavior patterns, which are severe enough to cause sig-
nificant impairments in functioning or internal distress. 
They  are  enduring  and  persistent  style  of  behavior  and 
thought,  not  atypical  episodes  (3).  The  high  prevalence 
of DSM-IV PDs among those with SUDs was evidently indi-
cated in the research literature (4, 5). A recent literature 
review  (6)  summarized  prevalence  rates  and  concluded 
that estimates of the overall axis II prevalence range from 
34%  to  73%  in  treated  substance  users,  with  and  border-
line PDs as the most prevalent ones. 

A short review on previous studies revealed individuals 
with certain PDs, especially the antisocial PD, were more 
prone  to  SUD  (7-9),  and  persons  dependent  to  different 
types  of  drugs  showed  more  PDs  comorbidity  (10,  11). 
One  meta-analyze  has  shown  that  patients  under  medi-
cal treatment for SUD display more comorbidity with PDs 
than normal individuals do (12). Another study conduct-
ed by Grana et al. (13) showed the chronic drug consumers 
had higher scores in schizoid PD and antisocial PD than 
the functional consumers did. Considering the corrobo-
ration  of  the  aforementioned  reality,  authors  like  San 
Narciso  et  al.  (14)  found  the  most  frequently  diagnosed 
PDs  in  heroin  substance  users  undergoing  methadone 
maintenance  treatment  were  antisocial  and  borderline 
PD. In addition, Grana et al. (13) found that antisocial and 
schizoid traits are the most outstanding traits of heroin 
substance  users  and  multidrug  consumers.  However,

cocaine  use  (15)  is  often  associated  with  psychiatric  co-
morbidity such as antisocial PD (24%), major depressive 
disorder  (18%),  and  posttraumatic  stress  disorder  (12%). 
Applying Millon Clinical Multi-Axial Inventory-III (MCMI-
III), Craig (16) focused on range of PDs in 443 individuals 
with drug dependency. In both groups, antisocial (60%), 
passive-aggressive  (34%),  and  depressive  PDs  (32%)  were 
the most prevalent PDs. In a study on heroin users in Tai-
wan, 58.5% of men and 62.5% of women had at least one 
axis-I psychiatric disorder or antisocial PD (17).

It is generally accepted that substance users prefer drugs 
that have best effects on healing their personality problems 
and use other kind of drugs only when they are deprived of 
the  preferred  ones  (6,  18).  Evident  reveals  that  drugs  may 
be choose by a substance user due to their self-medicating 
effects  (19).  Robbins  (20)  points  out  that  substance  users 
use  drug  to  reduce  their  social  anxieties.  He  also  argues 
that narcotics users may use them to overcome aggression. 
However, these suggestions about the specific association 
between psychological problems and drug choosing have 
not  been  scrutinized.  Yet  drugs  are  the  most  powerful 
means to change one’s mental state because of their effects 
on  minimizing  psychological  problems.  Some  patients 
abuse drugs to reduce anxieties, irritation, and depression. 
Therefore, in cases of self-medication, it would be better to 
consider a proper plan to solve fundamental problems (19).
This study aimed to determine the association between 
PDs  and  types  of  drugs  in  Iranian  substance  users.  The 
PDs of cluster B, especially borderline and antisocial PDs, 
and SUD and its intensity were studied largely in previous 
studies. This study aimed to study all types of PD. 

2. Objectives

No  research  has  concentrated  on  comparing  narcot-
ics  (including  opium,  shireh,  heroin,  and  crack,  a  kind 
of  compacted  heroin  made  in  Iran)  with  stimulants  (as 
amphetamine, methamphetamine and cocaine) in Iran. 
Undoubtedly, any knowledge about the personal charac-
teristic of these groups of drug users sheds new lights on 
the more effective medical and psychological treatment 
for  better  outcomes.  Thus,  if  routine  personality  assess-
ment improves outcomes of SUD treatment, the clinical 
implication will be increasing the use of PD assessment 
in SUD treatment settings (21).

3. Patients and Methods

Current study was a correlation study. To determine the 
sample size, the Cochran’s sample size formula for corre-
lation studies (22) was used (Equation 1, in which T = 1.96, 
P = 0.5, q = 0.5, and d = 0.11). The minimum sample size 
needed to obtain statistically valid results was 79, and we 
added 51 more samples to obtain higher validity.

The  samples  were  male  substance  users  aging  18  to  45 
years,  who  met  the  DSM-V  (23)  criteria  for  SUDs  and 
were in diverse treatment programs such as methadone 
maintenance  therapy,  buprenorphine  therapy,  and  de-
toxification  in  private  clinics  for  substance  use  treat-
ment.  The  sample  group  was  260  substance  users,  130 
narcotics  dependents  and  130  stimulant  dependents. 
They  were  selected  randomly  through  several-phases 
sampling  process.  In  first  step,  private  clinics  of  sub-
stance  dependency  treatment  were  classified  into  four 
groups of north, east, west, and south clinics in Tehran, 
Iran. Then in each region, two clinics were selected con-
veniently  regarding  the  clinic  manager’s  tendency  to 
participation in the study. Thus, patients were recruited 
from  centers  for  substance  dependency  treatment  in 
four regions of Tehran. Patients were recruited by gen-
eral  practitioners  (GPs)  working  in  these  centers  until 
the  required  sample  was  reached,  without  a  quota  of 
patients assigned for each center. The inclusion criteria 
were  as  follows:  being  male,  18  age  of  to  65  years,  be-
ing able to understand and read Persian language, and 
willing to participate in the study. Exclusion criteria in-
cluded  schizophrenia  and  psychosis,  incomplete  ques-
tionnaire, and relapse in the preceding two days. Finally, 
25 patients were excluded. Receiving medical treatment 
was not an exclusion criterion; however, treatment was 
not modified or increased during the study period. Di-
agnosis of drug dependency was made with structured 
interview  according  to  Addiction  Severity  Index  (ASI) 
and confirmation of the technical manager of the clinic, 
who were mostly GPs or psychiatrists. All of participants 
filed out MCMI-III to assess type of drug and PDs. Then, a 
psychiatrist or a clinical psychologist confirmed the re-
sult from MCMI-III by interviewing the patient.
3.1. Instruments

1)  ASI:  The  ASI  is  a  semi-structured  interview  for  sub-
stance  abuse  assessment  and  treatment  planning.  The 
ASI  is  designed  to  gather  valuable  information  about 
areas  of  a  client’s  life  that  may  contribute  to  their  sub-
stance-abuse  problems.  The  ASI  was  developed  in  1980 
by  A.  Thomas  McLellan,  along  with  collaborators  from 
the University of Pennsylvania’s center for the Studies of 
Addiction. The ASI was the first standardized assessment 
tool  of  its  kind  to  measure  the  multiple  dimensions  of 
substance  abuse.  It  has  three  categories:  1)  Socio-demo-
graphic: sex, age, years of education, and main source of 
income; 2) Consumption: main substance, type of treat-
ments, and years of consumption; and 3) Severity of de-
pendency.  Overall,  studies  typically  conclude  that  the 
ASI is a consistent and accurate tool for assessing clients 
and  their  substance  abuse  issues.  The  ASI  is  able  to  suc-
cessfully identify the client’s problem area in which they 
are experiencing the greatest difficulties, such as alcohol 
or drug addiction, or legal or familial problems. Once a 
client’s psychosocial issues are identified, an appropriate 
course of treatment should be administered.

Noorbakhsh S et al.Iran Red Crescent Med J. 2015;17(6):e23038Severity  ratings  are  based  on  the  following  ten-point 

scale (range, 0 - 9):

0 - 1, No real problem; treatment is not indicated.
2  -  3,  Slight  problem;  probably  treatment  is  not  neces-

sary.

4 - 5, Moderate problem; some treatment is indicated.
6 - 7, Considerable problem; treatment is necessary.
8  -  9,  Extreme  problem;  treatment  is  absolutely  neces-

sary.

The severity ratings scale allows the interviewer to de-
termine the severity of a client’s problem. The higher the 
score is, the greater the need for treatment in each area 
or immediate intervention will be. The ASI scores can be 
used to profile a client’s problem areas and then plan an 
effective course of treatment (24).

2) MCMI-III: The MCMI-III is a psychologic assessment tool 
intended  to  provide  information  on  psychopathology, 
including  specific  disorders  outlined  in  the  DSM-IV.  It  is 
intended for adults (≥ 18 years old) with at least an eighth-
grade  reading  levels  who  are  currently  seeking  mental 
health  services.  The  MCMI  was  developed  and  standard-
ized specifically on clinical populations, ie, patients in psy-
chiatric  hospitals  or  people  with  existing  mental  health 
problems, and the authors are very specific that it should 
not  be  used  with  the  general  population  or  adolescents 
(25). However, there is a strong evidence that shows it still 
retains  validity  on  non-clinical  populations.  Therefore, 
psychologists often administer the test to members of the 
general population. The MCMI differs from other personal-
ity tests in that it is based on theory and is organized ac-
cording to a multi-axial format. Updates to each version of 
the MCMI coincide with revisions to the DSM (26).

It  is  composed  of  175  true/false  questions  that  report-
edly take 25 to 30 minutes to complete. It was developed 
by Theodore Millon, Carrie Millon, Roger Davis, and Seth 
Grossman (27).

The  test  is  modeled  on  four  scales:  14  personality  dis-
order scales; 10 clinical syndrome scales; five correction 
scales  including  three  modifying  indices  (which  deter-
mine the patient's response style and can detect random 
responding)  and  two  random  response  indicators;  and 
42  Grossman’s  personality  facet  scales,  based  on  Seth 
Grossman's theories of personality and psychopathology. 
The MCMI-III was updated in 2008, with a new norming 
sample  of  752  individuals  (52.8%  female;  76%  Caucasian) 
with a wide range of clinical disorders. The scale develop-
ment stage consisted of 600 of these individuals (48.8% 
male; 84% Caucasian), and the cross-validation stage con-
sisted of the remaining 398 individuals (49.5% male, 81.7% 
Caucasian) (28).

Fourteen  personality  disorder  scales  correspond  with 
Axis II diagnoses of the DSM-IV. They describe more per-
vasive  conditions.  They  are  broken  down  further  into  11 
basic  clinical  personality  patterns  (Scales  1  through  8B) 
and  three  severe  personality  pathology  scales  (scales  S 
through P) (Table 1).

The final validation stage includes convergent and dis-
criminative validity of the test, which is assessed by corre-
lating the test with similar/dissimilar instruments. Posi-
tive predictive value is the likelihood of being right given 
a test positive, which ranged from 0.30 (Masochistic) to 
0.81  (Dependent).  Sensitivity  or  the  proportion  of  indi-
viduals that have a condition and are correctly identified 
ranged from 0.44 (negativistic) to 0.92 (paranoid).

Patients'  raw  scores  are  converted  to  base  rate  (BR) 
scores to allow comparison between the personality indi-
ces. The BR scores are essentially where each score fits on 
a scale of 1 through 115, with the median score of 60. Con-
version to a BR score is relatively complex, and there are 
certain corrections that are administered based on each 
patient's response style.

The Modifying indices are scored using a complex sys-
tem in which the patient's responses in the other scales 
are compared and the raw and BR scores are taken from 
this. However, the invalidity index is an exception and is 
not converted to a BR score (25-27). In Iran, the question-
naire has been normalized by Sharifi et al. (29).

3.2. Ethical Aspects

Informed  consent  was  obtained  from  the  participants. 
Before they give their consent, the patients were provided 
with a general overview of the aims and characteristics of 
the study. They were also informed that they were partici-
pating voluntarily, and that they could choose to withdraw 
at any time with the guarantee that they will continue to 
receive  the  treatment  considered  most  appropriate  by 
their clinic. The Study was approved by the ethical review 
board  of  the  Behavioral  Sciences  Research  Center  of  Sha-
hid  Beheshti  University  of  Medical  Sciences,  Tehran,  Iran 
(11.12.2013; ref: PI10/039). The results were used anonymous-
ly and all of the data were kept confidential in this study.

This  research  was  a  correlation  study.  The  Statistics 
were  analyzed  both  descriptively  and  inferentially.  Ap-
plying Pearson correlation coefficient and linear regres-
sion  in  the  inferential  part,  hypothesis  of  the  research 
were examined. 

4. Results

The average age of the stimulant and narcotics depen-
dents  was  respectively  28.8  and  33.1  years.  Half  of  the 
narcotic  dependents  were  married  (n  =  67),  one  was  di-
vorced, and the rest were single (n = 63). In stimulant de-
pendents, 42 were married, 73 were single, and 15 were di-
vorced. Most of stimulant dependents were single while 
the married and single ones were nearly equal in narcotic 
dependents.  Most  of  the  narcotic  dependents  were  job-
less  while  most  of  stimulant  dependents  had  job.  Most 
of narcotic and stimulant dependents had diploma (cer-
tificate  for  secondary  education  graduates  in  Iran)  or 
were  secondary  education  undergraduates.  In  addition, 
frequency of narcotic dependents with diploma, associ-
ate  degree,  and  bachelor  degree  was  lower  than  that  of 
stimulant dependents. 

In  order  to  explore  the  association  between  PDs  and 
type  of  used  drugs,  Pearson  correlation  coefficient  was 
applied with the results presented in two ways: for each 
PD and for each cluster. 

As  is  shown  in  Table  2,  there  was  a  significant  correla-
tion between stimulant consumption and histrionic PD 
(P  <  0.001),  and  antisocial  PD  and  narcissistic  PD  (P  < 
0.05). In addition, there were significant correlations be-
tween narcotic consumption and histrionic, narcissistic, 
and avoidant (P < 0.05 for all), antisocial, borderline, and 
depressive PDs (P < 0.001 for all).

According  to  Table  3,  examining  correlation  coeffi-
cients between each cluster and type of drug revealed a 
significant correlation between cluster B and narcotics 
and  stimulant  consumption  (P  <  0.001).  On  the  other 
hand, the table shows a significant correlation between 
cluster C and narcotic consumption (P < 0.001). No sig-
nificant  correlation  was  observed  between  cluster  A 
and any drug.

The  results  of  linear  regression  in  Table  4  shows  that 
avoidant,  histrionic,  narcissistic,  depressive,  antisocial, 
and borderline PDs play significant role in narcotic con-
sumption. In addition, histrionic, antisocial, and narcis-
sistic PDs can predict stimulant use.

The aim of this study was to determine the association 
between PDs and types of drugs in Iranian male drug us-
ers. The research findings revealed that there was a signif-
icant association between PDs in cluster B and both nar-
cotic and stimulant consumption, while PDs in cluster A 

had  no  significant  association  with  narcotic  and  stimu-
lant  consumption.  On  the  other  hand,  PDs  in  cluster  C 
also  showed  significant  association  only  with  narcotics 
(e.g. opium, heroin, and crack in Iran) consumption. As 
it was suggested, analyzing the association between cer-

5

Noorbakhsh S et al.Iran Red Crescent Med J. 2015;17(6):e23038tain  types  of  drugs  with  each  PD  proved  that  narcotic 
consumption was associated with histrionic, borderline, 
depressive, avoidant, antisocial, and narcissistic PDs, and 
stimulant usage was associated with narcissistic, antiso-
cial, and histrionic PDs.

These findings were consistent with the previous stud-
ies. Study of PDs and drug of choice in a meta-analysis 
indicated  that  borderline  and  antisocial  PDs  in  stimu-
lant  users,  dependent,  avoidant,  schizoid,  and  border-
line  PDs  in  narcotics  users,  and  in  general,  histrionic 
and  narcissistic  PDs  were  prevalent  among  patients 
with SUD (6, 30). In addition, the comorbidity of SUDs 
and  PDs  is  established  in  many  studies.  For  example, 
antisocial and borderline PDs, as the most common PDs 
in  patients  with  SUD  (6),  have  comorbidity  of  18%  and 
17%,  respectively  (31),  and  half  of  patients  consuming 
buprenorphine  have  borderline  PD  (32).  In  addition, 
antisocial,  borderline,  and  dependent  PDs–cluster  B 
and  C–are  the  most  common  comorbidities  in  heroin 
users  (33-38).  On  the  other  hand,  cocaine  users  show 
more  characteristics  of  schizoid  and  avoidant  traits 
(39),  or  antisocial  PD  (19).  It  can  be  said  that  individu-
als in cluster C have different reasons for their tendency 
to narcotics in comparison with individuals in cluster 
B.  In  fact,  persons  in  cluster  B  because  of  their  illegal 
behavior (40), and persons in cluster C due to their low 
self-esteem, self-dependency, self-sufficiency, and inferi-
ority  in  social  association  are  drown  to  narcotics  con-
sumption (41).

Some studies have proved that heroin users are more 
impulsive  and  aggressive  than  cocaine  users  (42,  43), 
while  other  have  expressed  no  significant  difference 
in  personality  traits  between  cocaine  and  heroin  (44) 
or cannabis abusers (45). Researches consistently have 
provided the evidence of higher impulsivity and emo-
tional  instability  in  multi-drug  abusers,  and  they  had 
higher  levels  of  antisocial,  borderline,  and  passive  ag-
gressive  PDs  (41).  Others  have  signified  that  narcotic 
users  share  characteristics  including  irresponsibility, 
snobbishness, ignoring others, and have PDs, especially 
antisocial and histrionic PDs (46). Other enquiries have 
shown that personality characteristics including reclu-
siveness,  being  antisocial,  sensitive,  and  anxious,  irre-
sponsibility,  and  poor  social  adjustment  and  empathy 
are associated with risky behaviors such as drug use as 
a  way  to  overcome  negative  moods  and  feelings  (47). 
Most  surveys  have  concluded  that  behaviors  such  as 
risky  sexual  behaviors  and  shared  injections  are  asso-
ciated  with  the  above-mentioned  characteristics  (48). 
Trobst et al. (49) argued that risky behaviors are in fact, 
an attempts to reduce anxiety levels and obtain transi-
tory tranquility and pain relief, which are resulted from 
negative  emotions  and  feelings.  These  results  suggest 
that most people who drink alcohol hazardously, or use 
drugs such as cocaine, marijuana, heroin and other nar-
cotics have anxiety, isolation, and loneliness (50).

Generally,  PDs  usually  accompany  with  drug  and  al-

6

cohol consumption. Armstrong and Costello (51) found 
that 60% of drug users, drug abusers, and drug depen-
dents have comorbid PDs. As long as having a psychiat-
ric  disorder  (52,  53),  especially  PDs  (6,  54),  can  signifi-
cantly increase the risk of relapse, drop out, or poorer 
treatment outcomes, these patients need more specific 
treatment plans (55-57). 

In  conclusion,  results  of  the  present  research  were 
in  accordance  with  previous  ones  in  terms  of  PDs  and 
types of consumed drugs. Antisocial and borderline PDs 
are  prevalent  in  stimulant  users,  avoidant,  dependent, 
schizoid, and borderline PDs in alcohol and narcotic us-
ers,  and  in  general,  histrionic  and  narcissistic  PDs  are 
prevalent in those with SUDs. In general, 34.8% to 73% of 
the  treated  substance  users  have  comorbid  PDs  (6).  Ac-
cording to Craig (16), Compton et al. (58), and Grant et al. 
(59), in each group, the prevalence of antisocial PD was 
significant.  Armstrong  and  Costello  (51)  acknowledged 
the  findings  in  teenagers.  In  this  research,  in  compari-
son with stimulant consumption, narcotic consumption 
had higher rate of PDs. Finally, this conclusion could be 
drawn  that  self-medication  effects  of  narcotics,  due  to 
the pain relieving and anxiety-reducing characteristics, 
can cover more PDs, while stimulants have more limited 
self-medicating effects.

The  current  study  was  the  first  study  conducted  on 
both narcotics and stimulant users about PDs on Irani-
an population; however, it study has some limitations. 
For  instance,  it  has  been  conducted  on  men  in  Tehran 
and cannot be generalized to women or substance users 
of other cities. It included population between 18 to 45 
years old and cannot generalize the results to teenagers 
or elderly. The same study can be conducted on women, 
teenagers,  and  population  in  other  cities.  Extensive  re-
search  may  include  their  family  members’  personality 
traits and culture.
