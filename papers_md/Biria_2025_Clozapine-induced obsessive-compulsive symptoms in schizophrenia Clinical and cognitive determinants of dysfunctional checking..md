Abstract

Background. Obsessive-compulsive symptoms (OCS) emerge in a significant proportion of
clozapine-treated schizophrenia patients, affecting social functioning and increasing depres-
sive symptoms. This study investigates the underexplored cognitive mechanisms of
clozapine-induced OCS, particularly focusing on dysfunctional checking behavior.
Methods. Clinical and cognitive profiles of OCS and their relationship to dysfunctional checking
were investigated using a novel checking paradigm (image verification task or IVT) in four
groups: clozapine-treated schizophrenia patients with clozapine-induced OCS (SCZ-OCS, n =
21) and without (SCZ-only, n = 15), patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD, n = 32)
and IQ-matched healthy volunteers (HV, n = 30).
Results. Only SCZ-OCS patients showed a distinctive pattern of dysfunctional checking on the
IVT. Compared with SCZ-OCS, SCZ-only patients exhibited functional checking while having
equivalent deficits in executive cognition, clozapine dose, and treatment duration, though with
less severe positive and depressive symptoms. In SCZ-OCS, dysfunctional checking was posi-
tively correlated with clozapine dose and working memory performance. By contrast, OCD
patients’ checking was positively related to intolerance of uncertainty. Checking in the OCD and
SCZ-OCS groups was positively correlated with YBOCS-compulsion.
Conclusion. This study is the first to compare the distinct cognitive and clinical profiles of SCZ-
OCS, SCZ-only, and OCD, with a focus on checking behavior, a major symptom in clozapine-
treated patients. We introduced a novel and sensitive measure for checking, which showed
dysfunctional checking only in SCZ-OCS patients treated with clozapine. These findings
indicate that a subset of patients with schizophrenia with more severe positive symptoms and
cognitive deficits are especially susceptible to OCD symptoms when treated with clozapine.

Introduction

Obsessive compulsive symptoms (OCS), such as intrusive thoughts and the compulsion to
perform ritualistic behaviors, develop in a significant proportion of chronic schizophrenia
patients treated with clozapine (Fernandez-Egea et al., 2018, Schirmbeck & Zink, 2012, Grover
et al., 2015). These symptoms are associated with a range of negative outcomes, including reduced
social functioning (Tonna et al., 2015), increased positive and depressive symptoms (Biria et al.,
2019; Parkin et al., 2023), and a greater risk of suicide (Szmulewicz et al., 2015). However, despite
the high prevalence of this comorbidity and its negative consequences, no studies have yet
characterized the cognitive mechanisms underpinning their development after starting the
treatment with clozapine.

Clozapine is an atypical or second-generation antipsychotic, typically utilized to manage
refractory schizophrenia. It binds to a large number of receptors (Stahl, 2000), acting as an
antagonist especially at 5-HT2A, 5-HT1A, and 5-HT2C- receptors, as well as dopamine

(especially D2) receptors (Meltzer & Huang, 2008). Both the inci-
dence and severity of OCS among patients with chronic schizo-
phrenia has been positively associated with clozapine dose and/or
plasma levels (Biria et al., 2019; Fernandez-Egea et al., 2024; Gürcan
et al., 2021; Kim et al., 2020; Lin et al., 2006; Mukhopadhaya et al.,
2009; Reznik et al., 2004; Schirmbeck et al., 2011). Moreover,
duration of clozapine treatment is also positively associated with
symptom severity – while 25% of patients exhibit excessive check-
ing behavior after 5 years of treatment, this rises to over 50% after 10
years (Fernandez-Egea et al., 2018). Excessive checking is the most
commonly reported obsessive compulsive symptom in both pure
OCD patients (Ruscio et al., 2010) and schizophrenia patients with
OCS (Fernandez-Egea et al., 2018, Grover et al., 2015). However,
the factors causing excessive checking behavior remain unclear.

Previously, checking in schizophrenia has mainly been studied
with self-reported measures such as obsessive-compulsive inven-
tory (OCI; Foa et al., 1998) and, to our knowledge, has never been
compared in groups of patients with and without OCS. However, an
objective means of assessing checking under different environmen-
tal demands in these groups as well as OCD is required. A variety of
behavioral tasks has been used to investigate checking in OCD
patients (Clair et al., 2013; Jaafari et al., 2013; Rotge et al., 2015),
but these tasks have not considered the functionality of checking.
Checking is functional if it improves the monitoring of perform-
ance but is dysfunctional and superfluous if it does not. For this
purpose, we used in this study our novel IVT task (Biria et al., 2024),
which has been designed to capture this distinction under a variety
of conditions leading to anxiety including high uncertainty and
reinforcement contingencies such as punishment.

A comparison, therefore, between checking performance across
the two schizophrenia groups (SCZ-OCS and schizophrenia with-
out OCS) with equivalent dose of clozapine and treatment duration
and OCD patients is required. Previously, OCD and SCZ-OCS
patients have been differentiated in terms of their cognitive flexi-
bility deficits (Chamberlain et al., 2021; Patel et al., 2010; Schirm-
beck et al., 2013). While working memory deficits are prominent in
schizophrenia patients (Bowie & Harvey, 2006; Forbes et al., 2009;
Goldberg & Green, 2002; Lee & Park, 2005) and could possibly play
a role in checking behavior, they are less commonly reported in
OCD patients as a cause for checking (Greisberg & McKay, 2003;
Kalenzaga et al., 2020; Olley et al., 2007; Persson et al., 2021; Woods
et al., 2002).

We aimed to test the following hypotheses among four groups:
patients with OCD, clozapine-treated schizophrenia patients with
(SCZ-OCS; with OCS starting only after the clozapine treatment)
and without OCS (SCZ-only), and healthy volunteers (HV):

H1: OCD and SCZ-OCS patients will show dysfunctional checking
(i.e., checking that is dysfunctional, which does not improve per-
formance, hence superfluous), particularly under conditions of
high uncertainty and punished checking.

H2: Aspects of executive cognition, such as cognitive flexibility and
working memory, will be more impaired among subjects with SCZ-
OCS compared to other groups and may be related to their exces-
sive checking behavior.

H3: Clozapine dosage, treatment duration, and schizophrenia
symptoms (positive and depressive symptoms) will be related to
checking in SCZ-OCS but not the SCZ-only group.

Overall, testing these hypotheses will enhance our understand-
ing of the significance of checking symptoms in schizophrenia as
another aspect of executive cognition contributing to functionality
in everyday life.

Methods

Participants

Participants were 30 healthy volunteers, 32 OCD patients, and
38 clozapine-treated schizophrenia patients. Of the latter, 23 exhib-
ited OCS, and were enrolled in the SCZ-OCS group, while 15 par-
ticipants did not exhibit OCS (the SCZ-only group). All
participants were fluent in English, possessed normal or corrected-
to-normal vision and were matched for age and verbal IQ. The
OCD and healthy groups were also matched for gender. Table 1
shows the demographic and clinical characterization of all groups.
This study was approved by the East of England - Cambridge South
Research Ethics Committee (REC 16/EE/0465) for OCD and
healthy volunteers and the Cambridge and Peterborough NHS
Foundation Trust (REC 18/EE/0073) for patients with schizophre-
nia. All volunteers gave written informed consent before beginning
the testing and received monetary compensation for taking part in
the study.

Presence of an OCD or schizophrenia diagnosis was confirmed
through clinician assessment with reference to DSM-IV criteria.
All OCD patients had a primary diagnosis of OCD and no other
comorbid Axis-I mental disorders. OCD and SCZ-OCS patients
were recruited if they scored >7 on the Yale- Brown Obsessive
Compulsive Scale (YBOCS, Goodman et al., 1989) and > 42 on the
obsessive-compulsive inventory (Foa et al., 1998). SCZ-only
patients were included if after 5 years of treatment on clozapine
they scored <3 on the YBOCS, and a total score of <42 on the OCI.
Additionally, any schizophrenia patients with a history of OCD
(either successfully treated or with ongoing OCS) were not
recruited for this study. Healthy controls had no current or past
psychiatric disorders as determined by a screening interview
including the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview
(MINI; Sheehan et al., 1998), the Montgomery-Asberg Depression
Rating Scale (MADRS; Montgomery & Asberg, 1979), and the
OCI (< 42). For all participants, excessive drug or alcohol use,
neurological deficits, or head injury were exclusion criteria. Both
groups of schizophrenia patients (SCZ-OCS and SCZ-only)
received comparable clozapine doses and had undergone com-
parable duration of treatment (minimum of 5 years). These cri-
teria were necessary to avoid confounding effects of treatment on
clinical or cognitive symptoms between the two groups. Addition-
ally, a treatment duration of longer than 5 years was selected based
on the study by Fernandez-Egea et al. (2018) to allow enough time
for the development of OCS. As apparent from the above criteria,
the inclusion of the schizophrenia patients in our study was
particularly strict. At the time of this study, the clozapine clinic
research database contained 238 clozapine-treated patients. How-
ever, the majority of these patients had some exclusion criteria in
terms of treatment duration or other potential confounders
resulting in the small sample sizes of 21 and 15 for our two
schizophrenia groups.

Among the SCZ-OCS patients, 3 had comorbidities with
depression, 1 had a diagnosis of Asperger syndrome, 1 schizoaf-
fective disorder and 2 dyslexia. In the SCZ-only group, 1 had an
emotionally unstable personality disorder, and 2 had comorbid

generalized anxiety disorder. Thirteen SCZ-OCS and three SCZ-
only patients were treated solely with clozapine, the rest were on a
combination of medications. In the OCD group, all but 9 patients
were medicated, majority of whom treated with SSRIs. See
Supplementary Materials for more details on medication. None
of the healthy controls were medicated. Besides 5 schizophrenia
patients without OCS, and 7 with OCS, no one else including the
healthy and OCD groups was a smoker. Finally, two SCZ-OCS
patients were excluded from the study due to unreliable perform-
ance and an epilepsy diagnosis after the data collection leaving a
sample of 21 SCZ-OCS patients.

Clinical assessments

All participants were assessed using (1) obsessive-compulsive
inventory (Foa et al., 1998), a 42-item self-report scale assessing
OCS using 6 subscales (washing, checking, ordering, hoarding,
obsessional thinking, and mental neutralizing) to produce a score
between 0 and 126. Higher scores indicate greater symptomology;
(2) State/Trait Anxiety Questionnaire (Spielberger et al., 1983), a
20-item self-report scale assessing anxiety; (3) National Adult
Reading Test (Nelson & Willison, 1982), an estimate of verbal
intelligence; (4) Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale (Buhr & Dugas,
2002), a 27-item self-report scale assessing participants’ response
to uncertainty in daily life; and (5) a forward and backwards digit
task from the WAIS-III, assessing verbal working memory
(Wechsler, 1997). The following additional assessments were
undertaken for participants with schizophrenia: (1) The Positive
and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS; Kay et al., 1987), which is a
clinician-administered 30-item tool exploring positive (7 items),
negative (7 items) and general symptoms of schizophrenia
(16 items); (2) The Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale
(AIMS; Guy, 1976), which measures involuntary movements.
Finally, clozapine dosage, treatment duration, and smoking habits
were also collected for these participants.

Behavioral measures

Cognitive flexibility

The CANTAB Intra-Extra Dimensional Set Shift (Owen et al., 1991;
Roberts et al., 1988) was used to assess cognitive flexibility, more
specifically set-shifting ability. This 7-minute task tests for rule
acquisition, reversal learning, and attentional set shifting. It features
visual discrimination between color-filled shapes and white lines,
involving shifting and flexibility of attention. The test is well validated
in individuals experiencing OCD (Chamberlain et al., 2007; Vaghi
et al., 2017) and schizophrenia (Leeson et al., 2009; Pantelis et al.,
1999) and is a computerized analogue of the Wisconsin Card Sorting
test. It was administered on a touch-screen tablet.

Spatial and verbal working memory

Participants were additionally tested on CANTAB self-ordered
Spatial Working Memory (SWM) task (Owen et al., 1990). In this
4-minute task, participants performed a sequence of responses
on a touch sensitive screen tablet to detect the location of
‘reward’ tokens. It tests spatial working memory and executive
functioning. In this paper, we only report the SWM between
errors (SWMBE), which are the number of times someone

revisits a box they had already visited. An additional test was
used to assess the capacity of verbal working memory: the
forward and backwards digit
task from the WAIS-III
(Wechsler, 1997). Participants had to repeat series of digits of
increasing length, read by the researcher. Digit span forward
consists of 2 levels within of 8 sets of digits, whereas digit span
backwards has 2 sets of 7 digits. If a participants made a mistake
on both levels within a set, the test would stop. With these 2 tasks,
we covered measurements of working memory and executive
functioning.

Checking behavior

Checking behavior was assessed using a novel experimental
paradigm – the image verification task (IVT), administered via
a touchscreen XPS 15.6” DELL laptop. IVT is a conceptually
simple task, yet perceptually difficult enough to increase doubt
and checking. At each trial, participants observed two black and
white drawings of objects presented in rapid succession and were
asked to determine if the two items were identical or different in
size, shape or angle (see Figure 1). Optimizing both accuracy of
answers and overall speed were instructed as the main task goals.
The IVT utilized in this study differed slightly from the task
recently published in Biria et al., 2024, where the sole instruction
was to improve accuracy of answers without the need to consider
the overall speed. In this study, we chose to incorporate an
emphasis on speed as a measure of goal-directed behavior,
encouraging the use of information from checking, to enable
good performance, avoiding excessive checking that could detri-
mentally impact overall task speed and performance. Before
making their decision and providing their answer, participants
had the opportunity to review the images as many times as they
liked: an explicit measure of checking. Each object was presented
for 1 second, separated by an 800 ms white image interstimulus
interval. After making a choice, participants rated their confi-
dence about
their answer on 4-choice scale ranging from
‘not confident at all’ to ‘very confident’ (see Figure 1A). The
task comprised two blocks of 45 trials each, presented sequen-
tially, assessing different aspects of cognition and perceptual
decision-making that may be implicated in checking (specifically
uncertainty and punishment). The first block involved high
uncertainty and no feedback on performance (Figure 1A) while
the second block punished checking with an extra trial every time
participants checked and provided performance feedback by

Data analysis

Clinical assessment, cognitive flexibility, and spatial working
memory

A series of analyses of variances (ANOVAs) was performed to
compare clinical and cognitive measures, as well as performance
on IED and SWM tasks between groups. The Welch’s ANOVA
test was used when a non-parametric test was required. Multiple
comparison tests were performed for variables that displayed a
significant variation between groups. For variables available only
in two groups, an independent sample t-test was used in case of a
normal distribution, otherwise a Mann–Whitney U test was
applied.

Figure 1. A schematic representation of the Image verification task reproduced from Biria et al., 2024. Participants observed two black and white drawings sequentially. The
task was to compare them and decide if they are the same or different. There was an opportunity to check the images, before giving a response, by pressing on the red << sign.
After each answer, there was a 4-choice confidence rating scale: ‘not confident at all’, ‘not very confident’, ‘fairly confident’, and ‘very confident’. Each stimulus presentation
lasted 1 second with an 800 ms interstimulus interval. The remaining frames remained on the screen until an answer was given. (A) Block 1 is the high uncertainty block, which
provided no feedback. In this example, the stimuli differ in angle. (B) Block 2 punished checking by adding one trial for each check (that is every time the participant pressed
the checking sign on the screen) and feedback was provided for all trials to reduce uncertainty. Wrong and correct answers were followed by both visual (red and green,
respectively) and auditory feedback (aversive and uplifting sound, respectively). Here, two different objects are depicted. (C) Three examples of stimuli used in this task.
From left to right: 2 bears (the right bear is bigger), 2 ducks (the right duck is more crooked), and 2 umbrellas (the umbrellas are exactly the same).

Checking behavior

Code availability

Correlation between checking rates and accuracy of performance
was used to inspect the functionality of checking behavior. Asso-
ciations between IVT performance and clinical measures and
questionnaire scores were tested using Pearson’s r correlation
coefficient, or Spearman’s r if data were non-parametric. The
Williams’s Test (z) was used to compare two independent correl-
ations between groups. To compare the clozapine dose between
the two schizophrenia groups, an ANCOVA (analysis of covari-
ance) was used with number of cigarettes smoked and gender as
covariate. Finally, checking was compared between groups using
three orthogonal contrasts performed using repeated-measures
ANOVAs. The contrasts were between (1) healthy volunteers
(HV) vs patients (OCD and schizophrenia groups), (2) OCD vs
schizophrenia (SCZ-OCS + SCZ-only), and finally, (3) SCZ-OCS
vs SCZ-only groups. Dependent variables in these analyses
included average checking rates, accuracy of answers in percent-
age, and participant confidence ratings. If significant main effects
were identified, post hoc multiple comparisons were performed
using a Bonferroni correction. SPSS version 29 was used to per-
form the repeated-measures ANOVAs, while the rest of the ana-
lyses were performed using Python version 3.7.6 and RStudio
version 4.2.3.

The R code and output used for the contrast analyses are provided
in the Supplementary Materials.

Results

Demographics and clinical assessments

Table 1 displays the ANOVA results comparing all demographic,
clinical assessments between groups, with their corresponding
mean and SD. The multiple comparisons are presented in Table
S1 in the Supplementary Materials.

Cognitive flexibility and working memory

Table 2 depicts the group comparisons, averages, and standard
deviations for the cognitive and behavioral measures on the CAN-
TAB IED and SWM tasks, digit span task, and the IVT. The
schizophrenia groups exhibited poorer performance on all three
cognitive measures as compared to OCD and HV participants. On
the SWM, schizophrenia patients revisited boxes they had already
visited (SWMBE) significantly more than the remaining groups
(p < 0.05). Similar to the SWM findings, schizophrenia groups

6

Marjan Biria et al.

performed worse on digit span backward, remembering fewer digits
(p < 0.05). However, the groups did not differ on digit span forward
(p > 0.05). On the IED task, schizophrenia patients also demon-
strated worse performance at all task stages (p < 0.01). More
specifically, they completed less stages on the task and made more
errors on the extra-dimensional set shift stage (EDS) of the CAN-
TAB IED task, a critical measure of cognitive flexibility. Whereas
the number of errors measured at the earlier stage of PRE-EDS was
worse in SCZ-OCS compared to the SCZ-only group, both schizo-
phrenia groups were worse than HV and OCD groups. Table 2
defines significant performance differences among the groups.
Table.S1 in Supplementary Materials shows the independent mul-
tiple comparison tests for all significant group differences in
Table 2.

Functional checking behavior

Table 2 shows the descriptive statistics for all IVT task measures
across groups. Response accuracy and checking were significantly
correlated in OCD (r = 0.61, p < 0.001) and SCZ-only (r = 0.73,
p < 0.001) groups in block 1 under high uncertainty. This block had
the highest checking rate for these groups. This was not the case for
the SCZ-OCS group, who checked less and less effectively. In
healthy subjects, however, the high levels of accuracy depended
on less checking (in comparison e.g. with OCD patients), which
may explain the lack of correlation between checking and perform-
ance. The difference between these correlations in the two schizo-
phrenia groups was significant (z = 2.079, p < 0.01), and OCD and
healthy volunteers (z = 1.93, p = 0.02), but not between OCD and
SCZ-OCS (p > 0.05). Figure 2 depicts this relationship in all groups.
Table S2 shows the descriptive statistics for all task performance
measures in all groups and over all blocks.

Relationship between checking under uncertainty and clinical
measures

Only in OCD patients, was functional checking under uncertainty
(block 1) positively correlated with intolerance of uncertainty
scores (rs = 0.40, p = 0.02), but this was not the case in other groups.
Clozapine dose was significantly correlated with checking under
uncertainty (block 1) only in the SCZ-OCS group (SCZ-OCS:
rs = 0.44, p = 0.04; SCZ-only: rs = 0, p = 0.98). When accounting
for cigarette use and gender, known modulators of clozapine
metabolism and plasma levels (Mayerova et al., 2018), this partial
correlation remained very similar (SCZ-OCS: rs = 0.428, p < 0.05;
SCZ-only: rs = 0.14, p = 0.31).

Relationship between punished checking, clinical measures,
and SWM

For punished checking, two OCD patients who were outliers for
checking (>2SD from the mean) in the second block were excluded
from this part of the analysis. Both these patients were checkers
according to their OCI-checking sub-scores and after excluding
them, the YBOCS compulsion score in OCD patients was correl-
ated with the punished checking rate in block 2 (rs = 0.46, p < 0.01).
A similar relationship between punished checking and YBOCS
compulsion sub-scores was
found in the SCZ-OCS group
(rs = 0.51, p < 0.01), who additionally showed a positive correlation
between punished checking and state anxiety (rs = 0.60, p = 0.004).
There were no such correlations between punished checking and
state anxiety in SCZ-only group (r = (cid:1)0.15, p = 0.29).

Previous findings of association between treatment duration and
checking behavior (Fernandez-Egea et al., 2018) were only replicated
in SCZ-OCS patients who showed a non-significant trend (SCZ-
OCS: rs = 0.40, p = 0.09; SCZ-only: rs = 0.20, p = 0.54). The latter non-
significant finding could be due to the fact that only patients who
were treated longer than 5 years on clozapine were recruited for this
study as opposed to the patient cohorts in Fernandez-Egea et al.
(2018). There were no correlations between PANSS sub-scores and
IVT checking in either schizophrenia groups in block 1. However, in
block 2, under punished checking, there were positive trends only in
SCZ-OCS group between all PANSS sub-scores and checking
(Positive: r = 0.39, p = 0.08; Negative: r = 0.36, p = 0.10; General:
r = 0.49, p = 0.02). Moreover, SWM deficit (SWMBE: revisiting a
previously visited box again) was also marginally correlated with
checking under punishment (rs = 0.42, p = 0.05) and significantly
correlated with clozapine dose (rs = 0.37, p = 0.01) in the SCZ-OCS
group but not among SCZ-only patients (rs = 0.09, p = 0.38;
rs = (cid:1)0.016, p = 0.47, respectively for SWMBE and clozapine dose),
indicating the role of working memory deficit not only for checking
but also in association to clozapine dose in SCZ-OCS patients.

Contrast analysis and IVT group differences

Finally, we analyzed three contrasts (C1, C2, and C3) comparing the
checking, confidence rating, and accuracy of answers between C1)
HV vs patients, C2) OCD vs schizophrenia, and C3) SCZ-OCS vs
SCZ-only groups for block 1 (high uncertainty, no feedback) and
block 2 (punished checking, feedback). Supplementary Figure S1
depicts performance on the IVT for all three contrasts. Across all
contrasts checking and confidence reduced from block 1 (high
uncertainty) to block 2 (punished checking) in all groups. There
were group differences in C1 (Supplementary Figure S1.A) with
patients checking less and being less confident than healthy volun-
teers, and in C2 (Supplementary Figure S1.B) with OCD patients
checking more and being more accurate than both schizophrenia
groups. There were no group differences in C3 (Supplementary
Figure S1.C) between the two schizophrenia patients. The R code
and the output of all three contrasts are shown in the Supplementary
Materials. Tables S2 and S3 in the Supplementary Materials, respect-
ively, show the descriptive statistics for all measures on the IVT and
the independent multiple comparison tests for all groups.

Discussion

OCS are prevalent in a significant proportion of schizophrenia
patients treated with clozapine. Fernandez-Egea et al. (2024)
reported this rate to be approximately 38%, although in our less
representative sample, 58% of schizophrenia patients experienced
OCS 5 years after beginning clozapine treatment.

In this study, we compared the cognitive, clinical, and behavioral
characteristics of OCS in schizophrenia patients experiencing clo-
zapine induced OCS, in comparison with schizophrenia patients
without OCS, OCD patients and healthy control subjects.

The IVT, a novel behavioral paradigm, was used to study
dysfunctional checking for the first time in patients with schizo-
phrenia in a laboratory setting. As expected, healthy controls
exhibited high levels of accuracy. While checking in this group
was not associated with improved performance, this finding is likely
explained by a ceiling effect as they consistently exhibited optimal
perceptual accuracy. The SCZ-OCS group, however, exhibited
dysfunctional checking under uncertainty as their checking behav-
ior was not related to their accuracy of perceptual decision-making.

OCD and SCZ-only patients, however, showed functional checking
by using the information from checking to monitor the accuracy of
their performance. All groups checked significantly less under
punishment, except for the most severe OCD and SCZ-OCS
patients, who showed a positive relationship between punished
checking and compulsive symptom severity as measured by
YBOCS. Further analysis of possible factors affecting checking,
such as intolerance of uncertainty, cognitive inflexibility, and work-
ing memory, was conducted in all four groups to better understand
its psychological basis as well as its relationship, specifically in the
two schizophrenia groups, with positive symptoms, anxiety, cloza-
pine dose, and duration of treatment.

Cognitive flexibility, working memory, and other clinical
measures

As expected, SCZ-OCS and OCD patients showed enhanced
depression, anxiety, intolerance of uncertainty, and OCS, and as
previously reported (Biria et al., 2019), the SCZ-OCS group also
exhibited increased positive and depressive symptoms (PANSS)
compared with the SCZ-only group. In a recent mediation analysis,
psychosis severity mediated checking behavior indirectly by indu-
cing obsessions (Fernandez-Egea et al., 2024), and this could

potentially explain the role of schizophrenia symptom severity in
the development of checking behavior.

Cognitive flexibility, executive functioning, and spatial working
memory are known deficits in schizophrenia patients (Bowie &
Harvey, 2006; Goldberg & Green, 2002; Leeson et al., 2009; Pantelis
et al., 1999) and we also replicated these findings by detecting worse
performance on IED across all measures, digit span backward and the
CANTAB spatial working memory test in both schizophrenia groups
compared to OCD and healthy controls. The two schizophrenia
groups were not different in cognitive performance across several
measures of working memory, although the SCZ-OCS group were
more impaired on the number of completed stages and PRE-EDS
errors on the IED task compared to SCZ-only group. In a previous
study by Patel et al. (2010), the deficit was apparent at the extra-
dimensional shift stage of the IED task, perhaps because of differences
in depressive symptom severity between the SCZ-OCS groups used in
these studies.

Checking under uncertainty

Our initial hypothesis of dysfunctional checking in both the SCZ-OCS
and OCD groups was only confirmed in the former patient group.
Checking under uncertainty was related to clozapine dose only in

SCZ-OCS patients, despite no differences in clozapine dose between
the two schizophrenia groups. While this implies a causal role for
clozapine in inducing checking in SCZ-OCS patients, it is clear that
clozapine dose alone is insufficient to cause this behavior and that
other characteristics of SCZ-OCS patients, such as anxiety and
executive dyscontrol (impaired working memory and cognitive
inflexibility), enhance vulnerability to these effects of clozapine. It
was also noticeable that checking in the SCZ-only group was
functional, being related to their accuracy of perceptual decision-
making. This is an important finding as it suggests that monitor-
ing of performance was unimpaired in these patients, despite
exhibiting other executive deficits. By contrast, such monitoring
was clearly impaired in the SCZ-OCS group.

Checking under punishment

The SCZ-OCS group had more severe symptoms compared to the
SCZ-only group, as apparent from their higher anxiety, positive and

depressive symptoms, and impaired performance at the earlier
stage of the IED task. All these variables were also associated with
punished checking, only in SCZ-OCS patients. Despite having
similar working memory deficits on the CANTAB SWM task in
both schizophrenia groups, again only SCZ-OCS patients exhibited
a positive correlation between working memory impairment and
punished checking. The lack of link between checking and working
memory deficits in SCZ-only patients is consistent with a previous
study, which measured checking in this clinical population using
eye tracking (Jaafari et al., 2015). The SCZ-OCS patients showed a
positive trend between checking under punishment and clozapine
treatment duration. The latter finding is consistent with Fernandez-
Egea et al. (2018) who showed that 25% of patients exhibit excessive
checking behavior after 5 years of treatment, rising to over 50% after
10 years. Hence, it appears likely that excessive checking in SCZ-
OCS patients is determined by clozapine acting in tandem with
other factors, such as emotional state (anxiety) and executive
dyscontrol.

Marjan Biria et al.

Possible neural and neurochemical substrates of
dysfunctional checking associated with clozapine

Previous studies of excessive checking in OCD have impli-
cated brain mechanisms in the anterior cingulate cortex
(ACC), thalamus, and striatum (Biria et al., 2024; Mataix-
Cols et al., 2004; Murayama et al., 2013), consistent with the
role of the ACC in action monitoring and conflict resolution
during decision-making under uncertainty (Alexander &
Brown, 2011). White matter integrity in the cingulum, orbito-
frontal cortex (OFC), and in fronto-striatal tracts is comprom-
ised more in SCZ-OCS in comparison with OCD or SCZ-only
patients (Bıçakcı Ay et al., 2023). As clozapine antagonizes
5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors, it is relevant that OFC acti-
vation is enhanced in fMRI studies of schizophrenia patients
treated with clozapine (Schirmbeck et al., 2013), opposite to
therapeutic effects of SSRI treatment in OCD (Saxena et al.,
1999). Using MRS, McQueen et al. (2021) reported that a
12-week of clozapine treatment was associated with a longi-
tudinal reduction in Glx (glutamate + glutamine) in the caud-
ate nucleus, which positively correlated with symptom
improvement. However, the precise causal role of any of these
changes in checking associated with clozapine treatment is not
clear and requires further research.

Clinically, our results suggest that OCS in clozapine-treated
patients emerge due to a combination of psychosis, depression
and anxiety severity, clozapine load, and working memory dys-
function. The treatment might require an individualized assess-
ment of these factors and intervention accordingly (e.g. improving
depression or reducing clozapine dose when possible), albeit fur-
ther studies are needed.

Limitations

Although the IVT was able to characterize dysfunctional checking in
SCZ-OCS patients, the lack of excessive checking behavior overall in
both OCS groups was somewhat unexpected. A related study (Biria
et al., 2024) used a modified version of the task that removed the
time pressure component and led to excessive levels of checking in
OCD patients and it would, therefore, be of interest to employ this in
future studies of SCZ-OCS patients. In addition, we did not have the
clozapine plasma levels available for all patients, and although we do
show the relationship between clozapine plasma levels and clinical
symptoms in a larger sample (n = 196) elsewhere (Fernandez-Egea
et al., 2024), it would be important to study this relationship more
precisely with checking on the IVT in the future.

Another limitation was the small sample size, which did not
allow us to conduct a mediation analysis to investigate the relative
causal importance of other factors such as working memory and
anxiety, besides clozapine dose and treatment duration, which was
partly due to our strict inclusion criteria in the schizophrenia
groups. Additionally, the small sample size in the schizophrenia
groups did not allow a mediation analysis to clarify the impact of
demographic differences (e.g. age and sex) but also clinical and
cognitive symptoms (e.g. positive symptoms and cognitive flexibil-
ity) on their IVT performance. We have, however, studied the
sociodemographic and clinical aspects of clozapine treatment in
relation to OCS separately with larger and more heterogeneous
samples of clozapine-treated patients (Biria et al., 2019; Fernandez-
Egea et al., 2018; Fernandez-Egea et al., 2024; Parkin et al., 2023).

Finally, since our study had a cross-sectional design, it also did
not allow us to study the temporal trajectory of checking behavior
development. Nevertheless, this study has provided us with an
effective methodological platform for pursuing these additional
questions.

Conclusion

Dysfunctional checking was successfully measured in clozapine-
treated schizophrenia patients with OCS and the factors contrib-
uting to this symptom were uncovered, including clozapine dose,
state anxiety, and working memory deficits. The dysfunctional
checking observed in schizophrenia patients with OCS was greater
than in patients with schizophrenia only (without OCS) (matched
for clozapine dose) and OCD. The checking in the OCD group was
related to intolerance of uncertainty. The SCZ-OCS patients exhib-
ited more severe PANSS symptomatology than schizophrenia
patients without OCS (confirming previous findings) and clearly
require special therapeutic approaches.
