## Calming Coping Strategies for Stress


Calming our physiology can help reverse thestress response.When our stress response is triggered, we process information differently and can feel physically and emotionally taxed. If this state is prolonged, it can escalate to chronic stress.

One way to calm our bodies, therefore also calming our minds, is to go to a quiet place and take deep, long breaths. Breathe in, hold for five seconds, then exhale slowly. Repeat several times. Thisbreathing exercisecan help soothe our nerves and slow a racing heart.

Other calming strategies include:

- Engaging in aromatherapy

- Listening tosoothing music

- Practicingmindfulness meditation

- Progressive muscle relaxation


## Emotion-Focused Coping Strategies for Stress


With emotion-focused coping strategies, the situation doesn’t change but our perception of it does. These strategies are great to use when we have little ability to control what happens. They help us see stressors as a challenge instead of a threat.

Research has found thatmaintaining a sense of humorcan help people better cope with stress.Another helpful strategy is to stay optimistic.Cultivating optimismworks by reducing our rates of perceived stress while also increasing our resilience.

Other emotion-focused techniques for coping with stress include:

- Journaling our emotions

- Practicingloving-kindness meditationto increase self-compassion

- Usingvisualization strategiesto increase positive feelings

While these techniques can be time-consuming, reducing stress is necessary to improve our well-being and mental and physical health.


## Solution-Focused Coping Strategies for Stress


Sometimes there’s nothing we can do to change a situation, but often we can find an opportunity to take action and change the circumstances we face. Solution-focused coping strategies can be very effective for stress relief.

Often a small change is all that’s required to make a huge shift in how we feel. One change can lead to other changes, creating a chain reaction of positive change in which opportunities open up and life changes significantly. Also, once an action is taken, the sense of beingtrapped with no options—a recipe for stress—can dissipate quickly.

It’s important to be thoughtful about which actions to take, as each situation may call for a unique solution. A less-stressed mind can more easily choose the most beneficial course of action.

Solution-focused techniques good forreducing workplace stressbut that can also be beneficial in other situations include:

- Implementing time-management strategies when feelingoverwhelmed by a busy schedule

- Reaching out to others for help, such as contacting human resources (HR) if work demands feel overwhelming or if being harassed

- Usingconflict-resolution strategiesto mitigate the stress, whether with co-workers or in a relationship
