Abstract

Introduction: Women exposed to potentially traumatic events (PTEs) are at
high risk for developing psychiatric disorders, including posttraumatic stress
disorder (PTSD), general anxiety disorder (GAD), major depressive disorder
(MDD), and substance-related disorders. However, this risk is not universal.
Most women are resistant (i.e., remain asymptomatic), or recover following a
brief symptomatic period. This study examined the psychological factors associ-
ated with resistant and recovered outcomes in a sample of high-risk women
exposed to assault-related PTEs. Method: One hundred and ﬁfty-nine women
completed the Life Events Checklist and were administered the Structured Clin-
ical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders. This resulted in three groups: (1)
no diagnosis (no past or current psychiatric disorder diagnosis; n = 56), (2)
past diagnosis (a past psychiatric disorder diagnosis, but none currently;
n = 31), and (3) current diagnosis (a current diagnosis of one or more psychi-
atric disorders; n = 72). Groups were compared on sociodemographics, PTE
exposure, psychopathology, health-related quality of life (HRQOL), and psycho-
logical resilience-related factors. Results: The majority of respondents (79%)
did not develop chronic PTSD following assault exposure, and the most com-
mon psychiatric outcome was MDD (30%). High endorsement of mastery and
social support were associated with the no diagnosis group; and greater reports
of mastery and posttraumatic growth were associated with recovery from a past
psychiatric disorder. Furthermore, both resilient groups (i.e., no diagnosis and
past diagnosis) scored higher on HRQOL measures compared with the current
diagnosis group (P < 0.001). Conclusion: Psychological resilience has ramiﬁca-
tions to health and well-being, and identifying these factors has potential to
inform preventive strategies and treatment interventions for assault exposed
women.

Introduction

Exposure to a potentially traumatic event (PTE) is com-
mon, and approximately 25% of women will report expo-
sure to an assault during their lifetime (Tjaden and
Thoennes 2000). A third of
these women will subse-
quently develop one or more psychiatric disorders includ-
ing, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), general anxiety
disorder (GAD), major depressive disorder (MDD), and
substance abuse or dependence (Breslau 2009, deRoon-
Cassini et al. 2010, Kachadourian et al. 2014). While

women exposed to PTEs are at an increased risk for
developing psychiatric morbidity, (Kessler et al. 1995,
Breslau et al. 1998) most women are resilient and report
little or no disruption to their lives (Bonanno and Man-
cini 2008). Even in assaulted women who initially develop
a psychiatric disorder, more than half will recover within
1 year and return to previous levels of functioning (Sha-
lev 2002). Therefore, psychological resilience is common;
yet, there are limits in determining which women are
resistant or will recover from the initial effects of PTE
exposure, and which women will develop chronic symp-

toms. Moreover, the factors that promote different out-
comes of resilience are not fully understood. To address
these limitations an improved understanding of the fac-
tors associated with trauma resistance and recovery is
required to inform preventive strategies and treatment
interventions for women exposed to assault.

A more consistent determination of what constitutes a
resilient outcome following a PTE is essential in develop-
ing an agenda for psychological studies of resilience, due
to the varied trajectories following PTE exposure. There-
fore, it’s critical to differentiate between trauma resistance
(i.e., the relative imperviousness to the deleterious effects
of stress) and trauma recovery (i.e., the ability to restore
homeostasis, which was initially compromised following
trauma exposure) (Yehuda et al. 2006). Distinguishing
between these resilience-related prototypes, will illustrate
the extent to which these constructs are related and dis-
tinct. Previously, we developed the “society-to-cells”
framework to guide the investigation of factors that inﬂu-
ence psychological resilience, and provide a distinction of
what constitutes a resilient outcome (Szanton and Gill
2010). In this framework, resilience is determined by one
of three outcomes: (1) resistance, a state of noncompro-
mised function following challenge, (2) recovery, a state of
compromised function following challenge, succeeded by
a return to previous levels of function, and (3) rebound, a
state of increased function following challenge (observed
in both resistance and recovery outcomes), and also
known as posttraumatic growth (Ai and Park 2005). Con-
trary to these resilient-related trajectories is an outcome
of compromise, a state of chronic symptoms following
challenge that qualiﬁes for a psychiatric disorder diagno-
sis. This framework integrates other theories of resilience,
which refer to resistance and recovery outcomes in terms
of hardiness (Kobasa 1979), invulnerability (Rutter 1979),
and stress buffering (Haggerty 1996), and a rebound out-
come in terms of poststress growth (Aldwin 2009).

Putative resilience factors may be protective in the face
of challenge, by contributing to psychopathological resis-
tance; however, the identiﬁcation of well-established fac-
tors may be obscured by heterogeneous samples and
diverse trauma characteristics. The most commonly rec-
ognized factors associated with psychological resilience
are positive coping behaviors (e.g., ﬂexibility, acceptance,
and humor), optimism, mastery (i.e., competence and
perceived control over one’s life), social support, and
posttraumatic growth. For example, increased scores on
the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC), a mea-
sure of positive coping behaviors, are associated with
reduced risk for PTSD in both men and women (Wrenn
et al. 2011). Increased optimism is correlated with psy-
chological
resistance across gender and a variety of
trauma types (Petros et al. 2013).

While some factors are associated with resistance to
trauma effects, others may emerge in effort to recover
from and defend against the otherwise long-term impair-
ments associated with stress-related psychiatric morbidity.
For example, greater mastery is predictive of recovery
from PTSD in African Americans (Alim et al. 2008), and
is associated with overall psychological recovery, but not
resistance in men and women with high rates of assault
(Yehuda et al. 2006). Veterans with clinical and sub-clini-
cal PTSD reported higher levels of posttraumatic growth
compared with resistive veterans (Zerach et al. 2013).
Taken together,
it is essential to examine resistant and
recovered outcomes as distinct constructs to determine
the psychological factors that promote resistance prechal-
lenge, and the factors that promote recovery in individu-
als already compromised. In doing so, these ﬁndings can
facilitate the appropriate implementation of interventions.
Although there has been considerable effort to deter-
mine the psychological mechanisms of trauma resilience,
most studies examine resilience within the context of
PTSD, and comparatively few studies have examined resil-
ience deﬁned by the absence of a stress-related Diagnostic
and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) diag-
nosis. Surprisingly, there is also a paucity of research
examining psychological resilience in women exposed to
assault, who are at the highest risk for developing stress-
related psychiatric morbidity (Kessler et al. 1995). More-
over, only a few studies have systematically differentiated
between resistant and recovered outcomes to distinguish
the speciﬁc factors that contribute to each resilience out-
come. To address this critical gap, we determined psychi-
atric status in a sample of women with assault-related
PTEs, and compared multiple resilience-related measures
among the following groups: (1) no diagnosis of a psychi-
atric disorder, (2) past diagnosis of a psychiatric disorder,
and (3) current diagnosis of a psychiatric disorder (see
Figure 1. for group criteria details). Characterizing these
resilience factors may foster the design of novel interven-
tions to prevent psychiatric disorder onset and facilitate
recovery from PTE exposure in high-risk populations.

Method

Participants

Potential participants were recruited through healthcare
provider referral and ﬂyers posted in the emergency depart-
ment waiting room, the outpatient health clinic, and the
community of an academic medical center. Inclusion crite-
ria included women between the ages of 18–60 years old,
least one PTE. Exclusion criteria
with exposure to at
included suicidality and medical instability (e.g., ongoing
severe trauma, traumatic brain injury, and need for acute

treatment). One hundred and ﬁfty-nine women met eligi-
bility criteria; they provided written informed consent and
received monetary compensation in accordance with the
Code of Ethics of the World Medical Association and all
afﬁliated institutional review boards (IRBs).

Methods

Potential participants completed the Life Events Checklist
(LEC) (Gray et al. 2004), a self-report inventory of life-
time exposure to various traumatic events. Only those
women who reported a DSM-IV: PTSD (Criterion A)
assaultive trauma as their index trauma (i.e., most dis-
tressful exposure), were included in the study. The Struc-
tured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Disorders (SCID)
(First et al. 1996) was used to determine the presence of
past and current PTSD, GAD, MDD, and substance and
alcohol abuse (collectively referred herein as “psychiatric
disorders”). For analysis purposes, this resulted in three
groups: (1) no diagnosis (n = 56), women who were
never diagnosed with a psychiatric disorder, (2) past diag-
nosis (n = 31), women who were diagnosed with a psy-
chiatric disorder in the past, but no longer met diagnostic
criteria, and (3) current diagnosis (n = 72), women who
currently met diagnostic criteria for at least one psychiat-
ric disorder. Eligible participants were also administered
multiple resilience-related measures to determine the fac-
tors most associated with resistant and recovered out-
comes following assault exposure.

Psychological resilience measurements

The Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC) (Con-
nor and Davidson 2003) is a 10-item scale that assesses
positive coping behaviors over the past month. Higher
scores, on a 0–40 scale, indicate greater resilience. The CD-
RISC has good internal consistency (0.81), good test–retest
reliability (0.85), and excellent validity (0.93) (Campbell-
Sills and Stein 2007). The Pearlin Mastery Scale (Mastery-
S) (Pearlin and Schooler 1978) is a 7-item scale that mea-
sures perception of control over life altering forces. Higher

scores, on a 7–35 scale, reﬂect greater mastery. The Mas-
tery-S has acceptable internal consistency (0.77) (Pearlin
et al. 1981). The Life Orientation Test-Revised (LOT-R)
(Scheier et al. 1994) is a 10-item test that assesses differ-
ences in generalized optimism versus pessimism. Higher
scores, on a 0–24 scale, indicate greater optimism. The
LOT-R has acceptable internal consistency (0.78), accept-
able test–retest reliability (0.79), and adequate validity
(Bostock et al. 2009). The Posttraumatic Growth Inventory
(PTGI) (Tedeschi and Calhoun 1996) is a 21-item inven-
tory that measures positive changes attributed to a highly
stressful event. Higher scores, on a 0–105 scale, reﬂect more
growth. The PTGI has excellent internal consistency (0.90)
and acceptable test–retest reliability (0.71) (Tedeschi and
Calhoun 1996). Lastly, the MOS Social Support Survey
(MOS-SSS) (Sherbourne and Stewart 1991) is a 19-item
survey that assesses perception of social network resources
on four dimensions. Higher scores, on a 19–95 scale, indi-
cate greater perception of social support. Both total scale
and subscales have excellent internal consistency (0.85–
0.91) and good test–retest reliability (0.72–0.85) (Sher-
bourne and Stewart 1991).

Health-related quality of life measurement

The Short Form Health Survey-36 (SF-36) (Ware and Sher-
bourne 1992) is a 36-item survey that evaluates patient-
reported health-related quality of life (HRQOL) on eight
outcomes, including: general health perceptions, energy/
fatigue, emotional well-being, role limitations due to emo-
tional difﬁculties, role limitations due to physical difﬁcul-
ties, physical functioning, social functioning, and bodily
pain. Lower scores, on a 0–100 scale, indicate greater dis-
ability. Across patient groups, all scales demonstrate excel-
lent internal consistency (0.97), good test–retest reliability
(0.85), and excellent validity (0.92) (McHorney et al. 1994).

Statistical methods

Participants in each of the three groups (i.e., no diagno-
sis, past diagnosis, and current diagnosis) were classiﬁed

by age (18–35 vs. 36–60), race (white vs. non-white),
marital status (married vs. non married), level of educa-
tion (some college vs. no college), and household income
(less than $40,000 vs. greater than $40,000). The relatively
high income split is due to the $65,000 median income in
the greater D.C. area (United States. Census Bureau
2012). Omnibus tests of bivariate associations were con-
ducted between the three groups and sociodemographic
characteristics, PTE exposure, DSM-IV psychiatric disor-
der prevalence, HRQOL, and resilience-related factors
using two-tailed chi-square tests for categorical variables
and one-way ANOVA for nominal and continuous vari-
ables (Tables 1–5). Fisher’s exact
test was used when
expected cell counts were less than ﬁve. Pairwise compari-
sons were conducted on variables that were signiﬁcant at
the P < 0.05 level in the omnibus test, using two-tailed
chi-square tests for categorical variables and Bonferroni
post hoc tests for nominal and continuous variables. All
resilience-related factors (Table 5) were entered into mul-
tivariate force entry linear regression models, with group
status as the dependent variable, to determine the factors
most associated with resistant and recovered outcomes
compared with a compromised outcome (Table 6). All
analyses were conducted using IBM SPSS for Mac, version
21.0 (SPSS, RRID:rid_000042).

Results

three groups did not signiﬁcantly differ on sociodemo-
graphic variables (i.e., age, education, and annual income),
with the exception of race and marital status, which were
controlled for in the analysis. Overall, the no diagnosis
group was more likely to be Caucasian (compared to the
other two groups), and the past diagnosis group was more
often married compared with the current diagnosis group,
which was more likely to be single or divorced.

Potentially traumatic event exposure

All participants reported exposure to one or more assault-
related index traumas, details are depicted in Table 2. Aside
from assault, the most common PTEs reported included
death of a loved one (36.8%), transportation accident
(16.4%), and life-threatening injury (4.4%). Within the
assault-related PTEs, the no diagnosis group had a signiﬁ-
cantly lower indirect exposure to assault (i.e., hearing about
or witnessing) compared with the past diagnosis and cur-
rent diagnosis groups (all P’s<0.01). There was no differ-
ence between the three groups on exposure to childhood
sexual assault; however, the no diagnosis group had a sig-
niﬁcantly lower exposure to adult sexual assault compared
with the current diagnosis group (P < 0.01). Both the no
diagnosis and past diagnosis groups reported signiﬁcantly
lower exposure to child and adult physical assault com-
pared with the current diagnosis group (all P’s < 0.01).

(15.3%) (Table 3). Within the current diagnosis group,
recovery from MDD
there were also high rates of
(55.6%), PTSD (26.4%), and alcohol abuse (18.1%), yet
these participants still met diagnostic criteria for at least
one other psychiatric disorder.
In the past diagnosis
group, the most prevalent past psychiatric disorder diag-
noses were PTSD (64.5%), MDD (58.1%), and substance
abuse (16.1%).

Health-related quality of life

The current diagnosis group reported signiﬁcant deﬁcits
on all dimensions of HRQOL, with the exception of
social functioning, when compared with the no diagnosis
and/or past diagnosis groups (all P’s < 0.001) (Table 4).
Compared with the no diagnosis group, the past diagnosis

group also exhibited signiﬁcantly lower HRQOL scores in
areas of emotional well-being, energy/fatigue, physical
functioning, and role limitations due to emotional difﬁ-
culties (all P’s < 0.001).

Resilience-related factors

The no diagnosis and past diagnosis groups scored signiﬁ-
cantly higher on measures of mastery (Mastery-S), opti-
mism (LOT-R), positive coping behaviors (CD-RISC),
and posttraumatic growth (PTGI) compared with the cur-
rent diagnosis group (all P’s<0.001) (Table 5). The no
diagnosis group had signiﬁcantly higher
scores on
reported social support (MOS-SSS) compared with the
current diagnosis group (P < 0.001); however, this rela-
tionship was not observed between the past diagnosis and
current diagnosis groups (P > 0.05).

Resilience-related factors associated with no
diagnosis and past diagnosis outcomes

Multivariate force entry linear regression models were used
to determine the resilience-related factors most strongly
associated with no diagnosis and past diagnosis outcomes
(Table 6). The signiﬁcant predictors of a no diagnosis (vs.
current diagnosis) outcome were mastery (b = (cid:1)0.359,
t = (cid:1)3.958, P < 0.001) and social support (b = (cid:1)0.226,
(R2 = 0.448,
t = (cid:1)3.017, P = 0.003), with an overall
f(5,113) = 18.374, P < 0.001). The signiﬁcant predictors of a
past diagnosis (vs. current diagnosis) outcome were mas-
tery (b = (cid:1)0.388, t = (cid:1)3.976, P < 0.001) and posttrau-
matic growth (b = (cid:1)0.267, t = (cid:1)3.029, P = 0.003), with
an overall (R2 = 0.412, f(5,92)=12.893, P < 0.001).

Discussion

The primary goal of the current study was to examine the
association of psychological resilience factors with DSM-
IV psychiatric disorder resistance, as well as recovery in a
sample of women exposed to PTEs. All participants were
exposed to at least one assault-related PTE; however, the
no diagnosis group had signiﬁcantly less reports of indi-
rect assault. Exposure to indirect trauma can weaken psy-
chological defenses (Shultz et al. 2012, Cieslak et al.
2013), which may have increased the risk for psychiatric
morbidity in the past diagnosis and current diagnosis

the damaging effects of traumatic stress, but may also
modulate the probability of subsequent exposure to PTEs,
by equipping individuals with the social support and
mastery necessary to leave dangerous situations. In a
study of women sexual assault survivors, those who were
revictimized within 1 year reported use of more maladap-
tive coping strategies than those who were not revictim-
ized (Najdowski and Ullman 2011). Future studies may
examine whether resilience factors contribute to an indi-
vidual’s ability to seek out safe environments and dis-
criminate between safe and threatening stimuli.

While the data clearly revealed that

the overriding
majority of respondents did not develop chronic PTSD;
the most common psychiatric outcome in this sample
was MDD. This outcome may be explained by the attri-
bution of responsibility and blame, as well as a sense of
betrayal by intimate partners or people known to the
assault survivor (Abrahams et al. 2013, Ullman et al.
2014). Self-blaming attributions for assault, have been
associated with increased levels of PTSD and MDD symp-
toms (Hassija and Gray 2012). These ﬁndings bring
greater awareness to the need for complex interventions
that also recognize and address trauma-related self-blame
depression.

Repeated exposure to psychosocial stressors has been
linked to damaging biological consequences (McEwen
2006) ensuing prolonged activation of allostatic systems
(McEwen and Wingﬁeld 2003), which contribute to psy-
chiatric symptom burden (Gill et al. 2005). Stress-related
psychiatric disorders can then increase the risk for medical
comorbidities that may further affect quality of life (Gill
and Page 2006). As such, lower HRQOL indicators in this
sample were related to a current psychiatric disorder diag-
nosis, and these health declines remained (although less
severe) in the past diagnosis group. These ﬁndings support
past studies, which found a negative association between
HRQOL and PTSD and MDD symptoms (Pacella et al.
2013). This highlights the need for continued health

functioning or

surveillance following the resolution of stress-related psy-
chopathology. Global symptom severity scores and clini-
cians’ subjective ratings of general improvement do not
identify speciﬁc domains of
capture
patient-reported coping (Westphal et al. 2011), which
would otherwise elucidate alternate target areas for inter-
vention. For example, individuals with obesity (Lopresti
and Drummond 2013) and sleep disturbance (Mysliwiec
et al. 2013) are at higher risk for a range of psychiatric dis-
orders, which have similar disrupted biological pathways
(Pace and Heim 2011, Haroon et al. 2012). Therefore,
trauma focused interventions that incorporate a compo-
yield enhanced
nent of HRQOL enrichment, may
improvements in PTSD and MDD symptom severity. A
nurse-led program, which integrates mental health care
with care for other chronic conditions, was effective in
reducing anxiety and depressive symptoms, as well as
improving HRQOL in the elderly (Markle-Reid et al.
2014).

Although optimism and mastery were signiﬁcantly and
negatively correlated with a current psychiatric disorder
diagnosis, only mastery was associated with the no diag-
nosis and past diagnosis groups in the current sample.
These results suggest that the apparent predictive power
of optimism found in this study and others (Bostock
et al. 2009) may have been derived from its substantial
overlap with mastery (Marshall and Lang 1990). Mastery
refers to the degree to which an individual perceives
control and inﬂuence over life circumstances. By con-
trast, optimism is the expectation of favorable outcomes
that are not directly attributable to personal
factors
(Marshall and Lang 1990). Previous studies link mastery
to reduced PTSD onset in up-rooted Israelis (Ben-Zur
2008), attenuated PTSD symptoms in veterans (Potter
et al. 2013), and mitigated depression in women with
intimate partner violence exposure (Rodriguez et al.
2008). Higher mastery is also related to greater quality
life, as well as reduced diabetes-related distress (Yi
of
et al. 2008) and cardiovascular disease mortality (Surtees
et al. 2010). Together these studies illustrate the role of
mastery in resisting and recovering from the effects of
psychological trauma and health-related stressors. Cogni-
tive behavioral therapy (CBT), a widely employed treat-
ment
traumatized populations, promotes greater
mastery by helping patients regulate distressing thoughts
and

ter mastery and have been shown to improve PTSD and
MDD symptoms, alcohol problems, and physical health
issues following trauma exposure (Smith et al. 2011,

critical
responses from social resources increased the risk of
PTSD in physical and sexual assault survivors (Ullman
and Filipas 2001, Andrews et al. 2003), most likely by
discouraging open communication, which increases cog-
nitive
trauma-related
memories (Evans et al. 2013, Ullman and Peter-Hagene
2014). Stigmatization, most relevant to sexual assaults,
encourages social withdrawal and conﬁrms maladaptive
perceptions of self-blame, which are linked to depres-
sion (Filipas and Ullman 2001, Hassija and Gray 2012).
Given the pernicious impact these maladaptive attribu-
tions have on recovery, cognitive restructuring tech-
niques are valuable in challenging these misconceptions
(Hassija and Gray 2012). They’ve also shown beneﬁts
in processing avoidance, as well as enhancing personal
resilience, and social

While social support had a signiﬁcant role in buffering
the initial effects of stress in this sample, posttraumatic
growth was linked to recovery from a psychiatric disor-
der in the aftermath of trauma. These ﬁndings indicate
that posttraumatic growth is not a direct consequence of
trauma exposure, but arises from the cognitive struggle
for a renewed reality during the assumption-shattering
aftershock (Calhoun and Tedeschi 2004). This process
involves working through alternating cycles of intrusion

and avoidance (Joseph et al. 2012), which may suggest
that posttraumatic growth is indicative of psychopathol-
ogy, but instead these constructs reﬂect adaptive cogni-
tive processing (Helgeson et al. 2006). In fact, greater
posttraumatic stress was associated with greater posttrau-
matic growth following the September 11, 2001, attacks,
but only up to a point, above which posttraumatic
growth declined (Butler et al. 2005). This curvilinear
relationship was reﬂected in this sample too, with the
highest endorsement of posttraumatic growth in the past
diagnosis group and the lowest reports in the current
diagnosis group. Posttraumatic growth is not simply a
return to baseline function following a symptomatic per-
iod; instead it is a multifaceted experience of improved
function manifested through a perception of new possi-
bilities, increased sense of connectedness, enhanced per-
and
sonal
deepening in spiritual belief (Zerach et al. 2013). Since
posttraumatic growth has been linked to attenuated post-
traumatic and depression symptoms (Morrill et al. 2008),
as well as increased HRQOL (Morrill et al. 2008), using
an affective–cognitive processing model collaboratively
survivors can help foster posttraumatic
with assault
growth and facilitate
recovery (Joseph et al. 2012).
Engaging the patient in consistent exposure-related activ-
ities to encourage trauma reappraisal, normalizing dis-
tressing emotional states, and promoting relaxation and
gratitude exercises are also helpful techniques for over-
coming processing difﬁculties and promoting growth
(Joseph et al. 2012).

Of the demographic variables, Caucasians were most
prevalent in the no diagnosis group. Ethnic minority sta-
tus is often reported as a risk factor for the development
of PTSD (Breslau et al. 2004); however, ﬁndings are less
disparate when confounding variables, such as low socio-
economic status (Bonanno et al. 2007) and utilization of
health care services (Price et al. 2014) are taken into
account. Post hoc analyses using least squares differences
correction for multiple comparisons revealed no signiﬁ-
cant distinctions by ethnic class. This supports other
studies where ethnic differences in PTSD were rendered
nonsigniﬁcant after socioeconomic factors were statisti-
cally controlled (Adams and Boscarino 2005, Bonanno et
al. 2007). The current study did not offer insight into

Resilience Factors in Assaulted Women

The results of the present study should be interpreted
in light of the study limitations. The sample size was rela-
tively small, and included only women who sustained an
assault. Due to the cross-sectional study design, causal
relationships between endorsement of a resilience factor
and a psychiatric disorder diagnosis cannot be deter-
mined. Larger prospective studies are required to deter-
mine which resilience factors are linked to trauma

assaults.

operational deﬁnition of resilience (i.e., a negative PTSD
diagnosis) was broadened to include the absence of a
stress-related DSM-IV psychiatric disorder diagnosis. This
decision was made based on prior research indicating that
assaulted women present with MDD and/or substance-
related disorders in lieu of PTSD. Increasing the sensitiv-
ity of our grouping criteria may have resulted in the mis-
classiﬁcation of some MDD and alcohol/substance abuse
cases that manifested spontaneously independent of the
assault.”

Conclusion

In this study, we propose that the term “resilience” refers
to the absence of a stress-related DSM-IV psychiatric dis-
order diagnosis following assault, and that resistant and
recovered outcomes are two distinct constructs warrant-
ing separate examination. The most common psychiatric
outcome in this sample was MDD, which may be attrib-
uted to self-blame common to survivors of assault. We
also found that mastery and social support were associ-
ated with the no diagnosis group, while mastery and post-
traumatic growth were related to recovery from a past
psychiatric disorder. These ﬁndings have signiﬁcance in
promoting health and well-being in women, as well as
identifying individuals who are most in need of resilience
promoting interventions. Longitudinal studies are needed
to clarify the factors consistently associated with resilience
in women exposed to PTEs and to determine the extent
that these factors may be modiﬁed through clinical inter-
vention.
