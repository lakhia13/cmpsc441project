Objectives:  This  study  aimed  to  identify  factors  affecting  the  psychological 
well-being of family caregivers of dependent older adults in Italy. Understanding 
these  variables  is  essential  for  designing  interventions  to  prevent  negative 
outcomes  in  at-risk  caregivers.  The  research  explored  how  varying  levels  of 
caregiving burden and types of perceived social support influence psychological 
well-being.

Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 387 family caregivers 
of older adults in the Marche region (Italy) between November 2019 and March 
2020. Data were collected via a structured questionnaire assessing psychological 
well-being  (WHO-5  Well-Being  Index),  caregiving  burden,  and  social  support 
(COPE Index). Statistical analyses were performed using Jamovi software, with a 
significance threshold set at p  <  0.05.

Results: A significant negative correlation was found between caregiving burden 
and psychological well-being [r (364)  =  − 0.540, p  <  0.001], with caregiving burden 
being a significant predictor of psychological well-being reduction (R2  =  0.290; 
F  =  150, p  <  0.001). A threshold value of 2 (on a 1–4 scale) was identified, where 
caregiving  burden  predicted  a  significant  reduction  in  psychological  well-
being.  Conversely,  greater  perceived  social  support  was  positively  correlated 
with  better  psychological  well-being  [r  (357)  =  0.348,  p  <  0.001]  and  was  a 
significant  predictor  of  it  [R2  =  0.121;  F  =  49.2,  p  <  0.001].  Support  from  social 
and health services had the most notable impact on psychological well-being. 
Moreover, social support mitigated the negative impact of caregiving burden on 
psychological well-being.

Conclusion: The study confirms that high caregiving burden adversely affects 
caregivers’  psychological  well-being,  while  social  support  plays  a  protective 
role.  These  findings  highlight  the  need  for  interventions  focused  on  reducing 
caregiving burden and enhancing support systems for family caregivers.

1 Introduction

The anticipated increase in the older adult population in many 
countries  worldwide,  including  Italy,  represents  a  significant 
challenge.  According  to  demographic  projections  by  the  Istituto 
Nazionale di Statistica (ISTAT),1 by 2050, individuals aged 65 and 
over are expected to represent 34.9% of the Italian population. This 
demographic shift is likely to place considerable pressure on social 
protection systems and significantly increase the demand for older 
adult assistance services, as well as the involvement of family members 
in their care. Currently, much care is provided informally by family 
members (1), who play a crucial role in supporting frail older adults 
–  those  who  “are  infirm  and  experience  significant  difficulties  in 
performing  activities  of  daily  living,  resulting  in  a  lack  of 
independence and the need for extensive assistive care,” as defined by 
the APA dictionary.2 This type of care, also known as long-term care 
(LTC), encompasses a wide range of personal, social and medical 
services  aimed  at  assisting  individuals  (particularly  adults  aged 
60 years or above with functional or cognitive impairments) who are 
unable  to  perform  activities  such  as  eating,  dressing  and  bathing 
independently.3

With  the  expected  progressive  growth  of  the  older  adult 
population,  it  is  highly  likely  that  the  responsibilities  of  family 
caregivers will continue to intensify, exposing them to increasing strain 
and stress, thereby raising the urgent question of how to support them.
As previously mentioned, family caregivers are often responsible 
for the daily care of frail older adult relatives. While these care tasks 
are  essential,  they  often  come  at  a  high  personal  cost.  Numerous 
studies have demonstrated the negative impact of caregiving burden 
on the quality of life, health status and psychological well-being of 
family  caregivers  [e.g.,  (2,  3,  4–10,  54)].  In  the  Italian  context, 
research has shown that family caregivers of frail older adults face 
significant challenges in maintaining their psychological well-being 
while managing the increasing demands of caregiving [e.g., (1, 11)].
Although there is considerable agreement about the detrimental 
effects of caregiving, much research has also highlighted the positive 
experiences associated with caring, such as a sense of fulfillment and 
satisfaction [e.g., (12–17, 53)]. However, these positive aspects often 
fail  to  compensate  for  caregiving  fatigue,  especially  when  care 
responsibilities are prolonged over time. Indeed, in many cases, the 
multiple demands of caregiving lead to burnout (18), stress (19), and 
other negative psychological outcomes [e.g., (20–22)].

A  key  factor  that  has  been  shown  to  mitigate  the  effects  of 
caregiving burden is perceived social support, both emotional and 
instrumental. It has been consistently associated with lower levels of 
subjective  distress  and  improved  psychological  well-being  [e.g., 
(23–25)].  In  the  Italian  context,  research  has  also  indicated  that 
social support can play a crucial role in buffering the negative effects 
of  caregiving  [e.g.,  (26)],  but  the  specific  types  of  support  that 

caregivers perceive as most beneficial and the extent to which they 
can  effectively  mitigate  caregiving  stress  remain  under-
explored aspects.

Thus, despite the valuable insights provided by previous studies, 
several gaps remain. Firstly, there is a lack of knowledge about when 
caregiving becomes excessively burdensome and starts to negatively 
impact caregivers’ psychological well-being. In other words, while 
much of the research focuses on the general effects of caregiving, few 
studies  have  identified  the  specific  threshold  at  which  the  burden 
seems to become detrimental. Secondly, although the protective role 
of social support is widely recognized, there is a limited understanding 
of  which  types  of  support  caregivers  perceive  as  most  effective  in 
reducing the negative impacts of caring. Furthermore, the complex 
interaction  between  caregiving  burden,  social  support  and 
psychological  well-being  has  not  been  adequately  examined  in  a 
comprehensive manner, especially in the Italian context.

This  study  aims  to  fill  the  aforementioned  gaps  by  (1) 
investigating  the  extent  to  which  caregiving  burden  negatively 
impacts  psychological  well-being  among  family  caregivers,  (2) 
identifying  the  specific  aspects  of  social  support  that  most  affect 
caregivers’ psychological well-being, and (3) examining whether and 
how social support can mediate the relationship between caregiving 
burden and psychological well-being. In other words, the primary 
aims of the present research are (1) to determine how caregiving 
burden  affects  psychological  well-being  among  Italian  family 
caregivers of older adults; (2) to explore the role of specific aspects of 
social support in affecting family caregivers’ psychological well-being; 
and (3) to identify whether social support acts as a buffer to alleviate 
the psychological strain due to caregiving.

These  objectives  will  therefore  be  pursued  by  answering  the 

following research questions (RQs):

 -  RQ1: Does caregiver burden affect psychological well-being? If 

so, to what extent?

 -  RQ2: Does social support influence psychological well-being? If 
so, which aspects have the most significant impact on caregivers’ 
psychological well-being?

 -  RQ3:  If  caregiver  strain  negatively 

impacts  caregivers’ 
psychological well-being, can social support mediate this effect 
(i.e., act as a buffer)?

The answers to these questions could provide useful indications 
for the development of interventions aimed at reducing the burden on 
caregivers, enhancing their psychological well-being and improving 
the care they provide.

This  cross-sectional  study  draws  on  data  collected  in  the 
Marche region (Italy) by the survey titled ‘The perspective of older 
people  with  LTC  needs  and  their  family  caregivers  in  the  Marche 
region’  (27),  commissioned  by  the  Marche  Region  Authority  to 
deepen the understanding of the care needs of vulnerable older 
people  living  in  this  area  of  Central  Italy  and  their  primary 
family caregivers.

The sampling followed a convenience/purposive method (28). 
Older people were identified first by the pensioners’ trade unions to 
which older individuals or their relatives had sought support for 
accessing LTC services, e.g., the State Care Allowance (“Indennità 
di Accompagnamento” in Italian), a monetary cash benefit provided 
by the Government to individuals with a severe level of disability.

Older  individuals  were  included  and  considered  eligible  to 
participate in the study if they (a) signed the informed consent form 
and volunteered to participate in the study, and (b1) received the 
State Care Allowance (which ensured a high degree of disability) or 
(b2) although they did not receive the State Care Allowance, they 
reported a score of less than 9 on a 12-item scale measuring their level 
of autonomy in Activities of Daily Living (ADL), based on the Barthel 
Index (29), and the Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL 
(30)). This screening was conducted through face-to-face interviews 
administered by trained volunteers from the trade unions.

Once recruited, older individuals were screened for eligibility, 
and the interviewers planned an appointment to meet them in person 
and administer the questionnaire at their homes. The interviewers 
then asked them to indicate their primary family caregiver to also 
participate in the survey. Subsequently, the interviewer contacted the 
primary caregiver, screened them and if eligible, scheduled another 
appointment at the caregiver’s home or in the trade union office.

Family caregivers – who were all Italian-speaking – were included 
in the sample if they were caregivers of older individuals with LTC 
needs,  were  25 years  of  age  or  older,  had  been  providing  direct 
assistance  to  the  older  relative  for  at  least  1 year,  did  not  have  a 
cognitive impairment and signed the informed consent.

For older individuals, we did not conduct a sample size study; 
however, to ensure the highest correspondence between the sample 
selected for this study and the universe of older people with LTC 
needs living in the Marche region, we estimated the share of the 
over-75 population with severe mental and physical limitations for 
each of the 13 health districts in which the health service of the 
Marche  Region  is  articulated  (at  this  level,  care  pathways  are 
activated  and  integration  between  health  and  social  activities  is 
realized). This share was then stratified by age (using three groups: 
75–79, 80–84, and 85+) and gender, and the results were used as a 
basis  to  identify  the  minimum  number  of  respondents  to 
be interviewed in each district (31). The interviewers visited the 
interviewees’ homes and administered the questionnaire face-to-
face. In about half of the cases, the person in need of care was unable 
to fill in the survey unassisted, and the primary caregiver completed 
the questionnaire as a proxy for them for all questions not requiring 
a subjective response.

As for the caregivers, the sample size was determined based on 

the older individuals’ sample size.

All  data  were  collected  anonymously,  in  compliance  with  the 
guidelines  set  forth  in  EU  Regulation  No.  679  of  the  European 
Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016, as well as the Helsinki 
Declaration (2013). The study was submitted for approval to the Ethics 
Committee of the National Institute of Health and Science on Aging 
(INRCA), which deemed approval unnecessary since the investigation 
did not involve clinical patients.

Data collection was carried out by the primary pensioners’ trade 
union volunteers between November 2019 and March 2020 in the 
aforementioned 13 health districts of the Marche Region, including 
both inland and coastal areas.

2.2 Measures

for  older 

individuals  did  not 

Considering the two targets, the survey comprised two common 
assessment tools: the first included a series of questions designed to 
assess the condition and requirements of frail older individuals with 
LTC  needs;  the  second  consisted  of  a  set  of  questions  specifically 
targeted at caregivers, aiming to gain insights into their condition and 
needs.  Except  for  questions  about  ADL  and  IADL  (29,  30),  the 
include  other 
questionnaire 
psychometrically  validated  scales.  The  questionnaire  for  family 
caregivers  embedded  ad-hoc  multiple-choice  and  open-ended 
questions on socio-demographic aspects, family caregivers’ burden, 
well-being,  formal  and  informal  support  received,  and  work-life 
balance issues. It also included some validated scales for measuring 
caregiving burden (the 7-item subscale of the Carers of Older People 
in Europe Index - COPE Index), psychological well-being (the World 
Health Organization’s Five-Well-Being Index -WHO-5), and social 
support (the 4-item subscale of the Carers of Older People in Europe 
Index - COPE Index), which are described in detail below.

In this study, we focused exclusively on the outcome measures of 

the family caregivers’ questionnaire.

2.2.1 Personal information data

Family  caregivers  answered  a  series  of  questions  designed  to 
identify the characteristics of the sample considered (e.g., gender, age, 
level of education, parental status with the older adult care recipient).

2.2.2 Caregiver burden

Caregiver  burden  was  measured  by  four  specific  questions 
tailored for this study, aiming to assess the extent to which caregivers 
perceive a loss of personal time due to caring for the older adult 
person (1. Do you feel that you do not have enough time for yourself 
because of the time spent on the older adult person?), as well as their 
perceived levels of stress resulting from caring for the older adult 
and coping with other responsibilities (2. Do you feel stressed between 
caring  for  the  older  adult  person  and  trying  to  cope  with  other 
responsibilities?), levels of fatigue (3. Do you feel fatigued when caring 
for the older adult person?) and sense of the insecurity (4. Do you feel 
insecure about what to do for your older adult person?). Respondents 
were  asked  to  rate  on  a  5-point  Likert  scale  from  0  (never)  to  4 
(almost always). The internal consistency of the items was good, with 
a Cronbach’s alpha of 0.80. Additionally, caregiving burden was also 
measured by the 7-item subscale of the Carers of Older People in 
Europe  Index  (COPE  Index)  (2,  55,  56),  specifically  item  1.  Do 
you find caring too demanding?; 2. Does assisting create any difficulties 
for you in your relations with your friends?; 3. Does caring have a 
negative  effect  on  your  physical  health?;  4.  Does  caring  create 
difficulties for you in your relationships with your family?; 5. Does 
caring cause you financial difficulties?; 6. Do you feel ‘trapped’ in your 
role as a carer?; 7. Does caring have a negative effect on your emotional 
balance? Respondents rated items on a 4-point Likert scale from 1 
(always) to 4 (never), except for item 7, where the rating was reversed 
(1 = never, 4 = always). The values of the first six items were inverted 
to match item 7 and previous items. The scale showed good internal 
consistency (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.84). Following Balducci et al. (2), 
an exploratory factor analysis (EFA) – the results of which are not 
reported  in  detail  due  to  space  limitations  –  revealed  a  3-factor 
structure,  one  of  which  is  represented  by  the  caregiver  burden

subscale, replicating Balducci et al.’s findings. To assess the construct 
validity of the COPE Index subscale, a confirmatory factor analysis 
(CFA) was also conducted on the seven items. All items loaded on 
the  same  factor,  with  estimates  ranging  from  0.480  to  0.723, 
supporting  the  unidimensional  structure  of  the  COPE  Index 
Caregiver Burden subscale. The overall fit indices suggest that the 
model fits the data well, with a CFI of 0.973, a TLI of 0.959 (both 
values above 0.95) and a RMSEA of 0.0664 (i.e., below 0.08).

Furthermore,  to  account  for  the  multiple  components  of  care 
burden, we computed a new summary index called ‘total care burden’. 
Principal component analysis (PCA) and exploratory factor analysis 
(EFA) showed that all items (i.e., the four specifically tailored for this 
study  and  the  7  of  the  COPE  subscale)  loaded  on  a  single  factor, 
explaining 47.9% of the variance. The new index had high internal 
consistency, with a Cronbach’s alpha of 0.888.

2.2.3 Well-being

The family caregivers’ psychological well-being was assessed 
using the Italian version of the World Health Organization’s Five-
Well-Being Index (32–34), which is available in PDF format on 
the WHO-Five website at the following link.4 The WHO-5 is a 
self-report measure assessing subjective psychological well-being, 
consisting of five statements that respondents rate on a 6-point 
Likert  scale  ranging  from  0  (not  at  all)  to  5  (all  the  time). 
Respondents were asked to provide answers that come closest to 
how  they  have  felt  in  the  past  2 weeks  to  the  following  five 
assertions: I have felt cheerful and in good spirits; I have felt calm 
and relaxed; I have felt active and vigorous; I woke up feeling fresh 
and rested; My daily life has been filled with things that interest me. 
Higher  scores  correspond  to  a  higher  level  of  well-being; 
conversely, lower scores correspond to a lower level of well-being. 
The  raw  score  is  calculated  by  adding  up  the  scores  given  by 
respondents for the five answers and ranges from 0 (lowest well-
being) to 25 (highest well-being). A score below 13– as suggested 
by many studies in the literature [e.g., (35, 36, 57)] – indicates a 
poor  state  of  well-being  and  is  an  indication  to  perform  the 
depression test. The raw score can be multiplied by 4 to give a 
percentage score ranging from 0 (worst) to 100 (best). In this case, 
the cut-off is set at 50. Cronbach’s alpha and McDonald’s omega 
were both 0.90. To assess the construct validity of the WHO-5 
Index, a CFA was conducted. The factorial loadings are strong 
(ranging from 0.694 to 0.866) and statistically significant, showing 
that  each  item  contributes  significantly  to  the  latent  factor. 
However, the Chi-square results [χ2 (5) = 54.9,  p < 0.001] and the 
high RMSEA (0.162) indicate a misfit of the model to the data, 
despite the high values of CFI (= 0.96) and TLI (= 0.92). In other 
words, although CFI and TLI suggest that the model satisfactorily 
explains  an  important  part  of  the  variance,  the  high  RMSEA 
deserves attention.

Respondents’ well-being was also measured by:

4  https://www.psykiatri-regionh.dk/who-5/Documents/WHO5_Italian.pdf; 

last accessed on 24 March 2024.

 -  The  initial  item  of  the  SF-36  Health  Survey  (37–41),  which 
assesses individuals’ overall perception of their general health on 
a  5-point  Likert  scale  ranging  from  1  (excellent)  to  5  (poor). 
Nonetheless, we preferred to reverse values, so that 1 stands for 
poor and 5 for excellent;

 -  One question specifically tailored for this study to explore the 
caregiver’s assessment of their quality of life over the past 2 weeks. 
Again, respondents were asked to answer on a 5-point Likert 
scale ranging from 1 (very good) to 5 (very bad). In this scale, 
we preferred to reverse values, so that 1 would refer to very poor 
and 5 to very good.

Since our questionnaire measured well-being using different items 
that assess specific components, we calculated a new summary index 
called ‘total well-being’. PCA results indicated that all items loaded 
optimally  on  a  single  factor,  explaining  63.6%  of  the  variance. 
Similarly, EFA confirmed that all items loaded optimally on a single 
factor. Cronbach’s alpha for this new index was 0.897, indicating high 
internal consistency.

2.2.4 Social support

Social support, a complex and multidimensional construct [see 
(42)]  –  encompassing  both  the  general  perception  of  being 
supported by friends and family networks, as well as by health and 
social services – was assessed through the 4-item subscale of the 
Carers of Older People in Europe Index (COPE Index) (2, 55, 56), 
specifically item 1. Do you feel adequately supported by your friends/
neighbors?; 2. Do you feel adequately supported by your family?; 3. Do 
you feel adequately supported by health and social services (public, 
private, or voluntary)?; 4. Overall, do you feel adequately supported in 
your role as an assistant?). Respondents rated on a 4-point Likert 
scale  from  1  (Never)  to  4  (Always).  This  subscale  measures  the 
extent to which caregivers feel supported by their family, friends, 
and health and social services. In our sample, Cronbach’s alpha and 
McDonald’s omega were, respectively, 0.576 and 0.611. Although 
both  values  are  poor,  they  are  nevertheless  acceptable  (43–45). 
Specifically,  since  Cronbach’s  alpha  tends  to  increase  with  the 
number of items on the scale, adding more well-aligned items (in 
this  case,  for  example,  concerning  other  specific  types  of  social 
support)  could  improve  internal  consistency.  As  the  scale  is 
multidimensional, refinement of the subscales could lead to better 
consistency in each dimension. A CFA was also conducted for this 
subscale. The factor loadings are all significant, but there is variability 
in  the  strength  of  their  associations  (which  range  from  0.317  to 
0.736) with the latent factor. The fit indices suggest that the model 
has a moderate fit to the data. While the CFI is good (= 0.962), the 
RMSEA (= 0.0910, i.e., above 0.08), the TLI (= 0.887, i.e., below 
0.90), and the Chi-square results [χ2 (2) = 8.41, p = 0.015] indicate 
that the model might require some improvements to better represent 
the underlying data.

Social support was also measured by two questions specifically 
tailored for this study to find out whether caregivers think they can 
rely on others, i.e., whether they can find someone to substitute in case 
of  illness  or  need  for  a  break.  Respondents  were  asked  to  choose 
among three different possible answers: I could find quite easily (1); 
I could find with difficulty (2); I could not find anyone (3).

2.3 Data analysis

3.2 Descriptive and inferential analyses

Data were analyzed using Jamovi (Version 2.3.21.0), an open 
statistical software,5 built on top of the R statistical language6, and 
inferential  (t-test,  ANOVA, 
RStudio.  Both  descriptive  and 
correlations, linear regressions, Receiver Operating Characteristic 
– ROC - analysis, multivariate logistic regression, and mediation) 
analyses were performed. Descriptive statistics have been used to 
summarize the characteristics of the sample, including measures of 
central  tendency  (e.g.,  mean)  and  variability  (e.g.,  standard 
deviation)  for  continuous  variables.  For  categorical  variables, 
frequencies and percentages were reported. Inferential statistics were 
used to show the relationships between continuous variables (e.g., 
caregiver  burden  and  well-being),  with  Pearson’s  correlation 
coefficients computed to assess the strength and direction of linear 
relationships. Additionally, linear regression models were performed 
to determine whether one variable predicts another. For categorical 
variables,  tests  such  as  Chi-square  were  used  to  examine  the 
association between different groups. Missing data were handled 
systematically.  Since  the  proportion  of  missing  data  was  low,  a 
complete-case analysis was performed. A standard level of statistical 
significance  (p-value)  was  set  at  0.05.  Any  p-value  below  this 
threshold was considered statistically significant. Alongside p-values, 
95%  confidence  intervals  (CIs)  were  reported  for  effect  sizes  in 
regression models and other inferential tests. CIs were calculated to 
provide a range of values within which the true parameter value 
likely  lies.  Reporting  confidence  intervals  offers  insight  into  the 
precision  of  the  estimates  and 
informative  than 
p-values alone.

3.1 Sample characteristics

Out of the 387 individuals who completed the questionnaire, 
251  (64.9%)  were  female,  while  136  (35.1%)  were  male.  The 
participants’ ages ranged from 25 to 89, with a mean age of 63.3 
(SD = 11.4). This value is particularly noteworthy as it indicates that 
our  sample  of  family  caregivers  for  dependent  older  adult 
individuals consists largely of individuals who are themselves older 
adult  or  nearing  that  stage.  Moreover,  over  half  (56.6%)  of  the 
family  caregivers  in  our  sample  provide  care  without  assistance 
from non-family caregivers, thus exclusively taking on the burden 
of caring. Among the participants, 62.5% were daughters or sons of 
the  assisted  older  persons,  while  21.4%  were  spouses.  Most 
caregivers (55.6%) live in the same household as the person they are 
caring  for,  which  could  make  caring  even  more  stressful.  On 
average, they spend 60.8 h per week caring for the older adult. For 
a  more  comprehensive  overview  of  the  sample  characteristics, 
please refer to Supplementary Table S1.

In  the  following  section,  descriptive  and  inferential  analyses 
concerning the variables taken into consideration will be presented.

3.2.1 Caregivers’ care burden

As mentioned in the methodology section, caregiver burden was 
first  measured  using  four  questions  specifically  designed  for  this 
purpose. Higher scores (4 = ‘almost always’) indicate a higher perceived 
care burden. As shown in Table 1, caregivers assigned an average score 
between 2 and 3 (indicating responses between ‘sometimes’ and ‘often’) 
to questions about lack of personal time, stress, and caregiving fatigue. 
They assigned an average score between 1 and 2 (indicating responses 
between  ‘rarely’  and  ‘sometimes’)  to  the  question  about  insecurity 
related to caring for the older relatives. When combining the percentages 
of  respondents  who  answered  sometimes  (2),  often  (3)  and  almost 
always (4) for the items on lack of personal time (74.4%), perceived 
stress (75.6%), and caregiving fatigue (70.4%), the overall rate for each 
item  is  approximately  70%.  Only  the  item  related  to  insecurity  in 
providing care shows a distinct pattern, with a higher percentage of 
respondents assigning lower values, thus implicitly suggesting that they 
feel confident about caring for the person most of the time.

To  test  whether  gender  and  age  affect  the  level  of  burden 
experienced,  t-test  and  ANOVA  were  used  (see  Table  2).  T-test 
(applied to the mean value of the four items) revealed no significant 
differences based on caregivers’ gender [t (384) = −1.35, p = 0.178]. 
However, when the four items were analyzed separately, a statistically 
significant difference emerged in terms of perceived stress for caring 
tasks and managing responsibilities, with women caregivers reporting 
significantly  more  stress  than  men  [t  (384) = −2.08,  p = 0.038]. 
ANOVA  test  revealed  instead  that  age  significantly  impacts  the 
perceived burden of care [F (4, 128) = 3.67, p = 0.007]. Specifically, 
post-hoc tests indicated that caregivers over 80 perceive a significantly 
higher care burden than the 60–69 age group (p = 0.002).

However, correlation analysis (Pearson’s r = 0.094, p = 0.066) and 
linear regression (R2 = 0.00880; F = 3.41, p = 0.06) showed no significant 
relationship between age (as a continuous variable) and perceived care 
burden, meaning that advancing age alone is not a reliable predictor 
of increasing perceived care burden.

In addition to the four items, caregiver burden was also measured 
using the 7-item subscale of the COPE index. As shown in Table 3, the 
respondents in our sample gave an average score between 2 and 3 
(indicating answers between ‘sometimes’ and ‘often’) to items 1, 2, 6, 
and 7. Specifically, caregivers reported that they sometimes or often 
perceived  their  caregiving  activities  as  being  too  demanding 
(mean = 2.53), responsible for difficulties with friends (mean = 2.08), 
a source of their feeling of being trapped in their role (mean = 2.10), 
and  having  negative  effects  on  their  own  emotional  well-being 
(mean = 2.04). Conversely, they assigned an average score between 1 
(‘never’) and 2 (‘sometimes’) to items 3, 4, and 5, indicating that they 
only rarely or sometimes perceived their caregiving activities as being 
responsible for negative effects on their physical health (mean = 1.96), 
causing  difficulties  with  their  family  (mean = 1.61),  or  leading  to 
financial difficulties (mean = 1.72).

Again, the t-test – calculated on the mean of the 7-item subscale 
of the COPE Index – showed no significant differences based on the 
gender of the caregiver [t (376) = −1.78, p = 0.076]. However, when 
the t-test was calculated on the seven items separately, there were 
statistically significant differences between men and women on the 
items measuring the negative impact of caregiving on physical health 
[t (384) = −2.34, p = 0.019] and emotional well-being [t (384) = −2.53,

p = 0.012],  with  female  caregivers  reporting  significantly  more 
negative  impacts  of  caregiving,  both  physically  and  emotionally. 
Regarding age, ANOVA test did not reveal any statistically significant 
differences across the various caregiver age groups [F (4, 123) = 1.56, 
p = 0.188] (see Table 4). It should be noted, however, that the mean 
scores of caregivers aged 70–79 and 80 and over were higher than 2, 
indicating that they often feel that caregiving has a negative impact 
on their relationships, physical health and emotional well-being. In 
contrast, younger age groups reported consistently lower mean scores.
Even when age is treated as a continuous variable, correlation 
analysis (Pearson’s r = 0.093, p = 0.072) and linear regression analysis 
(R2 = 0.00857, F = 3.25, p = 0.072) do not reveal significant relations, 
again confirming that the age of the caregiver alone is not a predictor 
of increased perceived care burden.

they  appear 

Although the four items specifically designed in this study to 
measure care burden and the COPE index subscale measure different 
aspects  of  perceived  caregiving  burden, 
to 
be complementary features of the same dimension. This is indicated 
by the results of the correlation analysis (which was carried out after 
converting  all  scores  into  z-scores  to  standardize  the  measures), 
according to which Pearson’s r coefficient was found to be 0.691, a 
highly  significant  value  (p < 0.001),  and  it  is  also  confirmed,  as 
previously mentioned in the methodological section, by PCA and 
EFA  that  showed  that  all  items  load  optimally  on  a  single  factor, 
we labeled ‘total care burden’.

3.2.2 Caregivers’ well-being

In terms of psychological well-being, as measured by the WHO-5 
scale, descriptive analysis reveals that more than half of the caregivers 
in our sample scored below the cut-off point of 13, which suggests the 
administration  of  a  depression  test.  The  mean  score  was  11.1 
(SD ± 6.27). Although a clear trend emerged, with women showing 
lower well-being scores than men, this difference is not statistically 
significant [t (372) = 1.89, p = 0.059]. Conversely, when data are split 
by  age,  ANOVA  indicates  a  clear  pattern,  according  to  which 
psychological well-being significantly declines with increasing age [F 
(4, 134) = 3.31, p = 0.005] (see Table 5).

As revealed by the post-hoc test, the significance is due to the 
difference between the younger (under 50 years) and the older group 
(70–79 years, p = 0.023; and 80 and over, p = 0.002).

ANOVA

F = 1.56, df1 = 4, df2 = 123, p = 0.188

These  results  are  also  confirmed  by  correlation  (Pearson’s  r 
coefficient was found to be −0.181, p < 0.001), and linear regression 
analyses (R2 = 0.0328; F = 12.6, p < 0.001), which suggest that increasing 
age of the caregiver is a predictor of lower psychological well-being.

Since well-being is a complex construct, in addition to measuring 
it using the WHO-5 scale, it was also assessed using two other items: 
one measuring the overall perception of general health and the other 
quality of life.

As  for  the  general  health  status,  family  caregivers’  overall 
perception was rated by most of the respondents (46.5%) as fair. The 
average  rating  was  2.59  on  a  scale  ranging  from  1  (poor)  to  5 
(excellent). Although some differences in the well-being of caregivers 
based on gender were found, with men reporting higher levels of well-
being (average score of 2.70) compared to women (average score of 
2.53), these differences were not statistically significant, as indicated 
by the t-test results [t (379) = 1.91, p = 0.056]. Conversely, ANOVA test 
showed  statistically  significant  differences  according  to  age  [F  (4, 
129) = 9.96, p < 0.001] (see Table 6).

Specifically, the post-hoc test revealed that younger caregivers, i.e., 
those aged under 50, rate their health as significantly better (mean 
value = 3.11)  than  older  caregivers,  particularly  those  aged  60–69, 
70–79,  and  80-plus.  However,  there  is  no  significant  difference  in 
health  ratings  between  younger  caregivers  and  those  aged  50–59. 

Conversely, the over-80s rate their health as significantly worse (mean 
value = 2.31) than those aged 50–59. Finally, the group aged 50–59 
rated their health as significantly better (mean value = 2.73) than the 
group aged 70–79 (mean value = 2.31). These results are statistically 
confirmed  by  correlation  (Pearson’s  r  coefficient  was  found  to 
be  −0.298,  p < 0.001)  and  linear  regression  (R2 = 0.0890;  F = 37.0, 
p < 0.001) analyses, which indicate that caregiver’s general health status 
perception worsens as age increases. In other words, increasing age of 
the caregiver is a predictor of worsening health.

As for the perceived quality of life over the past 2 weeks, a high 
percentage of family caregivers (46.7%) assessed it as ‘Neither good 
nor poor’. The average rating on a scale of 1 (very poor) to 5 (very 
good) was 3.38. Since higher scores indicate higher perceived quality 
of life, the caregivers in our sample seem to be near the middle of the 
scale. Although there are some gender-related differences in quality of 
life,  with  men  assigning  higher  mean  values  (3.46)  compared  to 
women  (3.34),  this  difference  is  not  statistically  significant  [t 
(381) = 1.63, p = 0.105]. Conversely, ANOVA test showed statistically 
significant differences based on age [F (4, 129) = 7.04, p < 0.001]. Like 
the results for the general health assessment, caregivers’ ratings of 
their  own  quality  of  life  are  significantly  influenced  by  age  (see 
Table 7). The post-hoc test shows statistically significant differences, 
with younger caregivers (under 50) reporting better quality of life

scores compared to older caregivers. Specifically, those over 80 rated 
their quality of life significantly lower than younger groups, especially 
those aged 50–59 and 60–69. These findings are further supported by 
the correlation analysis (Pearson’s r = −0.205, p < 0.001) and linear 
regression  analysis  (R2 = 0.0393; F = 16.6, p < 0.001),  both  of  which 
indicate that as caregivers age, their quality of life decreases. In other 
words, advancing caregiver age is a predictor of lower quality of life.

Since  our  questionnaire  assessed  well-being  through  several 
components  (psychological  well-being,  general  health,  perceived 
quality of life), we conducted – after transforming all the scores of the 
different  variables  into  z-scores  to  standardize  the  measures  –  a 
correlation  analysis.  Its  results  reveal  that  caregivers’  subjective 
assessment  of  their  own  health  status  correlates  positively  and 
significantly  with  their  assessment  of  their  own  quality  of  life  [r 
(376) = 0.39,  p < 0.001],  thus,  a  better  assessment  of  one’s  health 
corresponds to a better assessment of one’s quality of life. Similarly, the 
correlations  between  psychological  well-being  and  health  status  [r 
(367) = 0.48, p < 0.001], as well as between psychological well-being and 
quality  of  life  [r  (372) = 0.65,  p < 0.001],  are  significant.  Therefore, 
higher scores for general health and quality of life are associated with 
higher scores for psychological well-being. The PCA and EFA analyses 
also confirmed, as previously discussed in the methodological section, 
that  the  items  used  for  psychological  well-being  (measured  by  the 
WHO-5), perceived general health and quality of life measure a same 
underlying dimension, that we called ‘total well-being’.

3.2.3 Perceived social support

As for the COPE index quality of support subscale, data analysis 
reveals that caregivers in our sample assigned an average score of 2 to 
3 (corresponding to responses ranging from ‘sometimes’ to ‘often’) to 
items 1, 2, and 4. For item 2, the average rating fell between 3 (‘often’) 
and  4  (‘always’).  This  suggests  that  the  caregivers  in  our  sample 
reported feeling supported by friends, health and social services, and 
generally in their role sometimes or often; additionally, they indicated 
that they felt supported by their own family ‘often’ or ‘always’ (see 
Table 8). However, Table 8 also highlights that a significant percentage 
of respondents felt poorly supported by friends and neighbors (35.3% 
‘never’ and 29.1% only ‘sometimes’), and by social and health services 
(26.4% ‘never’ and 42.7% only ‘sometimes’).

Regarding perceived support, the t-test revealed no significant 
difference according to gender [t (369) = −0.57, p = 0.563]. Similarly, 
the  ANOVA  test  applied  to  age  did  not  show  any  statistically 
significant difference [F (4, 118) = 1.72, p = 0.149] (See Table 9).

Social support is a very multifaceted construct that encompasses 
both  the  overall  perception  of  being  supported  by  friends  and 
family  networks,  as  well  as  by  health  and  social  services.  In  the 
questionnaire administered to our sample, in addition to the COPE 
social support subscale, two other questions were included to assess 
whether caregivers could rely on someone in times of need. When 
asked if someone would be available to assist them in caring for the 
older  adult  person  if  they  were  ill,  the  majority  of  caregivers 
(44.8% + 43.8% = 88.6%) 
responded  positively.  Similarly,  a 
significant proportion of caregivers (42.6% + 44.2% = 86.8%) also 
answered  affirmatively  when  asked  if  there  would  be  someone 
available to take care of the older adult person in their absence, 
allowing them a break from caregiving duties (see Table 10).

No statistical differences were found regarding gender and age 
for both questions. As for gender, the χ2 for the first and second

and  χ2  (8,  N = 385) = 6.95,  p = 0.542.  In  other  words,  caregivers’ 
personal belief that they can count on the support of someone else 

in case of illness or need for a break does not seem to be influenced 
by age or gender.

After presenting the data for each of the variables and dimensions 
studied, the following analyses are carried out to answer specifically 
and in more detail the three research questions underlying this paper.

3.2.4 Caregiving burden and psychological 
well-being

Before addressing RQ1 (Does caregiver burden affect psychological 
well-being? If so, to what extent?), a correlation analysis was performed 
on the various measures used to evaluate caregiving burden and well-
being. The results revealed significant associations, indicating that as 
caregiving burden increases, well-being decreases, and vice versa (see 
Table 11).

Specifically:

 •  Each  of  the  three  variables  used  to  measure  well-being  is 
negatively  and  significantly  correlated  with  the  two  variables 
measuring care burden.

 •  The  two  variables  measuring  care  burden  are  –  as  already 
mentioned at the end of section 3.2.1 – positively correlated with 
each other, thus indicating that they capture different aspects of 
the same underlying dimension.

 •  The three variables measuring individual well-being - as already 
mentioned at the end of section 3.2.2 – are positively correlated 
with each other, demonstrating that they also capture different 
aspects of the same underlying dimension.

Given  the  highly  significant  results  of  internal  reliability 
(Cronbach’s index), PA and EFA for both ‘total well-being’ (items of 
WHO-5, general health, and quality of life), and ‘total care burden’ 
(items  specifically  designed  for  testing  care  burden,  and  COPE 
subscale for caregiver burden), as pointed out in the methodological 
session, we also calculated the correlation between these two new 
variables.  The  analysis  once  again  revealed  a  significant  negative 
correlation  (Pearson’s  r = −0.582,  p < 0.001)  indicating  that  as  care 
burden increases, well-being decreases. Moreover, linear regression 
analysis confirmed that changes in caregiver burden predict changes 
in caregiver well-being (R2 = 0.339; F = 184, p < 0.001).

Specifically addressing RQ1, we tested whether caregiver burden 
is a predictor of poor psychological well-being and at what point it 
leads to psychological distress, by conducting linear regression and 
receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses.

Linear regression analysis revealed that care burden is a significant 
predictor  of  psychological  well-being,  both  when  the  four  items 
specifically  designed  are  taken  into  account  (R2 = 0.197;  F = 91.3, 
p < 0.001)  and  when  the  Cope  index  subscale  is  used  (R2 = 0.290; 
F = 150, p < 0.001). These results indicate that as caregiving burden 
increases, psychological well-being significantly decreases.

To identify the point at which perceived fatigue leads to a decline in 
psychological well-being, we also conducted a ROC analysis, assuming 
a value ≤13 on the WHO-5 scale as the cut-off for poor psychological 
well-being. We sought to determine at what average level of caregiver 
burden (as measured separately by the COPE subscale and by the four 
items  specifically  designed)  our  sample  began  to  exhibit  poor 
psychological well-being. Operationally, we considered the WHO-5 
scale as a dichotomous dependent variable (scores above 13 indicate 
good well-being, scores equal to or below 13 indicate poor well-being) 
and as covariates once for the COPE caregiver burden subscale and once 
for the four items specifically designed for measuring care burden.

As  for  the  COPE  subscale  for  care  burden,  the  ROC  analysis 
identified an optimal cut-off value of 2 (on a 4-point Likert scale 
ranging  from  1  to  4,  with  1 = ‘never’;  2 = ‘sometimes’;  3 = ‘often’; 
4 = ‘always’). This means that a score above 2 (frequency ‘sometimes’

reasonably good performance in discriminating between different levels of psychological well-being based on caregiving burden, with a good balance 
between sensitivity (the model’s ability to identify true positives, i.e., cases where the psychological well-being is correctly identified given the care 
burden) and specificity (the model’s ability to identify true negatives, i.e., cases where psychological well-being is correctly identified as unaffected by 
caregiving burden). The AUC: 0.74 (0.689–0.79), p  <  0.001 indicates a good level of accuracy of the model in discriminating between those who have 
low psychological well-being and those who do not.

cut-off the value of 1.75 (on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 0 
to  4,  with  0 = ‘never’;  1 = ‘rarely’;  2 = ‘sometimes’;  3 = ‘often’; 
4 = ‘almost always’). In this case, a score above 1.75 signals a higher 
probability of low psychological well-being, while a score below 
1.75 signals a lower probability of low psychological well-being. In 
other words, a value of 1.75 is the point at which the burden of care 
begins to predict a significant reduction in psychological well-being 
(see Figure 2).

These results can be used to identify individuals who may need 
additional support to improve their psychological well-being when 
experiencing a significant caregiving burden (equals 2 when measured 
with  the  COPE  subscale  and  1.75  when  measured  with  the  four 
specifically developed items).

3.2.5 Social support and psychological well-being
To address the first part of RQ2 (Does social support influence 
psychological well-being?), correlation and regression analyses were 
carried out. As expected, correlation analysis suggests that perceived 
social  support  (measured  by  the  COPE  subscale  index)  positively 

impacts carers’ psychological well-being (measured by WHO-5) [r 
(357) = 0.348, p < 0.001] (Table 12).

Linear  regression  analysis  supports  this,  indicating  that  social 
support  is  a  significant  predictor  of  psychological  well-being 
(R2 = 0.121; F = 49.2, p < 0.001).

3.2.6 Multivariate logistic regression

Multivariate logistic regression was conducted to further explore 
the relationship between perceived caregiver burden and psychological 
well-being,  specifically  identifying  the  weight  of  each  aspect  of 
caregiving on psychological well-being, as well as to identify which 
dimensions of social support have the greatest impact on perceived 
psychological  well-being,  thus  addressing  the  second  part  of  RQ2 
(which aspects of social support have the most significant impact on 
caregivers’ psychological well-being?).

In the table below, the ‘Estimate’ column shows the coefficients in 
log-odds  form.  More  precisely,  the  estimation  output  highlights 
whether  the  effect  of  the  predictors  on  the  variable  of  interest  is 
positive or negative.

Table 13 shows only those items from the different scales that have 
a significant impact on the dependent variable (i.e., psychological 
well-being exclusively measured with WHO-5).

Regarding the four items specifically designed for measuring care 

burden, Table 13 shows that:

 •  Lower levels of stress in caring and coping with responsibilities 
(‘Do you feel stressed between caring for the older adult person 
and trying to cope with other responsibilities?’ with 0 = ‘never’, 
1 = ‘rarely’,  and  2 = ‘sometimes’)  have  a  significant  impact  on 
psychological  well-being;  hence,  less  stress  corresponds  to 
greater well-being. Although the relationship is significant for all 
values  of  the  variable,  it  is  observed  that  the  significance 
decreases when the variable takes values of 1 and 2. In other 
words, at values of 1 and 2, the variable loses its significance, as 
a higher level of stress would have a negative effect on well-being.
 •  Lower levels of fatigue in caring (‘Do you feel fatigued when 
caring for the older adult? with 0 = ‘never’, and 1 = ‘rarely’) also 
have a significant effect on psychological well-being; in other 
words, lower levels of perceived fatigue correspond to higher 
psychological well-being.

 •  Lower levels of insecurity in caring (‘Do you feel insecure about 
what to do for your older adult person?’ with 0 = ‘never’) also 
correspond to greater psychological well-being.

Additionally,  regarding  caregiving  burden,  as  measured  by  the 
COPE index subscale, the reported absence of perceived difficulties in 
relationships with friends (‘Does caring cause any difficulties in your 
relationships with friends?’) and family (‘Does caring cause any difficulties 
in your relationships with family?’), as a result of caregiving tasks, and the 
absence of a negative effect of caring on personal physical health (‘Does 
caring have a negative effect on your physical health status?’) also have a 
significant impact on psychological well-being. In other words, the less 
people feel that caring has a negative impact on their relationships (with 
friends and family) and on their own physical health, the better their 
self-reported  psychological  well-being.  Conversely,  greater  financial 
difficulties (‘Does providing assistance cause you financial difficulties?’) 
have a negative impact on psychological well-being.

On  the  COPE  Index  social  support  subscale,  only  the  item 
concerning  social  and  health  services  (Do  you  feel  adequately 
supported by health and social services (public, private, or voluntary?)) 
is significantly associated with well-being at higher levels. In other 
words,  the  greater  the  perceived  support  from  social  and  health 
services,  the  greater  the  reported  psychological  well-being.  This 
information could be used to enhance social and health services, 
given their crucial role in the psychological well-being of caregivers. 
If psychological well-being is closely related to the extent to which 
caregivers  feel  supported  by  these  services,  then  improving  the 
quality  of  services  should  increase  the  likelihood  of  caregivers 
achieving good levels of psychological well-being.

3.2.7 Mediation analysis

After  addressing  the  first  two  RQs,  a  mediation  analysis  was 

conducted using the following variables:

 -  WHO-5 (dependent variable);
 -  Subscale COPE index for care burden (predictor);
 -  Subscale COPE index for social support (mediator).

This analysis aimed to answer RQ3 (If caregivers’ burden negatively 
affects  their  psychological  well-being,  does  the  perception  of  social 
support mediate this relationship?) (Figure 3).

The analysis revealed a significant direct and indirect effect of the 
care  burden  on  psychological  well-being,  with  the  direct  effect 
accounting for the majority of the total effect (88%). Although social 
support plays a smaller and partial role in explaining the relationship 
between  care  burden  and  psychological  well-being  (12%),  it  is 
nonetheless  statistically  significant  (p = 0.001; Table  14).  Therefore, 
although social support does not neutralize the negative impact of 
caregiver  burden  on  psychological  well-being,  it  contributes  to 
buffering  (i.e.,  reducing)  its  negative  impact,  confirming  the 
importance of social support as a mitigating factor. The estimates patch 
confirms that: the greater the care burden experienced, the lower the 
perceived social support (a); the greater the social support experienced, 
the greater the psychological well-being (b); the greater the care burden 
experienced, the lower the psychological well-being experienced (c).

Even if we calculate the mediation analysis using the four items 
specifically designed to measure care burden as a predictor, the results 
would  be  similar  (Table  15).  In  this  case,  although  the  direct  effect

accounts for the majority of the total effect (83.5%), social support plays 
a slightly larger, though still partial, role in explaining the relationship 
between  care  burden  and  psychological  well-being  (16.5%).  As  the 
p-value (0.001) indicates, this role is statistically significant.

4 Discussion

Family  caregivers  play  a  crucial  role  in  caring  for  frail  older 
people. Research shows that caregiving can have both positive and 
negative effects on caregivers’ well-being. On the one hand, providing 
care may enhance the caregivers’ sense of purpose and satisfaction, 
particularly when the role is taken voluntary. Studies, such as those by 
Weinstein and Ryan (46), and by Hui et al. (47), suggest that pro-social 
behavior can improve well-being for both caregivers and recipients. 
Other  research  confirms  that  caring  for  older  relatives  can  foster 
feelings of fulfillment and satisfaction [e.g., (12–15, 17)]. However, 
when  the  demands  of  caregiving  and  the  related  burden  exceed 
individual  resources,  it  can  lead  to  negative  outcomes.  Thus, 
caregivers, particularly family caregivers of older adults, often face 
significant physical, emotional, and psychological strain. This is well-
documented in studies showing a decline in caregivers’ quality of life 
and psychological well-being [e.g., (2, 5–7, 9, 54)]. In this complex 
situation,  the  perception  of  social  support  –  whether  from  other 
family  members,  friends,  or  services  –  can  play  a  crucial  role  in 
reducing stress [e.g., (25)] and improving the psychological well-being 
of family caregivers of older adults [e.g., (23, 24)].

RQs  that  guided  this  study  aimed  to  understand  whether 
caregiving burden negatively impacts individual psychological well-
being and, conversely, whether social support has a positive influence, 
while also exploring these relationships more thoroughly.

5 Conclusion

5.1 Caregiving burden

imprisonment,  and  difficulties 

in  maintaining  social 
of 
relationships. These findings are consistent with previous research, 
such  as  that  by  Rokicka,  and  Zajkowska  (48),  who  found  that 
carers  of  older  adults,  especially  co-residents,  often  sacrifice 
personal activities and social interaction. An unbalanced trade-off 
between time devoted to caring for others and time devoted to 
oneself can be detrimental to health, life satisfaction and well-
being. Returning to our research, although our analysis did not 
reveal  any  significant  gender  differences,  women  generally 
reported higher levels of stress and more pronounced declines in 
their  physical  and  mental  health  compared  to  men.  Similarly, 
older caregivers also reported higher levels of perceived fatigue, 
although  advancing  age  per  se  did  not  emerge  as  a  reliable 
predictor of perceived fatigue.

5.2 Psychological well-being

In terms of psychological well-being, as measured by the WHO-5, 
our findings are consistent with those of Santini et al. (49) in a similar 
population  (i.e.,  100  family  caregivers  of  older  adult  people  with 
incontinence), but lower than the average score measured in an Italian 
sample from the general population by Carrozzino et al. (32), which 
reported  an  average  score  of  11.64 ± 4.95.  In  our  study,  55.9%  of 
caregivers also scored below the reference cut-off of 13, indicating 
poor psychological well-being. This highlights the pervasive issue of 
low  psychological  well-being  among  family  caregivers  in  similar 
caregiving  roles.  No  significant  gender  differences  were  found. 
However,  age  emerged  as  a  significant  predictor  of  well-being, 
suggesting that the advancing age of caregivers predicts a significant 
decline in their psychological well-being, as well as in their perceived 
health and quality of life.

5.3 Social support

Regarding  caregiver  burden,  a  significant  portion  of  our 
sample reported high levels of time deprivation, fatigue, feelings 

In line with the results of other research on family caregivers of 
older people [e.g., (25)], a significant proportion of our respondents 
reported feeling poorly supported by friends, neighbors, and social

and health services, irrespective of gender and age. Despite this, only 
a small percentage of caregivers reported that they could not find a 
replacement in case of illness or need for a break. Conversely, many 
respondents  mentioned  having  someone  available  to  take  over 
caregiving duties in their absence, allowing them some respite.

5.4 Caregiving burden and psychological 
well-being

Addressing  RQ1,  our  analysis  aligns  with  the  findings  of  a 
systematic  review  by  Del-Pino-Casado  et  al.  (50),  who  identified 
caregiver  burden  as  a  key  risk  factor  for  depressive  symptoms  in 
caregivers  of  older  adults.  Our  findings  revealed  a  significant 
correlation  between  increased  caregiving  burden  and  decreased 
psychological  well-being.  Focusing  solely  on  the  results  from  the 
analysis of the responses provided by our sample to the validated 
scales items (COPE Index subscale for care burden and WHO-5 for 
psychological  well-being),  a  significant  negative  correlation  was 
found between caregiving burden and psychological well-being [r 
(364) = −0.540,  p < 0.001],  with  caregiving  burden  emerging  as  a 
significant predictor of reduced psychological well-being (R2 = 0.290; 
F = 150, p < 0.001). Through ROC analysis, we determined a threshold 
value (which for the COPE Index subscale is equal to 2 on a 1–4 
scale)  at  which  caregiver  burden  begins  to  negatively  impact 
psychological  well-being.  As  previously  mentioned,  the  results 
confirmed  that  caregiver  burden  does  not  significantly  impact 
caregivers’ psychological well-being as long as it does not exceed a 
certain level. These findings have critical implications, suggesting that 
interventions to support caregivers facing significant burdens could 
prevent deterioration or worsening of their psychological well-being. 
This result also suggests that regular monitoring of caregiving burden 
and early intervention with psychosocial support could help prevent 
caregivers  from  reaching  a  critical  point  that  could  lead  to  more 
severe psychological outcomes. Moreover, in our sample, multivariate 
logistic  regression  allowed  us  to  identify  the  specific  factors  of 
caregiving  burden  that  seem  to  most  significantly 
impact 
psychological well-being. The analysis revealed that psychological 
well-being is higher when caregivers experience lower levels of stress, 
fatigue, and insecurity in their caregiving roles, and when caregiving 
tasks have a reduced impact on their relationships. These findings 
confirm the need to monitor caregiving burden in specific personal 
and relational domains of caregivers of frail older people with LTC 
needs. The aim should be to keep levels of stress, fatigue and personal 
insecurity  low,  to  limit  the  impact  of  caregiving  burden  on 
relationships,  and  to  intervene  promptly  when  these  levels 
are exceeded.

5.5 Social support and psychological 
well-being

As for RQ2, the relationship between perceived social support 
and psychological well-being was also found to be highly significant: 
greater perceived social support correlates with better psychological 
well-being. Focusing strictly on the results of the analysis of responses 
provided by our sample to the validated scale items (COPE Index 
subscale  for  social  support  and  WHO-5  for  psychological 

well-being),  a  positive  correlation  was  found  between  greater 
perceived  social  support  and  better  psychological  well-being  [r 
(357) = 0.348, p < 0.001], with social support emerging as a significant 
predictor of psychological well-being (R2 = 0.121; F = 49.2, p < 0.001).
These results are partially consistent, among others, with the findings 
of Leung et al. (51), who demonstrated that support from friends 
significantly reduces caregiver burden and improves mental health 
outcomes. Similarly, Muñoz-Bermejo et al. (58) highlighted that the 
perceived social support can contribute to improving mental well-
being,  especially  for  older  caregivers.  De  Maria  et  al.  (52)  also 
observed that perceived support from family and friends improved 
the  health-related  quality  of  life  of  both  older  adults  and  their 
informal caregivers. In our sample, multivariate logistic regression 
analysis emphasized that support from health and social services 
plays a critical role in determining caregivers’ psychological well-
being.  While  support  from  friends,  family  and  neighbors  is 
important, formal services emerged as the most significant factor. The 
greater  the  perception  of  support  from  services,  the  higher  the 
reported psychological well-being.

5.6 The mediating role of social support 
between care burden and psychological 
well-being

Finally, concerning RQ3, mediation analysis confirmed that social 
support plays a buffering role in mitigating the negative impact of 
caregiving  burden  on  psychological  well-being.  Even  though 
caregiving can be demanding, knowing that one can rely on social 
support – mainly from services – helps in reducing its adverse effects 
on caregivers’ psychological well-being.

Overall, these findings underline the importance of robust social 
support networks and, in particular, the urgency of investing in health 
and social services to alleviate the psychological burden of caregivers 
and improve their general well-being. In other words, increased public 
investment in health and social services could enhance the well-being 
of caregivers and, consequently, that of the older adults they care for.

5.7 Limitations and future research

While this study provides valuable insights, several limitations 

should be acknowledged.

First,  the  generalizability  of  the  findings  is  limited  due  to  the 
sample  of  caregivers,  which  is  not  representative  of  the  Italian 
population of family caregivers of frail older adults. Furthermore, data 
collection was conducted in a single session, preventing the calculation 
of test–retest reliability, which limits the robustness of the results. In 
addition, although the items of the scales used (WHO-5 and the two 
subscales of the COPE index) have been shown to adequately measure 
the  latent  factors  (psychological  well-being,  caregiver  burden  and 
social support), they do not always seem to fully fit our data. This may 
be due to several factors, including the limited number of items on 
each scale, as well as, the socio-demographic differences of our sample, 
the differing contexts in which the surveys were administered and 
completed  (either  at  home  or  in  a  union  office),  which  may  have 
influenced  the  atmosphere  and  comfort  levels  of  the  participants. 
Another limitation relates to the format of the questions (all closed), 

Frontiers in Public Health

Bongelli et al. 

10.3389/fpubh.2024.1474967

which  may  have  limited  the  carers’  ability  to  fully  express  their 
attitudes, perceptions, and viewpoints. Moreover, although guidelines 
recommend  administering  a  depression  screening  when  low 
psychological well-being is detected (as was the case for many in our 
sample), this step was not implemented, highlighting a significant gap 
between research knowledge and practical intervention.

Future  research  should  aim  to  overcome  these  limitations  by 
adopting more robust methodologies, but it should also aim to achieve 
new  goals.  A  longitudinal  approach,  for  instance,  could  involve 
measuring key variables before and after specific training or support 
interventions. Additionally, comparative studies could be useful, such 
as  comparing  informal  caregivers  of  older  adult  individuals  with 
formal caregivers or contrasting caregivers of older adult people with 
those caring for individuals with different needs (e.g., children with 
special  needs).  Cross-cultural  studies  would  also  be  insightful, 
allowing  for  comparisons  of  psychological  well-being  among 
caregivers  in  countries  with  different  healthcare  and  social 
support systems.

5.8 Implications for policy

A shift in the paradigm for managing interventions to support 
families dealing with the challenges of frailty and LTC seems urgent. 
This change should embrace a community-based approach to reduce 
the  isolation  in  which  carers  often  find  themselves,  as  caring 
responsibilities are often seen as an ‘essentially private affair’ within 
Italian  society.  This  change  would  alleviate  some  of  the  burden 
traditionally placed on family members.

The  findings  of  this  study  offer  valuable  practical  insights. 
Firstly,  it  highlights  the  importance  of  maintaining  ongoing 
communication  between  caregivers  and  service  providers. 
Listening  to  caregivers’  needs  and  regularly  monitoring  their 
psychological health are essential to promptly address potential 
risks. Neglecting such risks can adversely affect both caregivers and 
those they care for. Secondly, the study underscores the need to 
invest  in  developing  and  offering  training  programs  for  family 
caregivers. These programs should equip them with practical skills 
to effectively manage the needs of older assisted relatives and cope 
with the stress of their duties, thus reducing both the perceived 
burden and the likelihood of adverse psychological outcomes. This 
becomes  even  more  urgent  in  contexts  like  ours,  where  a  high 
percentage of caregivers are older adult themselves or approaching 
this  stage  of  life.  Improving  access  to  services  and  training 
programs,  including  overcoming  barriers  related  to  service 
locations,  is  critical  to  ensuring  that  caregivers  can  fully  utilize 
available resources.
