Lessons
Learned from
Mental Health
Enhancement
and Suicide
Prevention
Activities in the
Veterans Health
Administration

This publication of a special
issue of the American Journal of
Public Health, which focuses on
suicide in veterans and service
members, is occurring when
America has been at war for over
a decade. Over this time, suicide
in veterans and service members
has become a national concern.
This can be documented in
a number of ways. For one,
a search of the Medline database
for articles indexed under the
expanded subject heading “sui-
cide” and the text words “veteran”
or “veterans” identiﬁed one article
in the year 2000 and three in
2001, but 23 in 2009 and 33 in
2010. For another, a search of the
New York Times archives for
“veteran” and “suicide” followed
by review of the citations identi-
ﬁed three articles referring to
suicide among American veterans
in 2000 and one in 2001, but 11
in 2009 and 15 in 2010. Perhaps
most signiﬁcantly, the 2001 US
National Strategy for Suicide Pre-
vention1 did not address suicide in
military and veteran populations.
However, the National Action
Alliance for Suicide Prevention,
the public---private partnership
charged with revising the strategy,
was structured to ensure relevant
input. The partnership’s public
sector cochair is the Secretary of
the Army; it includes representa-
tives of the Department of De-
fense (DoD), the Department of
Veterans Affairs (VA), and rele-
vant support groups on its Exec-
utive Committee; and it has

formed a work group on military
and veterans issues.

There are a series of possible

reasons for the recognition of
suicide in military and veteran
populations as a national priority.
As Operation Enduring Freedom
and Operation Iraqi Freedom
(OEF/OIF), the wars in Afghani-
stan and Iraq, have gone on,
suicide rates have increased in
active duty service members, in-
cluding those who have recently
returned from deployment. The
American public has responded,
in part, to support the troops, and,
in part, to ensure that America
recognizes the full measure of the
costs of war. A number of stories
of individual suicides have been
widely reported; each one speaks
for itself, demonstrating the trag-
edy and suffering associated with
each death. Speciﬁcally for VA,
there have been a substantial
number of reports of problems
with mental health services and
calls for improvement. There have
also been reports recognizing the
innovative nature of the VA’s
programs for suicide prevention.
One summary of recent activities2
stated, “In the past few years the
Department of Veterans Affairs
has become one of the most vi-
brant forces in the US suicide
prevention movement, imple-
menting multiple levels of inno-
vative and state of the art inter-
ventions, backed up by a robust
evaluation and research capacity.”
Anticipating the formation of the
National Action Alliance for Sui-
cide Prevention and the revision

of the National Strategy for Sui-
cide Prevention, the same docu-
ment included the recommenda-
tion to: “Evaluate and assess
practices being implemented in
the VA for dissemination to
the broader healthcare delivery
system.1,2

The VA’s current suicide pre-
vention program began with the
approval of its Mental Health
Strategic Plan by the Under Sec-
retary for Health in 2004. The
plan was motivated by the rec-
ommendations of the 2003 re-
lease of the report of the Presi-
dent’s New Freedom Commission
on Mental Health,3 and by early
recognition of the mental health
problems facing veterans return-
ing from Afghanistan and Iraq. It
included 242 actions that could
be factored into 6 domains, in-
cluding increasing access and ca-
pacity, integrating mental health
with primary care, transforming
mental health specialty care into
recovery-oriented services, and
implementing evidence-based
practices, as well as prioritizing
services for returning veterans
and suicide prevention. To pro-
mote the implementation of the
strategy, VA established the Men-
tal Health Initiative as a way to
complement its usual mechanisms
for funding clinical services with
targeted funding for mental health
enhancements. This led to an
increase in core mental health
staff on a national level by 50%,
from about 14 000 in 2005 to
21 000 by the end of 2010;
approximately half of the increase

occurred between 2005 and the
end of 2008, and half since then.
Moreover, as a means for trans-
lating a time-limited strategic plan
into the sustained operation of
enhanced programs, the strategy
led to approval of the Handbook
on Uniform Mental Health Services
in VA Medical Centers and
Clinics,4 a policy document that
speciﬁes requirements for those
services that must be available to
all veterans with mental health
conditions, and those that must be
provided at each medical center
and at very large, large, mid-sized,
and small community-based out-
patient clinics.

Implementation of VA’s suicide
prevention program was based on
the principle that prevention re-
quires ready access to high quality
mental health services within the
health care system, supplemented
by two additional components;
ﬁrst, public education and aware-
ness promoting engagement for
those who need help, and second,
availability of speciﬁc services
addressing the needs of those at
high risk. Implementation began
approximately one year after the
Mental Health Initiative was
established, after enhancements in
access and capacity for the mental
health system were already mov-
ing ahead. Establishing the pro-
gram included creating a national
ofﬁce for suicide prevention,
partnering with the Substance
Abuse and Mental Health Services
Administration and its Lifeline to
add a centrally located veterans’
call center to the national 800---
273-TALK crisis line and funding
suicide prevention coordinators
with support staff in each VA
medical center and in the largest
of the outpatient clinics. The crisis
line has been the focus for public
information campaigns that pro-
moted use of the crisis line for
veterans. Thus, it serves as a

tangible symbol for the availabil-
ity of VA as a source for care as
well as a component of VA ser-
vices. Responders in the VA crisis
center can access medical records
of those seeking help, and they
can refer them to the suicide pre-
vention coordinator at the closest
VA medical center. The suicide
prevention coordinators at each
facility receive referrals from the
crisis line, facilitate coordination
and care of suicidal patients
within the facility, and conduct
outreach to providers and stake-
holders in the community. Thus,
VA’s program includes two types
of hub and spoke networks to
help veterans engage in care. The
national system includes the crisis
center as a hub and the suicide
prevention coordinators as
spokes. The local systems in-
clude the suicide prevention co-
ordinators as hubs and both VA
and community providers as
spokes.

Other actions included policy
requirements for screening all VA
patients for mental health condi-
tions at least annually, with fol-
low-up evaluations of the risk for
suicide in those who screen posi-
tive; for identifying veterans at
high risk for suicide and for en-
suring that they receive enhanced
care; and for using safety plan-
ning5 as an intervention for those
at high risk. Additional compo-
nents of the system included two
centers for research, education,
and clinical innovation, and ex-
tensive evaluation activities within
the ofﬁce of suicide prevention
and in the mental health program.
Parts of the system that are still
evolving include collaborations
with the DoD; extensions of the
crisis line to include Internet chat
and texting services, a self-assess-
ment component on the Internet,
and systems for surveillance for
suicide attempts.

It is important to evaluate the
impact on veterans of all that has
happened since the start of OEF/
OIF. At this time, there are no de-
ﬁnitive national listings of veterans
across eras of service, and it is not
possible to determine the annual
count or rate for deaths from
suicide among the entire veteran
population. However, data are
available for veterans who have
utilized clinical services in the
Veterans Health Administration
(VHA), the VA’s health care sys-
tem (see McCarthy et al.6 for
methods). For veterans utilizing
VHA services, rates and stan-
dardized mortality ratios (rates
relative to age- and gender-
matched people from the US
population) decreased from ﬁscal
year 2001, before the start of the
war in Afghanistan, to 2008, the
most recent year for which data
were available as of the end of
ﬁscal year 2011 (Figures 1 and 2).
During this time, the number of
veterans served per year in-
creased from approximately 4.0
million to 5.3 million, and the
number of suicides increased
from 1609 to 1909. The suicide
rate decreased by 9%, and the
standard mortality ratio by 14%.
The decrease appeared to begin

in 2002 or 2003, before the VA
Mental Health Strategic Plan, the
Mental Health Initiative, and the
implementation of VA’s current
program for suicide prevention.
Rates and standard mortality ra-
tios remained more or less con-
stant since 2003, during a period
of intense improvements in men-
tal health and suicide prevention
activities.

What events in 2002 or 2003
could explain the decrease in sui-
cide rates in VHA? It is possible to
develop two hypotheses, one
related to speciﬁc legislation and
the other to a “yellow ribbon”
effect related to increases in com-
munity support. The Veterans
Millennium Health Care Act
(Public Law 106---117), enacted in
1999 and implemented over
subsequent years, provided for
increases in VHA services, in-
cluding mental health services
and other beneﬁts. However, the
increases were modest relative to
subsequent enhancements. More-
over, the need for the Mental
Health Strategic Plan and subse-
quent enhancements were appar-
ent to VA leadership through
evaluations of the system after the
act was implemented. Therefore,
the yellow ribbon hypothesis

decrease in suicide rates. First, it
may be important to reframe the
discussion of the war-related in-
creases in national concerns
about the health and well-being of
service members and veterans as
previously summarized. In a
sense, the increase in national
concerns about service members
and veterans may have consti-
tuted an intervention. In this
context, supporting our troops
and our veterans is not only
a matter of patriotism; it is a mat-
ter of public health. Second, the
magnitude of the yellow ribbon
effects observed in veterans ap-
pears to be at least as great as the
effects of large-scale and broad-
based interventions in an inte-
grated health care system.
Therefore, observation from the
VA during a unique era in our
nation’s history may provide
support for the importance of
public health models for suicide
prevention. Key questions that
remain are about how the yellow
ribbon hypothesis can be tested,
and, if validated, how the ﬁndings
can be translated into generaliz-
able public health interventions. j

appears to be more likely.
According to this hypothesis, the
decrease in suicide rates that be-
gan in 2002 or 2003 could be
attributed to the start of the war,
the way that it changed the pub-
lic’s view of military service and of
veterans, and, probably, the way
it led to changes in veterans’
perceptions of the way America
valued their history of service.
Conceptually, this hypothesis is
supported by models in which
strengthening the sense of belong-
ing to a valued community or group
can protect against suicide.7 Empir-
ically, it is supported by observa-
tions that perceived social support
(including community support) is
associated with decreased suicidal
ideation in National Guard Mem-
bers returning from OEF/OIF.8

The yellow ribbon hypothesis
suggests a number of secondary
questions: do the increased rates
of suicide in active duty personnel
reﬂect the sum of opposing effects,
a direct effect that is increasing
rates, and an indirect effect medi-
ated through increased support
that is decreasing rates? Have
the hypothesized yellow ribbon

effects been persistent, or were they
responsible for the initiation of
a decline in suicide that has been
sustained through other factors,
such as clinical programs? What
will happen at the end of the wars
in Afghanistan and Iraq if there are
decreases in public support for
service members and veterans?

Regardless of the reasons for
the decline in suicide rates, the
substantial changes that occurred
before the implementation of
VA’s mental health enhance-
ments and its suicide prevention
program complicate VA’s evalu-
ations of these programs. VA is
continuing to follow rates as data
from additional years become
available. It is also pursuing other
strategies, including evaluations
of speciﬁc subpopulations and
studies of the associations be-
tween regional variability in pro-
gram implementation and out-
comes. At the same time, it
continues to enhance its suicide
prevention activities.

Assuming for moment that the
yellow ribbon hypothesis is valid,
there may be important lessons
to be drawn from the observed
