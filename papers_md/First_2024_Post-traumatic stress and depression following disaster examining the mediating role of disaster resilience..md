Post-traumatic stress and 
depression following disaster: 
examining the mediating role of 
disaster resilience

The  current  study  used  structural  equation  modeling  to  examine  the  role  of 
disaster resilience as a mediator between disaster exposure and post-traumatic 
stress  and  depressive  symptoms  among  a  sample  of  625  U.S.  adults  who 
experienced  a  disaster  event.  Results  found  that  disaster  resilience  mediated 
the relationship between disaster exposure as a predictor and depression and 
post-traumatic  stress  as  dependent  variables.  These  findings  have  important 
implications  for  understanding  the  mechanisms  by  which  disaster  resilience 
supports  post-disaster  mental  health  and  can  inform  future  disaster  mental 
health interventions and practice models.

Introduction

Environmental threats such as natural and human-caused disaster events (e.g., tornados, 
hurricanes, floods, oil spills) are increasing in prevalence and severity in the United States and 
worldwide. Between 2000 and 2019, approximately 510,837 individuals have died and 3.9 
billion people have been affected by disasters (1). Disasters and other environmental threats 
pose profound risks to human well-being and cause widespread mortalities, morbidities, 
property loss, and reduced access to food, water, and housing (1). Furthermore, they can 
contribute to adverse psychological risks and behavioral health disorders, including substance 
use, depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (2, 3). After a disaster, it is common 
for people to experience a range of emotional and mental health difficulties, including stress, 
anxiety, fear, and grief. These effects can be short-term, such as increased stress and anxiety in 
the immediate aftermath of the disaster, or more long-term, such as the development of post-
traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression (3).

Various factors have been found to place individuals more at risk for developing depression 
and PTSD following disasters. Prior research [e.g., (4–6)] indicates the extent of psychological 
harm is associated with factors such as the severity of the disaster (e.g., EF-5 tornado), the 
degree of exposure (e.g., personal injuries, loss of home), and the magnitude of community 
destruction (e.g., the prevalence of homes, schools, and hospitals destroyed). For example, in 
a meta-analytic review, Brewin et al. (7) found an association between the severity of the 
disaster trauma (higher degree of disaster exposure) and the subsequent severity of depression 
symptoms.  In  addition,  prior  studies  have  indicated  that  a  dose–response  effect  occurs, 
wherein PTSD and depression symptoms have been found to increase with greater disaster 
exposure levels (5, 8, 9).

While disaster exposure has been found to have a direct effect on 
post-disaster depression and PTSD, it could, however, also indirectly 
affect depression and PTSD through a third mediating variable, such as 
resilience. Although different definitions of resilience exist in the literature 
[for  a  review,  see  (10)],  most  of  them  generally  share  the  idea  that 
resilience is the ability of an individual to positively adapt in the face of 
stress, risk, and adversity (10–13). This definition indicates that resilience 
is a process and that protective factors (e.g., optimism, distress regulation, 
environmental resources) foster specific processes in the individual that 
assist in preventing adverse outcomes and promote positive adaption and 
growth following exposure to stressful or traumatic events (4, 14).

Within  a  disaster  context,  (15)  described  a  risk  and  resilience 
framework, wherein resources or protective factors counterbalance 
the  threats  of  disaster  exposure.  In  terms  of  conceptualizing  the 
process of resilience in a research model, resilience has the potential 
to operate as a mediator (16, 17) between risk factors (e.g., disaster 
exposure)  and  adverse  outcomes  [e.g.,  depression,  PTSD;  (18)]. 
Known as the “protective factor model,” resilience has been found to 
influence the effect of a risk factor by mediating the adverse impact of 
risk for predicting negative outcomes (19, 20). For example, in prior 
research,  resilience  has  been  found  to  mediate  the  relationship 
between interpersonal risk factors and hopelessness, and contribute 
to lower levels of hopelessness in a sample of individuals with clinical 
depression (19). Resilience has also been found to mediate COVID-19 
pandemic-related  stress  and  contribute  to  lower  depression  and 
anxiety (21), and higher academic success among college students (22).
Despite the role of resilience as a potential mediator between risk 
factors and mental health outcomes, few studies have examined the 
possible  mediating  relationship  of  resilience  to  mitigate  against 
adverse mental health outcomes following exposure to disaster events 
(23). While there is a large amount of evidence that indicates disaster 
exposure and resource loss can have a detrimental impact on mental 
health  after  disasters  (24,  25),  however,  less  is  known  about  the 
processes and mechanisms by which resilience mitigates risk factors 
and  reduces  the  probability  of  a  negative  mental  health  outcome. 
Uncovering the potential mechanisms by which disaster resilience 
may be directly and indirectly related to mental health outcomes is 
important for disaster preparedness and response, as it can provide 
insights into protective factors that are particularly important in the 
event of a disaster. Therefore, to address this gap, the objective of the 
current  study  was  to  examine  whether  disaster  resilience  had  a 
protective  mediating  effect  on  the  relationship  between  disaster 
exposure  and  post-disaster  depression  and  PTSD  among 
625 U.S. adults exposed to disaster (e.g., hurricane, tornado, wildfire, 
oil spill).

In  the  current  study,  disaster  resilience  was  conceptualized  as 
various  internal  and  external  factors  that  interact  to  influence  an 
individual’s ability to adapt and recover following exposure to disaster 
(26).  These  results  could  provide  a  further  understanding  of  the 
dynamic  process  of  resilience  by  understanding  its  interactive 
mechanisms between exposure to disaster and post-disaster mental 
health. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was utilized to test this 
model, and a cross-sectional study was conducted among a sample of 
adults exposed to a disaster event (N = 625). Based on the evidence 
reviewed above, the following hypotheses guide this study:

H1. Disaster exposure will be positively associated with PTSD 
and depression.

H2.  Disaster  exposure  will  be  positively  associated  with 
disaster resilience.

H3.  Disaster  resilience  will  (a)  have  an  inverse  or  negative 
relationship with PTSD and depression and (b) will mediate the 
relationship between disaster exposure and PTSD and depression.

Methods

Data collection procedures

Data  collection  procedures  were  approved  by  the  [Identity 
Removed for Review] Institutional Review Board (IRB). Participants 
qualified for this study if they were 18 or older and had experienced a 
disaster  within  the  previous  3 years  (2016–2019).  To  ensure  the 
statistical analyses possessed sufficient statistical power with the SEM 
model,  a  power  analysis  was  conducted  to  help  determine  the 
adequacy of the sample size required. The criterion was set that the 
estimated power needed to be 80% or higher, with a significance level 
(α) set at 0.05, for all the parameters of interest within the SEM (e.g., 
factor loadings, correlations, and regression paths), with a projected 
sample  size  of  at  least  500  participants  was  found  as  adequately 
powered (27).

Participants were recruited through purposive online sampling 
using  Qualtrics’  panel  aggregator  sampling  service.  The  Qualtrics 
panel aggregator provides researchers access to market research panels 
and  uses  digital  technology  (e.g.,  IP  address  checks,  digital 
fingerprinting) to ensure participants’ data are as valid and reliable as 
possible (28). In addition, Qualtrics can monitor the data collection 
procedure and controls for issues such as participant inattentiveness 
or  ineligibility,  high  incompletion  rates,  duplicate  responses,  or 
unreasonably quick completion times (29). Qualtrics was chosen as 
the online data collection platform following research indicating that 
samples  recruited  via  online  panel  aggregators  represent  the 
U.S.  population  demography  slightly  better  and  are  usually  less 
expensive  than  convenience  samples  (30).  Qualtrics  invited 
participants  to  the  study  by  clicking  on  a  link  to  a  screening 
questionnaire to assess eligibility if they lived in a U.S. state or territory 
that has experienced a natural or human-caused disaster in the prior 
3 years (2016–2019). Accordingly, the states targeted for recruitment 
included  California,  Tennessee,  North  Carolina,  South  Carolina, 
Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Florida, and Texas. Using the online 
interface  of  Qualtrics,  participants  were  provided  with  study 
instructions  and  self-reported  questionnaire  items.  In  addition, 
participants were compensated for their time with incentives through 
the  Qualtrics 
incentive  program  (e.g.,  prize  drawings  and 
accumulated rewards).

Measures

Disaster exposure

Disaster exposure (M = 9.72, SD = 1.72, α = 0.66) was measured by 
participants rating their perceptions of exposure to five main disaster-
related stressors: did they lose personal belongs, was their home or 
property damaged, did they experience bodily injury, did their life or

loved one’s life feel threatened, and did they experience feelings of 
helplessness, fear, or horror [see (31, 32)]. Participants rated their 
responses on a 4-point Likert scale with response options ranging 
from 1 = not at all to 4 = a great deal. All items were summed to create 
an observed variable.

Disaster resilience

Disaster resilience (M = 166.51, SD = 28.53, α = 0.96) was measured 
via  the  Disaster  Adaptation  and  Resilience  Scale  [DARS;  (26)],  a 
43-item scale consisting of five domains found to support disaster 
resilience,  including:  material  resources,  social  resources,  distress 
regulation, problem-solving, and optimism. Each item is rated on a 
5- point Likert scale ranging from 0 (not at all true) to 4 (true nearly 
all of the time), with higher scores reflecting higher levels of resilience. 
Participants were prompted to think about the most recent disaster 
event and answer to report if they possess a specific protective factor 
(e.g., distress regulation, access to basic resources) on a 5-point Likert 
scale ranging from 0 = not at all true and 5 = true nearly all the time to 
create a latent variable.

Post-traumatic stress

Post-traumatic  stress  disorder  (PTSD)  symptoms  (M = 34.76, 
SD = 23.22, α = 0.97) were measured via the Impact of Event Scale-
Revised [IES-R; (33)]. The scale consists of three factors of symptoms 
related to posttraumatic stress: avoidance (eight items), hyperarousal 
(six items), and intrusion (eight items). Sample items include: “Any 
reminder brought back feelings about it,” “I felt irritable and angry,” 
and “My feelings about it were kind of numb.” In the current study, 
participants will be instructed to report how distressing or bothersome 
each symptom had been within the past 7 days with respect to the 
most recent disaster event. Responses for the IES-R are provided on a 
5-point  Likert-like  scale  which  ranged  from  1 = not  at  all  to 
5 = extremely to create a latent variable.

Depression

Depression (M = 3.93, SD = 1.97, α = 0.89) was measured via the 
Patient Health Questionnaire [PHQ-2; (34)]. The PHQ measures the 
degree to which an individual has experienced depressed mood over 
the past 2 weeks in order to screen participants for disaster-related 
depression. Responses were provided on a 4-point Likert-like scale 
which ranged from 0 = not at all to 3 = nearly every day to create a 
latent variable.

Analyses

The demographic characteristics of respondents were analyzed 
using univariate methods including means, standard deviations, and 
frequencies. To examine the relationships between disaster exposure, 
disaster resilience, and mental health outcomes, structural equation 
modeling (SEM) was used. Using a two-step procedure recommended 
by Kline (35), first tested a measurement model (confirmatory factor 
analysis, CFA) to examine and confirm the factor structure of the 
latent  variables  and  indicators  (e.g.,  disaster  resilience,  PTSD, 
depression). Next, the structural model analyzed the direct effects of 
disaster  exposure  and  mental  health  outcomes  and  whether  the 
impact of disaster exposure on PTSD and depression, can be filtered 
or mediated by the individual’s level of disaster resilience.

For  both  the  measurement  and  structural  SEM  models,  a 
maximum  likelihood  estimation  with  robust  standard  errors  was 
performed  using  R  software  and  the  lavaan  package  ((37,  38)  R 
Development  Core  Team,  2011;  Rosseel,  2012).  Guidelines  for 
goodness of fit indices were used to evaluate model fit based on the 
recommendations of Little (36) included the root mean square error 
of approximation (RMSEA) <0.08, standardized root mean square 
residual (SRMR) <0.08, and comparative fit index (CFI) > 0.90 and the 
Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI) > 0.90. Residuals were also inspected for 
outliers, which can indicate a model misfit that is not due to chance. 
In  addition,  modification  indices  were  inspected  for  high  values 
indicating the possible need to remove an item or change the path of 
an indicator (35). To test the mediation or indirect effects, the 95% 
confidence interval of 1,000 bootstrapped resamples of the product of 
coefficients were generated to ensure the confidence intervals do not 
include  zero,  and  therefore  the  effect  is  considered  statistically 
significant  (37).  In  the  case  of  missing  data  at  random,  a  full 
information  maximum  likelihood  estimation  will  be  used,  which 
assumes missing data points have an expectation equal to a model-
derived value estimated from the remaining data points (38).

Results

The final sample included 625 participants who experienced a 
disaster between 2016 and 2019. Missing data in the current study did 
not exceed 10% for any variable. Three hundred thirty participants 
were  female  (53%),  and  293  were  male  (47%).  The  majority  of 
participants identified as White (62.5%), followed by Black/African 
American/Afro Caribbean (n = 105, 16.8%), Hispanic/Latino (n = 55, 
8.8%),  Multi-racial  (n = 29,  4.6%)  Asian  American  (n = 26,  4.2%), 
Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander (n = 9, 1.4%), and American 
Indian/Alaskan Native (n = 4, 0.6%). Nearly half of all participants had 
a bachelor’s degree or higher (n = 146, 49.7%). The average household 
size was 2.69. The most frequent disasters experienced by participants 
included  hurricanes  (n = 423,  68%),  followed  by  tornados  (n = 59, 
9.5%), floods (n = 56, 9%), and wildfires (n = 54, 8.7%). See Table 1 for 
the complete descriptive statistics of the participants.

For the SEM analyses, a measurement model of the latent variables 
(e.g., disaster resilience, depression, PTSD) was first estimated and the 
initial measure model did not achieve an acceptable model fit as both 
the CFI and TLI were less than 0.90. To remedy this issue, parceling 
items, or combining indicators, can be a valuable method to improve 
model fit when latent variables have a high number of indicators and 
can provide information about the relationships among the latent 
variables (36). After parceling the 22 indicators for the PTSD latent 
variable  into  three  equal-sized  domain  parcels,  the  measurement 
model  achieved  acceptable  fit:  χ2  (2108) = 4588.933,  p < 0.01, 
CFI = 0.91,  TLI = 0.90,  RMSEA = 0.04,  SRMR = 0.05.  Next,  the 
structural model was estimated and achieved acceptable fit, model fit 
statistics included χ2 (1117) = 2484.079, p < 0.01, CFI = 0.91, TLI = 0.90, 
RMSEA = 0.05, SRMR = 0.06, and allowed for the testing of hypotheses 
(Table 2 and Figure 1).

In Figure 1, the SEM results revealed significant relationships 
among all the study variables. The first hypothesis (H1) predicted 
that disaster exposure would have a significant positive relationship 
with PTSD and depression symptoms. Results show that H1 was 
supported, and found that disaster exposure had a significant and

positive  relationship  between  PTSD  (β = 0.744,  p < 0.001)  and 
depression (β = 0.773, p < 0.001). Individuals who had encountered 
more  disaster-related  losses  and  stressors  (e.g.,  injuries,  loss  of  a 
loved one, property damage) had a higher risk of disaster-related 
PTSD and depression. Next, the second hypothesis (H2) predicted 
that  disaster  exposure  would  have  a  significant  and  positive 
relationship  with  disaster  resilience.  Results  found  that  H2  was 
supported and disaster exposure was significantly associated with 
having more disaster resilience (β = 0.109, p < 0.05). The increase in 

disaster exposure was found to predict an increase in the level of 
disaster resilience.

Finally,  the  third  hypothesis  (H3a)  predicted  that  disaster 
resilience would be inversely associated with PTSD and depression 
symptoms.  Results  found  that  H3a  was  also  supported  as  disaster 
resilience  had  a  significant  and  negative  association  with  PTSD 
(β = −0.116,  p < 0.001)  and  depression  (β = −0.246,  p < 0.001). 
Furthermore,  the  third  hypothesis  (H3b),  predicted  that  disaster 
resilience would mediate the relationship between disaster exposure

Discussion

Disaster events place stress on human life, livelihood, and health, 
and can have significant impacts on the mental health and well-being 
of individuals exposed. To test whether the impact of disaster exposure 
on PTSD and depression can be mediated by disaster resilience, this 
study examined direct and indirect relationships between disaster 
stress, disaster resilience, and mental health using structural equation 
modeling among 625 U.S. adults. Results from the current study point 
to several findings. First, SEM analysis found that individuals with 
more disaster exposure were associated with higher levels of PTSD 
and depressive symptoms. These findings are consistent with prior 
studies  (2,  8,  41)  indicating  that  individuals  exposed  to  more 

disaster-related  losses  (i.e.,  property  damage,  injuries)  were  more 
likely  to  demonstrate  symptoms  of  PTSD  and  depression,  and 
illustrate that disaster exposure can have significant effects on the 
mental health of individuals.

Second, this study found that more exposure to disaster losses 
was associated with more resilience. This finding highlights that 
individuals  experiencing  greater  amounts  of  disaster-related 
adversity required greater levels of resilience to help mitigate the 
negative  effects  of  disaster  exposure.  Resilience  or  protective 
factors have been theorized to be able to help mitigate the effects 
of stressful and traumatic experiences after a collective trauma, 
and this study’s results confirm prior studies (15, 42) that have 
found  a  positive  association  between  exposure  to  adversity 
contributing to greater resilience. However, researchers note that 
at certain doses, individuals may no longer be capable of adapting 
when exposure levels are cumulative and ongoing (8, 43, 44). For 
example, previous studies have found that cumulative exposure to 
multiple  collective  traumas  may  predispose  people  to  negative 
mental  health  outcomes  (43–45,  47).  Future  research  should 
continue to examine the relationship between disaster exposure

and resilience responses to time-limited stressor events and in the 
face of chronic, ongoing collective traumas (46).

In addition to acknowledging potential risks and adverse impacts 
from  disasters,  is  an  increased  recognition  and  importance  of 
understanding  the  mechanisms  of  disaster  resilience  (47).  Results 
from  this  study  found  that  disaster  resilience  demonstrated  a 
significant  mediating  relationship  between  disaster  exposure  and 
PTSD  and  depression  among  participants.  This  finding  provides 
further empirical support for conceptualizations of disaster resilience’s 
ameliorating role in contributing to better mental health outcomes 
following  disaster  exposure  (49–51),  and  further  theoretical 
understanding of the phenomena of resilience and how it operates in 
the specific context of disasters (Schneiderman et al., 2005). In other 
words,  disaster  resilience  was  found  to  play  an  important  role  in 
changing the strength or direction of the relationship between disaster 
exposure and post-disaster mental health, such that individuals with 
access  to  more  disaster  resilience  (e.g.,  material,  social,  and 
psychological resources) contributed to fewer negative mental health 
effects.  Understanding  the  underlying  mechanisms  that  help  to 
explain the relationships between risk factors and adverse outcomes 
provides  important  insights  into  potential  inventions  to  target  to 
improve disaster mental health response and preparedness. Findings 
from  this  study  will  be  able  to  assist  disaster  researchers  and 
practitioners in identifying protective factors (e.g., physical, social, 
and  psychological  resources)  for  intervention  development  that 
promote  resilience  and  healthy  psychological  development  in 
communities experiencing disaster.

Finally,  these  findings  also  have  the  potential  to  contribute  to 
future  research  on  identifying  factors  supporting  the  resilience  of 
medical  and  healthcare  professionals  working  in  disaster  and 
emergency response settings. Prior studies have found that working 
in disaster settings exposes healthcare workers to considerable stress, 
trauma, and emotional strain and can lead to conditions such as post-
traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, suicidality, and anxiety 
(52, 53), and this study illustrates the important mechanism or process 
of  disaster  resilience  in  reducing  mental  health  symptoms.  These 
findings could be used to inform future research on specific protective 
factors that could play a beneficial role in reducing negative mental 
health outcomes among high-risk medical workers in disaster settings 
(55). By systematically examining and refining these protective factors, 
future research can contribute to developing targeted interventions, 
training  programs,  and  support  systems  tailored  to  the  disaster 
resilience of the healthcare workforce.

Limitations

In  regard  to  study  limitations,  this  project  was  limited  by 
non-probability  sampling,  by  self-report  measures,  cross-
sectional  design,  and  the  sample’s  disaster  experiences  (e.g., 
majority natural hazards, hurricanes). First, this study utilized 
non-probability  sampling,  and  therefore,  the  results  may  not 
be generalizable to all individuals experiencing a disaster event. 
Future  studies  could  improve  on  this  limitation  by  utilizing  a 
probability  sampling  design.  Second,  this  study  utilized  self-
report  measures  that  may  not  be  accurate  as  a  full  clinical 
evaluation  of  PTSD  or  depression  symptomology.  A  third 
limitation  is  that  this  study  is  cross-sectional  in  design,  and 

therefore,  the  collected  data  cannot  make  causal  claims  of 
temporal  order  (56).  The  current  study’s  cross-sectional 
limitation could be improved upon by future studies employing 
a  longitudinal  design  that  collects  data  at  several  points  and 
could, for example, assess resilience at 1 month, 6 months, and 
1 year  to  increase  further  knowledge  about  disaster  resilience. 
Despite  these  limitations,  this  study  found  the  presence  of 
important  associations  that  were  consistent  with  theoretical 
predictions (e.g., disaster exposure and resilience had direct and 
indirect associations with PTS and depression symptoms).

Conclusion

The current study used structural equation modeling (SEM) to 
identify  the  relationships  between  disaster  exposure  and  disaster 
resilience on mental health outcomes in a sample of 625 U.S. adult 
participants. Results found that disaster exposure was significantly 
related to higher levels of PTS and depression symptoms. Disaster 
resilience was inversely related to PTSD and depression symptoms 
and played an important role in mediating the relationship between 
disaster exposure and mental health outcomes. Findings from this 
study can assist disaster researchers and practitioners in identifying 
protective  factors  to  support  disaster  resilience  interventions  and 
practice models.
