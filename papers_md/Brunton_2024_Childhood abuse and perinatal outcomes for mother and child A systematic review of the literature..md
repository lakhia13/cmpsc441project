Abstract

Childhood abuse can have long-term adverse outcomes in adulthood. These outcomes
may pose a particular threat to the health and well-being of perinatal women; however, to
date, this body of knowledge has not been systematically collated and synthesized. This
systematic review examined the child abuse literature and a broad range of perinatal out-
comes using a comprehensive search strategy. The aim of this review was to provide a
clearer understanding of the distinct effect of different abuse types and areas where there
may be gaps in our knowledge. Following PRISMA guidelines, EBSCO, PsychInfo, Scopus,
Medline, CINAHL, PubMed, and Google Scholar databases and gray literature including
preprints, dissertations and theses were searched for literature where childhood abuse was
associated with any adverse perinatal outcome between 1969 and 2022. Exclusion criteria
included adolescent samples, abuse examined as a composite variable, editorials, letters to
the editor, qualitative studies, reviews, meta-analyses, or book chapters. Using an assess-
ment tool, two reviewers extracted and assessed the methodological quality and risk of bias
of each study. From an initial 12,384 articles, 95 studies were selected, and the outcomes
were categorized as pregnancy, childbirth, postnatal for the mother, and perinatal for mother
and child. The prevalence of childhood abuse ranged from 5–25% with wide variability
(physical 2–78%, sexual 2–47%, and emotional/psychological 2–69%). Despite some con-
sistent findings relating to psychological outcomes (i.e., depression and PTSD), most evi-
dence was inconclusive, effect sizes were small, or the findings based on a limited number
of studies. Inconsistencies in findings stem from small sample sizes and differing methodol-
ogies, and their diversity meant studies were not suitable for a meta-analysis. Research
implication include the need for more rigorous methodology and research in countries
where the prevalence of abuse may be high. Policy implications include the need for
trauma-informed care with the Multi-level Determinants of Perinatal Wellbeing for Child
Abuse Survivors model a useful framework. This review highlights the possible impacts of
childhood abuse on perinatal women and their offspring and areas of further investigation.

A systematic review of child abuse and perinatal outcomes

Introduction

Worldwide, millions of children suffer physical (CPA), sexual (CSA), psychological (CPY), or
emotional abuse (CEA) that potentially have long-term deleterious outcomes [1]. While it is
well established that the sequela of childhood abuse can be poor [1, provides a review], an
important consideration is the impact of abuse on perinatal women. Certain adverse outcomes
consistently linked to abuse could be exacerbated by pregnancy or impact the mother’s well-
being and behaviors. For example, if the risk of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and
substance use is high for abuse survivors in the general population, it is important to know if
this risk extends to pregnancy and postpartum. Moreover, particular experiences of pregnancy
and postpartum can be exacerbated by child abuse, such as childbirth and breastfeeding [2,3],
potentially impacting mother, child, and prenatal care.

Another consideration is that the body of knowledge regarding child abuse and perinatal
outcomes needs to be collated to ensure that findings extrapolated globally are generalizable.
Child abuse can exacerbate anxieties experienced during pregnancy [4], but these anxieties
have wide cross-cultural variability [5]. Moreover, conceptions of child abuse can vary cross-
culturally, with what constitutes physical abuse in one country deemed acceptable parenting
behavior in another country [6]. Therefore, without a clear understanding of the body of
knowledge, assumptions cannot be made that all findings apply to all pregnant women.

Few systematic reviews have synthesized research for all types of child abuse and a broad
range of perinatal outcomes. To our knowledge, only one similar review examined CSA and
pregnancy outcomes [7]. Other reviews have focused on child maltreatment more broadly [8]
or specific outcomes such as mood disorders [9]. However, the distinct characteristics of dif-
ferent abuse types in the context of the unique developmental life stage of pregnancy, warrant
separate examination. For example, the experience of CSA differs from other abuses; therefore,
an individual with this history may avoid prenatal care for fear of intimate procedures, which
may not be triggering for someone with a CPA history. Therefore, understanding the differen-
tial impact of child abuse on perinatal women is important in understanding their needs.
This review builds on previous reviews by expanded search criteria (i.e., all child abuse
types and perinatal outcomes [i.e., conception to 12 months postpartum]) databases and gray
literature. The aim is to provide a focused review of child abuse outcomes for perinatal women
by collating and synthesizing the data to provide a comprehensive overview of the current
knowledge. This targeted review will provide a clearer understanding of the distinct effect of
different abuse types and areas where there may be gaps in our knowledge. Specifically, the fol-
lowing research questions were examined: Do pregnant and postpartum women with a history
of child abuse have more adverse pregnancy, childbirth, and postpartum outcomes than other
women? Do the offspring of pregnant women with a history of child abuse have more adverse
outcomes than other children?

Methods

The systematic review and protocol were registered with PROSPERO in 2021. PRISMA and
other reporting guidelines guided the review [10,11]. The PICOT search framework mnemonic
focused the question: Population = women who experience pregnancy and childbirth;
Indicator = child abuse (includes any study that examines child abuse, noting that different
studies may use different age limits to define abuse); Comparison = non-abused women; Out-
comes = (1) pregnancy, (2) childbirth (3) child development including neonatal and infant, and
(4) postpartum maternal outcomes; Time = perinatal (conception to 12 months postpartum).

Reviewer one [RB] and reviewer two ([DC], a research assistant) extracted the data. Studies

were selected if they were original quantitative cross-sectional or longitudinal research

examining perinatal outcomes for women with a child abuse history. Child abuse could be a
predictor or correlate of any adverse perinatal outcome in English-language peer-reviewed
articles, dissertations, conference proceedings, or preprints between 1969 and 2022. Two
searches were conducted, one in May 2021 and another in January 2023 to update the original
2021 search. However, the additional studies identified in 2023 were not subjected to two
reviewers due to budget constraints.

Adolescent samples were excluded as they have unique psychosocial and biological chal-

lenges [12] however papers that included some adolescents in their sample [e.g., Ranchod
et al., 2016] were included. Other exclusion criteria included abuse examined as part of a com-
posite variable, editorials, letters to the editor, qualitative studies, reviews, meta-analyses, or
book chapters. Databases searched included EBSCO (Academic Search Complete, Psychology
and Behavioural Sciences and SocIndex), PsychInfo, Scopus (Elsevier), Medline, CINAHL,
PubMed, and Google Scholar. In addition, gray literature searches included preprints (i.e., Pre-
PubMed and OSFPreprints) and theses and dissertations (i.e., the ProQuest Dissertations and
Theses Global database and EBSCO Open dissertations).

Reviewer one searched databases using the following search strategy to identify relevant
articles: Child* AND (abuse OR maltreatment OR neglect) AND (Pregnan* OR antenatal OR
Childbirth OR labour OR labor OR Neonat* OR Postpartum OR postnatal OR Perinatal). In
addition, “history of violence against children” was also searched alongside the perinatal search
terms, as it is used by many researchers globally [e.g., 13]. Consistent with ‘back-in-time’ pearl-
ing, reviewer one searched the reference list of each identified article using the ‘find’ function
in the pdf viewer and the words child* and pregnan*. This search was conducted on articles
after full-text screening. Data from the search results were downloaded into Endnote, which
identified exact duplicates. All extracted records were imported into an Excel spreadsheet
where reviewers independently used the inclusion/exclusion criteria to screen the records by
title, abstract, and full text.

Quality assessment

Once inter-rater agreement was achieved, the sample was quality assessed. An assessment tool
developed from previous studies [(provided as S1 Appendix, 11,14] evaluated the methodolog-
ical quality and risk of bias. Each study was rated on 1) selection procedures, 2) data collection
methods, 3) study design, and 4) statistical analyses. Ratings were scored from 4 (weak) to 12
(strong). Consistency of ratings was confirmed by no substantial differences in the review of an
initial ten articles. The remaining studies were individually assessed due to budget limitations.
Consistent with Huang et al. [15], articles rated weak for all four domains were excluded from
the review. In addition, the sufficiency of any sample � 200 was checked using G*Power [16]
relative to the analyses conducted (i.e., < 5% chance of a Type 1 error). Those with insufficient
power were excluded.

Meta-analysis assessment

The homogeneity of the data was assessed using predefined criteria. Given the heterogeneity of
the studies in terms of samples, design, predictors, and outcomes, no studies were deemed
suitable [17]. S1 Table provides the criteria, full details of this assessment, and associated rea-
sons for the unsuitability of the studies.

Results

Fig 1 shows the PRISMA flow diagram. From 12,384 records identified, a sample of 555 studies
was derived. For the initial search, the inter-rater agreement was 96.8% (disagreements

resolved by discussion). For each iteration of pearling, the inter-rater agreement was 100%.
Common reasons for exclusion were duplication of theses with published articles (theses
retained for their detail), lifetime or current abuse examined, or using a summary/composite
score. The final sample consisted of 95 articles.

The data extracted included the type of abuse, the child abuse measure, study details (e.g.,
longitudinal, country, participant age), perinatal outcomes, and findings. The outcomes were

categorized as pregnancy, childbirth, postnatal for the mother, and perinatal for mother and
child. Records extracted represented studies from 25 countries with 643,241 participants
(excluding duplicate samples); 59 studies were cross-sectional, 36 were longitudinal, and most
were conducted in North America or other developed countries. Child abuse was commonly
assessed using customized measures and the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) was the
most used validated measure. The studies were of good quality (M = 9.05 SD = 1.42); most
were rated low to medium bias (see S2 Table). S3 Table provides a detailed overview of the
studies’ characteristics (e.g., sample, abuse measure, prevalence, outcome measures, and qual-
ity rating).

Prevalence

Consistent with Brunton and Dryer’s [7] approach, prevalence estimates excluded
samples < 200 (could lack external validity), with a high risk of abuse (may overestimate) and
that utilized the same cohort as another included study. The prevalence of child abuse overall
ranged from 5–25% with wide variability for the abuse types: CPA 2–78%, CSA 2–47%, and
CEA/CPY 2–69%. The child abuse measure, conceptualization of abuse, and study location
contributed to this variability.

Findings from studies

For each subsection of the four main categories of findings, the main findings are summarized
(in italics) when multiple studies are reported. Then, the more detailed findings are provided.
S4 Table provides the main findings of each study.

Pregnancy outcomes

Unhealthy behaviors.
Disordered eating
Two studies had findings related to pregnancy weight gain or control. The evidence indicates
that all abuse types (i.e., CPA, CSA, and CEA) are related to weight or shape concerns or disor-
dered eating. However, in adjusted analyses only CSA significantly predicts lifetime eating disor-
ders and shape and weight concerns.

Ranchod et al. [18] noted that at least two occurrences of CPA were independently associ-
ated with an increased risk of excessive gestational weight gain. Senior et al. [19] identified that
CPA, CSA, and CEA independently predicted lifetime eating disorders and shape and weight
concerns. However, only CSA remained significant after adjustment for other childhood fac-
tors (e.g., parental depression, support). In addition, CSA and CEA predicted antenatal eating
disorder symptoms (e.g., self-induced vomiting), whereas CPA did not. However, these associ-
ations were not significant after adjusting for other childhood factors. In addition, all three
abuse types were independent risk factors for shape and weight concerns during pregnancy
(ORs = 1.56–1.78); however, after adjusting for childhood factors, only CSA remained signifi-
cant for antennal shape and weight concerns.

Substance use
Four studies examined smoking during pregnancy and predominantly identified CPA and
CEA as risk factors for continued smoking. CSA, CSA with force, or CSA and depressive symtoms
also predicted antenatal smoking. Fewer studies examined alcohol or drug use during pregnancy,
and these indicate that CSA is a risk factor for antenatal drug use, and a history of any CPA or
CSA increases the likelihood cocaine use (cf. no abuse).

Blalock et al. [20] identified that smoking within five minutes of waking was more than
twice as likely for pregnant women who experienced CPA and CEA (cf. women who reported

low/no trauma). Depression did not mediate these relationships. Cammack [21] identified that
non-parental CSA motivated by physical force was associated with continued pregnancy
smoking among women with a smoking history. Individuals with depressive symptoms and a
history of caregiver CPA or non-caregiver CSA had the same risk level for continued smoking;
however, those with 0–1 depressive symptoms and a CPA history were less likely to continue
smoking. Nerum et al. [22] noted that, pregnant women subjected to CSA were more likely to
smoke (cf. adult rape or no child abuse). Racine et al. [23] found that childhood family violence
(i.e., CPA, CEA, and exposure to domestic violence) increased the odds of antenatal smoking,
binge drinking, and drug use. A history of CSA was also a risk factor for antenatal drug use.
Jantzen et al. [24], was the only study to examine illicit drugs and showed that women with a
history of any CPA or CSA were more likely to use cocaine during their lifetime or perinatally
(cf. no abuse).

Maternal wellbeing.
Psychosocial risks
Psychosocial risks were examined in six studies. Findings suggest that the individual abuse
types alone or experienced jointly increased the risk of psychosocial difficulties (e.g., single parent-
ing, being unsupported) relative to no abuse. However, the evidence relating to unplanned preg-
nancy is mixed with one study identifying child abuse as increasing the risk of unplanned
pregnancy yet two studies failed to identify any dose-response relationship related to severity of
abuse and unplanned pregnancy.

Racine et al. [25] noted that women who experienced both CPA and CEA were more like-

lier to enter pregnancy with health risks and psychosocial difficulties than women who had
not suffered abuse. However, no single abuse type significantly increased pre-pregnancy or
reproductive health risks. Madigan et al.’s [29] study of 501 Canadian women identified that
CPA or CSA increased the psychosocial risks (e.g., single parent) of pregnant women. One
study [26] identified that women with a CSA history were less likely to participate in childbirth
classes and, if they did participate, were unlikely to have a partner with them (cf. no abuse).
These women also felt less prepared for labor and were less likely to have a trusted person with
them during labor or feel they could participate in medical decisions. Similarly, Nerum et al.
[22] found thatwomen with a CSA history were more likely to be unemployed or unsupported
during pregnancy (cf. adult rape or no abuse).

Three studies examined unintended pregnancy. Dietz et al. [27] identified that less frequent

abuse attenuated the risk of unintended pregnancy for CPA and CPY with multiple instances
of abuse increasing the risk by 50%. Similarly, Drevin [28] noted that all abuse types, either
individually or experienced jointly, and more frequent abuse was associated with an increased
risk of unplanned pregnancy. This risk remained even when controlling for other abuses.
Finally, Lukasse et al. [29] identified that CPA, CSA, and child abuse (any CPA, CSA, or CEA)
predicted a high incidence of unintended pregnancy but no dose-response effect for severity
was identified.

Biomedical risks
Five studies examined five different biomedical risks. CSA was identified as a risk for persis-
tent bacterial vaginosis and increased inflammation in pregnancy. Child abuse history predicted
C-reactive protein and increased the risk of gestation diabetes mellitus (GDM). CPA increased
the odds of thyroid dysfunction in postpartum women.

Cammack et al. [30], in a sample of 312 pregnant US women, compared those who suffered
CPA, CSA, or CEA to non-abused women and identified only CSA as a risk for persistent bac-
terial vaginosis (aOR = 3.07). Moreover, when stratified by race (a known risk factor for vari-
ous adverse perinatal outcomes), the magnitude of this association was stronger for non-black
people than black people. Finy and Christian’s [31] study identified child abuse history as a

PLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0302354 May 24, 2024

predictor of C-reactive protein. Pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) statistically explained
this relationship.

Mason et al. [32] examined GDM with a large sample (N = 45,500). In adjusted analyses,
different severities, and combinations of exposure of CPA and CSA increased the risk of GDM
(cf. no abuse). Adjustment for pre-pregnancy BMI attenuated these associations slightly. Also,
adjustment for not being overweight at 18 years also attenuated these associations and only
severe CPA and CSA remaining significant predictors of GDM. CPA was more strongly asso-
ciated with GDM if it occurred in adolescence than in childhood. Conversely, CSA was more
strongly associated with GDM if it occurred in childhood than adolescence. Severe CPA and
being overweight at 18 years increased the risk of GDM in a smaller subsample but no similar
interaction for CSA was found.

Madigan et al.’s [33] study identified that CPA or CSA increased the biomedical (e.g., gesta-

tional diabetes) risks of pregnant women. Plaza et al. [34] found that only CPA increased the
odds of thyroid dysfunction in postpartum women (cf. no abuse). Finally, Bublitz et al. [35]
showed that a CSA history was linked to a greater change in the Neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio
(NLR, a measure of systematic inflammation) over pregnancy.

Cortisol
Four studies examined cortisol with the evidence indicating that CSA is associated with ele-
vated cortisol awakening response (CAR) in later pregnancy (cf. other or no abuse) and that this
association may be moderated by family functioning and abuse severity. Also, experiencing joint
CSA and CPA is linked to increased hair cortisol levels however this association was only evident
among black women.

CSA was associated with elevated CAR at 30 and 60 minutes after waking after controlling
for proximal stressors in a small US study [36]. Bublitz and Stroud [37] found that 30 women
with CSA histories had higher CAR at 35 weeks gestation than women reporting other or no
abuse. In a second study of a similar size drawn from the same cohort, Bublitz et al. [38] identi-
fied that among participants with more experiences of CSA, those with poorer perceived fam-
ily functioning had increased CAR at 35 weeks but not at 25 or 29 weeks compared to women
with fewer CSA experiences and better-perceived family functioning. Schreier et al. [39] noted
that women who experienced joint CPA and CSA had higher hair cortisol levels (cf. no abuse).
When stratified by race/ethnicity, the association between child abuse and hair cortisol levels
was only evident for black women.

General health
Seven studies examined aspects of general health or pregnancy-related health. Findings show

that CPA or CSA are associated with poor past year health, hospitalization during pregnancy
and more pregnancy complications. Also, CPA, CSA or CEA may increase the risk of current (e.g.
migraine) or pregnancy-related health complaints or complications (cf. no abuse).

In a study of postpartum women, Ansara et al. [40] noted that CPA or CSA did not predict

bad headaches (cf. no abuse), however, CSA independently predicted backache, but this was
no longer significant in adjusted analyses (e.g., depression). Perineal pain, hemorrhoids,
fatigue, or bowel problems were not associated with CPA or CSA. Barrios et al. [41] identified
that a history of child abuse increased the odds of reporting poor past year health or during the
current pregnancy (cf. no abuse history). Similarly, women who reported CPA or CSA were
more likely to have poor past year health and over twice as likely to have a poor past year and
pregnancy health even after adjustment for current intimate partner violence (IPV).

Drevin [28], in a large cohort study, identified that women with self-reported CPA reported
sacral and pelvic pain more often than those with no CPA. Lukasse et al. [42] examined 55,776
Norwegian women and found that women with CPA, CSA, or CEA were likelier to report
seven or more common pregnancy complaints (e.g., heartburn, backache, cf. no abuse). In

PLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0302354 May 24, 2024

7 / 27

PLOS ONEA systematic review of child abuse and perinatal outcomes

addition, joint exposure to different abuses increased this likelihood. Sociodemographic char-
acteristics and other risk factors did not explain this graded association. Finally, Littleton [43]
found that those with a CSA history were more likely than nonvictims to report high levels of
past month somatic complaint severity (e.g., headaches, indigestion). Depressive symptoms
mediated this relationship (medium effect size). Controlling for sociodemographic variables
resulted in similar findings.

Two studies [44,45] found that women exposed to CSA were more likely to be hospitalized
during pregnancy (cf. no abuse). One study identified a link between CSA and reduced antena-
tal consultations after controlling for demographic and other key factors (e.g., dissociation,
adverse childhood experiences). Women with a CSA history also presented more often with
complications such as cervical insufficiency than other women. In adjusted analyses, women
with a CSA or CPA history were likelier to have pregnancy complications.

Gelaye et al. [46] identified that any child abuse, CPA, or joint exposure to CPA and CSA
increased the likelihood of migraine. In addition, a higher frequency of child abuse increased
this risk. Adjusting for lifetime IPV attenuated these associations slightly. Yampolsky et al.
[47] found that CSA survivors were almost twice as likely to have gynecological problems (cf.
other trauma) after adjusting for depression and post-traumatic stress. However, a history of
CSA or other trauma was not statistically significant in contributing to high-risk pregnancy.

Sleep
One study examined sleep and found that child abuse was related to stress-related sleep dis-
turbance. Child abuse or CPA increased the odds of poor pregnancy sleep quality with a dose-
response relationship relative to the frequency or joint exposure.

Gelaye et al. [48] noted that women who experienced child abuse, multiple occurrences of
abuse or jointly experienced CPA and CSA were more likely to have stress-related sleep distur-
bance than non-abused women. These associations remained after adjustment for age, ethnic-
ity, and lifetime IPV. Experiencing CPA or CSA alone was not related to increased odds of
stress-related sleep disturbance. When examining sleep quality, women reporting child abuse
or CPA were around twice as likely to have poor sleep quality during pregnancy than other
women. This risk increased relative to the frequency of abuse or if there was joint exposure to
CPA and CSA. In separate analyses, antepartum depression and IPV mediated the relationship
between child abuse and stress-related disturbance and sleep quality.

Memory
Zhang et al. [49] examined memory impairment in a community sample. CPA, CSA, and
CEA all predicted greater prospective and retrospective memory impairment. In adjusted ana-
lyzes, only CEA was independently related to both types of impairment. Women reporting
both CEA and CPA had a higher prospective impairment, and those reporting both CEA and
CSA or CEA and CPA had higher retrospective memory impairment. Women reporting all
three types of child abuse also had higher prospective and retrospective memory impairment.

Miscarriage, stillbirth, and termination
Atkinson [50] failed to find a relationship between CPA and stillbirth, miscarriage, or termina-

tion. Similarly, Freedman et al. [51] found no association between CPA, CSA, or CEA and still-
birth. However, in a smaller study [22] of women referred to mental health services, a history of
CSA increased the likelihood of a previous termination or miscarriage (cf. adult rape or no abuse).

Psychological and mental health disorders.
Antenatal depression
Nine studies examined antenatal depression. Findings strongly indicate that child abuse,
CPA, CSA or a history of both CPA and CSA are risk factors for depression in pregnancy (cf. no
abuse). In addition, race and a positive maternal relationship may influence the severity of
depression. Only one study did not find significant results for CSA and depression.

Barrios et al. [41] identified child abuse, CPA, or a history of both CPA and CSA as more
than doubling the risk of depression in early pregnancy (cf. no abuse). This risk remained after
adjusting for current IPV. CSA alone was not a significant risk factor. Likewise, Corona et al.
[52] found a two-fold risk of depression in a sample of 382 low-income Hispanic/Latina
women who reported child abuse. However, when stratified by country of birth, foreign-born
Hispanic/Latina women had a lower depression risk (aOR = 1.96) than US-born women
(aOR = 2.40).

Rich-Edwards et al. [53] also identified that a history of CPA or CSA increased the risk for

antenatal depression in mid-pregnancy after adjusting for age and race. In addition, Yam-
polsky et al. [47] found that CSA survivors had a higher risk of depressive symptoms than oth-
ers. Similarly, Chung et al. [54] noted that CPA and CSA increased the risk of depression (cf.
no/other abuse). Of note, for CSA survivors without a positive maternal relationship, their risk
of depressive symptoms more than tripled compared to women with no CSA and a positive
maternal relationship.

Benedict et al. [55] found that contact or non-contact CSA was unrelated to antenatal
depression symptoms but when they examined severe depressive symptoms, women who
experienced CSA had a two-fold risk. Samia et al.’s [56] Kenyan study demonstrated that con-
tact CSA predicted antenatal depression, consistent from early to mid-pregnancy. Galbally
et al. [57] identified moderate-to-severe forms of child abuse increased the risk of an early
pregnancy depression diagnosis but when examined separately, CSA posed over a four-fold
risk. Only one study did not find a relationship between CSA and depression [58].

Anxiety, worries and common mental disorders (CMDs)
Four studies had findings related to pregnancy-related anxiety, worries, and CMDs. Brun-
ton et al. [4] demonstrated that CPA, CSA, and CPY all independently predicted pregnancy-
related anxiety mediated by resilience and social support. Eide et al. [59] noted that women
who reported CPA, CSA, or joint exposure were more likely to have strong worries about the
baby’s health than other women. Samia et al. [56] had no significant findings concerning CSA,
pregnancy-related anxiety, and stress. Lydsdottir et al. [60] showed that CSA nearly tripled the
odds of CMDs in pregnancy (i.e., depression or anxiety) after controlling for other traumas
(e.g., poverty, being bullied). For CPA, however, the risk of CMD diagnosis was over five-fold.

Suicide ideation
Two studies examined suicide ideation finding that pregnant women who experienced any
child abuse, CPA, CSA, or CEA had an increased risk of suicide ideation. The severity and fre-
quency of abuse increased the risk exponentially. For women with a history of child abuse,
depression or IPV potentially moderates this risk.

Zhang et al. [61] identified that pregnant women who experienced any child abuse had over

a three-fold risk of suicide ideation; controlling for depression slightly attenuated this. When
examined independently, child abuse was associated with an increased risk of suicide ideation
during pregnancy ranging from around a three-fold risk for CPA and CSA to close to five-fold
for CEA. The severity and frequency of abuse increased the risk exponentially. Of note,
women with a history of child abuse and depression had the greatest risk of suicide ideation
(aOR = 17.78) than women without abuse or depression or women with only depression and
no abuse history. Likewise, Zhong et al. [62] noted that any CPA or CSA nearly quadrupled
the risk of suicide ideation in pregnancy compared to other women. This risk was attenuated
by controlling for IPV and depression. Experiencing only CPA or only CSA increased the risk
more than two-fold; however, joint exposure to CPA and CSA or multiple instances of abuse
increased the risk more than four-fold, even after controlling for IPV and depression. The lack
of a depression diagnosis did not reduce the risk of suicide ideation for those with a child
abuse history.

and CSA increased the risk for PTSD or related symptomology and this risk increased exponen-
tially for those who experienced child abuse and IPV. Only one study failed to find any significant
findings related to the individual abuse types and PTSD.

Yampolsky et al. [47] found that a history of CSA doubled the risk for high post-traumatic

stress symptoms. Sanchez et al. [63], in models adjusted for age, ethnicity, and lifetime IPV,
showed that women who experienced CPA or CSA had an increased risk of PTSD (cf. other
women). This risk increased eightfold when CPA and CSA were experienced together. Also,
women who experienced child abuse were more than five times more likely to have PTSD and
experiencing child abuse and IPV increased the odds of PTSD to more than twenty-fold.

Seng et al. [64] examined primiparous women using cluster analysis. CPA was associated
with an increased likelihood of affect/relational dysregulation, and CSA doubled the odds of
comorbid PTSD. In addition, the odds of being in the healthy cluster for both abuse types were
low (aOR < 0.62). Huth-Bocks’ [65] smaller study examined women in late pregnancy. After
controlling for age and income, there were no significant findings related to the individual
abuse types and PTSD. Finally, Diestel et al. [66] examined child abuse and PTSD symptoms
with women from an IPV and epigenetic risk study. All types of child abuse were associated
with PTSD symptomology, with the strongest findings for CEA. This abuse type was strongly
associated with social isolation with weaker associations for intrusive thoughts and negative
emotionality.

Childbirth outcomes

Birth complications. Four studies examinend bith complications with the findings indicat-
ing that women with a CPA or CSA history had increased risk of perinatal and obstetrical com-
plications and more likely to have a difficult birth, medical interventions during birth, or their
child transferred to intensive care. CPA and CSA were also independent risk factors for compli-
cated delivery.

Shamblaw et al. [67] found that women with a CSA or CEA history (cf. no abuse) had
around a two-fold increased risk of perinatal and obstetrical complications. However, after
adjustment for lifetime psychiatric disorders, only CSA was significant. Heimstad et al. [68]
noted that CPA and CSA were independent risk factors for complicated delivery (i.e., operative
vaginal delivery or caesarean); both posed around a 2.5 increase in risk than women with no
abuse history. Leeners et al. [26] showed that pregnant women with a history of CSA were
more likely to have a difficult birth and less likely to deliver spontaneously. Finally, Nerum
et al. [22] found that relative to women who experienced adult rape or no abuse, women with a
CSA history were more likely to have obstetric risks, induced or augmented labor, epidural
analgesia, or their child transferred to intensive care.

Fear of childbirth. Three studies had findings related to a fear of childbirth. Consistently,
child abuse survivors have been shown to have more childbirth fear than other women regardless
of parity. A previous negative birth experience increases the risk exponentially. CSA history
increases the likelihood of intense fear of delivery, negative birth perceptions, and a greater fear of
delivery.

Lukasse et al. [3] found that regardless of parity, child abuse survivors feared childbirth
more than other women. However, primiparas with a CPA, CSA, or CEA history were more
likely to fear childbirth severely (cf. no abuse). The severity of abuse also increased the odds of
the severity of fear of childbirth. Experiencing simultaneous abuse increased the odds, and a
collective history of all three abuse types posed the greatest risk for severe fear of childbirth

PLOS ONEA systematic review of child abuse and perinatal outcomes

(aOR = 5.30). For multiparas, only non-contact, and mild CSA (e.g., humiliation) increased
the odds of severe fear of childbirth. CPA, severe CPA, CEA, and any child abuse likewise were
risk factors. Also, when adjusted (e.g., demographics, adult abuse, previous negative birth
experience), the association between child abuse and severe fear of childbirth attenuated
slightly for primiparas but was not significant for multiparas. However, multiparas who experi-
enced any child abuse and had a negative birth experience were nearly six times more likely to
have a severe fear of childbirth than women with a history of child abuse and a positive birth
experience. However, no child abuse and a negative birth experience posed a much higher risk
(nearly nine times) for severe fear of childbirth.

Lukasse et al. [69] examined multiparas (second pregnancy). Child abuse increased the risk
for fear of childbirth after adjusting for sociodemographics, adult abuse, previous birth experi-
ence, and perception of first pregnancy. However, only CEA was a significant risk factor for
fear of childbirth. Finally, Leeners et al. [26] demonstrated that women with a CSA history
were more likely to have an intense fear of delivery than other women, twice as likely to have a
negative birth perception, and nearly three times more likely to fear delivery.

Low birthweight. Hyle’s [70] study of low-income women found that a history of CSA
(broadly defined), predicted birth weight, whereas CPA did not (cf. no abuse). Additionally,
specific abuse characteristics (e.g., onset age) predicted birth weight. Leeners et al. [45] identi-
fied that women with a CSA history were more likely to have a low birthweight baby (< 2800
grams) than non-abused women. In contrast, Benedict et al. [55] did not find differences in
birth weight or baby characteristics for women exposed to CSA compared to those who were
not.

Mode of delivery. Five studies examined the mode of delivery. The finidngs show that
regardless of parity, a history of abuse was not associated with operative delivery, but CPA was
associated with a significant increase in emergency cesareans for multiparas. Moreover, any child
abuse or CSA was linked to increased cesarean during labor and women who suffered CPA or
CSA were more likely to desire a cesarean before their second pregnancy birth.

Schei et al. [71] utilized data from a multi-country study, finding that regardless of parity, a
history of abuse was not associated with any operative delivery. However, for multiparas, a his-
tory of CPA was associated with a significant increase in emergency cesareans, and this associ-
ation attenuated after controlling for previous cesarean. There was no association between
CPA and non-obstetrically indicated cesarean. In contrast, Nerum et al. [22] found that
women with a CSA history were no more likely to have an operative vaginal delivery or cesar-
ean than women with a history of adult rape or no abuse. Benedict et al. [55] failed to find sig-
nificant differences between CSA and no CSA for the type of delivery (e.g., caesarean,
induction). Lukasse et al. [72] identified that more women with an abuse history had an
increased chance of caesarean during labor than other women. However, none of the distinct
categories of child abuse was significantly associated with a cesarean before childbirth; how-
ever, any child abuse and mild CEA were associated with increased cesarean during labor com-
pared with women with no child abuse. After adjustment, only any child abuse remained a
risk factor for cesarean during labor. Using a smaller subsample from the same cohort [69],
women who suffered any CPA or CSA were more likely to desire a cesarean before their sec-
ond pregnancy birth than women with no abuse.

Preterm birth (PTB). Six studies have findings related to PTB however most have failed to

identify child abuse or specific types (e.g., CPA or CSA) as risk factors for PTB. In contrast one
study found that a CSA history was associated with an increased risk of PTB (cf. no abuse), and
this risk was heightened for women from a race other than Hispanic, black, or white. Only one
study identified that the frequency of child abuse or exposure to child abuse and IPV, doubled the
risk of placental abruption.

PLOS ONEA systematic review of child abuse and perinatal outcomes

Cammack [21] found that women with CSA perpetrated by a non-parent and motivated by

non-physical threats had nearly double the risk of very PTB (before 34 weeks) than women
with no child abuse. Further, women from a race other than Hispanic, black, or white were
nearly eight times more likely to have a very PTB. Moreover, the risk for ‘other race’ and birth
before 37 weeks nearly quadrupled when they had experienced the same type of CSA (cf. no
abuse). Leeners et al. [44,45] conducted two studies with the same sample. Women with a CSA
history were more likely to have a PTB or premature contractions.

In contrast, studies have more consistently not identified child abuse or specific types (e.g.,

CPA or CSA) as risk factors for PTB [70,73,74]. However, Hyle [70] showed specific abuse
characteristics (e.g., more than three incidents) predictive of lower gestational age in a sample
of low-income women. Specifically, there was an associated decrease in gestational age for
each additional abuse incident. Only one study found that any child abuse and CSA increased
the chances (1.5 times) of late PTB at 35–36 weeks [74].

Mitro et al. [75] conducted the only study on placental abruption. Child abuse did not

increase the odds of placental abruption in adjusted models for demographics and parity. How-
ever, experiencing three or more instances of child abuse increased the odds of placental abrup-
tion by just over 1.5 times. In addition, joint exposure to severe child abuse and IPV doubled
this risk compared to rare or no abuse. When examined among women delivering preterm,
experiencing three or more child abuse events almost doubled the risk for placental abruption.
Similarly, among women delivering full-term babies, experiencing joint and severe exposure to
childhood abuse and IPV was associated with close to a three-fold risk of placental abruption.

Postnatal outcomes for mothers

Mother-child relationship. Five studies examined attachment/bonding with the evidence sug-

gesting that CEA and CSA are associated with less maternal-fetal attachment or bonding distur-
bances. However, postpartum no specific abuse types predict mother-infant bonding impairment.
Two studies identified CEA as a predictor of lower maternal-fetal attachment [76] and
mother-infant bonding disturbances [77]. Also, Nieto et al. [78] found that CSA (cf. no CSA)
nearly tripled the odds of lower maternal attachment. In contrast, Lehnig et al. [79] did not
identify specific abuse types that predicted mother-infant bonding impairment at two months
postpartum. However, their result may reflect their sample’s low prevalence of abuse. Choi’s
[80] study of South African mothers did not identify any abuse type significantly affecting
maternal-infant bonding in analyses controlling for other abuse types.

Parental practice.
Self-efficacy and parenting morale
Two studies examined parenting outcomes. Kunseler et al. [81] identified that postpartum

women who reported child abuse did not differ in parenting self-efficacy or changes in their
efficacy after positive feedback (than other women). However, for those who reported child
abuse, their parenting self-efficacy decreased after exposure to a difficult-to-soothe infant (cf.
non-abused women). Malta et al. [82] noted that women with a child abuse history were nearly
twice as likely to have low parenting morale.

Child abuse harm or potential
Three studies examined child abuse potential or harm. Findings indicate that a history of
CPA, CSA or CEA are associated with an increased likelihood of harm to the infant/toddler and
this association may be mediated by substance abuse or depression. Moreover, for first-time
mothers those with a history of CPA or CEA, they may be less responsive or have reduced
empathic awareness in parenting, have harsher punishment attitudes and be more accepting of
child abuse/neglect.

PLOS ONEA systematic review of child abuse and perinatal outcomes

Appleyard et al. [83] demonstrated that a maternal history of CPA or CSA increased the
likelihood that the mother would victimize their infant/toddler. Maternal substance abuse
mediated this relationship. Bert et al. [84] noted that CEA predicted less responsivity/empathic
awareness in parenting, harsher punishment attitudes, more acceptance of child abuse/neglect,
and greater child abuse potential in first-time mothers. CPA predicted the same outcomes
except for child abuse potential, which was only significant for mothers older than 21 with
some college education. Choi [80] identified CEA as indirectly influencing child harm expo-
sure through postpartum depression (PPD). CPA or CSA were not significant contributors.

Postpartum psychological outcomes.
Postpartum depression (PPD)
Ten studies had findings relating to PPD. Women who experienced child abuse may be more
likely to have PPD with the risk increasing exponentially for multiple types of abuse or experienc-
ing child abuse and pregnancy IPV. Three studies found that CEA increased the risk of PPD. In
contrast, one study failed to find any association between CPA, CSA, and CEA and PPD but
may have been limited by its sample.

Mahenge et al. [85] identified that women who experienced child abuse were between 2.5
and over five times more likely to have PPD. The risk nearly quadrupled for those with a joint
history of CSA and CPY and increased to more than nine times if they experienced child abuse
and IPV during pregnancy. Bahadur et al. [86] noted that CEA increased the risk of PPD
nearly seven-fold after adjusting for sociodemographic factors, whereas CPA and CSA were
not significant. However, a larger Australian study [87] showed a similar but lower risk for CEA
(aOR = 1.4). Nagl et al. [88] found that women with severe CEA were nearly 20 times more
likely to have PPD. Severe CPA or CSA, slight and moderate CPA, or CEA were lesser risk fac-
tors. Most of these associations remained even after controlling for other abuses. One Ethiopian
study [89] identified that a history of CSA was a stronger predictor of PPD than other sociode-
mographic variables. In studies that examined all abuse types, CPA, CSA, and CEA indepen-
dently predicted PPD; however, only CPA remained significant when controlling for other
abuses [34]. CEA and CSA were also risk factors for early-onset PPD, and CEA, CPA, and CSA
were all risk factors for late-onset. The risk remained for CSA and early-onset PPD and CEA
and late-onset PPD after adjusting for sociodemographic factors and other abuse types [90]. In
contrast, a South African study showed that only CSA and CEA predicted PPD [80]. Finally,
Cohen et al. [91] demonstrated that CPA, CSA, and CEA was not predictive of PPD however
insufficient participants with abuse experiences may have impacted this result.

Postnatal anxiety, stress and PTSD
Three studies examined postnatal anxiety or stress finding that child abuse was not linked to
postnatal anxiety or stress. However, when examined by subtype CPA, CSA and CEA were inde-
pendent risk factors for postnatal anxiety. One study failed to find any association between CSA
and PTSD symptoms hypothesising an indirect effect.

Malta [82] did not identify any association between child abuse and postnatal anxiety or

stress. In contrast, Nagl et al. [88] identified CPA and CEA as independent risk factors for
postpartum anxiety with severe CSA associated with a nearly seven-fold risk. These associa-
tions were lower after controlling for other abuses. Mayhew and Thomas [92] noted that pre-
natal anxiety was the strongest predictor for postnatal anxiety. CEA and distressing childbirth
were also significant predictors in the same model.

Oliveira et al. [93] conducted the only study of postnatal PTSD symptoms noting that CSA
was related to other traumatic events such as IPV and fear of childbirth but not directly related
to PTSD symptoms suggesting an indirect effect.

Sleep. Swanson et al. [94] found that women with a CPA or a joint history of CPA and

CSA had greater difficulty falling asleep. Of interest, the risk was greater for CPA alone

PLOS ONEA systematic review of child abuse and perinatal outcomes

(aOR = 9.20) than for experiencing CPA and CSA jointly (aOR = 5.95). In addition, women
with a history of CPA or those who experienced CPA and CSA simultaneously were more
than three times more likely than other women to have difficulty staying asleep.

Perinatal outcomes for mothers and newborns

Offspring asthma and autism. Only one study examined asthma but did not identify sig-

nificant associations with maternal CPA or CSA [95]. Roberts et al. [96], the only study to
examine autism risk, found that severe CSA doubled the risk for offspring autism, with severe
joint exposure to CPA and CEA a lesser risk (cf. no abuse). In addition, experiencing multiple
instances of child abuse tripled the risk of autism regardless of the child’s biological sex. In
adjusted models, gestational diabetes, previous abortion, and smoking mediated the relation-
ship between child abuse and autism.

Breastfeeding. Breastfeeding was examined by three studies with the findings indicating

that women who experienced child abuse were more likely to stop breastfeeding earlier than
other women. Also, a history of CSA increased the likelihood of mastitis or painful breastfeeding
which may be a contributing factor to early cessation.

Sorbo et al. [97], using a large sample, noted that women who experienced child abuse or
CSA were more likely to stop breastfeeding before four months. The odds of breastfeeding ces-
sation by four months were lower for CPA and/or CEA. Coles et al. [2] identified CSA survi-
vors as less likely to breastfeed for longer than six months however, this result was no longer
significant after adjustment for adult violence and other factors (e.g., smoking, partner status).
Elfgen et al. [98] noted that a history of CSA nearly tripled the likelihood of mastitis or experi-
ence painful breastfeeding (OR = 5.77). However, there was no difference in breastfeeding
prevalence between these women and those with no CSA history.

Intimate Partner Violence (IPV). Three studies examined IPV identifying that CPA, CSA,

and CEA increased the likelihood of IPV in the past-year with specific abuse types linked to spe-
cific IPV subtypes. Child abuse, CPA, and CSA were risk factors for any IPV with joint exposure
(i.e. CPA and CSA) increasing the risk. However, when other types of violence are controlled, the
results were non-significant suggesting a mediating effect. Only one study did not identify child
abuse (CPA and CSA) predictive of IPV in a sample of HIV-positive women.

Barnett’s [99] longitudinal study (pregnancy and postpartum) demonstrated that CPA,
CSA, and CEA increased the likelihood of high past-year IPV. When specific IPV subtypes
were analyzed, a CPA history was a higher risk for moderate emotional and sexual IPV and
high physical IPV (cf. women with low/no child abuse). CSA and CEA were associated with
high emotional or physical IPV and high/moderate sexual IPV.

Barrios et al. [41] identified that child abuse, CPA, and CSA were risk factors for any IPV

and physical lifetime IPV; joint CPA and CSA posed the highest risk. Child abuse also pre-
dicted lifetime sexual IPV, and a history of both CPA and CSA posed a five-fold risk of this
IPV type. Child abuse and CSA predicted both physical and sexual lifetime IPV. A history of
CPA and CSA increased this risk more than seven-fold. Comparable results were evident for
IPV in the past year. CPA and CSA were associated with greater odds of revictimization of
physical IPV. CSA was also related to sexual IPV revictimization. Experiencing both CPA and
CSA increased the risk of physical and sexual lifetime IPV revictimization. However, the great-
est risk of revictimization was for those who experienced CPA and CSA and combined physi-
cal and sexual IPV, aOR = 6.88.

Castro et al. [100] identified a higher prevalence of pregnancy IPV for those who experi-
enced moderate to high CPA or CEA (cf. no/low abuse). Both abuse types more than doubled
the risk of IPV; however, when other types of violence were controlled, the results were non-

significant. Only one study did not identify child abuse (CPA and CSA) predictive of IPV in a
sample of HIV-positive women [101].
Maternal psychological outcomes.
Depression and anxiety
Seven studies examined depression across the perinatal period. The findings show that
child abuse, CPA, CSA, and CEA all increased the risk of antenatal or postnatal distress or
depression or high depressive symptoms. One longitudinal examination showed that women
who experienced CSA had higher anxiety symptoms during pregnancy and postpartum than
non-abused women.

Kang et al. [102] demonstrated that child abuse nearly doubled the risk of peripartum

depression in a large Turkish study. Li et al. [103] found that women who experienced CSA or
CEA were more than four times more likely to have antepartum depression than non-abused
women. Also, women with a CEA history had higher depression scores in pregnancy which
lessened over the perinatal period than women with no CEA, whose scores started lower but
increased postpartum. In fact, the depression scores for women with a CEA history, while
higher in pregnancy, were much lower than those with no CEA by four weeks postpartum.
Also, no significant effects for any abuse or frequency of abuse was found for PPD scores, or
between abuse types and chronic depression risk.

Akinbode’s [104] study showed that CSA predicted PPD symptoms in pregnancy, six and
12 weeks postpartum. CPA predicted depression in pregnancy and 12 weeks postpartum but
not six weeks postpartum. Experiencing both CPA and CSA also predicted antenatal depres-
sion, but there was no significant finding for PPD. In contrast, Robertson-Blackmore et al.
[105] found that women who reported CSA were more likely to report antenatal depressive
symptoms than other women but were not more likely to report PPD. CPA/parental neglect
was not significant for antenatal depression or PPD.

Khanlari et al. [106] compared women with a maternal history of abuse with other women,
noting that child abuse increased the risk for antenatal and postnatal distress and depression. The
highest risk was for antenatal depression (aOR = 3.2). Similarly, Ogbo et al. [107] examined a
large sample of culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) Australian women. Those with a child
abuse history had nearly double the risk for antenatal distress and were more than twice as likely
to have antenatal or PPD than non-abused CALD women. Giallo et al. [108] noted that CPA and
CSA independently increased the risk for subclinical and persistently high depressive symptoms
for nulliparous women. However, CPA was the only significant risk factor for subclinical and per-
sistently high depressive symptoms after controlling for sociodemographic factors.

Akinbode [104] conducted the only longitudinal examination of anxiety, noting that
women who experienced CSA had higher anxiety symptoms during pregnancy, six and 12
weeks postpartum, than non-abused women. CPA and experiencing both CPA and CSA were
not significant predictors.

Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)
Three studies examined PTSD. The evidence shows that women with a CSA history or those
who experienced CPA and neglect have a higher risk of lifetime PTSD. Greater exposure to child
abuse also predicts antenatal PTSD symptoms and a history of CSA predicts greater PTSD symp-
tomology, postpartum.

Robertson-Blackmore et al. [105] showed a higher risk of lifetime PTSD for women with a

CSA history (aOR = 9.21) or those who experienced CPA and neglect (12.16) in models
adjusted for demographics. Also, in adjusted analyses, Sumner et al. [109] found that higher
exposure to child abuse predicted antenatal PTSD symptoms but not postpartum symptoms.
Finally, Lev-Wiesel et al. [110] noted that a history of CSA predicted greater disassociation at

two months postpartum and more birth-related PTSD symptoms, avoidance, and arousal lev-
els at seven months postpartum.

Discussion
Summary of findings

Despite some variability in the findings, predominantly studies confirm that a history of child
abuse is a significant risk factor for poor pregnancy outcomes. CSA was the most examined
abuse type consistently linked to pregnancy and childbirth outcomes. These outcomes
included substance use (i.e., alcohol, smoking) which is of critical concern given the harmful
teratogens introduced into the prenatal environment. However, none of the studies examined
alcohol as an independent outcome; this area requires more attention. Poor mental health was
the focus of several studies conducted in various countries, supporting the generalization of
the findings. There were consistent findings that CPA and CSA, independently or jointly, rep-
resent a greater risk of antenatal depression and PTSD symptoms during pregnancy.

Studies examining biomedical outcomes confirm that child abuse increases the risk for cer-

tain conditions (e.g., enhanced inflammatory states) linked to poor maternal and neonatal
health and perinatal complications. Also, CSA was associated with higher cortisol levels,
whereas child abuse overall or different subtypes had less consistent findings. High cortisol lev-
els may increase the HPA axis’ sensitivity to maternal distress, shorten gestation and increase
antenatal health problems such as preeclampsia or gestational diabetes [38]. For the child,
increased prenatal cortisol is associated with poor developmental outcomes [e.g., restricted
growth, 111]. However, the findings should be viewed cautiously, given the small samples
used.

Several studies established a link between child abuse and aspects of poor general health but

not all types of poor health were linked to abuse, suggesting that the type of health condition
may play a pivotal role. For example, a history of CSA is linked to gynecological problems in
areas consistent with the foci of that abuse type. In contrast, CPA is associated with greater pel-
vic or sacral pain; these are areas that could be targeted during physical abuse. Also, findings
that abuse survivors can have more common health complaints are consistent with trauma
leading to a vulnerability for poorer mental and physical health and, for some, unexplained
complaints [112]. Related to health is sleep disturbance, with studies establishing that women
with a history of child abuse are more likely to have poorer sleep quality. Despite sleep disrup-
tion normative during pregnancy, poor sleep can contribute to poor outcomes [113, provides
a review]. Finally, findings regarding care indicate that women with a CSA history are more
likely to be hospitalized during pregnancy or have reduced consultations. While these results
may seem contradictory, it is conceivable that a lack of standard care may lead to more serious
problems requiring hospitalization. However, caution is warranted in interpreting these find-
ings due to the small effect sizes.

Childbirth

All abuse types increase the risk of delivery complications, and these have largely been studied
for CSA. Child abuse survivors also have a greater preference for a cesarean; however, while
this preference exists, the chances that it occurs are low. Multiparous women with a CPA his-
tory are also more likely to have an emergency cesarean which may be related to previous
abdominal trauma. The finding that controlling for any previous caesarean attenuated this risk
supports this proposition.

PTB and low birthweight have attracted the most interest from North American researchers

using obstetric data (than self-report), which adds certainty to the findings. Predominantly

PLOS ONEA systematic review of child abuse and perinatal outcomes

CSA is associated with low birthweight more than other abuses. However, studies are limited
by not considering the influence of other related factors identified in this review (e.g., self-care,
eating disorders, and substance use) which could contribute to less nourishment for the fetus.
Therefore, the mechanisms by which low birthweight occurs are unclear. Likewise, the associa-
tion between CSA and PTB is inconsistent, suggesting there may be significant mediators or
moderators of this relationship. However, again there are limited studies in this area.

Postnatal outcomes for mothers

Bonding and attachment are critical developmental tasks of motherhood [114], yet findings
are inconsistent and require cautious interpretation (from single studies with small effects or
unrepresentative samples). Given that several factors have been identified that result in a
woman psychologically distancing from her pregnancy and newborn [e.g., anxiety and depres-
sion, 115], an examination of other indirect influences is needed.

Child abuse is a risk factor for low parenting morale [82] and predicts less parenting self-
efficacy after exposure to a difficult-to-soothe infant. This large effect size for self-efficacy in
nulliparous women indicates that these mothers may lose belief in themselves more readily in
stressful parenting situations [81]. Relatedly, CPA, CSA, and CEA predicted exposure or
potential to harm their child. Of note, substance use and PPD mediated the relationship
between CEA and child harm exposure between the ages of five and 12. The authors explained
that this delayed onset of maltreatment of abused mothers’ offspring is due to the persistence
of depression beyond the postpartum period. These findings are particularly important given
that vicarious learning may model later parenting behaviors [116], contributing to a genera-
tional cycle of violence.

Similarly, there are consistent links between CPA, CSA, and PPD. Less consistent are the
findings for CEA, CPY and PPD. Only one study [91] did not find a relationship between CSA
and PPD and CEA and PPD; however, their smaller sample and modified abuse measure may
have limited findings. There were some consistent findings that CPA, CSA or CEA increase
the risk of perinatal anxiety, with contradictory findings likely due to the purpose-created
abuse measures used [e.g., 82].

Only one study examined CSA and postnatal PTSD symptoms, with the results trending toward

significance (p = .07), consistent with longitudinal studies across pregnancy and postpartum. Of
interest, while identifying that PTSD symptoms have a downward trajectory from pregnancy to
postpartum, Lev Weisel and colleagues’ comprehensive study also showed that CSA predicts signif-
icant PTSD symptoms seven months postpartum. Prima facie, this downward trajectory does not
seem consistent with theorizing that childbirth for abuse survivors is retraumatizing; however,
symptoms relating to intrusion and arousal, which had a time interaction, may indicate a delayed
response to childbirth. Alternatively, the thought of childbirth may be retraumatizing for some
abuse survivors, and the effects of this may lessen if the experience was not traumatic.

Perinatal outcomes for mothers and newborns

CSA posed the greatest risk for breastfeeding cessation, with CEA or CPA also identified as a
risk for earlier cessation. One study identified that a history of CSA was related to painful
breastfeeding, which may contribute to decisions to stop breastfeeding earlier, although this
outcome was not examined. In addition, the link between child abuse, particularly CSA and
breastfeeding, could be related to breastfeeding involving skin-to-skin contact, triggering
memories of abuse. Given the importance of breastfeeding for at least six months to optimize
an infant’s growth, development, and health and the benefits for the mother [e.g., reduces can-
cer risks, 117], this is an understudied area that requires more attention.

PLOS ONEA systematic review of child abuse and perinatal outcomes

The risk of revictimization of survivors of child abuse is high with consistent links between
child abuse, its subtypes and lifetime, past year, or current IPV [41,99,100]. These findings are
consistent with child abuse, a known risk factor for adult revictimization [118]. The one study
that did not identify abuse as a risk of revictimization utilized an HIV-positive sample and a
comparison of no or low abuse, possibly limiting their findings [101]. During pregnancy, this
risk for IPV may increase, potentially endangering the expectant mother and the unborn baby.
This risk is explained by experiential avoidance, which proposes that dissociation and PTSD
symptoms influence revictimization [119].

Results indicate that CSA may be a more consistent predictor of depression across the peri-

natal period than CPA or CEA. One study identified an interaction between CEA and time
with women who experienced emotional abuse; their depression scores decreased across the
perinatal period compared to women who had not suffered this abuse, whose scores increased.
There was no similar interaction for other abuse types. No studies examined CPY.

Methodological issues and implications for research

The CTQ was the most common child abuse measure utilized by 24% of studies. This ques-
tionnaire has adequate psychometric data; however, the short-form version, used more fre-
quently, needs further validity evidence [7]. Many studies relied on purpose-created measures
or tools without documented reliability and validity to assess child abuse. This significant issue
potentially impacting findings and cross-study comparisons.

Despite consistent findings across the studies, effect sizes were small or negligible in some
cases, likely due to the samples used or the methodology employed. Some studies used small
convenience samples that can amplify effects or are unrepresentative of the population. In con-
trast, several studies analyzed data as part of large-scale projects. Despite the common belief
that larger sample sizes are superior to small samples, excessive sample sizes can exaggerate
small or even non-significant effects [120]. To provide more certainty for future findings,
researchers should determine the sample size a priori to ensure it is adequate for the planned
analyses. Indeed, this review excluded 36 studies with insufficient sample sizes relative to the
power to conduct their analyses. Also, it is important to acknowledge that some of the path-
ways between child abuse and the outcomes reported are complex. However, few studies iden-
tified in this review examined mediation/moderation or interact effects, focussing instead on
the direct relationship however the influence of other variables needs to be considered when
examining the sequalae of child abuse.

Eighteen studies examined only one type of abuse, yet child abuse is rarely isolated, with
many victims subjected to multiple maltreatment [121]. In contrast, when examining multiple
types of abuse, there was a failure to partition other abuse types statistically [e.g., 40], which
could overestimate findings as it cannot be assumed that the effects noted are specific to the
abuse examined. Moreover, the propensity to examine abuse as a combined variable limits our
understanding of the impacts of certain abuses in the perinatal period. Relatedly, few studies
included adequate control of other variables, such as socioeconomic status or family environ-
ment previously identified as risk factors for child abuse [122]. These variables could interact
or account for some of the variance, and when not included, effect sizes may be overestimated.
This highlights that the design of child abuse studies requires careful consideration to ensure
that the findings reflect the population of interest.

The studies captured by this review were predominantly North American, with an over-
focus on CSA. This focus is likely an artifact of historical understandings of abuse, with CSA
considered part of battered child syndrome some 45 years ago [123]. However, child abuse is a
worldwide phenomenon with wide variability in the prevalence of abuse types across different

countries. Generally, CPA is more prevalent in countries such as South America and Africa,
CSA in North America and Australia, and CEA and CPY in South America and Australia
[124]. While this disparity may relate to differing conceptualisations of abuse (e.g., [punitive
parenting practices may be acceptable in some cultures and not others), or differing methodol-
ogies for assessing abuse [125] they also highlight the disparity between the countries where
child abuse is predominantly studied and the absence of studies in countries with a higher
abuse prevalence (e.g., Africa and South America).

Also, CPY and CEA are often treated as synonymous, likely stemming from cognition and
emotion considered interdependent [126]; examining them independently or statistically control-
ling them may clarify inconclusive findings. Indeed it can be argued that CPY and CEA are inher-
ent in all abuse types and may even be more prevalent than CPA or CSA [(see 42, for example].

Implications for policy

Child abuse outcomes related to pregnancy (e.g., poor physical and mental health and
unhealthy behaviors), highlight the importance of early prenatal screening. Australian, UK,
and US guidelines recommend screening for abuse or trauma, but not all specifically name
child abuse [127]. However, given the identified barriers and challenges of child abuse screen-
ing (e.g., the need for sensitive inquiry), many researchers and clinicians advocate trauma-
informed care for perinatal women [127,128].

The Multi-level Determinants of Perinatal Wellbeing for Child Abuse Survivors model
[129] provides a framework for this care using these principles that engender empowerment,
safety, and trust. All women can have a supportive environment through universal screening,
leading to referral and intervention. Importantly this model includes the needs of both the sur-
vivor and clinician. For example, a child abuse survivor requires a safe and appropriate envi-
ronment to help facilitate disclosure, whereas a clinician needs training, time, and setting
considerations. Therefore, policies around screening need to be based on trauma-informed
principles that address the needs of the clinician, survivor, and environment [127–129].

While identifying women with a history of child abuse is important in affording more sensi-
tive antenatal care, for many women, postpartum care is focused on physical recovery and less
on psychosocial or psychological factors [130]. However, child abuse is also a risk factor for
postpartum outcomes such as poor mental health, child abuse potential, and IPV. However,
there is limited opportunity to identify child abuse and intervention without continuity of care
extending to the postpartum period.

Strengths and limitations of the review

The strength of this review was its comprehensive examination of a wide range of databases and
grey literature. In addition, the double screening of search results and rigorous quality assess-
ment contributed to the accuracy of the data. This search strategy enabled a wide range of evi-
dence to be synthesized, thus contributing to the body of knowledge. Notwithstanding this, the
review was potentially limited by excluding non-English language studies limiting the generaliz-
ability of the findings. Also, the quality assessment was mostly conducted by one rater (due to
budgetary constraints) which is a limitation that should be noted. Furthermore, as detailed
above, many studies reviewed had methodological limitations and used retrospective and self-
report data for child abuse/maltreatment, limiting the ability to draw causal conclusions.

Conclusion

This comprehensive review examined outcomes related to child abuse for perinatal women.
Notwithstanding this, this review demonstrated that maternal child abuse has implications for

perinatal women. Perinatal women may be at higher risk for poorer mental health, difficulties
with childbirth, and the experience of prenatal care and motherhood. For the child, their
mother’s previous history may have implications for their healthy growth and development
and intergenerational implications through the transmission of violence. Identifying women
at risk is the first step in positive interventions, which may best be achieved through care based
on trauma-informed principles.
