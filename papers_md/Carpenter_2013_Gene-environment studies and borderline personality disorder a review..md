Abstract

We review recent gene-environment studies relevant to borderline personality disorder, including
those focusing on impulsivity, emotion sensitivity, suicidal behavior, aggression and anger, and
the borderline personality phenotype itself. Almost all the studies reviewed suffered from a
number of methodological and statistical problems, limiting the conclusions that currently can be
drawn. The best evidence to date supports a gene-environment correlation (rGE) model for
borderline personality traits and a range of adverse life events, indicating that those at risk for
BPD are also at increased risk for exposure to environments that may trigger BPD. We provide
suggestions regarding future research on GxE interaction and rGE effects in borderline
personality.

Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a severe mental disorder characterized by
dysfunction in emotional, interpersonal, and behavioral realms. BPD is present in 1 – 3 % of
the general population and, clinically, is the most commonly diagnosed personality disorder
[1, 2•, 3]. It is commonly comorbid with other disorders, especially other personality
disorders, substance use disorders, and mood disorders [4]. Although an increasing amount

of attention has been paid to the disorder in recent years, its etiology and development
remain largely shrouded in uncertainty. A genetic predisposition seems to play a role, but
the contribution of genetic factors is modest [5, 6], at least when compared to the heritability
of other psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia or bipolar disorder [7].

According to Linehan’s biosocial model [8•], BPD develops in the context of both biological
vulnerabilities and environmental risk factors. Impulsivity and emotion sensitivity are
thought to be the two main products of biological risk, which then interact with the
environment. In particular, individuals who go on to develop BPD are believed to be
exposed to an invalidating familial environment. Linehan [9] associates three broad family
types with increasing the likelihood of developing BPD: chaotic families, in which there is
little time or attention for the child, perfect families, in which there is little tolerance of
displays of negative emotion, and, less commonly, typical families, which may provide a
poor fit for an emotionally sensitive and impulsive child. The result of this interaction, then,
is that a child with a predisposition toward certain behavior develops more and more
extreme patterns of dysfunction in an effort to cope with a difficult and invalidating
environment. An enormous complication in explaining associations such as these is, of
course, that children inherit both their genes and their environment from their parents: a
chaotic family environment may be a marker for a set of genes that was transmitted from
parents to offspring that leads both to chaos in the environment and increased risk of BPD.

As Kendler and Eaves [10] note, there are three major ways that genes and environment can
jointly influence the vulnerability to psychopathology. First, an individual’s liability for a
disorder may be the sum of the contributions of genes and environment (the additive model).
Second, genes and environment may interact, such that genes control the sensitivity to the
environment or, alternatively, one can say the environment controls gene expression (the
gene-environment interaction model; GxE). Third, genes and environment can be correlated
such that genes influence environmental exposure (the gene-environment correlation model;
rGE).

Given the emphasis of the biosocial model on the importance of the interaction of biological
and environmental factors, gene-environment interaction (GxE) studies of BPD would seem
to be particularly pertinent. In this case, models of GxE interactions posit that specific
“susceptibility genes” to borderline personality disorder or major features of BPD may be
expressed under certain environmental conditions or in response to certain adversities. Note
that GxE does not simply reflect that both genes and environment are required for the
expression of a trait or a disorder. An additive model such as the vulnerability threshold
model (Fig. 1), which is often employed in genetic studies, also incorporates genes and
environment, stating that risk of disorder increases with increased environmental exposure,
so that in those who already score high on the vulnerability scale because of genetic reasons
a small environmental insult may lead to disorder.

Since the publication of initial results from the influential Dunedin study [e.g., 11], there
have been hundreds of publications examining the evidence for GxE effects in the
manifestation of a range of psychopathology, with mixed results. There are two general
types of GxE interaction studies: those that examine genetic influences modeled latently
(i.e., examine the aggregate effects of genes rather than any one specific gene; behavior
genetic studies) and those that focus specifically on measured genotypes (i.e., focusing on
one specific gene of interest at a time) [12••]. Both approaches require large sample sizes–
often much larger than those used in current research projects.

The current article reviews the existing literature on gene-environment studies in BPD. This,
however, is still an area of emerging interest and, as such, there are relatively few studies

Impulsivity

available on the topic. Furthermore, as highlighted below, almost all existing studies we
present here suffer from problems that ultimately prohibit any strong conclusions regarding
evidence for GxE effects. As Boomsma and Martin [13] note, often the term GxE is used to
indicate that genes and environment are important, rather than in the true statistical sense
(i.e., demonstrating that different genotypes respond differently to the same environment or
that some genotypes are more sensitive to environmental changes than others). In general,
many studies purporting to find GxE effects on a phenotype are unable to do so definitely
for one or more of the following reasons: (1) the number of participants is much too small to
reliably detect GxE effects (effects which are notoriously small); (2) factors that are
considered “environmental” may actually be under some degree of genetic influence (i.e., a
gene-environment correlation); (3) “environments” are measured retrospectively and
imprecisely; and (4) the inadequate scaling of environments (i.e., how these are quantified)
can lead one to conclude that a GxE effect exists when in fact it does not [14].

As will become apparent, our position is that, to date, there is no empirical evidence yet
supporting a gene-environment interaction (GxE) model of liability to borderline pathology.
To begin, we review the literature of purported GxE interactions in domains relevant to
BPD, focusing especially on domains highlighted by Crowell et al. [8•]: impulsivity and
emotion sensitivity, but also suicidal behavior and anger and aggression. Next, we discuss
the few studies that have focused on a borderline personality phenotype. Following this, we
summarize the limitations of these studies and then make some recommendations for future
work in this area.

There have been several gene-environment studies on impulsivity, primarily focusing on the
DRD4 gene. Sheese et al. [15] and Keltikangas-Järvinen et al. [16] examined the relations
between DRD4 and early childhood environment in the context of increased sensation
seeking and novelty seeking, respectively, in young children. Lahti et al. [17] reported a
significant interaction effect of DRD4 and parental drunkenness on impulsivity. However,
the sample sizes of all these studies were quite small, and larger studies that examined
aggregate genetic effects have been mixed [18, 19].

Two more recent studies reported on purported GxE interactions for impulsivity. Sweitzer et
al. [20] investigated an interaction between socioeconomic status (SES) and presence of the
7-repeat allele of the VNTR polymorphism of DRD4 on delay discounting, a behavioral
measure of impulsivity. Using data from 546 middle-aged community volunteers, they
found that individuals with the 7-repeat allele who were raised in lower SES environments
discounted future rewards more steeply than individuals without the allele, while individuals
with the allele but who were raised in a high SES environment discounted less steeply than
individuals without the allele. Reif et al. [21] examined the interaction between NOS1 ex1f-
VNTR and stressful life events (e.g., poor health, parental alcoholism, suicide attempt) on
impulsivity. NOS1 is a gene that is linked to the serotonergic system and has been
previously found to be associated with impulsivity in animal studies [22]. Additionally,
previous findings linked the presence of homozygous short-short (s/s) genotype with Cluster
B personality disorders [23]. They used data from a longitudinal sample of 435 Estonian
students, collecting multiple measures of impulsivity. Both stressful life events (SLEs) and
an adverse family environment interacted with s/s genotype to lead to increased scores on all
measures of impulsivity. However, it should be recognized that their results were found
primarily for males only. As noted by Patsopoulos et al. [24], in a systematic appraisal of
432 sex-difference claims from 77 studies, findings that pertain to only one sex tend to be
insufficiently documented or spurious. Claims with documented good internal and external
validity are uncommon and rarely based on a priori, clearly defined, and adequately powered
subgroup analyses.

Emotion Sensitivity

Page 4

Fewer gene-environment studies have directly examined emotion sensitivity. However,
several have reported gene-environment interactions predicting increased negative affect
[25, 26], and decreased positive affect [27]. Sugden et al. [28] reported that children with the
s/s genotype of 5-HTTLPR were more likely to develop emotional problems following
bullying. The s-allele of the 5-HTTLPR gene is related to greater amygdala activity (an area
of the brain associated with attention and emotion processing) in response to emotional cues.
Therefore, the authors argued that these findings support the idea of genetic vulnerabilities
that leave emotions more susceptible to environmental influence (i.e., heightened emotional
sensitivity). There have been attempts to examine components of emotion sensitivity
directly, as well. For example, Hayden et al. [29] found that children with the s/s genotype
of 5-HTTLPR were more likely to engage in negative schematic processing following a
negative mood induction. Negative schematic processing was measured by the likelihood of
participants ascribing negative adjectives to themselves. However, their sample included
only 39 participants.

More recently, Gibb et al. [30] investigated the effects of 5-HTTLPR and maternal criticism
on children’s attentional biases toward emotional information. Participants consisted of 74
mother-child pairs. Approximately half of the mothers had a history of major depressive
disorder (n=40). Maternal criticism was operationalized as the level of expressed emotion
criticism during a five minute speech made by the mother about the child. To assess
attentional bias, children participated in a dot-probe task involving facial expression. There
was a significant three-way interaction between child 5HTTLPR gene, maternal criticism,
and facial expression. Children with the s-allele who experienced maternal criticism showed
an attentional avoidance toward angry, but not sad or happy, facial expression.

Related to emotion sensitivity is the concept of distress intolerance, or the inability to
continue goal-directed behavior while experiencing negative affect [31]. Distress intolerance
is linked both theoretically and empirically to BPD [9, 32]. Amstadter et al. [33] examined
the effects of 5-HTTLPR l/s and COMT Val158Met and emotional abuse on distress
intolerance in a sample of 218 adolescents. Distress intolerance was measured by (lack of)
persistence on an aversive behavioral task. They found that both the s-allele of 5-HTTLPR
and the Val allele of COMT predicted poorer performance on the behavioral task. The effect
for 5-HTTLPR was moderated by emotional abuse, such that individuals with the s-allele
and a history of emotional abuse showed more distress intolerance.

Suicidal Behavior

Recurrent suicidal behavior is one of the DSM-IV symptoms for BPD. It is estimated that
one in ten BPD patients completes suicide [34], 60 – 70 % make at least one attempt [35],
and the incidence of suicidal ideation and threats is higher still [36]. There is good evidence
that suicide ideation, suicide attempts, and suicide completion are genetically influenced
[37, 38]. Three recent gene-environment studies have investigated suicidal behavior.

Perroud et al. [39] examined the interaction of childhood physical and sexual abuse and the
BDNF Val66Met polymorphism on 813 suicide attempters. Suicide attempts were
categorized as violent (hanging, use of firearms or knives, throwing oneself under a train,
and jumping from heights) or nonviolent (drug intake and superficial wrist cutting).
Childhood sexual abuse, but not physical abuse or neglect, was associated with violent
suicide attempts in Val/Val individuals. All measures of maltreatment, with the exception of
physical neglect, predicted an increased number of suicide attempts and a younger age of
suicide attempt.

Ben-Efraim et al. [40] investigated an interaction between single nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs) in corticotrophin-releasing hormone receptor-1 (CRHR1), associated with
hypothalmic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis functioning and physical assault, rape, and
cumulative stressful life events (SLE) on suicide attempts. The authors focused on the HPA
axis because of its role in cortisol release as a result of stress and they focused on the
CRHR1 gene in particular because previous studies indicated a relationship between
childhood maltreatment and dexamethasone non-suppression [41, 42], a partial predictor of
suicide attempt [43, 44]. They found that rs4792887 interacted with cumulative SLEs to
predict suicide attempt in males, rs7209436 interacted with physical assault during
childhood or adolescence to predict suicide attempts among females, and rs16940665
interacted with physical assault in adulthood to predict attempted suicide among males.
These latter two SNPs were also associated with increased anger and aggression.

Aggression and Anger

Although BPD is generally associated with negative affect [45], anger is singled out in
particular by DSM-IV, citing ‘inappropriate, intense anger or difficulty controlling anger’ as
a symptom of BPD. Although internalized anger is sufficient to meet this criterion,
individuals with BPD may also engage in aggressive behavior. The area of anger and
aggression has been the topic of a number of gene-environment studies.

Simons et al. [46] found, in a sample of 689 African-Americans, that the l-allele of DRD4
and the s-allele of 5-HTTLPR both increased aggression in the presence of an adverse
environment, but led to decreased aggression in a supportive one. McDermott et al. [47]
found that individuals with the low activity (l-) allele for the monamine oxidase A (MAOA)
gene were more aggressive than those with the high activity (h-) allele when proximally
provoked. However, their sample consisted of only 78 male participants.

Three recent studies have examined aggression and anger expression in psychiatric patients.
Frazzetto et al. [48] examined the interaction of early SLEs and the MAOA gene on adult
violent and aggressive behavior in a combined sample of 235 healthy volunteers and 90
psychiatric outpatients. Thirty-four percent of adults endorsed one or more early SLEs,
although psychiatric outpatients were more likely to be exposed to a traumatic event than
healthy controls. Individuals exposed to early traumatic events were more likely to exhibit
aggression. Kinnally et al. [49] found l-MAOA was a risk factor for antisocial behavior
among women. Female participants, either healthy controls or diagnosed with MDD or
bipolar disorder, (n=159; 12.6 % with a diagnosis of BPD) reported retrospectively on the
presence of early SLEs and on parental bonding with the parent that they spent the most
time with. A three-way interaction was evident such that l-MAOA, low parental care, and
early stress interacted to predict higher impulsivity and aggression scores on self-report
measures.

Using the same sample as Perroud et al. [39] described above, Perroud et al. [50]
investigated nine candidate genes for an interaction with CSA on anger expression in 875
adult suicide attempters. These genes included COMT, TPH1, MAOA, 5-HTR1B, 5-
HTR2A, TPH2, 5-HTR1A, BDNF and 5-HTTLPR. Interaction-level effects were found
only for COMT Val158Met. A three-way interaction between gender, COMT Val158Met,
and CSA was found, such that presence of the Val allele and CSA predicted increased levels
of self-reported anger. There was also a main effect for COMT Val158Met, with presence of
the Val allele predicting higher scores of self-reported anger.

BPD Studies

Page 6

We now turn to the small group of studies that examined gene-environment effects within a
BPD sample or focused on GxE on a borderline personality phenotype [see 51••]. Of the
existing gene-environment studies of BPD, only two treated BPD features as a dependent
variable. The remainder, consisting of a series of studies by Wagner and colleagues, tested
for the presence of an interaction on personality traits relevant to BPD in BPD samples. In
these studies, they tested whether a history of SLEs (i.e., physical maltreatment, rape, and
CSA) interacted with gene polymorphisms believed to be involved in serotonergic (e.g., 5-
HTTPLR ss/sl, BDNF Val66Met) and dopaminergic (e.g., COMT Val158Met) functioning to
produce aggression and/or impulsivity. Wagner et al. [52] tested the interaction of SLEs and
the 5-HTTPLR ss/sl polymorphism on impulsivity as measured by an impulsivity
questionnaire in individuals with BPD. They found that presence of CSA and self-report of
functional impairment by SLEs both predicted lower impulsivity scores. These effects were
specific to ss/sl carriers. Additionally they found that, in ss/sl carriers, physical maltreatment
and number of SLEs predicted lower impulsivity scores. Using the same sample, Wagner et
al. [53] tested an interaction of SLEs and the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism on impulsive
aggression in BPD individuals. Presence of childhood CSA was associated with lower levels
of impulsive aggression and this effect was found to be specific to BDNF Val66Val carriers.

Again using the same sample, Wagner et al. [54] examined the role of SLEs and COMT
Val158Met on BIS scores and found no effect. However, Wagner and colleagues published
another study around the same time reporting significant results relating COMT Val158Met
to impulsive aggression in individuals with BPD [55]. In Val158Val carriers, presence of
CSA and the cumulative number of SLEs were associated with decreased scores of
impulsive aggression. There was also a main effect in the same direction for CSA on
impulsive aggression.

An initial study by Wilson et al. [56] found that polymorphisms in the tryptophan
hydroxylase I (TPH1) gene were significantly associated with a diagnosis of BPD but not
with a history of suicide attempt(s). In a follow-up study, Wilson et al. [57] tested whether
the strength of the association between childhood abuse and BPD was moderated by TPH1
polymorphisms. Specifically, 98 BPD patients and 300 non-BPD patients with either major
depressive disorder or bipolar disorder were genotyped, and childhood abuse was assessed
via direct interview. Results indicated that TPH1 risk allele carriers (A alleles at both loci)
were significantly more likely to be in the BPD diagnostic group. Furthermore, TPH1
polymorphisms significantly moderated the strength of the association between childhood
abuse and BPD status as an adult. These latter results were independent of Axis I status and
a history of suicide attempt(s).

In the only study to date to study the role of gene-environment interactions and gene-
environment correlations (rGE) on the etiology of BPD traits, Distel et al. [51••] analyzed
data from twin and sibling pairs from the Netherlands and Belgium (n=6368). Previously,
this research team demonstrated that the heritability estimates of BPD features were similar
across three countries (approximately 42 % [5]), and relations among the four major
components of BPD (affective instability, identity problems, negative relationships, and self-
harm/impulsivity) were best explained by a common genetic pathway model. This latter
finding indicates that both genetic and environmental factors influence these four major
features through the same mechanism.

In the follow-up study, focusing specifically on gene-environment interactions and gene-
environment correlations in this sample, Distel et al. [51••] analyzed twins’ and non-twin
siblings’ self-reported symptoms of BPD, using the Personality Assessment Inventory-
Borderline Scale (PAI-BOR) [58], and their reported experience of SLEs (i.e., divorce, car

accident, assault, robbery, and job loss). In addition to evaluating evidence for gene-
environment interactions (GxE), the investigators also estimated rGE, or the correlation
between the genetic influence on environmental risk factors and the genetic influence on
BPD traits. To limit the chance of spurious findings, two measures of rGE were used: a
bivariate genetic model and a co-twin control method.

Car accidents and robberies were not significantly moderating factors and were dropped
from the models. Divorce/ break-up, violent assault, and job loss did not moderate the effect
between genetic risk and BPD traits, but did moderate positively the effect of unique
environment. Individuals with a higher number of stressful life events had lower heritability
rates of BPD traits, although this was not significant. Finally, sexual assault was a
significant negative moderator of genetic risk in predicting BPD traits. In fact, when sexual
assault was accounted for, the impact of genes became negligible. Importantly, the authors
also found significant rGE for most of the life events, suggesting that genes that are
responsible for BPD risk increase risk of exposure to stressful life events.

Conclusion

As we discussed at the beginning of this review, GxE studies are often plagued with
methodological and statistical problems and most of the studies we reviewed suffer from
these limitations. The ability to accurately and precisely discover and characterize a non-
spurious GxE interaction effect on the liability to psychopathology is a function of many
research design features. As can be seen in our review, most current studies are based on a
small number of participants and do not include replication samples, may use imprecise
measurements of environment (e.g., single indices based on retrospective self-report), do not
address the possibility of spurious interaction effects due to improper scaling of the
environment and the uncritical use of logistic regression, and do not assess for rGE effects.
As is true in other areas of psychopathology, these design flaws likely conspire such that
replications of any reported GxE interactions for borderline personality or its features will
likely be more the exception than the rule.

So, what can be concluded from our review? At present, it appears that rGEs are especially
relevant to borderline personality. Specifically, evidence suggests significant rGE for
divorce/break-up, violent assault, sexual assault, and job loss and borderline personality
[51••]; the genes influencing borderline features increase the likelihood of being exposed to
these adverse life events. However, it is not possible to determine the direction of causality.
In the Distel et al. [51••] study, there was evidence for GxE effects as well. However, given
the findings of a rGE for these same events, it seems most appropriate to conceptualize this
as evidence for shared genetic influence with these events on borderline personality.

We recommend that future studies of GxE interactions in BPD be guided first by well-
designed, large twin and family studies that assess the aggregate effects of genes. Second, in
order to reliably characterize a GxE interaction effect, it is necessary to use very large
samples. Our review indicates that almost all existing studies in this area of research were
based on very small samples, making replication less likely. Third, it is necessary to also
evaluate rGE effects, and a failure to do so could lead to erroneous conclusions about a GxE
effect [59]. Fourth, there is a great need for improved measures of environmental influences.
Moffitt et al. [60] recommend that measurement of environmental stress or adversity be
prospective, cumulative, and proximal in order to adequately characterize environmental
risk for psychopathology in GxE studies. We would add that investigators must pay
particular attention to how environmental measures are scaled, given the demonstrations that
improper scaling and transformation can lead to false conclusions regarding GxE effects in
many cases [14]. Finally, in GxE studies that include measured genotypes, the genes that

factors for BPD is uncertain. There are no large scale genome wide association (GWA)
studies yet for BPD which can supply genetic variants to be tested in a GxE context. The
next generation of gene-environment studies of BPD should address the limitations of
previous studies, adopt optimal research design strategies to uncover GxE interaction and
address gene-environment correlation effects.

Fig. 1.
A threshold model [61] assumes a normally distributed liability (or vulnerability) underlying
a disorder or an ordered-category trait. The left figure shows a single threshold model with
subjects scoring below the threshold on the, unobserved, liability scale being unaffected and
subjects scoring above the threshold being affected. The right figure shows a model with
multiple thresholds. Individual differences in the liability distribution are a function of
genetic and non-genetic differences between people. Tetrachoric (for binary data) or
polychoric correlations (for ordered-category data) estimate the correlations between family
members on such liability scales. A subject scoring high on the liability scale because of
genetic vulnerability only would need a ‘mild’ environmental insult to cross the threshold
whereas someone scoring low on the liability scale would need to experience a major
environmental insult to cross the threshold
