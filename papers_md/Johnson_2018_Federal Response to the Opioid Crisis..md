Abstract

Purpose of Review—In light of the current crisis in opioid involved overdose deaths, the 
federal Department of Health and Human Services operating divisions are working together to 
implement a data-driven, research-based strategy to reduce opioid misuse and its consequences.

Recent Findings—The strategy has five elements: (1) strengthening public health data 
collection and reporting; (2) advancing the practice of pain management; (3) improving access 
to addiction prevention, treatment, and recovery support services; (4) increasing availability of 
overdose-reversing drugs; and (5) supporting cutting-edge research in treatment of pain, opioid use 
disorder, and associated conditions.

Summary—The Department of Health and Human Services has developed a concerted, 
coordinated evidence-based effort across department divisions to reduce opioid misuse, prevalence 
of opioid use disorder, and reduce deaths due to opioid use.

Introduction

In the USA in 2016, nearly 92 million people reported use of a prescription opioid, 11.5 
million reported misuse, and 2.1 million met the criteria for an opioid use disorder (OUD)

[1••]. That same year, drug overdose fatalities claimed over 64,000 lives and the majority of 
deaths resulted from prescription or illicit opioids [2••].

There are two primary drivers of the current opioid crisis. The rise in opioid prescribing 
that began in the mid-to-late 1990s is first. Providers increased both the volume of opioid 
prescriptions for all indications and prescribed opioids for chronic pain conditions not likely 
to respond to opioid treatment [3•]. The second driver is the healthcare system’s limitations 
in identifying and treating opioid use disorders. Estimates are that only 25% of people that 
meet diagnostic criteria for active OUD received treatment in that year [4].

The increase in opioid use disorder has occurred along with an increase in injection-related 
infections. Hospitalizations for endocarditis and osteomyelitis associated with opioid use 
increased significantly between 2002 and 2012 [5]. Rates of hepatitis C virus (HCV) 
infections have been rising since the mid-2000s [6, 7•]. After two decades of decline, HIV 
diagnoses among persons who inject drugs increased in 2015 [8•], and a local outbreak 
occurred in 2015 in Scott County, Indiana, with over 220 new cases of HIVand over 400 
cases of HCV associated with opioid injection—indicators that many counties throughout 
the nation are at potential risk [9].

HHS Opioid Strategy

In April 2017, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) launched its 
comprehensive Opioid Strategy. The HHS Opioid Strategy aims to:

1.

2.

3.

4.

5.

Strengthen public health data reporting and collection to improve the timeliness 
and specificity of data and to inform a real-time public health response

Advance the practice of pain management to enable access to high-quality, 
evidence-based pain care that reduces the burden of pain while also reducing 
inappropriate use of opioids and related harms

Improve access to addiction prevention, treatment, and recovery support services

Target the availability and distribution of overdose-reversing drugs to ensure 
broad availability of these medications to people likely to experience or respond 
to an overdose

Support cutting-edge research to advance understanding of pain and addiction, 
lead to the development of new prevention interventions and treatments, and 
identify effective public health interventions to reduce opioid-related harms

The following sections describe current efforts to address these strategic aims within 
the federal government with an emphasis on activities supported by HHS headquarters 
and regional offices as well as by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services 
Administration (SAMSHA), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and 
the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA).

Surveillance

Surveillance is the cornerstone to effective public health action—including the opioid crisis. 
Public health surveillance allows practitioners to understand the magnitude and distribution

of overdoses, opioid use disorder, and related infectious disease and to monitor trends over 
time. Data can be used to understand trends in who is affected by opioids, monitor changes 
in use, distribution, methods of use or effects of opioid use, and to identify targets for 
intervention. Refer to Table 1 for a summary of select data sources used to monitor the 
opioid crisis.

The rapid evolution of the opioid crisis leads to a need for more timely data. Therefore, 
provisional counts of opioid-related deaths are being released with a 7-month delay 
compared to the previous lag of 18 months [2••]. Similarly, detailed information about fatal 
and non-fatal overdoses from states—including EMS data—is collected with a 6-month lag 
via CDC’s Enhanced State Opioid Overdose Surveillance (ESOOS) program, and non-fatal 
data is readily displayed via CDC’s syndromic surveillance platform known as ESSENCE 
[10, 11].

Some jurisdictions are seeking real-time data. For example, the Washington/Baltimore High 
Intensity Drug Trafficking Area (HIDTA) developed the OD Map tool building on and 
complementing work from SAMHSA [12, 13]. This smartphone application allows EMS 
providers and law enforcement personnel to flag an overdose and how many doses of 
naloxone were delivered. These data are geo-coded and allow public health and safety 
practitioners to view the data instantly on a map and mobilize a response if a spike occurs in 
a geographic area.

There continues to be a number of information gaps. For example, medical examiners/
coroners reports are missing in about 22% of overdose deaths, limiting the ability to 
examine drug-specific causes in many jurisdictions [14]. For non-fatal overdoses, data on the 
administration of naloxone as well as more detailed toxicological information about specific 
substances detected (opioids and others) in emergency department patients are missing. 
Little is also known about current treatment outcomes and recovery trajectories. Given the 
promise of adapting the continuum of care model (used successfully in HIV treatment) 
to improve opioid treatment, better surveillance of engagement and outcomes is necessary 
[15•].

Advancing the Practice of Pain Management

An estimated 25 million Americans experience daily pain [16].Pain can impact physical and 
mental health, productivity, and ability to engage in social activities. Sixty-three percent of 
people who report misusing pain medication claim that the primary reason is to alleviate 
pain [1••]. Recalibrating the role opioid pain medications play in pain care is a critical part 
of reducing opioid harms and improving the quality of life for patients living with pain. HHS 
activities in this area fall into two categories: (1) achieving a system of care in which all 
people receive appropriate, high quality and evidence-based care for pain and (2) providing 
clinicians and patients with education and tools to improve pain care.

One aspect of this work is to reduce inappropriate opioid prescribing. To this end, CDC 
developed and launched the CDC Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pain, 
for use outside of active cancer, palliative, and end of life care in March 2016 [17]. To 
maximize use of the Guideline, communication and translation tools and resources have

been developed and disseminated. Health systems have been encouraged to adopt the 
Guideline and payers have been identifying ways for policies to be consistent with the 
Guideline.

Many health professional schools have made a voluntary commitment to integrate the 
Guideline into their curricula. So far, more than 60 medical schools have announced they 
will align their existing curricula with recommendations contained in the CDC Guideline. 
Many nursing schools and physician assistant schools have indicated the same. More than 50 
colleges and schools of pharmacy have pledged their commitment to educate their students 
about how to counsel patients and others on appropriate use of naloxone to reverse overdose.

Healthcare systems have the potential to improve pain management, including safer use of 
opioids, through guideline-concordant care on a broad scale. To achieve this, CDC created 
a clinical quality improvement initiative to develop health system processes that facilitate 
adoption of recommendations. For patients for whom the benefits of long-term opioid 
therapy outweigh the risks, the initiative includes a resource to implement structured and 
coordinated care. CDC is updating clinical decision supports to integrate recommendations 
into electronic health records such as alerts for morphine milligram equivalent thresholds, 
defaults on prescribing amounts for initiation of opioids, and prompts to check a state’s 
prescription drug monitoring system. Efforts to reduce inappropriate prescribing may be 
having an effect because while rates of prescription opioid-related death are still high they 
are leveling off [18].

Improve Access to Addiction Prevention Treatment and Recovery Support

Community-Based Prevention—While most states are impacted by the opioid crisis, 
state and community-level differences require a tailored response. Moreover, states regulate 
the health professions, run prescription drug monitoring programs (PDMPs), house 
comprehensive substance use disorder prevention and treatment programs, maintain strong 
connections to local public health departments, administer large public insurance programs 
like Medicaid, and collect surveillance data.

HHS supports community-based prevention initiatives whose activities are customized 
to local needs and include universal, selective, and indicated interventions. Universal 
interventions target all members of a population, selective interventions target people who 
are at high risk, and indicated interventions address precursor behaviors such as reducing use 
for people who use opioids non-medically or obtaining treatment for people who have an 
opioid use disorder or have overdosed.

SAMSHA funds the Strategic Prevention Framework-Partnerships for Success program to 
support state’s primary prevention activities to prevent prescription drug misuse among 
persons aged 12 to 25 years. The program is designed to raise awareness about the 
dangers of sharing medications and works with pharmaceutical and medical communities 
to address the risks of overprescribing to young adults. SAMSHA also collaborates with 
the Office of National Drug Control Strategy (ONDCP) to fund community-based substance 
use prevention coalitions that have diverse representation including youth, parents, local 
businesses, schools, religious organizations, health professionals, and others. One effective

approach being used in communities is the Strengthening Families Program 10–14, which 
has been shown in three population-based randomized trials to prevent the onset of 
prescription opioid misuse [19].

CDC launched the Overdose Prevention in States initiative in September 2016. A total of 45 
states and Washington, D.C. are funded. This program is designed to support evidence-based 
practice through maximizing the use of PDMPs, implementing community, insurer, or health 
system interventions, evaluating whether policy changes are effective, and enhancing the 
quality and timeliness of surveillance data. For its part, SAMSHA is funding states to use 
PDMPs to identify high risk populations, patients, and clinicians for primary prevention 
program targeting.

Another way that HHS is supporting communities is by providing messages and tools to 
help educate the public about the dangers of opioids and their consequences. CDC launched 
a campaign in September 2017 to raise awareness about the risks of prescription opioid use. 
The campaign highlights stories of people in recovery or family members who have lost 
loved ones to opioids. This type of campaign proved cost-effective with regard to tobacco 
use [20]. SAMHSA funding is being used by states to develop media campaigns with two 
purposes. Some states have developed media campaigns aimed at reducing prescription drug 
misuse by adolescents and young adults. Other states have developed media campaigns to 
reduce the stigma of having an opioid use disorder and encourage people to seek treatment.

Syringe service programs are now an allowable cost, under certain circumstances, in block 
grants and some discretionary grants as a way to reduce harms such as transmission of 
infectious disease like HIV and HCV. Syringe services also serve as a central vehicle for 
distributing naloxone, engaging in discussions about addiction treatment, and linking people 
to care.

Strengthening the connection between public health and safety is another prevention aim 
of HHS. HHS is partnering with the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) in a program 
called DEA 360. This initiative includes coordinated law enforcement action, diversion 
control, and community outreach. CDC is also working with 8 HIDTAs in 20 states 
around the heroin response strategy to (1) coordinate data sharing across public health and 
law enforcement; (2) develop and support the implementation of evidence-based practice 
through pilot projects; and (3) strengthen engagement of local communities and promote 
the inclusion of those most affected by the epidemic when designing, planning, and 
implementing activities.

Treatment of Opioid Use Disorder—While medication (methadone, buprenorphine or 
injectable or implantable, extended release naltrexone) has been the standard of care for 
treating OUD [21], estimates for the number of people in medication assisted treatment are 
as low as 10% of those that need it [15•]. HHS treatment efforts target two reasons that 
people do not receive appropriate care. First is inadequate capacity; second is the nature of 
the disease which leads patients to resist care.

Attempts to increase capacity have focused on increasing the number of prescribers who 
are able to prescribe buprenorphine, the number of patients that prescribers are able to 
treat [22•], and the number of opioid treatment programs (OTPs) which are the only 
location where methadone can be dispensed. Regulations were eased to allow prescribing 
of buprenorphine by nurse practitioners and physician assistants in states where they are 
already authorized to prescribe schedule III medications and to allow physicians to treat up 
to 275 patients rather than the 100 patients that was the cap prior to 2016.

A concerted effort involving ONDCP and SAMHSA to recruit physicians in 15 high need 
states led to significant growth in the number of physicians capable of treating OUD 
with medication. However, many physicians treat very few patients. Seventy percent of 
prescribers with waivers are only waivered at the 30 patients limit, and most serve far fewer 
than the number they are allowed to treat [23]. Research indicates that more physicians 
would prescribe if they had better access to psycho-social supports for their patients and 
if they had access to more experienced clinicians for guidance and support [24]. This 
knowledge has led HHS to provide greater post training support via coaching and continuing 
education both in person and using video conferencing technology. It has also led to greater 
use of telehealth to provide counseling, technology-assisted care such as mobile applications 
for recovery support, and greater efforts at integrating SUD treatment with the healthcare 
system by placement of counselors and recovery coaches in primary care, emergency, and 
other healthcare settings.

Several states (e.g., MA, VA, and AL) are investing federal grant dollars in developing 
capacity to provide treatment on demand in geographic areas where overdose rates are high. 
Treatment on demand involves rapid diagnosis, triage, and linkage to medication as well 
as psychosocial supports. Interim methadone and interim buprenorphine, where patients can 
receive medication without psychosocial support for a limited time, are being used in some 
locations so that patients are able to access medication even when psychosocial supports are 
not immediately available [25–27].

To address the issue of patients not seeking treatment, SAMHSA is encouraging states to 
adopt the seek, test, treat, retain (STTR) model that was effective for HIV containment. 
These activities involve peer coaches or other community health workers engaging people 
in emergency departments, in shelters, and in neighborhoods where drug use is prevalent. 
States and programs are being trained in chain-referral outreach to find people via their 
associates who may have entered treatment or been brought to an emergency department for 
an overdose or other drug related crisis and to conduct active outreach, to ensure that they 
have naloxone and access to clean syringes (for people who inject drugs), and to encourage 
people to enter treatment.

The opioid crisis in the USA that emerged over the past 15 years has provided new 
challenges to the public health community. Most notably, increasing overdose deaths 
(especially in the 2000–2010 period) were associated with prescription opioids [28, 29]. 
As a result, it was important to test whether the medical treatment of heroin-related opioid 
use disorder would apply to prescription opioid use disorder too. Weiss and colleagues 
demonstrated that buprenorphine treatment could be effective for prescription opioid use

disorders [30] and that longer-term retention in care was especially important for maximum 
benefit [31–33].

Recovery Support—People with opioid use disorder are availing themselves of recovery 
support services supported with SAMHSA funds. These services may include sober housing, 
peer coaching, employment and education preparation and linkages and a variety of health 
and wellness activities that improve a person’s overall health and well-being. Peer coaches 
are being deployed to hospitals and community settings to engage patients in a dialog about 
reducing risks and accessing treatment for their opioid use disorder [34]. These efforts have 
expanded in 2017 due to funding provided by the CURES Act [35].

Reversing Overdose—Naloxone is an opioid antagonist that can reverse respiratory 
depression associated with opioid overdose. It has been used for many years by healthcare 
providers and emergency medical services and increasingly is being used by non-EMS 
first responders and lay persons to reverse overdose in homes and community settings. 
Educating individuals on overdose prevention, including how to recognize and respond to 
an overdose and how to obtain and administer an opioid overdose reversal medication, is 
critical to the public health response to the opioid crisis. HHS activities in this area focus 
on (1) developing the auto-injector and nasal spray formulations recently approved by the 
U.S. Food and Drug Administration, (2) providing resources for local purchase of naloxone, 
and (3) providing education and tools on how to reverse an overdose. SAMHSA’s Opioid 
Overdose Prevention Toolkit equips local governments and community organizations with 
tools to develop policies and implement practices that are known to prevent opioid-related 
overdose and death. SAMHSA funds states to train first responders and provide naloxone 
kits to first responders and other community members, including people who use opioids 
non-medically. These grants cover expenses for naloxone kit distribution. Grantees are 
required to establish processes for linkage to treatment after overdose reversal.

Research on Reducing Risk and Preventing Infectious Diseases—At the peak 
of the HIV epidemic in the USA, about 25% of new infections were due to injection drug 
use (IDU). Over the subsequent two decades, IDU-associated HIV infections decreased 
dramatically. IDU-associated infection was the transmission category with the largest 
reduction in incidence during this time. At least four major factors led to these changes: 
access to sterile injection equipment through “syringe services programs” and pharmacies, 
education of persons who inject drugs (PWID) about the risk of sharing needles and other 
injection equipment, HIV testing, and antiretroviral therapy, which reduces viral load and 
risk of transmission to partners [36–40].

Key aspects to reducing the spread of HIV among PWID at the height of the HIV epidemic 
in the USA in the 1990s were engaging PWID personally in reducing their highest risk 
behaviors [41, 42, 43••] and connecting them into treatment for their OUD—especially 
medication-assisted treatment (e.g., Montaner 2014). Syringe service programs have been 
shown to decrease HIV and HCV incidence and increase by three times the chance that 
a person will stop using drugs. Injection drug use continues to be a major contributor to 
new cases of HIV globally [44]. In particular, comprehensive community-based programs 
that include syringe service programs; linkage to medication to treat opioid use disorder,

naloxone, and HIV; and viral hepatitis testing and treatment are likely to be particularly 
effective in the mutual goals of preventing overdose deaths, reducing substance use, and 
preventing infectious diseases.

An overarching framework for reducing HIV infection has been the “treatment as 
prevention” approach designed as a full “STTR” model [42, 45]. The components of this 
model include outreach (“seek”), to conduct widespread identification of HIV infection 
(“test”), and treatment of HIV-infected persons with highly active anti-retroviral medications 
(“treat”) over the long haul (“retain”). Ecological evidence has shown the value of treatment 
as prevention in population studies of PWID, especially when combined with medication 
assisted treatment for opioid use disorder as a means to reduce the underlying risk behavior 
[42, 43••]. Testing for HIV and viral hepatitis can be readily implemented in drug treatment 
settings and syringe services programs because it does not require specific risk-reduction 
counseling to be effective in diagnosis [46–48].

There is accumulating evidence that injection of prescription opioids has led to increased 
transmission of HIV and HCV among PWID, especially in rural areas [6, 7•, 9, 49]. Multiple 
federal partners are currently engaged in supporting research to address the opioid crisis 
and reducing adverse outcomes of injection opioid use in rural communities. For example, 
needs assessment grants were funded in October 2016 by NIDA and the Appalachian 
Regional Commission [50] to measure the local epidemiology of opioid injection drug 
use, overdose, and infectious disease consequences (including HIVand HCV) and to assess 
federal, state, and local infrastructure and policy that may facilitate or inhibit program and 
service improvements for remediating these concerns. A second round of grants was funded 
in August 2017 with support from NIDA, the Appalachian Regional Commission, CDC, 
and SAMHSA [51] to develop and test comprehensive, integrated approaches to prevent 
HIV and HCV infection, along with associated comorbidities such as hepatitis B virus 
infection and sexually transmitted diseases, among PWID in rural US communities. Eight 
research sites and a collaborative biospecimen testing center were funded [51]. The goal is 
to accelerate and implement research from these and related studies to address the full range 
of issues related to HIV and other infectious diseases caused by injection drug use in the 
context of the US opioid crisis (as well as injection drug-related behaviors with other drugs). 
Future research includes exploration of the predictors of response to medication assisted 
treatments, including genetic predictors [52].

Nationalizing the Strategy—Implementing the five elements of the HHS Opioid 
Strategy requires collaboration between HHS divisions and multisector stakeholders. HHS 
organizes programs by ten regions across the country. Each region is unique and considers 
demographic and public health variations to prioritize and focus collaborative decision 
making in its implementation of the HHS Opioid Strategy. Local familiarity with the 
issues and stakeholders is made possible by recurring engagements with state officials, 
tribal leaders, community organizations, and advocates who have geographic proximity in 
common.

Meetings, trainings, and community events support the implementation of a local strategy 
that includes the elements of the national strategy but is adapted to address local needs. Task

forces developed to create a cross-system approach to addressing the opioid crisis at a state 
and regional level involve HHS staff from many operating divisions and other departments. 
The aim of regional collaboration is to help stakeholders overcome barriers to improve 
public health, to reduce harm, and to ensure access to quality treatment and recovery support 
services.

A sample of regional activities includes the following:

Hosting state authorities from behavioral health, public health, Medicaid, and 
state managers of opioid grants with national experts on improving access to care

Convening dental schools, the American Dental Education Association, national 
experts, and colleagues from key professional organizations to advance better 
practices for pain management

Convening medical schools, the Addiction Medicine Foundation for Deans and 
Faculty, state behavioral health authorities, and others to advance better practices 
for pain management and to support the development of research on pain and 
addiction

Convening regional state authorities and leaders responsible for syringe services 
and harm reduction programs, SAMHSA, CDC, and the Harm Reduction 
Coalition to improve public health surveillance and access to treatment and 
recovery services

Developing an opioid overdose prevention collaborative for regional stakeholders 
with naloxone, syringe exchange, peer recovery, and pediatric research 
subgroups

Conclusion

In summary, implementing the HHS five-point opioid strategy is a cooperative, coordinated 
effort across HHS divisions, the 10 HHS regional offices and stakeholders from America’s 
communities. Grants for states and organizations supplemented by training and technical 
assistance provide a strong foundation for nationalizing the strategy. The 10 HHS regional 
teams, in partnership with colleagues in government, foundations, associations, and 
academic institutions, foster progress toward implementing the strategy at a local level. 
By identifying emerging state, tribal and local needs, and developing trusting relationships, 
activities are tailored to address unique regional circumstances. Progress toward the HHS 
opioid strategy’s goals is based on data driven decision making, using evidence-based 
prevention, intervention, and treatment programs within a multifaceted, collaborative 
approach.
