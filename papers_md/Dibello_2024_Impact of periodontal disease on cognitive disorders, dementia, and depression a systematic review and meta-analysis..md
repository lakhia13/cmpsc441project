Abstract  A  growing  body  of  research  suggested 
that there was a link between poor periodontal health 
and  systemic  diseases,  particularly  with  the  early 
development  of  cognitive  disorders,  dementia,  and 
depression. This is especially true in cases of changes 
in  diet,  malnutrition,  loss  of  muscular  endurance, 
and  abnormal  systemic  inflammatory  response.  Our 
study  aimed  to  determine  the  extent  of  these  asso-
ciations to better target the multi-level healthy aging

assessment  revealed  moderate  quality  of  evidence 
and risk of bias. Periodontal disease was found to be 
associated with both cognitive disorders (relative risk 
(RR) 1.25, 95% CI 1.11–1.40, in the analysis of cross-
sectional  studies);  cognitive  impairment  (RR  3.01, 
95%  CI  1.52–5.95  for  longitudinal  studies,  cognitive 
decline); and dementia (RR 1.22, 95% CI 1.10–1.36). 
However,  no  significant  increased  risk  of  depression 
among  subjects  with  periodontal  disease  was  found 
(RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.95–1.21). Despite the association 
with  two  of  the  three  explored  outcomes,  the  avail-
able  evidence  on  periodontal  diseases  and  dementia, 
cognitive  disorders,  and  depression  is  controversial 
due  to  several  limitations.  Therefore,  further  investi-
gations involving validated and standardized tools are 
required.

Introduction

Late-life  mental  health  and  neurological  disorders, 
including cognitive impairment, dementia, and depres-
sion, have a high social and economic impact and cause 
substantial  reduction  in  quality  of  life  and  life  expec-
tancy  [1].  Cognitive  impairment  can  be  considered  as 
an  umbrella  term  to  describe  conditions  characterized 
by deterioration of different cognitive domains. Increas-
ing  age  is  the  most  important  factor  associated  with 
cognitive  impairment.  Globally,  the  number  of  people 
suffering  from  dementia  increased  by  117%  between 
1990 and 2016, with more than 55 million people cur-
rently affected and roughly 10 million new cases every 
year [2]. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is an inter-
mediate  condition  with  no  impact  on  independence 
in  activities  of  daily  living  which  may  predispose  to 
future dementia. It has an estimated prevalence ranging 
between 15 and 20% in persons 60 years and older, and 
the annual conversion rate to dementia varies between 
8  and  15%  per  year  [3].  Depression  is  currently  the 
number one cause of disability worldwide, with major 
repercussions  on  the  psychophysical  status  of  the 

population and which may represent itself a potentially 
modifiable  risk  factor  for  dementia  [4,  5].  Given  the 
growing  population  of  older  adults,  these  conditions 
may represent a global threat, and stronger effort should 
be taken on prevention strategies [6].

Chronic inflammation has been proposed as one of 
the  most  important  underlying  factors  for  accelerated 
aging and a common milieu of different mental health 
disorders  [7].  The  long-term  peripheral  overproduc-
tion  of  pro-inflammatory  cytokines  might  determine 
central effects activating cerebral microglia, disrupting 
neurogenesis, and finally leading to negative outcomes 
such  as  cognitive  impairment,  dementia,  and  late-life 
depression.  In  this  regard,  the  presence  of  inflamma-
tory  mediators  in  the  pathogenesis  of  periodontal  dis-
ease (PD) has drawn attention to the systemic impact of 
this  disease  on  general  health  and  its  association  with 
mental  health  disorders  [8,  9].  PD  is  a  chronic  multi-
factorial  inflammatory  disease  characterized  by  the 
progressive  destruction  of  the  supporting  apparatus  of 
the  tooth  caused  by  pathogenic  bacteria  or  biofilm  in 
dental plaque, and responsible for a substantial part of 
edentulism  and  masticatory  dysfunction  with  conse-
quent  impact  on  dental  care  costs  and  general  health 
[10]. PD may contribute to dementia, late-life cognitive 
disorders, and depression in several ways [11]. In fact, 
PD-causing  bacteria  are  transmitted  directly  into  the 
brain [12]; PD may also affect the brain via neural path-
ways [13]; moreover, inflammatory molecules induced 
by PD may affect the blood and brain [14], and, finally, 
tooth loss due to PD and reduced masticatory function 
may affect cognitive function [11].

The available evidence on relationship between PD 
and dementia, late-life cognitive disorders, and depres-
sion  is  still  controversial  due  to  several  limitations, 
such  as  the  different  methods  and  classifications  used 
for the assessment of both PD and cognitive outcomes, 
the consideration of tooth loss as an index of PD even 
when  this  was  not  directly  or  solely  attributable  to  it, 
and  often  the  evaluation  of  mental  health  disorders 
as risk factors for PD, but not the contrary [8, 9]. The 
present  systematic  review  and  meta-analysis  aimed  to 
investigate  in  a  comprehensive  way  the  impact  of  PD 
on dementia, cognitive disorders (cognitive impairment 
and cognitive decline), and depression.

Methods

Search strategy and data extraction

The present systematic review followed the Preferred 
Reporting  Items  for  Systematic  Reviews  and  Meta-
Analyses  (PRISMA)  guidelines,  adhering  to  the 
PRISMA 27-item checklist [15]. An a priori protocol 
was established and registered on PROSPERO, a pro-
spective  international  register  of  systematic  reviews 
(CRD42023485688).  Two  scholars  performed  sepa-
rate  searches  in  the  US  National  Library  of  Medi-
cine  (PubMed),  Medical  Literature  Analysis  and 
Retrieval  System  Online  (MEDLINE),  EMBASE, 
Scopus,  Ovid,  and  Google  Scholar  databases  to  find 
original articles investigating any association between 
the  studied  exposure,  i.e.,  PD  and  the  three  adverse 
health-related  analyzed  outcomes.  The  exposure 
factors  were  selected  to  include  any  indicator(s)  of 
PD,  regardless  of  the  measurement  method  (clinical 
examination  or  self‐reported),  while  the  outcome(s) 
as to include adverse health-related outcomes, namely 
cognitive disorders, dementia, and depression. Search 
strings included a wide range of subject headings and 
synonyms  for  inflammatory  PD  (such  as  periodonti-
tis,  pericoronitis,  periodontal  pocket,  and  gingivitis) 
and adverse health-related outcomes (such as demen-
tia, mild cognitive impairment, cognitive decline, and 
depressive  disorder).  Full  details  of  the  search  strat-
egy  used  in  PubMed  and  MEDLINE  and  adapted  to 
the other four electronic sources is shown in Supple-
mentary  Table  S1.  The  literature  search  covers  the 
timeframe  from  the  database  inception  to  November 
22,  2023.  No  language  limitation  was  introduced. 
Two  investigators  (VD,  CC)  searched  for  papers, 
screened titles, and abstracts of the retrieved articles 
separately  and  in  duplicate,  checked  the  complete 
texts, and selected records for inclusion.

The  following  information  was  extracted  by  the 
two  investigators  (VD,  CC,  or  FP)  separately  and  in 
duplicate  in  a  piloted  form:  (1)  general  information 
of  single  studies  (author,  year  of  publication,  coun-
try,  settings,  design,  sample  size,  age);  (2)  PD  tools 
and  classifications;  (3)  arbitrarily  selected  cognitive 
and  mental  adverse  outcomes  (dementia,  cognitive 
impairment/decline,  and  depression);  and  (4)  tools 
used  by  examiners  for  the  assessment  and  diagnosis 
of cognitive outcomes. For further information (miss-
ing  or  incomplete  data)  or  to  request  unavailable 

articles,  the  primary  authors  were  contacted.  Data 
were  cross-checked,  any  discrepancies  were  dis-
cussed,  and  disagreements  were  resolved  by  a  third 
investigator (VS). Lastly, data extracted from selected 
studies were structured in tables of evidence.

Selection criteria

PECO  (Population,  Exposure,  Control,  and  Out-
come)  statement  was  used  for  defining  the  inclusion 
criteria  (for  cross-sectional  studies,  there  is  no  dif-
ference between exposure and outcome): (a) popula-
tion,  adults  (over  18  years  old);  (b)  exposure,  every 
indicator  of  clinical  PD  parameters  (clinical  attach-
ment  level,  probing  depth,  and  bleeding  on  probing) 
measured at least once in the study, regardless of the 
form of measurement (clinical or radiographic exam, 
self-reported); (c) control, control group subjects who 
do  not  meet  the  diagnostic  criteria  of  PD  (including 
studies evaluating tooth loss or edentulism as indica-
tors  of  periodontitis,  unless  specifically  documented 
otherwise);  (d)  outcome,  no  skimming  was  applied 
to assessment methods used to evaluate the three out-
comes,  i.e.,  dementia(s),  cognitive  impairment,  and 
depression; (e) study design, studies (including case-
control, cohort, and cross-sectional studies) providing 
quantitative measures of the association between PD 
and adverse health-related outcomes, without regards 
to the country where they were conducted. Exclusion 
criteria are the following: (a) exposure, no diagnosis 
of PD or inadequate or not directly related criteria for 
its assessment; (b) control, absence of healthy control 
patients; (c) outcome, no diagnosis of any of the three 
outcomes;  (d)  study  design,  studies  on  non-human 
subjects, individuals under 18 years of age, interven-
tion studies; (e) article type, technical reports, letters 
to  the  editor,  case  reports,  case  series,  meta-analy-
sis,  systematic,  and  narrative  review  articles  were 
excluded.

Quality assessment within and across studies and 
overall quality assessment

The  methodological  quality  of  included  studies  was 
independently  appraised  by  paired 
investigators 
(VD and CC or FP), using the National Institutes of 
Health  Quality  Assessment  Toolkits  for  Observa-
tional  Cohort  and  Cross-Sectional  Studies  [16].  The 
ratings  high  (good),  moderate  (fair),  or  poor  were

assigned to studies according to the criteria stated in 
the toolkit. This tool contains 14 questions that assess 
several  aspects  associated  with  the  risk  of  bias,  type 
I  and  type  II  errors,  transparency,  and  confounding 
factors, i.e., study question, population, participation 
rate, inclusion criteria, sample size justification, time 
of  measurement  of  exposure/outcomes,  time  frame, 
levels  of  the  exposure,  defined  exposure,  blinded 
assessors,  repeated  exposure,  defined  outcomes, 
loss  to  follow-up,  and  confounding  factors.  Items  6, 
7, and 13 do not refer to cross-sectional studies, and 
the maximum possible scores for cross-sectional and 
prospective studies were 8 and 14, respectively. Disa-
greements  regarding  the  methodological  quality  of 
the included studies were resolved through discussion 
until a consensus was reached, or resolved by a fourth 
investigator  (VS).  A  modified  version  of  the  Grad-
ing  of  Recommendations  Assessment,  Development 
and  Evaluation (GRADE) rating system was  used to 
assess  the  overall  quality  of  evidence  of  the  studies 
included  in  the  present  systematic  review  [17].  The 
following  factors  were  considered:  the  strength  of 
association  for  PD  and  adverse  health-related  out-
comes,  methodological  quality/design  of  the  studies, 
consistency, directedness, precision, size, and (where 
possible)  dose-response  gradient  of  the  estimates  of 
effects across the evidence base. Evidence was graded 
as  very  low,  low,  moderate,  and  high,  similar  to  a 
GRADE rating system.

Statistical methods and data synthesis

We extracted the number of events and total number 
of participants among subjects with and without PD. 
When  not  available,  we  converted  odds  ratios  (ORs) 
or  hazard  ratios  (HRs)  to  relative  risks  (RRs)  using 
established  approaches  [18].  In  particular,  Vander-
Weele  demonstrated  that  the  optimal  approximate 
conversion  of  OR  to  RR  is  its  square-root  transfor-
mation, assuming that the prevalence of the outcome 
among  the  unexposed  lays  in  a  normally  distributed 
interval between 0.2 and 0.8. Dividing and multiply-
ing,  by  1.25,  the  square-root  transformation  of  the 
OR lower and upper limits, we can obtain RR confi-
dence interval [18]. For the conversion of HR to RR, 
we applied a respective formula proposed by Vander-
Weele  [18].  We  pooled  estimates  when  at  least  two 
studies  reported  harmonizable  results  on  the  same 
outcome.  Due  to  the  heterogeneous  definitions  and 

measurement  methods  of  periodontal  disease,  we 
used  random-effects  meta-analyses  with  the  inverse 
variance  method  to  pool  RRs  (95%  CI).  Between-
study  heterogeneity  was  estimated  with  I2.  If  het-
erogeneity was found to be significant (p < 0.05, I2 ≥ 
50%),  we  conducted  sensitivity  and  subgroup  analy-
ses.  In  sensitivity  analyses,  we  removed  outliers  and 
poor-quality  studies.  Subgroup  analyses  were  per-
formed  based  on  study  design.  We  did  meta-regres-
sion analyses to explore how mean age and follow-up 
time might modify the associations found in the main 
analysis.  We  assessed  reporting  bias  using  Egger’s 
test  for  funnel  plot  asymmetry  and  corrected  the 
pooled  effect  estimates  from  the  main  analysis  and 
sensitivity  analysis  using  the  trim  and  fill  approach 
to account for potential reporting bias. We used Stata 
Version  16.0  (Stata  Corp)  and  RevMan  5.4  software 
(Cochrane  Collaboration  Review  Manager),  for  all 
statistical analyses.

Results

The  preliminary  systematic  search  of  the  literature 
yielded 7363 records. After excluding duplicates, and 
not  relevant  articles  only  739  met  the  inclusion  cri-
teria and were included in the final qualitative analy-
sis.  The  Preferred  Reporting  Items  for  Systematic 
Reviews  and  Meta‐analyses  (PRISMA)  flow  chart 
illustrating the number of studies at each stage of the 
review was shown in Fig. 1. The endpoint of the liter-
ary skimming process resulted in 46 eligible articles 
which  were  included  in  the  final  qualitative  analysis 
(Table 1) [19–64]. Figure 2 shows the percentage rep-
resentation  of  each  of  the  three  outcomes  (cognitive 
disorders,  dementia,  and  depression)  associated  with 
PD based on the selected studies.

Details  of  the  design  (cohort  or  cross-sectional), 
sample size (N), and sex ratio (%), minimum age and 
mean  (standard  deviation,  SD),  setting  (community, 
hospital, home care), and country of individual stud-
ies  are  shown  in  Table  1.  Given  the  mixed  shape  of 
the recruitment settings for one of the selected stud-
ies (1 out of the 46), the distribution resulted as fol-
lows: 89.3% (N= 42) community, 10.7% (N= 5) hos-
pital, while no study recognized nursing homes/home 
care as a setting. The Asian (36.9%, N= 17) continent 
led  the  geographical  distribution  of  selected  studies, 
followed by Europe (30.5%, N= 14), North America

(26.08%,  N=  12),  and  South  America  (6.52%,  N= 
3).  This  latter  perspective  pointed  to  both  the  lack 
of  homogeneity  in  geographical  distribution  and  the 
inadequate  representativeness  of  all  countries.  Mean 
(SD)  age  and  sex  ratio  of  study  participants  were 
recorded  if  applicable.  In  the  totality  of  3,220,345 
subjects,  females  accounted  for  the  majority  (about 
55.2% vs 44.8%). Cross-sectional design (47.8%, N= 
22)  dominated  the  prospective  cohort  (23.9%,  N= 
11), the retrospective cohort one (15.2%, N= 7), and 
the case-control (13.1%, N= 6).

Diagnostic criteria for periodontal disease, 
assessment tools, and their distribution across studies

Several  diagnostic  criteria  and  classifications  for  PD 
were used in the selected studies (Table 1). The most 
commonly used classification was the Centre for Dis-
ease  Control/American  Academy  of  Periodontology 

case  definitions,  found  in  11  studies  [36, 37,  46,  49, 
51,  58–61,  63,  64],  followed  by  the  International 
Classification  of  Diseases,  Tenth  Revision  [48,  56, 
57,  62]  and  the  International  Classification  of  Dis-
eases, Ninth Revision [35, 39–41], each used in four 
studies. Less frequently used classification criteria for 
PD  were  the  National  Institute  of  Dental  and  Crani-
ofacial Research epidemiological criteria, adopted in 
two studies [19, 23] and the Community Periodontal 
Index also found in two studies [28, 30]. Finally, rep-
resented  only  once  each,  other  classification  criteria 
were  identified:  established  periodontitis  by  Machtei 
et al. criteria [20], the periodontal risk assessment by 
Lang and Tonetti [21], the Healthy People 2010 defi-
nition  [31],  the  European  Workshop  in  Periodontol-
ogy Group C definition [46], and the Swedish Quality 
Registry for Caries and Periodontal Diseases [55].

Many studies did not provide one or more specific 
and validated classification criteria, but used clinical

parameters  for  the  assessment  of  PD,  such  as  prob-
ing depth, clinical attachment level, and bleeding on 
probing,  with  arbitrary  cut-off  values  [22,  24,  26, 
27,  29,  32–34,  42–45,  52,  53].  Radiographic  alveo-
lar  bone  loss  as  an  identifying  criterion  for  PD  was 
examined  in  two  studies  [19,  38],  while  two  other 
studies  used  laboratory  data,  respectively  serum 
Porphyromonas  gingivalis  (P.  gingivalis)  IgG  [25] 
and  serum  immunoglobulin  G  titers  against  19  peri-
odontal bacteria [50], to capture evidence of systemic 
exposure  to  common  PD-causing  pathogenic  bacte-
rium  with  well  described  pathogenicity.  Finally,  one 
study used a questionnaire for a self-reported assess-
ment of PD [47].

Assessment tools for adverse health-related outcomes 
and their distribution across studies

The  percentage  distribution  of  the  different  investi-
gated outcomes is shown in Fig. 2. Given the multi-
plicity  of  adverse  health-related  events  observed  in 
two of the 46 selected studies, a total of 48 outcomes 
were recorded as denominators when calculating the 
representativeness of each adverse health-related out-
come.  More  specifically,  both  studies  were  found  to 
evaluate cognitive impairment and dementia [45, 61]. 
Overall, cognitive impairment (43.8%, N= 21 out of 
48)  was  found  to  be  the  most  represented  outcome, 
followed by dementia (29.2%, N= 14 out of 48) and 
depression (27.1%, N= 13 out of 48).

Regarding the different types of assessment tools, 
several  studies  used  two  or  even  more  instruments 
to  assess  the  respective  outcome(s)  (Table  1).  For 
the  outcome  cognitive  impairment,  the  Mini-Men-
tal  State  Examination  was  most  frequently  adopted 
(32.5%,  N=  12)  [27,  33,  36–38,  42,  44,  46,  52,  54, 
60,  61],  followed  by  the  Digit  Symbol  Substitution 
Test  (10.5%,  N=  4)  [23,  30,  59,  63].  Less  repre-
sented  was  the  animal  fluency  test  (5%,  N=  2)  [59, 
63].  Finally,  each  of  the  following  assessment  tools 
was  used  only  once  (2.6%,  N=  1,  each):  the  Serial 
Digit  Learning  Test  and  the  Story  Recall  Test  [23]; 
the  Immediate  and  delayed  logical  verbal  memory 
test, the three word registration/memory task, and the 
five serial subtractions by intervals of three [25]; the 
spatial copying task [27]; the digit span test, the pic-
ture  completion  test,  and  the  block  design  test  [30]; 
the  Spanish  Society  of  Neurology  Behavioral  and 
Dementia  Study  Group  criteria  [32];  the  Hasegawa

the  Neurobehavioral  Evaluation  System  2  [49];  the 
National  Institute  of  Aging–Alzheimer’s  Associa-
tion work group criteria [58]; the Word Learning and 
recall  modules  from  the  Consortium  to  Establish 
a  Registry  for  Alzheimer’s  disease  and  the  global

Examination  [60];  the  Montreal  Cognitive  Assess-
ment [61]; and the Consortium to Establish a Registry 
for Alzheimer’s Disease Word Learning subtest [63].

For the 14 studies focusing on dementia, the most 
used  assessment  tools  were  the  International  Classi-
fication of Diseases, Ninth Revision [39–41, 50] and 
the  International  Classification  of  Diseases,  Tenth 
Revision [48, 55, 56, 62] (22%, N= 4 each), followed 
by  Mini-Mental  State  Examination  [53,  61],  and  the 
National  Institute  of  Aging–Alzheimer’s  Associa-
tion work group criteria [45, 50] (11.5%, N= 2 each). 
Finally,  each  used  in  a  single  study,  the  following 

assessment  tools  were  identified  for  the  diagnosis  of 
dementia  (5.5%,  N=  1  each):  the  National  Institute 
of  Neurological  and  Communication  Disorders  and 
Stroke⁄Alzheimer’s  Disease  and  Related  Disorders 
Association  criteria  and  the  Hachinski  score  [28]; 
DSM-IV  criteria  and  McKeith’s  consensus  criteria 
[29];  the  Montreal  Cognitive  Assessment  [61];  and 
the Clinical Dementia Rating [53].

For  the  assessment  of  depression,  the  most  fre-
quently used tool was the Beck Depression Inventory 
(20%,  N=  3)  [20,  22,  34],  followed  by  the  Geriatric 
Depression Scale [19, 57], and the Zung Self-Rating 
Depression  Scale  [21,  26]  (13.2%,  N=  2  each).  The 
least  used  tools  (6.7%,  N=  1  each),  each  adopted  in 
a single study, were the Self-Report Screening Ques-
tionnaire-20  [20];  the  Hamilton  Depression  Scale 
[21];  the  Center  for  Epidemiologic  Studies  Depres-
sion  Scale  [24];  the  World  Health  Organization 
Composite  International  Diagnostic  Interview,  auto 
version  2.1  [31];  the  International  Classification  of

Risk of bias across studies and overall quality of 
evidence for adverse age-related outcomes associated 
to periodontal disease

Examining  all  the  46  included  studies,  we  found  a 
moderate  (n  =  8)  to  high  (n  =  38)  methodological 
quality  (Table  1).  An  overview  of  quality  ratings 
within  (panel  A)  and  across  studies  (panel  B)  was 
provided  in  Fig.  3,  highlighting  areas  with  higher 
or  lower  risk  ratings.  Bias  was  detected  predomi-
nantly in the domain of blinded assessors (detection 
bias)  (46/46  studies,  100%  of  studies  with  a  higher 
risk of bias) and sample size justification (selection 
bias)  (39/46  studies,  85%  of  studies  with  a  higher 
risk  of  bias)  and,  to  a  lower  extent,  in  the  domains 
of  participation  rate  (16/46  studies,  35%  of  studies 
with a higher risk of bias), multiple exposure (8/46 
studies,  17%  of  studies  with  a  higher  risk  of  bias), 
and confounding (6/46 studies, 13% of studies with 
a higher risk of bias) (Fig. 3, panels a–B). Using the 
GRADE approach, the overall quality of evidence of 
the three adverse cognitive and depressive outcomes 
associated to PD was judge moderate for each of the 
three  categories,  i.e.,  cognitive  disorders  (cognitive 
impairment and cognitive decline) (n= 21), demen-
tia  (n=  14),  and  depression  (n=  13);  this  is  mainly 
due  to  the  large  participation  of  subjects  examined 
in  the  various  studies  and  the  discrete  number  of 
studies conducted for each of the assessed outcomes 
(Table 2).

Meta-analysis results

Periodontal disease and cognitive disorders

Ten  cross-sectional  studies,  with  an  overall  popu-
lation  of  10,952  subjects,  showed  a  significant 
association between PD and cognitive impairment 
(RR  1.25,  95%  CI  1.11  to  1.40)  with  low  hetero-
geneity  between  the  studies  (I2=  20%,  p=  0.12) 
(Fig.  4A),  but  evidence  of  small  study  effect  at 
Egger’s  test  (p=0.01)  and  asymmetry  at  funnel 
plot (Fig. S1A). The trim-and-fill analysis reported 

that  three  hypothetical  studies  were  estimated  to 
be missing, when imputed and added to the meta-
analysis  the  overall  risk  of  cognitive  impairment 
associated  with  the  presence  of  PD  was  slightly 
reduced, but still significantly high (RR 1.19, 95% 
CI 1.06 to 1.34).

Six  prospective  studies,  with  an  overall  popu-
lation  of  1123  subjects,  explored  the  association 
between PD and risk of cognitive decline during a 
mean  follow-up  of  3.5  years  (range:  0.5–6  years). 
PD  was  associated  to  higher  risk  of  cognitive 
decline  (RR  3.01,  95%  CI  1.52  to  5.95)  with  sig-
nificant heterogeneity across the studies (I2= 84%, 
p< 0.001) (Fig. 4B), but no evidence of small study 
effect at Egger’s test (p=0.898), neither asymmetry 
at  funnel  plot  (Fig.  S1B).  Adjusting  the  model  for 
mean  age  at  the  inclusion  and  the  duration  of  fol-
low-up,  the  remaining  between-study  residual  het-
erogeneity is roughly 60%. We found that there is a 
significant negative relationship between estimated 
effect  size  and  age  of  the  population  (z=  −2.41, 
p=0.016) (Fig. S2).

Periodontal disease and dementia

Eight studies with an overall population of 3,076,684 
subjects,  free  of  dementia  at  baseline,  explored  the 
association between PD and risk of incident dementia 
during a mean follow-up of 11 years (range 6.6–18.4 
years).  PD  was  associated  to  higher  risk  of  incident 
dementia  (RR  1.22,  95%  CI  1.10  to  1.36)  with  sig-
nificant heterogeneity across the studies (I2= 95%, p< 
0.001) (Fig. 4C), but no evidence of small study effect 
at Egger’s test (p=0.473) (Fig. S1C). Results did not 
significantly  change  in  a  subgroup  analysis  by  study 
design,  neither  adjusting  the  model  for  mean  age  at 
the  inclusion  and  the  duration  of  follow-up,  but  het-
erogeneity reduced among the three prospective stud-
ies  (I2=  60%,  p=  0.08)  (Fig.  4D).  The  trim-and-fill 
analysis  reported  that  two  hypothetical  studies  were 
estimated to be missing. When these two studies were 
imputed  and  added  to  the  meta-analysis,  the  overall 
risk of dementia associated with the presence of PD 
further  increased  (RR  1.29,  95%  CI  1.16  to  1.43). 
One  cross-sectional  study  carried  out  among  102 
subjects (43 with PD) showed significant association 
between periodontal disease and Alzheimer’s disease 
(AD) (RR 2.92, 95% CI 1.87 to 4.55) [53].

Periodontal disease and depression

Five  studies,  with  an  overall  population  of  29,266 
subjects,  explored  the  association  between  PD  and 
depression. Any significant increased risk of depres-
sion was observed among subjects with PD (RR 1.07, 
95%  CI  0.95  to  1.21)  with  significant  heterogeneity 

between  the  studies  (I2=  74%,  p=  0.004)  (Fig.  4E), 
but  no  evidence  of  small  study  effect  at  Egger’s  test 
(p=0.944). Mean age difference did not explain such 
heterogeneity at meta-regression analysis. In a sensi-
tivity  analysis,  we  removed  the  study  by  Kurushima 
et al., which had poorer quality and determined asym-
metry  at  funnel  plot  (Fig.  S1D),  and  the  results  did

not change (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.10), but het-
erogeneity was reduced (I2= 43%, p= 0.16). A single 
retrospective study, with 11 years of follow-up includ-
ing 63,540 subjects (> 20 years old), found a signifi-
cant association between periodontal disease and risk 
of incident depression (HR 1.73, 95% CI 1.58–1.89) 
[35].

Discussion

In  the  present  systematic  review  and  meta-analysis, 
we analyzed studies investigating the impact of PD on 
cognitive  disorders  (cognitive  impairment  and  cog-
nitive  decline),  dementia,  and  depression.  Overall, 
cognitive  disorders  were  the  most  common  outcome 
related to PD (43.8%), followed by dementia (29.2%), 
and depression (27.1%). We found that PD was asso-
ciated with a significantly increased risk of cognitive 
impairment  of  25%  in  cross-sectional  studies  and  a 
higher  risk  of  cognitive  decline  up  to  threefold  dur-
ing a mean follow-up of 3.5 years. Furthermore, PD 
was  significantly  associated  with  22%  higher  risk 
of  incident  dementia  during  a  mean  follow-up  of  11 
years.  However,  we  found  no  significant  association 
between PD and depression.

A  number  of  systematic  reviews  and  meta-
analyses  have  already  examined  the  association  of 
PD  with  cognitive  and  depressive  disorders  [8,  9, 
65–77],  although  none  of  these  studies  investigated 
all the outcomes. For cognitive disorders, in the pre-
sent study, we found that PD was associated to both 

cognitive  impairment  and  cognitive  decline,  with  a 
low  heterogeneity  in  the  first  case  (I2=  20%),  and  a 
significant  one  in  the  second  (I2=  84%)  even  when 
adjusting  the  model  for  mean  age  at  inclusion  and 
duration  of  follow-up  (I2=  60%).  A  recent  system-
atic  review  also  found  that  patients  with  chronic  PD 
with at least 8 years of exposure were at higher risk 
of  developing  cognitive  decline  and  dementia  [76]. 
Another  meta-analysis  on  eight  studies  showed  that 
subjects with PD had higher risk of MCI, especially 
those with severe PD [72].

For  dementia,  in  the  present  study,  we  found 
that PD was associated with increased risk of inci-
dent  dementia,  without  examining  dementia  sub-
types, i.e., AD or vascular dementia, and there was 
a  remarkable  heterogeneity  across  the  studies  (I2= 
95%). A previous systematic review including neu-
rodegenerative  disease  (Parkinson’s  disease  and 
AD) as the outcome, suggested that all the included 
studies  reported  an  association  between  neurode-
generative  diseases  and  PD,  although  the  level  of 
evidence  was  assessed  as  very  low  [70].  Further-
more, previous meta-analyses have confirmed a sig-
nificant association between poor periodontal health 
and  the  incidence  of  dementia;  however,  studies 
with  a  follow-up  period  of  at  least  10  years  have 
suggested that this association may be explained by 
reverse causality [9, 77]. In other words, poor peri-
odontal health may not necessarily cause dementia, 
but rather results from it. This finding was reported 
by  Asher  and  colleagues,  and  sheds  light  on  the 
potential limitations of previous studies [9].

However,  some  systematic  reviews  and  meta-
analyses  including  a  few  longitudinal  studies  indi-
cated that exposure to PD was not related to the risk 
of  incident  AD  [66,  72].  It  is  possible  that  the  par-
tially  conflicting  results  regarding  the  link  between 
PD  and  AD  are  due  to  variations  in  the  number  of 
studies  included.  Additionally,  observational  studies 
examining this relationship often had a high level of 
heterogeneity  and  may  be  affected  by  confounding 
factors. In fact, a recent meta-analysis suggested that 
confounding  factors  were  not  adequately  considered 
in over 50% of the articles that investigating this con-
nection [75].

For  depression,  in  the  present  meta-analysis  of 
cross-sectional  studies,  we  found  that  PD  was  not 
associated  with  an  increased  risk  of  depression.  The 
present high heterogeneity could not be explained by 
population  age,  but  probably  related  to  difference  in 
residual  confounders  as  assessment  tools  for  depres-
sion and onset of depressive disorders (young adults 
vs.  late-life).  Previous  studies  have  mainly  explored 
the  inverse  relationship,  showing  conflicting  results 
on PD risk between subjects with or without depres-
sion, but confirming a great heterogeneity among the 
studies [8, 69]. Moreover, a recent systematic review 
provided  a  novel  perspective  to  evaluate  the  impact 
of  stress-related  disorders  on  the  progression  of  PD, 
examining the growing body of evidence of stress as 
a risk indicator for PD progression and assessing the 
presence  of  biomarkers  [68].  According  to  this  sys-
tematic review, the use of salivary pro-inflammatory 
cytokines alone was found to be inadequate for identi-
fying the severity or progression of PD, with or with-
out  the  presence  of  stress-related  diseases.  However, 
this  study  did  observe  a  positive  qualitative  correla-
tion in the selected study between stress-related bio-
markers and the severity of PD [68].

The  mechanisms  underlying  the  possible  asso-
ciations  between  PD  and  different  cognitive  and 
depressive disorders are, at present, not fully under-
stood.  The  association  of  PD  with  cognitive  disor-
ders/dementia  may  be  explained  by  neuropathol-
ogy and the biological mechanism triggered by PD. 
In  fact,  this  disorder  can  challenge  the  brain  with 
intact  bacteria  and  inflammatory  mediators  due  to 
daily,  transient  bacteremias,  and  chronic  periodon-
titis of 10 years’ duration was reported to double the 
risk  of  AD  [39].  Studies  have  shown  that  the  bac-
teria  involved  in  periodontal  disease  can  enter  the 

bloodstream and travel to the brain [12, 78], trigger-
ing an immune response that may contribute to the 
development  of  dementia.  The  best-known  bacte-
rial  species  comprise  the  so-called  “red  complex,” 
P.  gingivalis,  Tannerella  forsythia,  and  Treponema 
denticola,  which  are  associated  with  diseased  sites 
in the mice [79,  80]. Periodontal diseases may also 
affect  the  brain  via  neural  pathways  [13];  moreo-
ver,  inflammatory  molecules  induced  by  periodon-
tal  diseases  may  affect  the  blood  and  brain  [14], 
and,  finally,  tooth  loss  due  to  periodontal  diseases 
and reduced masticatory function may affect cogni-
tive  function  [11].  Furthermore,  chronic  inflamma-
tion  caused  by  periodontal  disease  has  been  linked 
to  the  formation  of  amyloid-β  plaques  in  the  brain 
[81], which are a hallmark of AD. A recent system-
atic review of only preclinical studies exploring the 
biological  links  between  periodontal  disease  and 
AD pathology suggested that oral or systemic expo-
sure  to  periodontopathogens  or  their  byproducts 
may be responsible for both in situ brain manifesta-
tions  and  systemic  effects  contributing  to  neuroin-
flammation,  amyloidosis,  and  tau  phosphorylation, 
leading  to  brain  damage  and  subsequent  cognitive 
impairment [82]. In addition to the direct biological 
mechanisms, PD has also been associated with risk 
factors for dementia, such as cardiovascular disease 
and diabetes. Poor oral health can exacerbate these 
conditions,  further  increasing  the  risk  of  cognitive 
decline and dementia. Finally, also gender and soci-
oeconomic status can be common risk factors asso-
ciated with both dementia and PD and can underlie 
and partially explain the associations between these 
two conditions [77, 83]. In fact, people with a lower 
socioeconomic status and those with a poor educa-
tion level and women [83, 84] have poorer cognitive 
functioning in later life [85]. At the same time, the 
prevalence and risk estimates of cognitive disorders 
in association with PD can be influenced by gender 
[77].  Low  socioeconomic  status  also  leaded  to  the 
adoption  of  unhealthy  behaviors,  such  as  smoking 
and drinking [83,  86], and these lifestyle behaviors 
increased PD manifestation [83, 87].

For the links between PD and depression, chronic 
stress  and  depressive  symptoms  have  been  hypothe-
sized  to  reduce  immune  responsiveness,  resulting  in 
a higher rate of infection with pathogenic organisms 
and  a  greater  degree  of  periodontal  tissue  destruc-
tion [8]. In general, the evidence was consistent with

the  hypothesis  that  stress  in  patients  susceptible  to 
PD can modify the host immune defense and permit 
the  progression  of  periodontal  infections  [88].  How-
ever,  substantial  evidence  also  indicated  that  these 

conditions  can  mediate  risk  for  disease,  including 
PD,  through  changes  in  health-related  behaviors, 
such  as  oral  hygiene,  smoking,  and  diet  [89,  90].

depression, but whether biomarkers may mediate the 
associations  between  PD  and  major  depression,  was 
unclear [91].

The  present  article  covered  the  whole  spectrum 
of  cognitive  deterioration  including  depression  and 
excluding  from  the  definition  of  PD  the  tooth  loss 
that  may  be  related  to  reasons  other  than  PD.  We 
must  also  acknowledge  some  limitations.  Statisti-
cal  heterogeneity  may  be  a  consequence  of  clinical 
heterogeneity,  considering  how  a  variety  of  clinical 
and classification criteria have been used in the vari-
ous studies in the evaluation of PD. For example, the 
cut-off  levels  adopted  for  clinical  attachment  level, 
probing  depth,  and  bleeding  on  probing  were  often 
arbitrary. In the same way, numerous tests, tools, and 

classifications  were  used  for  the  assessment  of  the 
three explored outcomes. Furthermore, only a single 
longitudinal  study  with  retrospective  design  and  not 
exploring  specifically  late-life  depression  was  found 
on  the  association  between  PD  and  incident  depres-
sion.  Therefore,  further  studies  are  needed  to  verify 
the  potential  impact  of  PD  on  late-life  depression. 
Finally,  we  did  not  have  subgroup  analyses  taking 
into account PD-causing pathogens or including only 
older subjects, given that some of the selected studies 
had a broader age range.

In  conclusion,  the  present  systematic  review  and 
meta-analysis  suggested  a  significant  association 
between  PD  and  cognitive  impairment  and  decline. 
Furthermore,  PD  was  significantly  associated  with

a  higher  risk  of  incident  dementia.  Conversely,  evi-
dence on the relationship between PD and depression 
was  still  inconclusive.  Future  studies  should  utilize 
bias-reducing  selection  methods,  i.e.,  inverse  prob-
ability weighting and random sampling, of large and 
representative  study  populations  with  validated  PD 
assessment tools and more specific criteria for disor-
ders in different cognitive domains to reduce the cur-
rent heterogeneity.
