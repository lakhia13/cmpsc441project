Hoarding disorder is characterized by a persistent difficulty discarding items, the desire 
to  save  items  to  avoid  negative  feelings  associated  with  discarding  them,  significant 
accumulation of possessions that clutter active living areas and significant distress or 
impairment  in  areas  of  functioning.  We  present  a  case  of  a  52-year-old  married  man 
who  was  referred  to  the  psychiatry  department  for  collecting  various  objects  that 
were deposited unorganized in the patient’s house. He reported to get anxious when 
someone else discarded some of these items. This behavior had started about 20 years 
earlier and it worsened with time. The garage, attic, and surroundings of his house were 
cluttered  with  these  objects.  On  admission,  in  the  mental  status  examination,  it  was 
observed that the patient was vigil, calm, and oriented; his mood was depressed; his 
speech was organized, logic, and coherent; and there were no psychotic symptoms.  
A  psychotherapeutic  plan  was  designed  for  the  patient,  including  psychoeducation, 
cognitive restructuring, and exposure to discarding objects. A pharmacological treatment 
with fluvoxamine 100 mg tid and quetiapine 200 mg was added to the therapeutic plan, 
with the progressive improvement of the symptoms. Nine months later, the patient was 
able to sell/recycle most of the items. Studies evaluating treatment for HD are necessary 
to improve the quality of life of the patients and to reduce the hazards associated with 
the disorder.

The concept of hoarding was defined in 1996 as a behavioral phenomenon of acquisition of objects 
and failure to discard objects (1).

Compulsive hoarding was first included as diagnostic criteria for obsessive–compulsive personal-
ity disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders—third Edition Revised. 
Clinical hoarding began to be considered secondary to some disorders, such as dementia, residual 
schizophrenia, eating disorders, brain injury, autism spectrum disorders, or compulsive buying (2). 
Later, hoarding was considered a subtype or dimension of obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD), 
with  this  behavior  being  seen  in  about  18–40%  patients  (2).  However,  hoarding  would  be  seen 
frequently  independent  from  other  psychiatric  disorders.  After  focusing  on  the  epidemiological, 
phenomenological, and neurobiological aspects of hoarding, hoarding disorder (HD) was included 
as an isolated entity, in OCD spectrum, in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 
fifth Edition (DSM-V). The criteria for diagnosis of HD in DSM-V are a persistent difficulty discard-
ing items, the desire to save items in order to avoid negative feelings associated with discarding them, 
significant accumulation  of  possessions that clutter active living areas, and significant distress or

Persistent difficulty discarding or parting with possessions, regardless of 
their actual value

This difficulty is due to a perceived need to save the items and to distress 
associated with discarding them

The difficulty discarding possessions results in the accumulation of 
possessions that congest and clutter active living areas and substantially 
compromises their intended use. If living areas are uncluttered, it is 
only because of the interventions of third parties (e.g., family members, 
cleaners, and authorities)

The hoarding causes clinically significant distress or impairment in 
social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning (including 
maintaining  
a safe environment for self and others)

The hoarding is not attributable to other medical conditions (e.g., brain 
injury, cerebrovascular disease, and Prader–Willi syndrome)

The hoarding is not better explained by the symptoms of other mental 
disorders (e.g., obsessions in obsessive–compulsive disorder, decreased 
energy in major depressive disorder, delusions in schizophrenia or 
another psychotic disorder, cognitive deficits in major neurocognitive 
disorder, and restricted interests in autism spectrum disorder)

impairment in areas of functioning (Table 1) (3). Usually, these 
items are perceived to be useful in the future or to be esthetic or 
cause an emotional attachment (1, 4). If clutter is severe, it can 
cause threats to public health and safety (such as fire hazards and 
falls) (5).

In contrast to hoarding in OCD, the thoughts of not discard-
ing in patients with HD are not considered by the patients to be 
intrusive, repetitive, or egodystonic (6). Besides, stress in HD is 
associated with the consequence of the clutter of the items and 
not  related  to  the  content  of  the  thoughts  associated  with  the 
reasons to not discard objects.

Compulsive  hoarding  affects  about  2–5%  of  the  population 
(7–9). Hoarding behaviors usually start at a subclinical level in 
early adolescence and worsens with each decade (10–12). Often 
the disorder becomes clinically significant only in middle-aged 
patients, with the distress associated to HD being caused by the 
intervention of others, such as relatives or local authorities (13). 
Stressful or traumatic events may be associated with the onset of 
hoarding symptoms (11).

Other psychiatric disorders often co-occur with HD. The most 
frequent comorbidity is a major depression, which can be present 
in  up  to  50%  of  the  cases  (14).  Attention  deficit/hyperactive 
disorder (ADHD) is also a common comorbidity with HD, with 
some  studies  suggesting  association  with  inattentive  symptoms 
of  the  disorder  (15).  Poorer  general  health  is  also  associated  
with HD (16).

The  cognitive  behavioral  model  conceptualized  for  HD 
proposes that compulsive hoarding develops through emotional 
responses  associated  with  the  beliefs  about  possessions.  This 
model proposes (1, 17):

 1.  Information processing deficits (including avoiding/delaying 
decisions with fear of making wrong decisions, self-report of 
inattentiveness and difficulty remembering/recording memo-
ries, and deficits in categorization/organization).

 2.  Emotional attachment and beliefs (of responsibility and con-

trol) for the possessions.

 3.  Maladaptive behavioral patterns (avoiding discarding objects 
which  is  associated  with  negative  emotions,  and  acquiring  
and saving associated with positive emotions).

 4.  The cognitive behavioral treatment (CBT) designed to address 
HD involves assessment and psychoeducation on symptoms, 
motivation  enhancement,  cognitive  restructuring,  exposure 
to  non-acquiring,  and  discarding  and  prevention  of  relapse 
(17,  18).  One  meta-analysis  that  focused  on  the  results  of 
CBT  in  patients  with  HD  showed  that  symptoms  decrease 
significantly  after  treatment  with  large  effect  size,  especially 
with the difficulty to discard component of the disease (17). 
In the same study, rates of clinically significant changes were 
modest, with most patients continuing to score in the clinical 
range at posttreatment (17). Pharmacological treatment of HD 
disorder is not well established, since most studies evaluating 
treatment were made in patients with an OCD diagnosis with 
a hoarding component. Most of these studies used serotonin 
reuptake  inhibitors,  and  the  results  were  associated  with 
poor  response  to  treatment  (19).  A  meta-analysis  evaluated 
the  effect  of  pharmacotherapy  in  patients  with  pathological 
hoarding (either diagnosed with OCD with hoarding compo-
nent or HD) and response to treatment observed was 37–76% 
(20). In this study, only two studies focused on patients with 
HD.  An  open  label  trial  used  venlafaxine  in  monotherapy, 
in  which  70%  of  the  patients  were  classified  as  responders 
(decrease of ≥30% in the UCLA Hoarding Severity Scale and 
Saving Inventory—Revised and at least “much improved” on 
the Clinical Global Impression-Improvement) (21). The sec-
ond study, a case series (n = 4) using methylphenidate, since 
there are some studies that point out the association between 
HD and ADHD, did not have significance in the resolution of 
hoarding symptoms (22).

case rePOrT

We present a case of a 52-year-old married man, who has the 
sixth grade, and works as a mechanic. He has no previous his-
tory  of  medical  conditions.  As  a  psychiatric  background,  he 
reported  depressive  symptoms  following  the  death  of  his  only 
son 22 years ago.

The patient was referred to treatment at the psychiatry depart-
ment of Hospital de Braga for the first time by his family doctor 
for  collecting  various  objects,  predominantly  stones,  papers, 
and damaged pieces of cars that were deposited unorganized in 
the patient’s house. The patient collected these items because he 
thought they were valuable and/or usable in the future, but rec-
ognized that the collection was exaggerated. He could not discard 
any of these items, even if he never used them when needed. He 
reported  to  get  anxious  when  someone  else  discarded  some  of 
these items. This behavior had started about 20 years earlier and 
it worsened with time. Despite, the thoughts of the possible use of 
these items were the reason why he could not throw out the pos-
sessions, these thoughts were not considered intrusive, repetitive, 
or egodystonic. The garage, attic, and surroundings of his house 
were  cluttered  with  these  objects  (Figure  1).  The  clutter  in  his

there were no psychotic symptoms.

A  psychotherapeutic  plan  for  the  patient  was  designed.  The 
goals were to understand and educate the patient on his symp-
toms and beliefs, so he could understand the need of treatment. 
Cognitive restructuring of the beliefs and exposure to non-acquire 
and discard the objects saved were also explored. Along with the 
psychotherapeutic plan, a pharmacological treatment with fluvox-
amine 100 mg id and trazodone 150 mg id was made, to treat the 
coexistent depressive symptoms and insomnia. During the first 
6 months of treatment, the patient continued to buy and collect 
objects. Then, fluvoxamine was gradually augmented to 100 mg 
tid and quetiapine 200 mg was added to the treatment plan, with 
progressive improvement in the symptoms and the patient being 
able to sell/recycle most of the items after 9 months of this treat-
ment (Figure 2). The patient is currently medicated with quetia-
pine 100 mg id for insomnia and organized the spaces cluttered 
(Figure 3). The patient and his wife were very gratified with the  
results.

This study was performed in accordance with the provisions 
of  the  Declaration  of  Helsinki  2008  and  was  approved  by  the 
ethics eommittee of Hospital of Braga. We obtained informed 
written  consent  from  the  patient  authorizing  publication  of

disorders)  is  commonly  associated  with  chronic  stress  and 
important life events (11, 25).

Hoarding  disorder  is  mainly  treated  with  CBT,  including 
psychoeducation,  motivational  interviewing,  classic  cognitive 
techniques  focused  on  dysfunctional  beliefs,  and  exposures 
targeting sorting and discarding. Patients could also benefit with 
some pharmacological interventions.

In  the  presented  case,  the  psychotherapeutic  plan  included  
a  reduced  number  of  sessions  (basically  due  to  limitations  on 
available resources) and a combined pharmacologic approach.

Although no medications are currently marketed to treat HD, 
some studies identified benefits with the use of serotoninergic drugs 
in this disorder as in other disorders of the obsessive spectrum 
(19, 26). Treatment with fluvoxamine was chosen, not only for its 
characteristics of reduction of anxiety but also to address insomnia 
and depressive symptoms presented by the patient. Given that the 
patient did not tolerate trazodone, it was necessary to optimize 
the treatment for this problem, which constituted an opportunity  
for  the  use  of  quetiapine.  Although  there  are  no  studies  to 
evaluate the efficacy of quetiapine in this disorder, this case study 
illustrates its benefit that besides improving the sleep it seems to 
have contributed to lower the levels of anxiety in this patient.

Overall,  the  conjugation  of  described  psychotherapeutic 
and  pharmacotherapeutic  approach  contributed  to  significant 
improvement of the patient’s symptoms until sustained remission.
Future  studies  regarding  the  treatment  of  HD  are  necessary 
to address the difficulties of these patients and to improve their 
quality of life.

DiscUssiOn

We  presented  a  patient  who  suffered  from  HD.  The  case  was 
managed with both pharmacotherapy and a reduced number of 
psychotherapeutic  sessions,  which  may  be  of  interest  in  times 
of  restrictions  on  available  psychiatric  and  psychotherapeutic 
resources.

The clinical features of his object hoarding showed a typical 
pattern. The patient had an inability to discard objects and had 
an  accumulation  behavior  with  a  long  evolution  over  time.  He 
was referred to the psychiatric treatment about 20 years after the 
beginning of the accumulation symptoms. Delay in seeking treat-
ment for HD is very common and, if not treated, the evolution of 
the disorder occurs with progressive worsening of the behaviors.
The  possessions  collected  did  not  have  any  value,  and  the 
thought that the possessions may be needed in the future did not 
have  any  characteristics  of  an  obsession,  such  as  being  repeti-
tive or egodystonic. In the same vein, the anxiety caused by the 
disorder was associated with the fact that he did not want to get 
rid of the items because he thought they could be valuable and 
no thought of something bad could happen, as typical in OCD. 
In addition, collected items disturbed the normal organization of 
his house and were cluttered.

Interestingly, the accumulation behavior began a few years after 
the death of his son. In fact, HD onset (as other obsessive-related
