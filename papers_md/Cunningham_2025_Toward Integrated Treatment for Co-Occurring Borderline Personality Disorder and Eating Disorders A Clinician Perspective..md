ABSTRACT
Objective: It is common practice in Australia for co- occurring borderline personality disorder (BPD) and eating disorders (ED) 
to be treated separately. The objective of this research was to review features these disorders share, evidence- based approaches 
used for treating these disorders in isolation, clinicians' experiences of delivering treatment for co- occurring BPD and ED, and 
finally to explore integrated approaches to treating this dual diagnosis.
Method: A qualitative approach was used to examine interview transcripts of 10 clinicians employed at specialist outpatient 
services for severe BPD or severe ED. Interview transcripts were analyzed using thematic analysis.
Results: Nominated features shared by BPD and ED were emotion dysregulation, impulsivity, and interpersonal difficulties. 
Clinicians endorsed a range of therapeutic approaches for this dual diagnosis patient group, as well as an eclectic approach uti-
lizing a combination of treatment features. Most clinicians proposed an ideal program duration of 6–12 months, with group and 
individually focused therapy complementing one another to address underlying behavioural drivers and confer lasting clinical 
benefits.
Discussion: This study distills the importance of adopting integrated treatments for people with this dual diagnosis to optimize 
treatment outcomes. Future research could include soliciting client perspectives on using an integrated treatment approach for 
this dual diagnosis and trials of this approach to assess acceptability, feasibility, and longer- term outcomes.
Public Significance Statement: This study highlights the merit of concurrently addressing the complex interplay between 
EDs and BPD via an integrated treatment approach. Streamlining the therapeutic approach can address underlying features of 
these disorders, improve clinical formulation, and optimize patient outcomes.

Summary

•  Borderline  personality  disorder  and  eating  disor-
der  frequently  co- occur  and  share  some  diagnostic 
features.

•  Their  co- occurrence  leads  to  greater  complexity  and 
severity,  requiring  involvement  of  specialist  services 
that may not work in a coordinated manner.

•  Clinicians familiar with treating both disorders con-
sidered  emotion  dysregulation  and  distress  intoler-
ance to be core shared components.

•  Treatments  with  proven  effectiveness  for  treating  ei-
ther disorder may be combined in a holistic approach 
to address the shared psychopathology of co- occurring 
BPD and ED.

2   |   Introduction

Borderline  personality  disorder  (BPD)  is  a  severe  mental 
health  condition  causing  significant  functional  impairment 
and frequent co- occurrence with other psychiatric conditions 
(Leichsenring  et  al.  2011).  Primary  features  of  BPD  include 
a  pervasive  pattern  of  emotional  instability,  impulsivity,  and 
interpersonal  difficulties  (Miller  et  al.  2022),  along  with  a 
high  incidence  of  deliberate  self- harm  and  death  by  suicide 
(Liakopoulou  et  al.  2023).  BPD  is  highly  relevant  to  the  di-
agnosis  and  treatment  of  eating  disorders  (ED).  Prevalence 
varies  by  subtype,  with  BPD  co- occurring  in  25%  of  people 
with  anorexia  nervosa  (AN)  binge- eating  purging  type  and 
in  24.8%  of  people  with  bulimia  nervosa  (BN)  (Sansone  and 
Sansone 2011). It is notable that BPD and ED share some diag-
nostic features, with impulsivity (Newton et al. 1993) and af-
fective instability thought to give rise to chronically disturbed 
eating  behaviors  and  weight  preoccupation  (Lavender  and 
Mitchell  2015).  Bingeing  and  purging  are  particularly  com-
mon in people with a borderline personality structure (Miller 
et al. 2022).

The  co- occurrence  of  these  disorders  significantly  heightens 
psychopathology,  hospitalizations,  and  commensurate  chal-
lenges for consumers and mental health workers alike (Hessler 
et al. 2019; Trull et al. 2018; Vivarini et al. 2022). Critically, treat-
ment for co- occurring ED and BPD is usually siloed for each of 
these disorders, despite the overlap in their underlying clinical 
features. A recent network analysis suggests that although ED 
symptoms and BPD symptoms cluster independently, several di-
rect relationships may occur (De Paoli et al. 2020). For example, 
BN symptoms were linked with BPD symptoms of impulsivity 
and suicidality, and body dissatisfaction prevalent in BN is re-
portedly  associated  with  identity  disturbance  and  emotional 
instability,  both  characteristic  of  BPD  (De  Paoli  et  al.  2020). 
Despite this, there is limited capacity for services treating either 
BPD  or  ED  to  identify  and  implement  evidence- based  treat-
ments  specifically  for  this  dual  diagnosis.  Research  suggests 
that  attending  solely  to  ED  symptoms  can  result  in  therapy- 
interfering behaviours if BPD is present and not treated (Bankoff 
et al. 2012; Federici et al. 2012). Likewise, treating BPD without 
targeting ED symptoms may limit treatment efficacy due to dys-
regulated eating intensifying BPD features such as mood lability 

(McDonald 2019). Furthermore, the medical and psychological 
stability of a person with ED can impact the viability and timing 
of BPD treatment (Weigel et al. 2019). It is therefore essential to 
explore ways in which treatment can be integrated most effec-
tively for this clinical group and streamline its provision across 
BPD and ED treatment services.

Specialist  psychological  treatments  may  assist  people  with  co- 
occurring BPD and ED. Dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) is the 
most widely utilized treatment for BPD, targeting emotion reg-
ulation, distress tolerance, and suicidality (Linardon et al. 2018; 
Navarro- Haro et al. 2018). Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) 
demonstrates high efficacy in weight restoration and cognitive 
reappraisal of factors that perpetuate EDs (Fairburn et al. 2003). 
Acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT)- based approaches 
target distress tolerance and incorporate mindfulness principles 
(Beatson et al. 2010), while mentalisation- based therapy (MBT) 
focuses on understanding others' and one's own emotional and 
cognitive processes to improve symptom expression and inter-
personal functioning (Bateman and Fonagy 2013).

Evidence regarding strategies for treating co- occurring BPD and 
ED is scarce and inconclusive. When these disorders co- occur, 
their  symptom  severity  tends  to  be  positively  correlated,  with 
concurrent symptom reduction when treated together (Denning 
et al. 2023; Liakopoulou et al. 2023). Liakopoulou et al. (2023) 
evaluated  the  effectiveness  of  a  DBT  intervention,  augmented 
with  CBT  strategies,  for  nutritional  and  weight  restoration 
among  17–35- year- olds  admitted  to  an  ED  treatment  facility. 
They  found  that  improvement  in  coping  skills  was  related  to 
a  significant  reduction  of  both  ED  and  BPD  symptomatology. 
The long- term effectiveness of treatment for this clinical group 
was also explored in research comparing DBT with treatment- 
as- usual CBT (Navarro- Haro et al. 2021). Results indicated that 
significant symptom reduction persisted at 4-  and 6- years post- 
treatment  for  outpatients  who  had  received  either  treatment. 
Further support for DBT has been demonstrated in an adult ED- 
BPD cohort from a partial hospital program for EDs, wherein pa-
tients received a program of individual, family- based, and group 
therapy (Denning et al. 2023). Greater BPD symptomatology at 
admission led to steeper declines in ED symptomatology, such 
as  fasting,  bingeing,  and  parasuicidality,  compared  with  peo-
ple  with milder BPD  symptoms (Denning et  al.  2023).  Despite 
the clear need to integrate treatment for this clinical group, the 
evidence- base  is  still  developing,  with  more  studies  needed  to 
investigate the benefits of integrated treatments.

Qualitative  research  investigating  consumer  perspectives  on 
the  treatment  of  BPD  and  co- occurring  psychiatric  conditions 
also  underscores  the  value  of  synthesizing  therapeutic  modal-
ities.  For  instance,  while  some  consumers  endorsed  CBT  for 
helping them to identify and restructure their thought patterns, 
others felt that the emphasis DBT places on understanding their 
behaviours  and  emotional  states,  prior  to  adopting  behaviour 
change, was more aligned with their needs (Mooney et al. 2023). 
Similarly, consumers affected by BPD with co- occurring trauma 
disorder  desired  a  balance  between  emphasis  on  change  and 
maintaining  stability,  an  approach  they  thought  was  exempli-
fied by MBT and DBT styles of therapy (Woodbridge et al. 2023). 
Therefore,  conceptualizing  a  treatment  approach  that  incor-
porates  key  disorder- specific  treatment  features  is  a  necessary

step toward providing more targeted and tailored clinical care 
for people with this dual diagnosis. Clinicians who have expe-
rience  treating  both  disorders  are  well  placed  to  contextualize 
these consumer experiences, providing clinical insights that can 
inform future treatment design.

The present study addresses specific gaps in the BPD- ED lit-
erature. First, despite the presence of established therapies for 
BPD  or  ED,  treatment  integration  for  co- occurring  disorders 
is  less  explored  in  research  and  clinical  practice.  Given  the 
mutually  reinforced  chronicity  of  this  dual  diagnosis,  treat-
ments  that  can  effectively  attenuate  symptoms  of  both  dis-
orders  may  have  greater  and  longer- lasting  efficacy.  Second, 
while  the  efficacy  of  BPD  and  ED  treatments  has  been  in-
vestigated  quantitatively,  qualitative  data  are  comparatively 
scarce,  particularly  from  a  clinician  perspective.  Consulting 
with clinicians experienced in the treatment of BPD and ED 
may  capture  nuances  reflecting  different  settings,  treatment 
modalities,  and  clinical  challenges  associated  with  therapy 
provision.  Thus,  the  aim  of  this  study  was  to  explore  thera-
peutic approaches used when BPD and ED co- occur, based on 
clinicians'  experiences  of  delivering  treatment  to  this  popu-
lation.  Additionally,  the  researchers  investigated  clinicians' 
recommendations  regarding  an  integrated  approach  to  the 
treatment of co- occurring BPD and ED. This study constitutes 
the  first  known  attempt  to  study  clinicians'  perspectives  on 
the treatment of co- occurring BPD and ED.

3.1   |   Participants

Recruitment for this study used purposive sampling and was there-
fore by invitation only. Clinicians employed at either a specialist 
outpatient service for severe personality disorder or a specialist 
inpatient/outpatient service for severe ED were invited. As such, 
they worked within different service models (i.e., evidence- based 
psychotherapy versus the medical model of ED management, pri-
marily AN). Neither service routinely provided treatment outside 
of its remit. They did, however, have some patients in common, 
who received interventions from both services. All who were in-
vited—a total of 10 clinicians, five from each service—agreed to 
participate in this study. A key criterion for participation was that 
clinicians have substantive experience in delivering therapeutic 
interventions  for  BPD  and  ED  to  people  with  this  dual  diagno-
sis. Years of clinical experience varied, self- reported as between 
5 and 30 years, with an average of 13 years. The clinical director 
of  the  BPD  service  (Spectrum)  and  the  medical  director  of  the 
ED service (Austin Mental Health) were well- placed to nominate 
clinicians on the basis of their clinical experience.

Treatment  teams  in  both  study  settings  were  drawn  from  a 
range of professional disciplines; all were trained in delivering 
psychological  treatments.  Participants  were  senior  clinicians 
who were knowledgeable about treatment approaches that were 
individually  and  experience- based.  Participants  were  psychia-
trists (n = 3), psychologists (n = 4), psychiatric nurses (n = 2), and 
an occupational therapist (n = 1). Participants ranged from 30 to 
55 years old (mean age 35.5) with 80% identifying as female. This 
study  received  ethical  and  governance  approval  from  Eastern 

Health  (LR52/2016),  Austin  Health  (LNR/16/Austin/320),  and 
Swinburne University (LNR/16/Austin/320) Human Ethics and 
Research Committees.

3.2   |   Procedure

The  lead  author  was  introduced  via  email  to  five  clinicians 
from each specialist service (n = 10) by that service's clinical di-
rector.  Participation  involved  a  single  20  to  30- minute  individ-
ual interview with the lead author, a female Master of Clinical 
Psychology student completing a research thesis, who had previ-
ously interned at a BPD treatment facility. Interviews were con-
ducted between August and October 2016, in person or over the 
phone,  and  were  digitally  recorded  and  manually  transcribed. 
Transcripts were not returned to clinicians for review.

3.3   |   Design and Data Analysis

Thematic analysis was used to interpret the qualitative data from 
the interviews, identifying repeating patterns of responses to de-
rive  substantive  themes.  A  six- step  approach  recommended  by 
Braun  and  Clarke  (2006)  was  followed:  (i)  familiarize  oneself 
with the data; (ii) generate initial codes; (iii) search for themes; 
(iv)  review  themes;  (v)  define  and  name  themes;  and  (iv)  pro-
duce  the  report. The  lead  author  noted  initial  impressions  and 
features of the transcribed interviews and coded these across the 
entire  data  set. The  coded  responses  were  collated  into  emerg-
ing themes that were clearly defined and addressed the research 
questions. Finally, vivid and compelling interview extracts repre-
sentative of the themes were selected.

The major coding frame and themes were shaped by the inter-
view  questions  (see  Supporting  Information).  The  finer  grade 
categories (subthemes) emerged from the data during analysis. 
Any issues that arose during the coding process were resolved 
in  discussion  with  the  senior  author.  Considering  the  specific 
research  aims,  the  current  study  was  characterized  by  dense 
sample specificity, an established theoretical underpinning, and 
elaborate,  insightful  clinician  responses.  From  this,  it  was  de-
termined  that  data  obtained  and  analyzed  from  10  interviews 
was sufficient to address the research aims in accordance with 
recommendations by Malterud et al. (2015).

4.1.1   |   Proportion of Clients With Co- Occurring BPD 
and ED

When participating clinicians were asked about the prevalence 
of co- occurring BPD and ED among clients they knew (current 
and retrospective), 2/10 clinicians estimated 20%, 3/10 estimated 
30%,  4/10  estimated  50%,  and  1/10  estimated  60%–70%.  There 
were no clear differences in estimates across services. Estimates 
from clinicians in the primary ED service ranged from 20% to 
70%, and clinicians in the specialist personality disorder service 
ranged from 20% to 50%.

4.1.2   |   ED Subtypes Most Frequently Associated 
With BPD

ED  subtypes  co- occurring  with  BPD  varied  according  to  the 
specialist service participants worked for. Clinicians working at 
the  specialist  BPD  service  were  more  likely  to  report  EDs  de-
fined by binge eating, either BN or binge eating disorder (BED). 
For example, Clinician 3 noted that “bulimia nervosa would be 
one of the main, or binge eating.” However, clinicians working 
within the specialist ED service reported a predominance of cli-
ents with AN, as highlighted by Clinician 7, who observed that 
ED treatment settings see “a lot of people with anorexia nervosa 
and some people with bulimia.” Clinician 8 from the specialist 
ED  service  highlighted  that  “people  with  anorexia  binge  type 
or  people  who  have  bulimia  often,  not  always,  but  often  have 
borderline personality structure as well.”

4.1.3   |   Shared Symptoms of BPD and ED

Many participants reported emotion regulation/dysregulation as a 
prominent feature of both disorders. Clinician 5 stated that, for cli-
ents, “bingeing is a way of regulating themselves and feeling good.” 
Clinician  8  also  highlighted  the  “regulatory  function  in  bingeing 
and  purging,  as  a  way  of  reducing  emotional  distress.”  Elements 
of  control  and  impulsivity  were  also  identified,  with  Clinician  7 
suggesting  that  “often  people  with  borderline  personality  disor-
der  do  struggle  emotionally…  eating  disorders  can  provide  a  way 
of  being  under  control.”  Similarly,  clinician  5  surmised  that  ED 
may  arise  due  to  “lack  of  control,  impulsivity.”  Participants  also 
observed interpersonal difficulties associated with the dual diagno-
sis, Clinician 6 noting “really poor interpersonal function.” Finally, 
themes of self- harm and suicidality were also noted by clinicians 
across  both  clinical  settings.  Participants  understood  bingeing 
behavior to be a form of self- harm. Clinician 5 described it thus: 
“there is an aspect of self- punishment, sort of the spectrum of self- 
harm behaviour, suicidal urges… some of that is met by the eating 
disorder.” Clinician 1 noted that “treatment is pretty much aimed 
at reducing their risk of suicidality and deliberate self- harm… quite 
a long history of self- destructive behaviour… lots of presentations to 
ED.” Clinician 6 corroborated this notion, stating that within this 
clinical population, “you're targeting both the restricted eating and 
the self- harm… it's hard work, in a way, balancing those different 
targets.”

4.2   |   Current Treatment for BPD and ED—What 
Makes It Effective?

4.2.1   |   Features of Effective BPD Treatment

Clinicians employed by the BPD treatment service unanimously 
endorsed DBT and ACT as effective for relieving BPD symptoms. 
Many  specifically  noted  that  the  chain  analysis  component  of 
DBT  helped  clients  understand  the  underlying  causes  of  their 
behavior.  Clinician  2  described  this  as  “analysing  step- by- step 
what  leads  up  to  the  problem…  that  quite  detailed  behaviour 
chain… breaking problems down into just little steps that actually 
they  can  make  changes  on.”  ACT's  utility  was  summarized  by 
Clinician 5: “Mindfulness—a different way of living… not focused 

on judgement or evaluation… Defusion—a different way to relate 
to their inner thoughts that are often precursors to dysfunctional 
behaviours… Values—considering what it is they might be doing 
with that time and energy.” Distress tolerance, core to both DBT 
and ACT, was also thought to be effective in clinical settings, de-
scribed as “trying to bring the client back to the primary feeling 
that's at the origin… trying to help the person to learn to tolerate 
that feeling” (Clinician 2). Discussion of the value of MBT cen-
tered around the ‘not knowing stance’. For example, Clinician 1 
defined this as to “try and not stamp [my] assumptions of what 
[I] think they're thinking or doing… actually ask them,” and “try-
ing to help a person not just focus on their behaviour but try and 
understand the thoughts, feeling, and emotions in a curious and 
reflective way” (Clinician 4). Finally, all participants referred to 
the  central  importance  of  validation  for  the  treatment  of  BPD, 
with Clinician 5 emphasizing “first and foremost, the experience 
of being acknowledged… their internal experience validated and 
reflected, understood, communicated.”

4.2.2   |   Features of Effective ED Treatment

Participants from the specialist ED service emphasized the im-
portance of allowing the client to own the process of weight res-
toration. Clinician 10 expanded on this: “assisting them to accept 
the need for health restoration… being supported in taking con-
trol of that themselves.” Similar to BPD clinicians, ED clinicians 
discussed  the  value  of  distress  tolerance.  Clinician  9  stated,  in 
relation to those who received BPD treatment prior to treatment 
for their ED: “there seems to be strong evidence that [DBT] has 
equipped them to be able to deal with inpatient admission in a 
more adaptive way, with less self- harming behaviours and more 
distress tolerance. That seems to be a really important interven-
tion.” Regarding CBT, specific elements such as food and thought 
diaries were perceived as foundational for improving clients' un-
derstanding of their behaviour. For example, Clinician 7 shared 
that “there's a grade of exposure with a CBT food and thought 
diary to help people understand and stay on track,” which was 
corroborated  by  Clinician  10,  who  noted  “self- monitoring  of 
food intake” as an important treatment element. ACT was also 
regarded as effective for this group, particularly “how they can 
live their life in a way consistent with their values… we'll look at 
awareness  of  their  thoughts  and  cognitive  defusion”  (Clinician 
6).  Emphasis  on  trust  and  rapport  was  also  expressed,  with 
Clinician 8 indicating that “if they don't even have that basis, you 
know, there'll be no commitment to any of this.” Clinician 7 rein-
forced this notion of consistency: “having regular appointments, 
having  clear  boundaries.”  Finally,  the  inherent  risk  associated 
with severe ED was emphasized, as was the importance of “find-
ing a way of monitoring risk… finding a way to keep people safe” 
(Clinician 8).

4.3   |   Current Treatment for Co- Occurring BPD 
and ED—What Makes It Effective?

4.3.1   |   Eclectic Approach

Several participants referred to the benefits of using an eclectic 
approach to treat the dual diagnosis, that is, combining aspects 
of  DBT,  ACT,  CBT,  and  MBT.  For  example,  Clinician  1  stated 

920

International Journal of Eating Disorders, 2025

“they  allow  for  a  targeting  of  both  disorders  because  in  some 
ways they're addressing a common factor like emotion dysregu-
lation… relevant to BPD but also [to] why someone can't restrict 
their intake [in the context of ED].” Clinician 6 highlighted a di-
versity of therapeutic modalities: “emotion focused work can be 
quite helpful… cognitive reframing can be helpful or some cog-
nitive work, CBT work can be helpful… motivational interview-
ing when they first come in, that's kind of been most effective at 
the start. ACT can be very effective as well.” The use of an eclec-
tic approach that compensates for strengths and weaknesses of 
individual therapies was also discussed: “I think it requires the 
integration  of  all  these  techniques  in  one  program…  ACT  and 
DBT don't adequately address the eating disorder part of it, but 
do address some of the common elements and maintaining fac-
tors of the personality component, whereas I think you also need 
some specific CBT to address the eating disorder, although ACT 
and  DBT  also  help  with  some  of  that  too…  if  they  could  learn 
in parallel or [in] an integrated program… you could cover most 
of the issues” (Clinician 8). Specific features of therapeutic ap-
proaches suggested by participants are listed in Table 1.

4.4   |   Proposed Program Structure 
for Co- Occurring BPD and ED

Participants  were  asked  what  they  would  regard  as  the  ideal 
structure of an integrated treatment program, and what level of 
commitment they anticipated would be required from clinicians 
to  deliver  this.  Their  recommendations  regarding  treatment 
duration varied considerably, as did ideas regarding structural 
features (Table 2).

5   |   Discussion

The purpose of this study was to explore clinician impressions 
concerning the shared underlying etiology of co- occurring BPD 
and  ED,  treatment  features  most  effective  in  addressing  the 
symptomology  of  these  disorders,  and  how  these  might  be  de-
livered  concurrently.  Ten  clinicians  participated  in  this  study, 
each of whom had expertise in the treatment of both disorders. 
The  qualitative  findings  of  this  research  revealed  consistent

Quotes

C1: “Sometimes I've seen group programs get a bit too dominant 
on teaching things… as opposed to having a balance of providing 
skills but also as a group finding a way of processing emotions”

C6: “That's where the learning comes from… reflecting on things they 
say and how they behave… group dynamics can be incredibly intense”

C2: “The stabilization stuff, the distress tolerance, the distractions 
and self- soothing skills… works quite well, in terms of teaching 
the skills in a group setting… in individual therapy that goes 
alongside the group, you can focus on any particular issue the client 
might have… relate [treatment targets] to the client and how their 
personality symptomatology and eating disorder affects them”

C7: “The DBT model where people have individual sessions 
and also group skills training… maybe adding in some 
meal support and psychoeducation around that”

C5: “Supportive outpatient programs… a very accepting, 
understanding, compassionate, non- pathologising relationship”

C4: “Setting them up to value more, the connection and 
relationships… making that maybe a stronger value than the 
need to have a perfect body… taking that self- compassion attitude 
has been shown to be really positive in breaking that cycle”

Empowerment

C7: “I have to empower the client as much as possible and meet them 
where they're at, so not trying to go at a pace that's ahead of them”

Collaboration

C6: “I like to approach the client as the expert in their own 
life. Even though there is a power imbalance inherently 
there, there has to be as much equality as possible”

C10: “A strong emphasis on mutual collaborative conceptualisation 
of what the issues are. Carefully delineated, done actively 
together over a period of time rather than rushing into 
change… addressing regularization of eating patterns”

Duration

6–12 weeks

6–12 months

C1: “Between 2 and 3 months would perhaps be a minimum… a core that teaches all the basic things that 
people need… but then with other options after that to continue with different modalities like MBT”

Quotes

C7: “It would be ideal that they would have one- on- one concurrently with the group. I'd probably 
say twice a week… two group sessions as well as one- to- one… maybe about 6 or 8 weeks”

C3: “I think both those conditions are chronic conditions and so I guess I'm thinking about 
the DBT structure in my mind—it was designed originally as a year, but I know that, like, 
in the hospital I work in privately, they run it for 6 months… it can be enough for some”

C4: “You start with 6 months and see what happens, but with maybe contact up until a year or two 
afterwards, with three sessions every second day. Three- hour sessions. Or even a day thing”

C6: “I would wonder about it being set up in a block kind of way, so people commit to asix- 
month block and then we review things…. You'd hope that people would be engaged for at 
least 6 months. And I think it would be good then if they could continue with the individual 
therapist for a prolonged period of time as well, so somebody is carrying them through”

C10: “The individual therapy needs to be the journey and the groups need 
to be the skills… so, it's going to need to be 6 months at least”

12–24 months

C2: “12–18 months. Unless you address the underlying maintaining factors, you get a relapse. I think 
the only way to do that is to have people in treatment for longer… whether it's group or individual 
therapy my experience is a lot of these patients have all kinds of attachment difficulties”

C5: “A 12- month program. And if money wasn't an object, three times a week”

C9: “Something like a day program where you have 4 days a week of treatment where 
eating's also supervised, for at least a few meals a day, and there's lots of incorporated 
challenges… So, 12 months to 2 years but possibly with a kind of step- down approach”

perspectives in relation to the etiology and treatment of people 
with a dual diagnosis of BPD and ED.

and self- harm are not only related but provide a similarly sooth-
ing effect for people in this clinical group.

Prior  research  highlights  the  prevalence  of  co- occurring  BPD 
and ED (Miller et al. 2022). Participants in the current study es-
timated  that  20%–70%  of  clients  having  a  known  or  suspected 
dual diagnosis of ED and BPD. This is consistent with previous 
estimates that co- occurring ED is present in 10%–54% of people 
with BPD (Sansone et al. 2011). Participants from the specialist 
BPD  service  reported  that  clients  with  this  dual  diagnosis  ex-
perienced EDs defined by binge eating, including BN and BED, 
while  within  the  specialist  ED  service,  participants  reported 
co- occurring  AN  (binge- purge  type)  in  association  with  BPD. 
These responses generally corroborate previous findings related 
to  co- occurring  BPD  and  ED,  where  binge- purge  behaviour  is 
present as either AN (binge- purge type) (25%) or bulimia (28%) 
(Sansone et al. 2005).

Many participants in the present study referenced emotion dys-
regulation and distress intolerance as core components of both 
disorders, supported by previous research suggesting that dys-
regulated eating behaviors may arise from fluctuations in neg-
ative  affect  and  difficulty  tolerating  negative  emotions  (Miller 
et  al.  2022).  Moreover,  several  participants  perceived  binge/
purging  behaviors  as  comparable  to  self- harming  behaviours 
prevalent among people with BPD, consistent with the concept 
that self- harm serves an emotion- regulating function (De Paoli 
et al. 2020; O'Loghlen et al. 2023). There was a clear perception 
among participating clinicians that disordered eating behavior 

Participants'  endorsement  of  specific  techniques  across  the 
frontline treatment modalities for BPD and ED (DBT, CBT, ACT, 
MBT) highlights the merit in combining treatment approaches 
for this dual diagnosis. For instance, DBT's chain analysis and 
the  mentalisation  focus  in  MBT  emerged  as  important  ways 
to  encourage  reflective  exploration  of  clients'  own  and  others' 
emotions.  In  generating  a  thorough  understanding  of  clients' 
emotional and behavioral precursors such as self- harm or binge-
ing (Rizvi and Ritschel 2014), and utilizing mentalisation-  and 
mindfulness- based strategies to assist with emotion recognition 
(Preece et al. 2022), streamlining these processes may alleviate 
shared  symptoms,  like  self- disgust,  within  the  dual  diagnosis 
(Ille  et  al.  2014).  Additionally,  several  clinicians  drew  on  food 
and thought diaries to suggest CBT strategies that may be best 
placed to address certain ED- specific symptomatology, propos-
ing  that  drawing  on  emotion- focused  strategies  from  range  of 
modalities  can  assist  in  alleviating  features  of  both  disorders. 
This  is  reflected  in  existing  literature,  highlighting  CBT's  role 
in  attaining  nutritional  restoration  and  medical  stability  for 
further  psychological  treatment  (Fairburn  et  al.  2013;  Weigel 
et  al.  2019).  Furthermore,  studies  suggest  that  a  combination 
of  emotion- focused  techniques  such  as  distress  tolerance  and 
mindfulness can facilitate sustained improvement for this clin-
ical group (Hessler et al. 2019; Liakopoulou et al. 2023). Given 
the efficacy of techniques drawn from various modalities to ad-
dress the shared psychopathology of co- occurring BPD and ED,

synthesizing  these  into  individualised  treatment  may  assist  in 
alleviating the unique psychopathology underlying this clinical 
group, and importantly, reduce relapse.

It  is  increasingly  evident  in  ED  research  that  personality  di-
mensions  may  explain  meaningful  variance  in  several  areas 
of clinical assessment, symptomatic expression, and treatment 
(Farstad et al. 2016; Liakopoulou et al. 2023; Miller et al. 2022). 
Therefore,  further  investigation  is  warranted  to  conceptual-
ize  an  integrated  and  tailored  treatment  for  this  clinical  pop-
ulation.  Transdiagnostic  approaches  may  provide  an  avenue 
towards  conceptualizing  such  treatment.  Transdiagnostic  ap-
proaches  such  as  CBT  “Enhanced”  (CBT- E)  incorporate  mod-
ules targeting a broader range of psychological vulnerabilities, 
including clinically relevant perfectionism and low self- esteem 
(Thompson- Brenner  et  al.  2016).  CBT- E  may  facilitate  sus-
tained  treatment  benefits  for  people  with  this  dual  diagnosis, 
highlighting  the  potential  advantage  of  including  therapeutic 
content that targets mood states and interpersonal functioning 
(Thompson- Brenner  et  al.  2016).  The  Unified  Protocol  for  the 
Transdiagnostic Treatment of Emotional Disorders also takes a 
broad- spectrum approach. It acknowledges that personality fea-
tures  may  drive  BPD  and  co- occurring  conditions  and  targets 
these simultaneously (Sauer- Zavala et al. 2016). This sentiment 
is corroborated in the current research, with participating clini-
cians emphasizing the importance of matching treatment to cli-
ent  personality  difficulties.  Therefore,  clinicians  familiar  with 
different  treatment  modalities  could  selectively  incorporate 
features of specialized treatments (i.e., using transdiagnostic ap-
proaches) to maximize treatment effectiveness.

Aside  from  specific  therapeutic  modalities,  most  participants 
spoke about the importance of the therapeutic alliance, observ-
ing  that  clients  report  the  collaborative  process  of  developing 
and  sharing  a  formulation  to  be  empowering  and  validating. 
These findings are thoroughly supported in the literature, par-
ticularly among clients with these complex disorders (Flückiger 
et al. 2018; Graves et al. 2017). Moreover, participant discussions 
on the importance of compassion are consistent with research 
suggesting  that  mindful  self- compassion  may  serve  as  a  pro-
tective factor against ED pathology, such as body image distur-
bance (Braun et al. 2016; Hessler- Kaufmann et al. 2020), as well 
as being an effective emotion regulation strategy for BPD clients 
(Warren 2015). This is regarded as essential for assisting clients 
to experience secure relationships and self- acceptance, both of 
which are impaired in this clinical group (Beatson et al. 2010; 
Donald et al. 2019).

When  asked  to  propose  a  treatment  regime  suited  to  people 
with this dual diagnosis, there was surprising variability among 
participant responses, with suggestions regarding treatment du-
ration  ranging  from  6 weeks  to  2 years.  Despite  this,  most  cli-
nicians endorsed a 6–12 month duration, with some suggesting 
that  6 months  may  serve  as  an  initial  period,  contingent  upon 
client  improvement  and  commitment.  This  is  consistent  with 
previous 6- month effectiveness trials for co- occurring BPD and 
ED,  with  significant  symptom  reduction  persisting  at  4-   and 
6- years post- treatment for outpatients who had received either 
standard DBT or CBT (Navarro- Haro et al. 2021). Participants 
also suggested that group programs be offered 2–5 times a week, 
each  for  90 min,  particularly  in  an  inpatient  setting.  However, 

participants  also  noted  that  clients  with  less  severe  symptoms 
would benefit from less intense and lengthy interventions. This 
is  consistent  with  research  indicating  that  brief  interventions, 
such as a 3- week self- compassion intervention for ED, can lead 
to  positive  outcomes  such  as  reduced  body  dissatisfaction  and 
body  shame,  and  improved  body  image  (Braun  et  al.  2016). 
Importantly,  one  clinician  noted  potentially  shortening  a  12- 
month treatment program to 6 months within a hospital setting. 
This mirrors existing feasibility studies exploring the clinical ef-
fectiveness of shorter treatment durations within certain health-
care  settings,  identifying  promising  results  in  relation  to  BPD 
treatment (McMain et al. 2018).

Despite  areas  of  alignment  between  the  services,  there  were 
also  distinctions  in  participant  perspectives  according  to  the 
service  from  which  they  were  recruited.  Clinicians  from  the 
BPD service tended to focus more on addressing pervasive emo-
tional  dysregulation  and  trauma- related  behaviours,  whereas 
clinicians  from  the  ED  service  prioritized  the  management  of 
physical and medical risks associated with ED. These perspec-
tives shaped their approaches to formulating an ideal treatment 
program  for  people  with  this  dual  diagnosis.  While  clinicians 
from the ED service emphasized the interplay of one- on- one and 
group  therapy,  BPD  clinicians  reflected  more  on  the  utility  of 
specific modalities like DBT or MBT to address latent interper-
sonal and emotional nuances linked to personality structure.

Some  limitations  in  interpreting  the  findings  of  the  current 
study  are  important  to  note.  Conclusions  from  this  study  may 
be restricted given that the recruitment of participants was lim-
ited to specialist services for the treatment of BPD and ED, re-
spectively. A further limitation is the absence of consumer lived 
experience perspectives from these same services. Furthermore, 
confirmation  bias  may  have  emerged  during  the  interviews, 
with participants selectively favoring the treatment approaches 
that they use in their own work. Therefore, this research cannot 
be  used  to  ascertain  the  utility  of  other  evidence- based  treat-
ments for BPD and/or ED, which may also have utility for the 
treatment of this co- occurring disorder. This is offset in part by 
the broad range of treatments that individual participants were 
experienced in administering.

Future  research  could  consult  people  with  lived  experience  of 
this dual diagnosis about features of clinical interventions that 
they find effective, and what they believe would be beneficial in 
a  group  or  individual  program.  It  would  also  be  advantageous 
to  recruit  clinicians  who  have  training  in  other  therapeutic 
approaches  not  mentioned  in  the  present  study.  This  includes 
common factors- based approaches that have emerged as effec-
tive  and  practical  alternatives  to  specialist  treatments  for  the 
treatment of BPD, through combining effective therapeutic fea-
tures shared by specialist treatments to provide a more flexible 
approach (Gunderson et al. 2018; Weinberg et al. 2011). Further 
research  is  also  needed  to  investigate  different  treatment  ap-
proaches, specifically their effectiveness for managing persistent 
symptoms in cases where one of the disorders has remitted.

The dual diagnosis of BPD and ED represents a major challenge 
to clients, caregivers, and treatment services. Given the subop-
timal clinical outcomes when these co- occurring disorders are 
treated  in  isolation,  it  is  imperative  that  treatment  services  be 

923

guided by the overlap in underlying features of these disorders. 
Based on the clinical perspectives reported in the current study, 
there is a clear mandate for services to coordinate care of both 
disorders  concurrently.  Specifically,  adopting  client- centered 
approaches in the delivery of holistic, tailored care, using a syn-
thesis  of  manualized  and  flexible  therapeutic  modalities.  The 
capacity of services to coordinate concurrent treatment for BPD 
and  ED  has  the  potential  to  address  features  underlying  and 
perpetuating both disorders, alleviating strain on carers, more 
efficient  utilization  of  mental  health  resources,  and  ultimately 
facilitating  long- lasting  treatment  efficacy  for  people  with  this 
complex clinical presentation.
