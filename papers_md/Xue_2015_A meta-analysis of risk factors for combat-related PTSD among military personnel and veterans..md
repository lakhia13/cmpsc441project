Abstract

Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), a complex and chronic disorder caused by exposure
to a traumatic event, is a common psychological result of current military operations. It
causes substantial distress and interferes with personal and social functioning. Conse-
quently, identifying the risk factors that make military personnel and veterans more likely to
experience PTSD is of academic, clinical, and social importance. Four electronic databases
(PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and PsycINFO) were used to search for observational
studies (cross-sectional, retrospective, and cohort studies) about PTSD after deployment to
combat areas. The literature search, study selection, and data extraction were conducted
by two of the authors independently. Thirty-two articles were included in this study. Summa-
ry estimates were obtained using random-effects models. Subgroup analyses, sensitivity
analyses, and publication bias tests were performed. The prevalence of combat-related
PTSD ranged from 1.09% to 34.84%. A total of 18 significant predictors of PTSD among mil-
itary personnel and veterans were found. Risk factors stemming from before the trauma in-
clude female gender, ethnic minority status, low education, non-officer ranks, army service,
combat specialization, high numbers of deployments, longer cumulative length of deploy-
ments, more adverse life events, prior trauma exposure, and prior psychological problems.
Various aspects of the trauma period also constituted risk factors. These include increased
combat exposure, discharging a weapon, witnessing someone being wounded or killed, se-
vere trauma, and deployment-related stressors. Lastly, lack of post-deployment support
during the post-trauma period also increased the risk of PTSD. The current analysis pro-
vides evidence of risk factors for combat-related PTSD in military personnel and veterans.
More research is needed to determine how these variables interact and how to best protect
against susceptibility to PTSD.

Risk Factors for Combat-Related PTSD

Introduction

Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among military personnel and veterans has been studied
for more than 30 years, PTSD may develop after an individual experiences or witnesses a trau-
matic event, such as combat, a natural disaster, or a violent personal assault [1]. PTSD is often
been studied among military personnel in relation to combat trauma [2–5]. The effect of com-
bat on PTSD in military personnel is a major concern among the public, military leaders, and
policy makers [6], indeed, it can be a debilitating consequence of severe or life-threatening
trauma [7]. Moreover, PTSD can cause substantial distress and interfere with personal and so-
cial functioning, subsequently leading to social withdrawal, anger, and aggression [8–11]. Fur-
thermore, PTSD in military populations has a pervasive impact on military readiness and the
accomplishment of military goals [12]. Studies that focus on PTSD can be divided into several
categories, These categories include the basic theoretical accounts of PTSD (e.g., disease epide-
miology, clinical manifestation and classification, comorbid conditions), research on pathogen-
ic factors related to PTSD (e.g. traumatic events, family history of mental disorders, social
factors); the diagnosis and evaluation of PTSD; and the treatment and prevention of PTSD. Re-
searchers have proposed many theories to explain the development of PTSD, including biologi-
cal theories, and psychological theories. Psychology theories include the psychodynamic theory
as well as learning theory and cognitive theories; while cognitive theory best explains the devel-
opment of PTSD [13]. The current research on the biological theory of PTSD aims to better
understand the risk factor and related neurobiological mechanisms related to the illness.
Neurobiological research has indicated that PTSD has distinct mechanisms that are different
from the general stress response and other mental illnesses. For example, Bremner et al. noted
that patients with PTSD exhibit hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA axis) disorder [14,
15]. In addition, Gelpin, Bonne, et al. speculated that people with PTSD have abnormal levels
of catecholamine since they demonstrate high alert symptoms such as insomnia and becoming
frightened easily [16]. Moreover, Wong et al. reported that changes in immunology may be in-
volved in the occurrence and maintain of PTSD [17].

The risk factor literature shows that not everyone who experiences a traumatic event will de-

velop PTSD. Therefore, it has become increasingly accepted that individual vulnerability fac-
tors contribute to the development of PTSD beyond the traumatic event itself [18]. In past
several decades, a number of studies have focused on combat-related PTSD and have identified
individual and social risk factors, these risk factors include being younger at the time of the
trauma, being female, being of a racial minority, being of a lower socioeconomic status (SES),
and lack of social support [19, 20]. While all studies included routinely measured demographic
factors, there is little consistency in the risk factors examined or in the measures used to assess
these factors [3]. While the methods assessing trauma severity have been fairly consistent in
studies of veterans, there are increasingly more studies are focusing on more specific factors
that cannot be compared across studies because there are no standardized measurements of
high levels of threat, the experience of atrocities, abusive violence, and neutral or malicious in-
terpersonal atmospheres [21]. Thus, individual studies may report very different strengths of
association between a given risk factor and PTSD.

Meta-analyses are able to explore variations between studies by examining how sample and
study characteristics act as moderators of a given association. As such, a meta-analysis would be
helpful in consolidating the abundance of information on PTSD risk factors. Kaylor et al. con-
ducted a previous meta-analysis on the topic and focused on the general psychological impact of
military service in Vietnam [22], In addition, Rubonis and Bickman, examined the positive
relationship between disasters and psychopathology via meta-analysis [23]. Moreover, the
meta-analysis by Weaver and Clum found that psychological distress was associated with

interpersonal violence [24]. However, it must be noted that these previous meta-analyses of
trauma did not systematically study the risk factors of PTSD, or include participants with specif-
ic diagnoses of PTSD [3]. In a more recent examination, Shalev summarized the results of 38
studies and found that pre-trauma vulnerability (e.g., family history of mental disorders, gender,
personality traits, early traumatization, negative parenting experiences, and lower education)
were associated with PTSD. Specifically, the magnitude of the stressor, preparation for the trau-
matic event, immediate reactions to the trauma, and post-trauma factors (e.g., emerging symp-
toms, social support, and other life stress) were related with PTSD [25]. Brewin et al. also
studied predictors of PTSD and showed that pre-trauma risk factors have relatively weak predic-
tive effects, while trauma intensity and post-trauma risk factors have somewhat stronger predic-
tive effects. For instance, a lack of social support, life stress, trauma severity, childhood abuse,
and other adverse childhood experiences were strong predictors of PTSD. Importantly, Brewin
et al. noted that the set of studies they included in their meta-analysis was heterogeneous [3].

Drawing from Brewin et al.’s study, Ozer et al. focused on a comparison of static predictors
(e.g., psychological adjustment prior to the index traumatic event, family history of psychopa-
thology, perceived life threat during the traumatic event) to predictors that are more likely to
be implicated in the psychological and neurobiological processes associated with the exposure
to traumatic stress. They indicated that peri-traumatic dissociation was the strongest predictor
of PTSD, followed by perceived life threat and lack of perceived support [26]. In another meta-
analysis, Trickey estimated the population effect sizes of 25 potential risk factors for PTSD in
children and adolescents; they indicated that subjective peri-truma factors and post-event fac-
tors played a major role in the development of PTSD [11]. However, their analysis mainly tar-
geted studies on the risk factors of PTSD in civilian populations (children, adolescents, and
adults), rather than veterans or military personnel.

Thus, more research is needed to determine the key risk factors among military personnel

deployed to combat zones. A better reliable understanding of the factors that make military
personnel and veterans more likely to develop PTSD can help clinicians provide the necessary
treatment before difficulties become chronic [27]. Likewise, a better understanding of PTSD
may make it possible to improve assessments, prevention initiatives, and interventions, thereby
leading to better outcomes for military personnel and veterans exposed to potentially traumatic
events [26]. In our study, we investigated and succeeded in founding the factors that may influ-
ence the development of combat-related PTSD in military personnel and veterans using meta-
analytical techniques [28]. The predictive factors of PTSD included in our meta-analysis can be
broadly categorized as pre-, peri-, and post-trauma factors [3, 26]. Pre-trauma factors include
socio-demographic factors, military characteristics, prior traumatic experiences, and a history
of psychiatric illness, whereas peri-trauma factors include combat exposure, the severity of
the trauma, and acute reactions to deployment-related adverse events. Post-trauma factors in-
clude individual comorbid psychological problems, social support, and subsequent stressful
life events.

Methods

The methods and reporting procedures were in accordance with the PRISMA (Preferred Re-
porting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) checklist. A flow diagram has been
provided as supplementary material (S1 PRISMA Checklist) [29].

Search Strategy

English-language articles published in peer-reviewed journals between 1980 (the year PTSD
was first included in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, DSM) and

Risk Factors for Combat-Related PTSD

April 2014 were considered for inclusion. Four psychological and medical literature databases
were searched: PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, and Web of Science. Search terms entered into
the literature databases included combinations of the following: PTSD or post-traumatic stress
disorder; military, or troop(s), or army, or navy, or marine corps, or air force, or armed, or de-
fense, or peacekeeper(s), or soldier(s), or veteran(s); and, risk, predictor, prediction, or predis-
position. A predictor or risk factor was operationally defined as any variable examined as a
potential contributor to variability in PTSD symptom levels or diagnostic status. In addition, a
manual search of references cited in all relevant original and review articles was conducted. For
any full texts that were not available, we attempted to obtain information from the authors by
email. This literature search yielded a preliminary database of 2,657 published articles, which
were then reviewed for inclusion in the meta-analysis using various inclusion and
exclusion criteria.

Inclusion and exclusion criteria

In order to be eligible for inclusion in the meta-analysis, studies had to fulfill the following cri-
teria: (a) investigated risk factors for PTSD in military populations after deployment to combat
areas; (b) reported the odds ratios (ORs) or relative risks (RRs) and corresponding 95% confi-
dence intervals (CIs) for risk factors in the development of PTSD; (c) included the post-
deployment PTSD risk factors that we had selected; and (d) included a sample of military
personnel, veterans, or both.

Articles were excluded on any of the following grounds; (a) the study measured only the
acute trauma response (e.g. Acute Stress Disorder or PTSD measured before one month post-
trauma) rather than PTSD, which, according to the DSM-IV-TR, can be diagnosed only after
one month [30]; (b) the study used a categorical measure of PTSD—in other words, they in-
cluded individuals meeting full diagnostic criteria and those with less severe post-traumatic
symptoms or partial PTSD (e.g., “subsyndromal PTSD”) in the same comparison group, and
contrasted them with a group exposed to the same event but without PTSD; (c) the study popu-
lation consisted entirely of individuals already suffering from PTSD or from a specific comor-
bid psychiatric disorder (e.g., depression, Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, substance
abuse, learning disabilities) or having committed a violent offense, which would limit the gen-
eralizability of the results; (d) the study did not specifically assess DSM-defined PTSD symp-
toms (e.g., studies that reported only general symptoms); (e) the study contained insufficient
data to calculate univariate effect sizes, and such data could not be obtained from the study au-
thor; (f) the article was a review or a qualitative study that did not present new data or only pre-
sented qualitative analyses; (g) the primary aim of the study was to investigate the efficacy of
treatment; and (h) the study used a single-case design [11].

Finally, if more than one article reported data from the same sample, then the most

recent and complete article was included in our meta-analysis. All eligible studies were care-
fully reviewed by two authors (C.X. & M.W.) to ensure decision-rule consistency, with
100% agreement.

Data extraction and quality assessment

Data extraction was performed by two investigators (C.X. and B.T.) independently. Differences
in interpretation were resolved by discussion with a third co-author (Y.G.) to produce one final
coding. The following information was extracted from each eligible study: first author’s sur-
name, year of publication, study location, trauma type, study design, method, deployment area,
PTSD diagnosis, sample size, PTSD prevalence, age and gender of participants, estimated effect
size (OR/RR), corresponding 95% CI, and covariates adjusted for in the statistical analysis.

Risk Factors for Combat-Related PTSD

If a study reported several multivariable-adjusted effect estimates, we selected the estimate that
adjusted for the most potential confounding variables.

Quality assessments were conducted independently by two investigators (C.X. and Y.G.)
using an 11-item instrument recommended by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quali-
ty (AHRQ) for cross-sectional studies [31] and the 9-star Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) [32]
for cohort studies. Studies with eight stars or more on the AHRQ and NOS were considered to
be of high quality. Where the two raters’ quality assessments differed, the original articles were
re-examined along with two more co-authors (Y.L. and P. K.) until a final quality rating was
agreed upon. The inter-rater reliability of the quality assessment between the two main raters
(C.X. and Y.G.) was high (Cohen’s kappa statistic, k = 0.68).

Statistical analysis

We examined risk factors for combat-related PTSD in military personnel based on the ORs
and 95% CIs reported in each study. A random-effects model, which assumes that the real po-
tential effect varies among included studies, was used to estimate the pooled RRs with 95% CIs.
Heterogeneity between studies was evaluated using the χ2 test and I2 statistic, with p values
lower than. 05 indicating heterogeneity and higher I2 values indicating greater variability
among trials than would be expected by chance alone (range: 0–100%) [33]. The probability of
publication bias was assessed using Egger’s regression test. If publication bias was present, we
tried to evaluate the effect of the publication bias using the trim and fill method [34].

The various differences among the studies might have influenced their results. Brewin et al.
examined the impact of six samples and study characteristics on the effect sizes of various risk
factors (e.g., type of trauma, gender of participants, analysis by diagnostic category versus con-
tinuous score) [3]. We considered that the quality of the study, deployment locations, and na-
tionalities of samples might contribute to variances in risk factors. First, studies of different
qualities would have used different study designs, measurement methods, statistical analysis,
and procedures, and therefore they would naturally have obtained differing results and differ-
ent quality scores. Seventeen articles (53.1% of those included) achieved a score of seven stars
or less, and thus were considered low quality. Second, different deployment years and locations
suggested differences in combat exposure and trauma severity levels. Twenty-one (65.6%) arti-
cles in our meta-analysis looked at military personnel and veterans who were deployed to Af-
ghanistan or/and Iraq after the year 2000; 11 (34.4%) articles focused on persons deployed to
other areas (e.g., Rwanda, Bosnia, Vietnam, Gulf) before the year 2000. Finally, different na-
tionalities would be associated with different socio-demographic and military characteristics—
21 articles (65.6%) focused on military persons from the United States, while 11 articles focused
on those from other countries, such as the United Kingdom, Australia, the Netherlands, and Is-
rael. To examine the possible effects of these variables on the study results, we conducted three
subgroup (high-quality versus low-quality study; deployment to Iraq or Afghanistan versus not
deployed to Iraq or Afghanistan; and from the United States versus not from the United States)
and sensitivity analyses in our meta-analysis. When risk factors were for multi-categorical vari-
ables (e.g., age, education level), we used the ORs of the highest versus the lowest category.

Stata Version 12.0 software (Stata Corp, College Station, TX) was used for all analyses and
all statistical tests were two-tailed. Values of p < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.

abstracts, and retained the remaining 198 articles for further evaluation by reading the full
texts. Finally, we selected 32 full-text articles about risk factors for combat-related PTSD in mil-
itary populations for our meta-analysis (Fig. 1)[6, 35–65], including 25 cohort studies (4 pro-
spectively studies, 21 retrospective studies), and 7 cross-sectional studies. Furthermore, 24
articles obtained their data through investigation (e.g., interview, questionnaire) of military
personnel and veterans after they returned from their deployment areas; 4 articles prospective-
ly studied personnel before and after deployment; and 4 articles obtained their data through a
clinical data center.

Table 1 shows the general characteristics of the 32 studies retained in the analyses, including

trauma type, sample size, PTSD measure, interview versus questionnaire assessment, age
range, percentage of the sample that was male, and the location of the study samples. Sample

Risk Factors for Combat-Related PTSD

sizes from individual studies ranged from 238 to 40,600. The method described above generat-
ed 27 risk factors that were explored by two or more studies and that could therefore be entered
into the meta-analysis.

Classification of risk factors

In the 32 studies included in the analyses, the risk factors for combat-related PTSD in military
personnel and veterans were as follows: (a) pre-trauma factors, including socio-demographic
factors (e.g., age, gender, race, education level, marital status), military characteristics (e.g.,
rank, branch of service, occupation, number of deployments, length of deployments), smoking
status, drinking status, low SES, prior life events, prior trauma, and prior psychological prob-
lems; (b) peri-trauma factors, including unit support, combat exposure, component, discharg-
ing a weapon, witnessing someone being wounded or killed, and trauma severity; and (c)
post-trauma factors, including comorbid psychological problems, subsequent life events, and
post-deployment support.

Study outcome

The prevalence of PTSD in military personnel and veterans ranged from 1.09% to 34.84%. The
risk factors for combat-related PTSD are presented in Table 2 and Fig. 2. Multiple pre-trauma
risk factors were associated with PTSD, including being female (OR = 1.63; 95% CI, 1.32–2.01),
being non-White (OR = 1.18; 95% CI, 1.06–1.31), having low education (OR = 1.33; 95% CI,
1.14–1.54), being non-officers (OR = 2.18; 95% CI, 1.84–2.57), serving in the army (OR = 2.30;
95% CI, 1.76–3.02), more deployments (OR = 1.24; 95% CI, 1.10–1.39), a longer cumulative
length of deployments (OR = 1.28; 95% CI, 1.13–1.45), experiencing adverse life events
(OR = 1.99; 95% CI, 1.55–2.57), experiencing prior trauma (OR = 1.13; 95% CI, 1.01–1.26),
and having prior psychological problems (OR = 1.49; 95% CI, 1.22–3.81). However, heteroge-
neity was found for race (I2 = 65.0%, p < 0.001), rank (I2 = 69.0%, p < 0.001), branch of service
(I2 = 91.6%, p < 0.001), occupation (I2 = 70.6%, p = 0.001), number of deployments
(I2 = 63.2%, p < 0.001), length of deployments (I2 = 71.4%, p = 0.004), experiencing adverse
life events (I2 = 59.8%, p = 0.011), and having prior psychological problems (I2 = 73.9%,
p < 0.001). Subgroup and sensitivity analyses indicated inconsistencies in the results for race,
marital status, length of deployments, smoking status, low SES, prior trauma, and prior psycho-
logical problems (Table 2). For example, in all studies, race (being non-White) is a positive risk
factor for PTSD—however, after excluding low-quality articles, race (non-White) was unrelat-
ed to the risk for PTSD. This was also true for the other aforementioned variables (e.g., marital
status, smoking, prior psychological problems). Thus, the results of these studies should be in-
terpreted with caution because of the potential bias. In addition, we found publication bias for
education (Egger’s test p = 0.01), marital status (Egger’s test p = 0.013), branch of service
(Egger’s test p = 0.03), length of deployment (Egger’s test p = 0.02), and prior psychological
problems (Egger’s test p = 0.03). After adjusting for the publication bias, the ORs were 1.51
(95% CI, 1.28–1.79) for education, 1.09 (95% CI, 0.97–1.23) for marital status, 2.30 (95% CI,
1.76–3.02) for branch of service, 1.10 (95% CI, 0.90–1.34) for the length of deployments, and
1.49 (95% CI, 1.22–1.82) for psychological problems.

With regard to the peri-trauma risk factors affecting military personnel and veterans, those

who were combat specialists were more likely to suffer from PTSD, with pooled ORs of 1.69
(95% CI, 1.39–2.05), respectively. In addition, the risk for PTSD increased with greater combat
exposure (OR = 2.10; 95% CI, 1.73–2.54), the experience of discharging a weapon (OR = 4.32;
95% CI, 2.60–7.18), witnessing someone being wounded or killed (OR = 3.12; 95% CI,
2.40–4.06), severe trauma (OR = 2.91; 95% CI, 1.85–4.56), and deployment-related stressors

(OR = 2.69; 95% CI, 1.46–4.96). Heterogeneity was found for unit support (I2 = 51.7%,
p = 0.053), combat exposure (I2 = 97.3%, p < 0.001), component (I2 = 97.9%, p < 0.001),
discharging a weapon (I2 = 90.0%, p < 0.001), witnessing someone be wounded/killed
(I2 = 56.3%, p = 0.043), and trauma severity (I2 = 96.8%, p < 0.001). We found inconsistencies
in the results for length of deployments in the subgroup and sensitivity analyses. We also
found a publication bias for combat exposure (Egger’s test p = 0.008), and component (Egger’s
test p = 0.01). After adjusting for the publication bias, the ORs were 0.74 (95% CI, 0.55–0.93)
for combat exposure, and 0.81 (95% CI, 0.60–1.11) for component.

Finally, analysis of the post-trauma factors showed that comorbid psychological problems
and subsequent life events were not positively related to PTSD, while post-deployment support
was a protective factor (OR = 0.37, 95% CI, 0.18–0.77). However, heterogeneity was found for
post-deployment support (I2 = 92.6%, p < 0.001), and there were inconsistencies in the results
for comorbid psychological problems, subsequent life events, and post-deployment support in
the subgroup and sensitivity analyses. That means military persons suffered from subsequent
life events were more likely to get PTSD after they came back from Iraq or Afghanistan. This
was also true for comorbid psychological problems and post-deployment support (Table 2).

Discussion

To our knowledge, this is the first meta-analysis focusing on risk factors for combat-related
PTSD in military personnel and veterans. Specifically, 27 risk factors for military PTSD were
investigated across 32 observational studies (25 cohort studies, 7 cross-sectional studies) pub-
lished between 1980 and April 2014. Our synthesis of the relevant articles published in English
provided strong evidence of risk factors for combat-related PTSD. Approximately 11 out of 27
risk factors (41%) were investigated in ten or more studies. Although an increasing number of
researchers have been studying combat-related PTSD in the past 30 years, only a limited num-
ber of variables have been routinely investigated [26]. In comparison, in a meta-analysis of risk
factors for PTSD among trauma-exposed adults (based mostly on retrospective data) 11 of 14
risk factors (79%) had been considered in 10 or more studies; in that meta-analysis, psychiatric
history, life stress, and other previous traumas were not strong risk factors for the development
of PTSD among military service members [3]. Thus, the present study highlights the need for
further investigation of some very basic potential risk factors, such as age, smoking status, and
prior psychological problems.

Pre-trauma factors

Pre-trauma factors have been reported in many studies. In this article, we focused on socio-
demographic factors, military characteristics, prior psychological factors, and other prior trau-
matic experiences. Socio-demographic factors such as age have received attention; however,
the results have been mixed [66]. Specifically, the impact of being younger at the time of trau-
ma on the risk of developing PTSD has been difficult to predict given the contradictory effects
of age on various processes underlying traumatic stress reactions [67–69]. Approximately

Risk Factors for Combat-Related PTSD

19 studies included in our meta-analysis examined age as a risk factor for combat-related
PTSD; the results suggest that a younger age at the time of trauma is largely unrelated to PTSD.
In addition, subgroup analyses revealed that there was no statistically significantly relationship
between age and PTSD when only analyzing studies conducted among Americans deployed to
Iraq or Afghanistan, This finding was not found in individuals deployed to other areas such as
Vietnam and the Persian Gulf and for military service members from other countries. This re-
sult was somewhat different from the results published by Koenen et al. and Booth-Kewley
et al. [6, 62], that indicated that a younger age was a strong risk factor for PTSD. However, in
our analysis, military samples were divided into a number of diverse age brackets across 19 of
the studies, therefore, we decided to code age dichotomously (younger groups vs. older groups).
Thus, it is not advisable to draw conclusions about the age brackets that are vulnerable.

Over the past 20 years, the number of women serving in the military has increased, and that

number is projected to continue to increase; this may increase women’s risk for developing
mental health disorders [70]. Gender was also a predictor in our meta-analysis; females were
more likely to experience PTSD following combat than were males. This finding supports re-
search conducted among Army soldiers deployed to combat zones, where PTSD symptoms
were found to be more common among women than in studies that compared men and
women [35, 71]. A number of factors may account for these findings. However, the main rea-
sons appear to be that women report lower military preparedness and less unit cohesion, and
have higher rates of depression [72].

Moreover, it has been argued that women are more likely than are men to experience sexual
assault and childhood sexual abuse; however, they are less likely to experience accidents; non-
sexual assaults; and to witness death, injury, disaster, combat, and war [73]. The experience of
childhood sexual abuse may exacerbate PTSD in adulthood; indeed, Breslau et al. confirmed
this notion in their study using data from an epidemiologic survey. Their results were consis-
tent with those of Brewin et al. [3, 74, 75]. Importantly, only one article (LeardMann, 2010)
that met the criteria for inclusion in our meta-analysis reported relations between sexual abuse
and PTSD; thus, given the low number of studies included herein, we cannot make any conclu-
sions about the relations between childhood sexual abuse and PTSD,

Beyond the relations between abuse and PTSD, there are other reasons why females may
have more PTSD. For instance, females are more sensitive to threats, less likely to use effective
coping strategies, and tend to interpret trauma more negatively than males [73]. In addition,
when faced with unexpected trauma, men are probably just as frightened as women are, but
women are often more willing to report feeling negative emotions. This relation may also be at-
tributed to studies that women were observed to be avoidant, on guard, easily startled, and
flooded with memories and images of an assault that could not be easily dispelled [26, 76]. Fe-
males are also thought to be more sensitive to stress hormones, possibly reducing their ability
to manage stressful situations [77]. Beyond hormones, it may also be that women do not bene-
fit from some of the protective factors that benefit men; for instance, unit cohesion has been
shown to benefit men more than women [78, 79].

The additional socio-demographic risk factors associated with PTSD in military personnel
and veterans were race (minority ethnic groups) and education (lower education levels). Specif-
ically, non-white military service members were more likely to suffer from PTSD than whites
military service members. The reason, why minority military persons may be at risk for more
negative consequences from PTSD remains under debate; however, it may be that minority in-
dividuals who serve in the military have higher levels of other pre- or post-trauma risk factors,
or they may be more likely to be assigned to high combat roles. It is important to note that this
variable was coded in a dichotomous fashion (white versus black/ethnic minority); therefore,
important differences between minority ethnic groups may have been masked herein[3, 11].

Risk Factors for Combat-Related PTSD

To the point of education, different educational levels indirectly influences multiple, including
economic resources, social status, social networks, and health behavior. Therefore, military ser-
vice members with higher education levels may use better coping methods because they access
to more resources, thereby reducing the incidence of depression. However, it is important to
note that marital status did not have an effect on PTSD in this meta-analysis; this finding con-
tradicts some previous military research. For instance, Smith et al. indicated that military per-
sons were at a substantially higher risk for possible PTSD if they were divorced than if they
were currently married or never married [6, 80].Thus, future research should explore the rela-
tionship between marital status and PTSD.

When military characteristics were examined, military rank (i.e., non-officers), branch of
service (i.e., Army), occupation (i.e., combat specialists), cumulative length of deployments
(i.e., longer), and number of deployments (i.e., (cid:1)2) were important contributors to the devel-
opment of combat-related PTSD. Non-officers and supply personnel were more likely to be di-
agnosed with PTSD; this may be because of their increased combat exposure [39]. Other
studies have also show that PTSD is higher among enlisted personnel than among officers [81];
Booth-Kooley et al. proposed that this occurs because enlisted personnel reenter society with-
out close connections to military members with similar experiences, or because military
deployment has a greater negative impact on home life for reservists than for officers. Com-
pared to Army personnel, those in the Marines, Air Force, Navy, or Coast Guard are signifi-
cantly less likely to report symptoms of PTSD [61]. Few studies have examined military
occupation in relation to combat exposure, or how occupation mediates links between combat
exposure and mental health. In one of the few studies conducted in this area, Mayo et al. indi-
cated that combat specialists were at a greater risk for new-onset PTSD compared with health
specialists, service supply, and functional personnel [39]. It was speculated that these difference
were found because military persons have more and longer deployment. Thus, military persons
were at a higher risk for an enemy attack and increased combat exposure; this put them at
higher risk for the development of PTSD.

Although smoking status was not positively related to PTSD in this meta-analysis, Barrett

indicated that current and former smokers were more likely to meet the criteria for PTSD
when compared with those who reported never smoking [61]. The association between smok-
ing and PTSD has been previously found among U.S. veterans of the Vietnam War [2]. Howev-
er, most studies focusing on smoking and other adverse health behaviors, such as alcohol and
drug use, use self-report screeners rather than more structured diagnostic approaches; there-
fore, there could be a possible bi-directional effect. That is, those who smoke may have more
PTSD symptoms or PTSD symptoms may lead them to smoke. This factor remains unclear
and merits further study.

Pre-trauma factors (i.e., life events, pre-trauma psychological problems, and prior exposure
to trauma) were also related to the development of combat-related PTSD. However, these find-
ings were somewhat different from those reported in the meta-analysis by Brewin (2000).
Specifically, Brewin (2000) found that the effects of pre-trauma factors were mediated by sub-
sequent trauma factors or individual responses to the trauma. That is, the effects of these vari-
ables are distal rather than proximal, and their impact is diluted by one or more intervening
variables [3].

There is a common thread between prior exposure to adverse life events and the exposed
person’s own psychological problems as predictors of PTSD. Psychological problems—which
can both create and result from poorer social support—play some role in the risk of PTSD after
exposure to traumatic stressors [26]. Most studies have used cross-sectional or retrospective
data. These studies do not have pre-deployment data on the mental health status of military
samples, and only a small number of studies have examined the relationship between existing

Risk Factors for Combat-Related PTSD

disorders and combat-related PTSD. Thus, it is difficult to ascertain the effects of decreased
mental or physical health on the onset or persistence of symptoms of PTSD. Some studies have
also found that prior sexual abuse may increase military person’s vulnerability or resilience fol-
lowing potentially traumatic events [26]; since women are more often exposed to sexual abuse
than men, this finding may also help to explain the heightened PTSD prevalence
among women.

Peri-trauma factors

Deployment-related variables like combat exposure were significantly associated with combat-
related PTSD. Deployed personnel with combat exposure reported more symptoms of PTSD
than those deployed individuals without combat exposure. This is similar to previous findings
that PTSD risk increased among combat soldiers who returned from Vietnam, the Persian
Gulf, Iraq and Afghanistan, who had increased combat exposure, multiple deployments, and
longer deployments [5, 82, 83]. Researchers have also reported that greater elapsed time from
military active duty worry about family life during deployment, and separation from military
service were significantly risk factors for PTSD [50, 84].

Although combat exposure is considered the leading stressor of war, many researchers have

emphasized the importance of deployment-related stressors on PTSD; these deployment-
related stressors include excessive heat or cold, concerns or problems with family members
back home, boredom, lack of privacy, and problems with leadership [6]. In addition, Enge-
khard et al. indicated that noncombat stressors such as operational stressors, low-magnitude
stressors, and contextual stressors also play an important role in the development of PTSD.
However, service component difference did not emerge in this meta-analysis.

Military personnel were more likely to develop PTSD if they discharged a weapon or wit-
nessed an injury or death during their deployment. Discharging a weapon is likely to generate
a traumatic memory directly associated with the negative event, this is considered an important
precursor to combat-related PTSD. It is likely that military service members who witnessed
someone being injured or killed during deployment experienced intense fear at that time.

In addition, the relationship between being injured and PTSD may be related to the severity

of the injuries (e.g., injuries resulting in amputation and disability). The onset of disability is
likely to reduce the quality of life in military personnel and veterans that may lead to PTSD.
This is consistent with what Trickey et al.’s findings; specifically, they reported that trauma se-
verity was strongly associated with the risk of developing PTSD. However, they also indicated
that the effect of trauma severity was complex, since the objective measurement was complicat-
ed by a number of conceptual factors [11]. Other studies have also demonstrated a link between
physical injury and PTSD. For example, in a recent meta-analysis, Ozer et al. indicated that the
strongest predictors of PTSD were psychological processes during the traumatic event [26].
MacGregor confirmed that injuries occurring in battle were more strongly associated with
PTSD when compared with non-battle injuries [38].

Post-trauma factors

Post-deployment support, subsequent life stress, and comorbid psychological problems are
among the personal factors that have been considered as possible risk factors for PTSD [85]. A
positive recovery environment after trauma exposure may serve as a protective factor. For in-
stance, social support is associated with a lower PTSD risk in both the general population and
military settings [3, 26]. High levels of social care and support may foster feelings of self-
reliance and self-security among military people; these feelings protect against PTSD. Further-
more, military people who were unemployed after their military service were more likely to

Risk Factors for Combat-Related PTSD

exhibit post-combat PTSD symptoms. This suggests that a loss of resources diminishes veter-
ans’ ability to care for their families to the same extent as before the deployment. In other
words, it also highlights the importance of reducing the risk of PTSD.

In the current meta-analysis, comorbid psychological problems were not risk factors for de-
veloping combat-related PTSD; thus, the relationship between comorbidities and PTSD is still
unclear. In a systematic review, mixed results suggesting that comorbid psychological problems
may be risk factors for PTSD following combat exposure, or that PTSD may be a predictor of
comorbid psychological problems, or that they may share common risk factors [86]. However,
another study by Trickey et al. revealed that comorbid psychological problems (e.g., anxiety,
depression) were significant risk factors, and depression was the most predictive of PTSD [11].
Thus, future research should examine psychiatric reactions after the combat exposure.

Limitations

It is important to note that our study had some limitations. To begin, this meta-analysis only
included observational studies; most data were based on self-report measures, that can be
prone to biases in sample selection, recall, and information evaluation, as well as confounding
biases. There was also significant heterogeneity among the studies due to sampling, design,
measurement, and statistical analysis. This is not uncommon in reviews of observational stud-
ies [87]. Furthermore, many of the variables included in the analyses were only examined in a
small proportion of studies, thereby limiting the generalizability of the findings. Moreover, the
32 studies we included contained data from only a small number of female participants who
were deployed to combat areas, as previously noted, women may have unique risk factors for
PTSD that were not confirmed in our article, including experiences of sexual assault and child-
hood sexual abuse. This should be examined more closely in future research.

In addition, all of the studies involved deployed personnel and assumed that trauma expo-
sure was combat related. However, the nature of the traumas leading to PTSD cannot be con-
firmed, given the self-report nature of the studies. Finally, we were not able to reveal the exact
nature of the relationship between the risk factors; therefore, better levels of prediction could
occur by aggregating these risk factors. Thus, investigations of interaction, mediator, and mod-
erator effects are necessary. Nevertheless, our study highlights areas that will benefit from
further investigation.

Conclusion

In conclusion, despite some limitations of the studies included in the meta-analysis, this study
revealed positive relationships between several predictors and PTSD among military personnel
and veterans. As previously noted, beyond the traumatic event itself, individual and social vul-
nerability factors influence the development of PTSD. In our study, we examined the risk fac-
tors for PTSD based on the ORs/RRs and 95% CIs reported in each study; our analysis revealed
that the relatively larger estimated effect size of predictors were adverse peri-deployment events
(e.g., discharged a weapon, saw someone wounded/killed), trauma severity, and adverse life
events. Thus, more attention should be given to the role of personal and environment variables
in predicting PTSD.

In general, the present study has implications for the theoretical understanding of PTSD
and can help military health service workers reduce the incidence of PTSD among military ser-
vice members. First, this research may provide ideas for military leaders and policy makers to
establish programs to improve assessments, prevention efforts, and interventions for combat-
related PTSD. Specifically, it is necessary to understand the health of military personnel since
assessing the mental health of military personnel before their deployment is easy to initiate.

Risk Factors for Combat-Related PTSD

Indeed, military leaders and society should provide continuous support to military persons be-
fore, during, and after their deployment. Second, these results can help clinicians understand
the relevant risk factors and provide treatment prior to difficulties becoming chronic. Addi-
tionally, clinicians should pay more attention to previously existing mental disorders in
military personnel.

Importantly, there are some issues that require further study. First, the varying effects of
ages, ethnicity, and branch of service should be explored in future research. Second, and the
most importantly, the thrust of future research should be on the more proximal mechanisms
or processes in the development of combat-related PTSD; moreover, researchers should work
to better understand how these variables interact and how to better protect military personnel
from combat-related PTSD.
