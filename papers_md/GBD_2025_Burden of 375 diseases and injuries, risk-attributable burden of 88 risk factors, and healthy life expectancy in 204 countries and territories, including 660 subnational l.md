Summary
Background For more than three decades, the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) has 
provided a framework to quantify health loss due to diseases, injuries, and associated risk factors. This paper presents 
GBD 2023 findings on disease and injury burden and risk-attributable health loss, offering a global audit of the state 
of world health to inform public health priorities. This work captures the evolving landscape of health metrics across 
age  groups,  sexes,  and  locations,  while  reflecting  on  the  remaining  post-COVID-19  challenges  to  achieving  our 
collective global health ambitions.

Methods The GBD 2023 combined analysis estimated years lived with disability (YLDs), years of life lost (YLLs), and 
disability-adjusted  life-years  (DALYs)  for  375  diseases  and  injuries,  and  risk-attributable  burden  associated  with 
88 modifiable risk factors. Of the more than 310 000 total data sources used for all GBD 2023 (about 30% of which 
were new to this estimation round), more than 120 000 sources were used for estimation of disease and injury burden 
and 59 000 for risk factor estimation, and included vital registration systems, surveys, disease registries, and published 
scientific literature. Data were analysed using previously established modelling approaches, such as disease modelling 
meta-regression version 2.1 (DisMod-MR 2.1) and comparative risk assessment methods. Diseases and injuries were 
categorised into four levels on the basis of the established GBD cause hierarchy, as were risk factors using the GBD 
risk hierarchy. Estimates stratified by age, sex, location, and year from 1990 to 2023 were focused on disease-specific 
time trends over the 2010–23 period and presented as counts (to three significant figures) and age-standardised rates 
per 100 000 person-years (to one decimal place). For each measure, 95% uncertainty intervals [UIs] were calculated 
with the 2∙5th and 97∙5th percentile ordered values from a 250-draw distribution.

Findings  Total  numbers  of  global  DALYs  grew  6·1%  (95%  UI  4·0–8·1),  from  2·64  billion  (2·46–2·86)  in  2010 
to  2·80  billion  (2·57–3·08)  in  2023,  but  age-standardised  DALY  rates,  which  account  for  population  growth  and 
ageing,  decreased  by  12·6%  (11·0–14·1),  revealing  large  long-term  health  improvements.  Non-communicable 
diseases (NCDs) contributed 1·45 billion (1·31–1·61) global DALYs in 2010, increasing to 1·80 billion (1·63–2·03) 
in  2023,  alongside  a  concurrent  4·1%  (1·9–6·3)  reduction  in  age-standardised  rates.  Based  on  DALY  counts,  the 
leading  level  3  NCDs  in  2023  were  ischaemic  heart  disease  (193  million  [176–209]  DALYs),  stroke  (157  million 
[141–172]),  and  diabetes  (90·2  million  [75·2–107]),  with  the  largest  increases  in  age-standardised  rates  since  2010 
occurring for anxiety disorders (62·8% [34·0–107·5]), depressive disorders (26·3% [11·6–42·9]), and diabetes (14·9% 
[7·5–25·6]).  Remarkable  health  gains  were  made  for  communicable,  maternal,  neonatal,  and  nutritional  (CMNN) 
diseases,  with  DALYs  falling  from  874  million  (837–917)  in  2010  to  681  million  (642–736)  in  2023,  and  a 
25·8% (22·6–28·7) reduction in age-standardised DALY rates. During the COVID-19 pandemic, DALYs due to CMNN 
diseases rose but returned to pre-pandemic levels by 2023. From 2010 to 2023, decreases in age-standardised rates for 
CMNN diseases were led by rate decreases of 49·1% (32·7–61·0) for diarrhoeal diseases, 42·9% (38·0–48·0) for HIV/
AIDS,  and  42·2%  (23·6–56·6)  for  tuberculosis.  Neonatal  disorders  and  lower  respiratory  infections  remained  the 
leading level 3 CMNN causes globally in 2023, although both showed notable rate decreases from 2010, declining 
by  16·5%  (10·6–22·0)  and  24·8%  (7·4–36·7),  respectively.  Injury-related  age-standardised  DALY  rates  decreased 
by  15·6%  (10·7–19·8)  over  the  same  period.  Differences  in  burden  due  to  NCDs,  CMNN  diseases,  and  injuries 
persisted across age, sex, time, and location. Based on our risk analysis, nearly 50% (1·27 billion [1·18–1·38]) of the 
roughly 2·80 billion total global DALYs in 2023 were attributable to the 88 risk factors analysed in GBD. Globally, the 
five  level  3  risk  factors  contributing  the  highest  proportion  of  risk-attributable  DALYs  were  high  systolic  blood 
pressure (SBP), particulate matter pollution, high fasting plasma glucose (FPG), smoking, and low birthweight and 
short gestation—with high SBP accounting for 8·4% (6·9–10·0) of total DALYs. Of the three overarching level 1 GBD 
risk  factor  categories—behavioural,  metabolic,  and  environmental  and  occupational—risk-attributable  DALYs  rose 
between 2010 and 2023 only for metabolic risks, increasing by 30·7% (24·8–37·3); however, age-standardised DALY

Articlesrates  attributable  to  metabolic  risks  decreased  by  6·7%  (2·0–11·0)  over  the  same  period.  For  all  but  three  of  the 
25  leading  level  3  risk  factors,  age-standardised  rates  dropped  between  2010  and  2023—eg,  declining  by  54·4% 
(38·7–65·3) for unsafe sanitation, 50·5% (33·3–63·1) for unsafe water source, and 45·2% (25·6–72·0) for no access 
to handwashing facility, and by 44·9% (37·3–53·5) for child growth failure. The three leading level 3 risk factors for 
which age-standardised attributable DALY rates rose were high BMI (10·5% [0·1 to 20·9]), drug use (8·4% [2·6 to 
15·3]), and high FPG (6·2% [–2·7 to 15·6]; non-significant).

Interpretation Our  findings  underscore  the  complex  and  dynamic  nature  of  global  health  challenges.  Since  2010, 
there  have  been  large  decreases  in  burden  due  to  CMNN  diseases  and  many  environmental  and  behavioural  risk 
factors, juxtaposed with sizeable increases in DALYs attributable to metabolic risk factors and NCDs in growing and 
ageing populations. This long-observed consequence of the global epidemiological transition was only temporarily 
interrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The substantially decreasing CMNN disease burden, despite the 2008 global 
financial  crisis  and  pandemic-related  disruptions,  is  one  of  the  greatest  collective  public  health  successes  known. 
However, these achievements are at risk of being reversed due to major cuts to development assistance for health 
globally,  the  effects  of  which  will  hit  low-income  countries  with  high  burden  the  hardest.  Without  sustained 
investment in evidence-based interventions and policies, progress could stall or reverse, leading to widespread human 
costs and geopolitical instability. Moreover, the rising NCD burden necessitates intensified efforts to mitigate exposure 
to leading risk factors—eg, air pollution, smoking, and metabolic risks, such as high SBP, BMI, and FPG—including 
policies that promote food security, healthier diets, physical activity, and equitable and expanded access to potential 
treatments,  such  as  GLP-1  receptor  agonists.  Decisive,  coordinated  action  is  needed  to  address  long-standing  yet 
growing health challenges, including depressive and anxiety disorders. Yet this can be only part of the solution. Our 
response to the NCD syndemic—the complex interaction of multiple health risks, social determinants, and systemic 
challenges—will define the future landscape of global health. To ensure human wellbeing, economic stability, and 
social  equity,  global  action  to  sustain  and  advance  health  gains  must  prioritise  reducing  disparities  by  addressing 
socioeconomic  and  demographic  determinants,  ensuring  equitable  health-care  access,  tackling  malnutrition, 
strengthening health systems, and improving vaccination coverage. We live in times of great opportunity.

Introduction
High-quality,  comprehensive,  mutually  exclusive,  and 
timely  estimates  of  health  and  health  loss  produced 
through  the  Global  Burden  of  Diseases,  Injuries,  and 
Risk  Factors  Study  (GBD)  are  a  valuable  source  of 
publicly accessible health data. For more than 30 years, 
GBD  has  equipped  researchers,  policy  makers,  and  the 
public with evidence-based tools to better understand the 
global  impact  of  diseases,  injuries,  and  modifiable  risk 
factors  at  the  population  level.1  GBD  has  enabled  close, 
quantitative monitoring of progress towards international 
health 
the  UN  Sustainable 
Development Goals (SDGs). An early innovation of GBD 
was  the  metric  of  disability-adjusted  life-years  (DALYs), 
which  measures  overall  disease  burden  as  the  years  of 
lost health and life combined, and has been adopted by 
global  health  institutions  such  as  WHO.  More  recent 
work, including reports by WHO World Health Statistics2 
the NCD Risk Factor Collaboration, and the Prospective 
Urban and Rural Epidemiological (PURE) study, provide 
estimates  for  specific  diseases  or  risk  factors;  however,

Evidence before this study
Since its inception in the early 1990s, the Global Burden of 
Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) has 
systematically quantified health and health loss across time, 
age, sex, location, and sociodemographic groups. GBD 
introduced and uses disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) as a 
measure of disease burden that captures disability and 
premature mortality. DALYs have been widely adopted by WHO, 
the UN, and public health agencies to measure overall disease 
burden in a population. Previous research efforts, including 
WHO World Health Statistics and initiatives such as the NCD 
Risk Factor Collaboration and the Prospective Urban and Rural 
Epidemiological (PURE) study, have advanced understanding of 
specific diseases or risk factors and, like GBD, are continuously 
updated, making it possible to track progress towards the UN 
Sustainable Development Goals. GBD stands out for its 
comprehensive scope, wealth of data, and rigorous 
methodological provenance and updates, as well as its global 
coverage and commitment to reporting scientific findings free 
of political bias and the influence of special interests.

Added value of this study
GBD 2023 analysed 375 diseases and injuries and 88 modifiable 
risk factors, providing updated estimates of prevalence, 
incidence, years lived with disability (YLDs), years of life 
lost (YLLs), DALYs, and risk-attributable DALYs for 
204 countries and territories from 1990 to 2023. Our estimates 
of burden improved on those from GBD 2021 by the inclusion 
of data from more than 35 000 new sources, with particularly 
notable increases in data used to estimate the burden of 
diseases such as ischaemic heart disease, chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease, and tuberculosis. Analyses were extended 
to five new causes: ulcerative colitis; Crohn’s disease; thyroid 
diseases; other endocrine, metabolic, blood, and immune 
disorders; and electrocution. “Other pandemic-related 
outcomes” was removed as a cause. Additionally, we began to 
transition our primary tool to model prevalence from disease 
modelling meta-regression version 2.1 (DisMod-MR 2.1) to 
disease modelling age-time (DisMod-AT), which more 
effectively captures temporal trends in data. GBD 2023 
advanced risk factor analyses from previous GBD cycles, 
strengthening attributable burden estimates by conducting 
85 new or updated systematic reviews and incorporating 

additional data from more than 16 000 new sources, 
particularly for intimate partner violence, lead exposure, high 
BMI, and high fasting plasma glucose. Based on new evidence 
or further specification of outcomes or mediation factors, 
50 new risk–outcome pairs, such as the relationship between 
particulate matter pollution and dementia, were analysed; 
two pairs were excluded (child wasting and malaria, and high 
alcohol use and nasopharynx cancer) for not meeting inclusion 
criteria or for overlapping with other outcomes. In total, 
676 risk–outcome pairs were analysed for GBD 2023. Methods 
were updated for specific risk factors, notably regarding 
estimation of burden attributable to lead exposure and revision 
of the theoretical minimum risk exposure level for diet high in 
trans fatty acids.

Implications of all the available evidence
This study reaffirms that the global epidemiological transition 
has continued up to 2023. Although the COVID-19 pandemic 
temporarily disrupted health trends, the long-term decline in 
burden due to communicable, maternal, neonatal, and 
nutritional (CMNN) diseases has continued, whereas absolute 
burden of NCDs has risen sharply, largely due to demographic 
changes. It is an opportune time to revisit these two patterns at 
the highest policy levels. First, acknowledging and celebrating 
the staggering success of reducing the impact of CMNN 
diseases worldwide is important, alongside warnings that 
progress is fragile. The threats of stagnation or resurgence do 
not recede simply because our global policy focus might shift. 
Second, there is an opportunity to make substantial progress in 
reducing the burden of NCDs across sociodemographic strata. 
Since our present analyses show that almost half of total 
disease burden is attributable to specific modifiable risk 
factors—with increasing contributions, especially in ageing 
populations, of metabolic risks (eg, high systolic blood pressure, 
smoking, lead exposure, and ambient particulate matter air 
pollution)—considerable progress can be made by addressing 
risk-attributable burden, although successful mitigation varies 
substantially across risk factors. Equitable scaling of 
implementation remains a challenge, requiring coordinated 
policy efforts, targeted prevention strategies, and strengthened 
health-care systems to mitigate disparities and improve 
population health outcomes.

historically  high  burden  of  infectious  diseases.7  These 
advances  underscore  how  the  GBD  framework  has 
progressively illuminated the changing nature of global 
disease  burden,  reinforcing  the  need  for  targeted 
interventions  to  mitigate  the  growing  impact  of  NCDs, 
while  sustaining  infectious  disease  control  efforts. 
GBD  2023  shows  disease  burden  trends  amid  a 
fundamentally  altered  and  severely  constrained  global 
health financing system. As global budget cuts threaten 
progress  towards  the  SDGs,  future  iterations  of  GBD 

must prioritise monitoring of the impact on populations 
globally. GBD 2023 can inform priorities for international 
health  agendas,  while  anticipating  demographic  trends, 
the growing burden of NCDs, and other challenges.

The  comparative  risk  assessment  framework  of  GBD 
has  continually  advanced  in  methodology  and  scope. 
Risk factor estimates have been a part of GBD since its 
inception.  GBD  2010  refined  a  unified  methodological 
foundation  by  systematically  quantifying  67  risk  factors

As part of The Lancet’s serialisation of GBD, GBD 2023 
continues  this  theme  by  analysing  the  relationships 
between  375  diseases  and  injuries  and  88  risk  factors 
together  in  a  single  framework.  GBD  2023  provides 
detailed and comprehensive estimates of health loss over 
the period of 1990–2023 to highlight major global trends 
that have preceded and persisted beyond the COVID-19 
pandemic. GBD 2023 facilitates a deeper understanding 
of  health  disparities  within  and  across  populations, 
evaluates how differential health outcomes have changed 
over  time,  quantifies  health  improvements  and  gains, 
and  serves  as  a  valuable  resource  to  help  identify  the 
specific  policies  and  targeted  interventions  that  will  be 
most  impactful.  Here,  the  key  GBD  2023  findings  are 
presented for metrics quantifying health and health loss, 
including  prevalence,  incidence,  YLDs,  years  of  life 
lost  (YLLs),  and  DALYs.  Metrics  used  to  measure  the 
attributable  burden  of  risk  factors  include  relative  risk 
and risk-attributable DALYs. The estimation of causes of 
deaths and YLLs for GBD 2023 is reported in a separate 
publication.16

Methods
Overview
For  each  GBD  round,  newly  available  data  and  refined

results  therefore  supersede  all  previous  estimates. 
GBD  2023  methods  closely  followed  those  used  in 
GBD 2021.7,13 A summary of the methods is given, with 
emphasis on any notable improvements; a more detailed 
description 
in 
appendix 1 and appendix 2. Based on review and approval 
by the GBD Scientific Council, which considers factors 
such  as  policy 
relevance,  data  availability,  and 
epidemiological profile, we report here for the first time 
on health outcomes for five additional causes: ulcerative 
thyroid  diseases;  other 
colitis;  Crohn’s  disease; 
endocrine,  metabolic,  blood,  and  immune  disorders; 
and  electrocution.  The  cause  introduced  in  GBD  2021 
titled  “other  pandemic-related  outcomes”  was  removed 
because improved data availability since 2021 allowed for 
more precise assignment of pandemic-related outcomes 
to  specific  causes.16  These  changes  bring  the  total 
number of diseases and injuries reported in GBD 2023 
to 375. We improved our burden estimates through the 
incorporation  of  data  from  more  than  35 000  new 
sources.  Moreover,  we  began  transitioning  from  our 
principal  tool  to  model  prevalence—disease  modelling 
meta-regression version 2.1 (DisMod-MR 2.1; appendix 1 
section  2.6)—to  an  updated  version,  disease  modelling 
age-time 
the  main 
(DisMod-AT),  with  one  of 
improvements  being  the  ability  to  factor  cohort  effects 
over  time  and  location-level  covariates  by  age  and  sex 
(appendix 1 section 2.7). This allows us to model changes 
in prevalence or incidence among specific age cohorts as 
population  segments  grow  older  to  more  accurately 
reflect  how  disease  patterns  evolve  over  time,  which  is 
important 
changing 
epidemiology,  such  as  diabetes.  Data  availability  by 
location  and  year  for  modelling  of  disease  and  injury 
burden  is  included  in  appendix  1  (figures  S1,  S2). 
Additionally, changes to the estimation of impairments 
and  aetiologies  have  been  made  for  GBD  2023 
(appendix  1  sections  2.8,  6).  Similarly,  by  adding  more 
than  16 000  new  data  sources  on  risk  factors,  we 
improved 
risk-attributable  burden 
(appendix  2  table  S7).  For  GBD  2023,  we  conducted 
85  new  or  updated  systematic  reviews  of  the  literature 
on relative risk (appendix 2 section 2.1.3) and risk factor 
exposure (appendix 2 section 2.2.1). No new risk factors 
were  added  for  GBD  2023;  however,  based  on  new 
evidence  or  further  specification  of  outcomes,  50  new 
risk–outcome  pairs  were  added,  eight  of  which  were 
based  on  further  specification  of  mediation  factors. 
Two pairs were removed from the analysis (appendix 2 
table  S3).  Across  all  analytical  components  of  the  risk 
factor estimation process, 676 risk–outcome pairs were 
analysed  for  GBD  2023.  Details  of  our  standardised 
inclusion  and  exclusion  criteria  for  GBD  2023  risk–
outcome pairs are provided in appendix 2 (section 2.1.1). 
We also updated our methods for certain risk–outcome 
pairs, such as lead exposure and ischaemic heart disease 
(appendix 2 section 4). The inclusion of new data sources

and  methodological 
improvements  for  GBD  2023 
contributed  to  improvements  in  internal  consistency, 
trend stability, and cross-source harmonisation.

Data sources and processing
Details  for  all  data  sources  used  for  disease  and  injury 
burden and for risk factor estimation for GBD 2023 are 
available  online  via  the  GBD  2023  Sources  Tool  on  the 
Global Health Data Exchange. All data sources underwent 
strict  systematic  quality  assurance  processes.1  Data 
sources ensure quality by applying data-vetting protocols 
to  assess 
internal  consistency,  completeness,  and 
plausibility;  using  tools,  such  as  MR-BRT  (meta-
regression—Bayesian,  regularised,  trimmed),  to  adjust 
for  known  biases;  and  cross-validating  new  sources 
against existing datasets.

Burden of diseases and injuries
DALY  calculations  for  GBD  2023  were  based  on  more 
than  120 000  cause-related  data  sources,  of  which  more 
than  35 000  were  newly  added  between  GBD  2021  and 
the current release. Cause-related sources included more 
than 98 000 total entries, distributed over 50 000 incidence-
related  and  25 000  prevalence-related  sources,  and  a 
range  of  other  sources  necessary  for  tracking  severity 
splits,  duration,  and  similar  characteristics.  GBD  2023 
included newly incorporated data sources on numerous 
causes, including cardiovascular diseases (eg, ischaemic 
heart disease and ischaemic stroke), chronic obstructive 
pulmonary  disease,  tuberculosis,  asthma,  and  chronic 
kidney  disease.  Notable  changes  were  most  evident  in 
chronic  respiratory  conditions  and  in  specific  regions 
where the inclusion of new data addressed gaps. Details 
on  data  sources  for  YLLs  are  documented  in  another 
publication16 and are available via the GBD 2023 Sources 
Tool.  Estimates  of  burden  reported  here  draw  from  a 
wide  range  of  sources,  including  scientific  literature, 
household  surveys,  disease  registries,  and  clinical 
informatics, as detailed in appendix 1 (section 2.1). The 
process  for  conducting  cause-specific  literature  reviews 
is  detailed  in  appendix  1  (section  2.1.1).  The  search 
strategy  covered  online  research  databases,  public 
governmental  and  international  organisation  websites, 
and  published  reports,  as  well  as  contributions  of 
primary data from GBD collaborators. The methods and 
data sources for fatal estimates, such as vital registration 
systems, are discussed in a separate publication.16

Cause-related  data  with  known  biases,  such  as 
alternative  case  definitions  or  measurement  methods, 
were  adjusted  using  the  meta-regression  tool  MR-BRT 
(appendix  1  section  2.5).15  The  adjustment  process 
involved  analysing  paired  estimates  based  on  reference 
and  alternative  case  definitions  for  the  same  age,  sex, 
location, and year. For data sources without sex-specific 
information, we applied a correction factor derived from 
the  pooled,  within-study  sex  ratios.  Data  missing  both 
age and sex details were adjusted using a process (age-sex 

splitting) that leverages within-source sex ratios to adjust 
age-specific data from sources that reported by age and 
by sex separately. When data sources spanned wide age 
ranges  (typically  >25  years),  we  derived  more  granular 
age-specific estimates using age patterns based on other 
available data sources (appendix 1 section 2.3.5).

Data  processing  also  extended  to  clinical  data.  The 
comprehensive  series  of  data-processing  steps  are 
detailed in appendix 1 (section 2). We analysed data from 
several  clinical  settings,  including  inpatient  hospital 
admissions,  outpatient  visits,  and  health  insurance 
claims.  For  inpatient  data  reporting  a  single  diagnosis, 
we  adjusted  data  to  account  for  factors  such  as 
re-admissions,  non-primary  diagnoses,  and  outpatient 
care. We made these adjustments by calculating age-sex-
specific  ratios  by  cause  using  RegMod,  a  new  GBD 
regression  modelling  package,  which  was  used  in  this 
instance  to  create  correction  factor  models  for  clinical 
data (appendix 1 section 2.2.5). To ensure that estimates 
of  inpatient  data  accurately  reflected  population  data, 
inpatient  sources  were  scaled  using  estimates  of  total 
inpatient  admission  rates  per  capita  for  each  location-
year-age-sex 
for  which  demographic  data  were 
incomplete.

Moreover, we adjusted inpatient sources to account for 
disparities  in  health-care  access  across  all  locations  by 
scaling  estimates  using  a  scalar  developed  for  the 
Healthcare  Access  and  Quality  Index  (appendix  1 
section 2.2.5).17 These adjustments produce standardised, 
population-level  clinical  estimates  that  represent  both 
the incidence and prevalence of causes and mitigate the 
impact of known biases in the data.

Disease and injury burden attributable to risk factors
To  estimate  the  burden  of  disease  attributable  to  risk 
factors, we combined four inputs: exposure; relative risk 
of each health outcome associated with the risk factor; the 
theoretical  minimum  risk  exposure  level  (TMREL);  and 
deaths and burden for each of the health outcomes with 
which  a  risk  factor  is  associated.  In  GBD  2023,  we 
estimated the burden associated with 88 risk factors. The 
TMREL and deaths and burden for each health outcome 
associated  with  a  risk  factor  are  derived  and  did  not 
require  additional  data,  so  data  seeking  for  risk  factor 
analyses  focused  on  exposure  and  relative  risks.  The 
exposure  estimation  processes  used  more 
than 
55 000  distinct  data  sources,  about  16 000  of  which  were 
new for GBD 2023, related primarily to the incorporation 
of new data sources for various risk factors, such as sexual 
violence  against  children,  intimate  partner  violence, 
bullying  victimisation,  high  BMI,  high  fasting  plasma 
glucose  (FPG),  and  various  dietary  risk  factors.  These 
sources were identified through systematic reviews of risk 
factor  exposure  studies,  in  addition  to  other  data  that 
include  household  and  health  examination  surveys  and 
censuses,  ground-sensing  or  remote-sensing  data,  and 
administrative records (appendix 2 section 2.2.1).

Articlesthrough  systematic 

Relative  risk  estimates  were  derived  from  meta-
analyses  incorporating  more  than  3800  distinct  data 
sources, more than 900 of which were new for GBD 2023. 
Data  used  to  estimate  relative  risks  were  identified  and 
extracted 
literature  reviews  of 
randomised  controlled  trials  and  prospective  cohort 
studies  reporting  fatal  and  non-fatal  health  outcomes 
associated  with  risk  factor  exposures,  and  from  studies 
underlying  risk–outcome  meta-analyses  (appendix  2 
section  2.1.3).  Where  data  from  randomised  controlled 
trials  or  cohort  studies  were  unavailable,  odds  ratios 
from  case–control  studies  were  potentially  included  in 
relative risk estimation (generally reflected by including 
a  bias  covariate  in  the  burden-of-proof  estimation 
framework). Across relative risk and exposure estimation 
processes,  85  new  or  updated  systematic  reviews  were 
conducted.  Decisions  were  made  to  undertake  or 
prioritise  reviews  based  on  various  circumstances, 
including  the  availability  of  literature  providing  new  or 
more  nuanced  or  detailed  data,  or  newly  available 
resources  to  support  review  of  particular  risk–outcome 
pairs. Appendix 2 includes PRISMA diagrams for each of 
the  85  systematic  reviews  and  risk  factor-specific 
strategies to maximise data collection, search procedures, 
and  bias  assessment  (section  4),  and  systematic  review 
and  bias  assessment  guidelines  (section  2.1.3).  For  risk 
factor exposure data, MR-BRT was used to adjust for bias 
and perform age-sex splitting; further details are provided 
in appendix 2 (section 2.2.2).

Estimation methods
Burden of diseases and injuries
GBD 2023 estimated incidence, prevalence, YLDs, YLLs, 
and  DALYs  for  375  diseases  and  injuries:  371  with 
non-fatal outcomes and 292 with fatal outcomes. Specific 
diseases  and  injuries  are  organised  within  a  four-level 
cause  hierarchy.  The  broadest  category—level  1—
includes  three  large  cause  groupings  of  NCDs,  CMNN 
diseases,  and  injuries.  Level  2  categories  are  further 
disaggregated 
into  specific  subgroupings,  such  as 
cardiovascular  diseases  and  transport  injuries.  Level  3 
causes  include  specific  causes  (eg,  stroke  and  road 
injuries).  In  some  cases,  level  3  causes  are  the  most 
granular level of analysis; however, in other cases, causes 
are further disaggregated at level 4. Level 4 causes are the 
most specific (eg, ischaemic stroke and pedestrian road 
injuries).  Detailed  information  on  the  GBD  cause 
hierarchy is in appendix 1 (table S3).

The modelling of prevalence and incidence was mainly 
conducted  using  DisMod-MR  2.1,  a  Bayesian  disease 
modelling meta-regression tool.7 A new tool, DisMod-AT, 
modelled prevalence and incidence for four causes: type 1 
diabetes,  major  depressive  disorder,  anxiety  disorders, 
and autism spectrum disorders (appendix 1 section 2.7). 
For  certain  diseases  and 
the  use  of 
spatiotemporal  Gaussian  process  regression  (ST-GPR) 
models  allowed  for  the  analysis  of  data  that  are  both 

injuries, 

heterogeneous  and 
incomplete  and  which  require 
statistical  smoothing  (appendix  1  section  2.4).  The 
methodology  for  cause-specific  estimations,  including 
the  calculation  of  sequela-specific  prevalence, 
is 
described in appendix 1 (section 6).

To estimate YLDs, we calculated cause-age-sex-location-
year-specific  prevalence  of  sequelae  (or  duration  of 
nature  of  injury)  and  then  multiplied  these  prevalence 
values  by  their  respective  disability  weights  for  each 
disease and injury. The process for estimating disability 
weights  is  detailed  further  in  appendix  1  (section  2.9). 
YLDs  were  adjusted  for  comorbidity,  assuming  that  a 
multiplicative function of disability weights accounts for 
the co-occurrence of non-fatal causes within individuals. 
YLLs  were  derived  by  multiplying  the  cause-age-sex-
location-year-specific  number  of  deaths  by  the  standard 
life  expectancy  at  the  age  of  death  for  each  cause,  as 
detailed by the GBD 2023 Causes of Death Collaborators.16 
DALYs  were  computed  by  summing  YLDs  and  YLLs 
(appendix  1  section  4).  A  complementary  measure  to 
DALYs—healthy life expectancy (HALE), which measures 
a population’s mean number of years of life spent in full 
health—was  calculated  using  YLDs  per  capita  and  age-
specific  mortality  rates  by  location,  age,  sex,  year,  and 
cause.16  This  method  was  developed  by  Sullivan19  and 
described  in  appendix  1  (section  5).  Both  DALYs  and 
HALE  were  estimated  by  location,  age,  sex,  and  year. 
More comprehensive details can be found in appendix 1 
injury 
(sections  4,  5).  Cause-specific  disease  and 
estimation  methods  were  updated  for  GBD  2023  for 
several  causes,  including  for  rheumatic  heart  disease, 
autism  spectrum  disorders,  and  HIV/AIDS.  Details  on 
these and other cause-specific updates are in appendix 1 
(section 6).

Disease and injury burden attributable to risk factors
Risk  factor  analysis  was  based  on  the  comparative  risk 
assessment framework, which is premised on a causal web 
of  hierarchically  organised,  modifiable  risk  factors  that 
affect health outcomes20,21 (appendix 2 section 2, table S2). 
Risk factors were classified into a four-level hierarchy with 
the broadest categories—environmental and occupational, 
behavioural,  and  metabolic  risks—at  level  1.  Level  1 
categories  were  then  further  disaggregated,  allowing  for 
analysis  focused  both  on  risk  groups  at  level  2  (eg,  air 
pollution)  and  on  increasingly  granular  risk  factors  at 
(eg,  particulate  matter  pollution)  and  4 
levels  3 
(eg,  household  air  pollution  from  solid  fuels).  GBD  2021 
and  GBD  2023  included  88  total  risk  factors  across 
hierarchy levels (appendix 2 table S1). Risk factor definitions 
and modelling details are in appendix 2 (section 4).

Described briefly are the methods for estimating each 
of the four inputs into assessing risk-attributable burden: 
exposure, relative risk of each health outcome associated 
with the risk factor, the TMREL, and deaths and burden 
for each of the health outcomes with which a risk factor 
is associated.

ArticlesMethods  to  estimate  mean  levels  of  exposure  to  each 
risk  factor  by  age-sex-location-year  varied  across  risks. 
Data  for  most  risks  were  extracted  from  household 
surveys  and  the  scientific  literature  and  were  modelled 
using  either  ST-GPR  or  DisMod-MR  2.1.7,13  Some  risks 
(eg,  ambient  air  pollution)  required  other  approaches, 
such  as  satellite  data  and  geospatial  analysis  for 
environmental exposures. For most risks, the distribution 
of  exposure  across 
individuals  was  estimated  by 
modelling a measure of dispersion, usually the SD, and 
fitting  an  ensemble  of  parametric  distributions  to  the 
predicted mean and SD (appendix 2 section 2.2.3 [step 2]). 
Summary  exposure  values  (SEVs),  reflecting  both  the 
prevalence  of  a  given  risk  factor  and  the  relative  harm 
caused by that risk factor, were calculated from exposure 
estimates (appendix 2 section 2 [step 5]).

For the GBD 2023 risk factor analysis, we evaluated a 
total  of  88  risk  factors  and  159  health  outcomes, 
including  four  outcomes  (bipolar  disorder,  bulimia 
nervosa,  conduct  disorder,  and  schizophrenia)  that  in 
previous iterations of the GBD had not been linked to 
any  risk  factors.  At  the  most  detailed  risk  and  cause 
level,  relative  risks  for  a  total  of  676  risk–outcome 
pairs—including pairs in mediation pathways and pairs 
for which, by definition, a fixed percentage (often 100%) 
of the disease is attributed to the risk—were estimated. 
This  included  50  new  risk–outcome  pairs,  while 
two  previously  included  pairs—child  wasting  and 
malaria,  and  high  alcohol  use  and  nasopharynx 
cancer—were  excluded  for  not  meeting  inclusion 
criteria  or  for  overlapping  with  other  outcomes 
(appendix 2 table S3).

summary scores are mapped to a (one to five) star rating

risks  estimated  with  burden-of-proof  methods  in  this

potentially  revise  the  incorporation  of  unexplained

risk–outcome 

For  each  risk  factor,  the  TMREL—the  counterfactual 
level of exposure that is theoretically possible and would 
minimise  health  risks  in  exposed  populations—was 
estimated either on the basis of epidemiological evidence 
quantifying 
the 
distribution  of  observed  risk  factor  exposure  (eg,  ozone 
air  pollution),  or  on  the  basis  of  risk  factor  definition 
(eg,  smoking;  appendix  2  section  2  [step  3],  table  S4). 
Differing  TMRELs  reflect  the  range  of  behavioural, 
metabolic,  and  environmental  risk  factors,  including 
those for which zero exposure is theoretically achievable 
and  those  for  which  non-zero  levels  reflect  minimum 
risk.

and 

For  each  risk–outcome  pair,  estimates  of  exposure, 
TMREL,  and  relative  risk  were  used  to  compute  the 
population  attributable  fraction  (PAF;  the  proportional 
difference  between  disease  or  injury  burden  at  current 
levels of risk factor exposure and the burden that would 
have  occurred  had  the  population  been  exposed  to  the 
risk factor at the TMREL; appendix 2 section 2 [step 4]). 
For  associations  involving  risk  factors  that  act  on 
outcomes  via  intermediate  risks  (ie,  many  risk  factors, 
particularly  dietary  risks,  are  associated  with  disease 
outcomes  mediated  through  metabolic  risks,  such  as  a 
relationship  between  diet  high 
in  sodium  and 
hypertensive heart disease mediated through high SBP), 
PAFs  were  adjusted  based  on  values  estimated  in  the 
GBD  2023  mediation  matrix  (appendix  2  section  2 
[step  6],  table  S5).  Eight  additional  risk–outcome  pairs 
were  incorporated  in  the  2023  matrix,  for  a  total  of 
165 mediated pairs (appendix 2 table S6).

To  calculate  measures  of  risk-attributable  burden—
ie,  the  disease  burden  (DALYs,  deaths,  YLLs,  or  YLDs) 
attributable to a particular risk factor or combination of 
risks—PAFs  were  multiplied  by  the  estimated  disease 
burden associated with particular outcomes (appendix 2

Articlessection 2 [step 7]). There have been several updates to the 
estimation  of  risk-attributable  burden  for  GBD  2023, 
including for outcomes such as ischaemic heart disease, 
with  prevalence  and  disease  burden  now  modelled 
directly  rather  than  on  the  basis  of  non-specific  chest 
pain  symptoms,  and  for  risk  factors  such  as  lead 
exposure, with one of the important changes being that 
the  effect  of  lead  on  ischaemic  heart  disease  is  now 
estimated  directly,  whereas  this  effect  was  previously 
exclusively  mediated  via  high  SBP.  Additionally,  names 
and case definitions were updated for some risk factors, 
such  as  sexual  violence  against  children  (previously 
childhood sexual abuse), and the TMREL was revised for 
one  risk  factor:  diet  high  in  trans  fatty  acids.  See 
appendix  2  (section  4)  for  all  GBD  2023  risk-specific 
methods.

years  of  education,  and  fertility  rates  among  females 
younger than 25 years.29 Each location at the most specific 
level  is  assigned  an  SDI  value  ranging  from  0  (lowest 
income and educational attainment, and highest fertility) 
to 100 and then grouped into quintiles from low SDI to 
high SDI (appendix 1 table S12).

Estimates are reported here as absolute counts and as 
rates  per  100 000  person-years,  with  age-standardised 
rates  calculated  using  the  GBD  2023  world  standard 
population30 to account for varying age structures across 
populations. Count data are presented to three significant 
figures,  and  rates  are  presented  to  one  decimal  place. 
Uncertainty  was  propagated  throughout  the  estimation 
process.  Mean  estimates  for  all  metrics  reported 
represent  the  mean  value  across  250  draws  from  the 
estimate’s  distribution,  with  95%  UIs  calculated  as  the 
2·5th and 97·5th percentile values across the draws. To 
reduce computing power and time across the estimation 
process, the number of draws was reduced from 500 in 
GBD  2021  to  250  for  GBD  2023.  Simulations  revealed 
that  estimates  and  uncertainty  were  minimally  affected 
by  this  reduction  (see  appendix  1  section  1.1  for  more 
details).

Review Board approved the GBD study (STUDY00009060) 
up  to  July  26,  2026.  The  software  used  for  analyses 
included  Python  (version  3.10.4),  Stata  (version  13.1), 
and  R  (version  4.2.1).  The  statistical  code  used  in 
GBD 2023 is publicly available online. An international 
network  of  collaborators  helped  to  provide,  review,  and

GBD  2023  drew  on  the  expertise  of  more  than 
14 000  collaborators  from  more  than  160  countries  and 
territories.

All GBD 2023 estimates for diseases, injuries, and risk 
factors  are  reported  by  age,  sex,  location,  and  year  for 
25 age groups from early neonatal (0–6 days) to 95 years 
and older; for males, females, and all sexes combined; for 
every year from 1990 to 2023; and in 204 countries and

Results
Overview
To  capture  worldwide  long-term  patterns  of  disease 
burden  and  changes  in  the  global  health  outlook  since 
the  COVID-19  pandemic,  we  report  estimated  DALYs 
from 1990 to 2023, across level 1 causes, then primarily 
focus  on  results  from  2010  to  2023,  the  most  recent 
period of acute public health and policy interest. HALE 
results  are  presented  in  appendix  3  (table  S9).  For  risk 
factor  analyses,  we  present  estimates  of  risk  factor 
exposure in SEVs and risk-attributable burden in DALYs. 
More  detailed  estimates  and  metrics  are  presented  in 
appendix 3. Comprehensive results can also be accessed 
through  the  GBD  2023  Results  Tool  and  visualised  via 
GBD  Compare.  Results  specific  to  risk  factor  analyses 
can also be accessed through the Burden of Proof Tool.

The changing landscape of global health across 
sociodemographic levels
The  number  of  global  all-cause  DALYs  remained 
statistically  stable  between  1990  and  2023  (2·74  billion 
[95% UI 2·60–2·90] in 1990 and 2·80 billion [2·57–3·08] 
in 2023; appendix 3 table S10). This apparent stasis hides 
an epidemiological transition among level 1 causes that 
broadly  reflects  a  decrease  in  burden  due  to  CMNN 
diseases, a rise in NCD DALYs, and an unchanged level 
of  injuries  (figure  1A).  Global  age-standardised  DALY

injuries, reflecting per-person improvements in burden 
between 1990 and 2023 (figure 1B), but these gains were 
not seen in DALY counts for NCDs or injuries because 
the global population is growing and ageing. The biggest 
deviation  during  the  COVID-19  pandemic  from  these 
long-term favourable trajectories in DALY rates was for 
CMNN diseases, and this disturbance was more acute in 
countries  in  lower  SDI  quintiles  (ie,  the  effect  of  the 
pandemic was greatest for countries with lower income 
per  capita  and  educational  attainment  and  higher 
fertility  rates;  figure  1B).  A  similar  pandemic-related 
disruption  was  not  evident  for  NCDs  or  injuries  at  the 
global level.

Declines  in  age-standardised  DALY  rates  for  CMNN 
diseases were steepest over time at lower SDI levels and 
more  attenuated  with  higher  SDI.  In  the  high  SDI 
quintile,  total  DALY  counts  and  age-standardised  rates 
for CMNN diseases were below those for injuries in all 
but the pandemic years (figure 1). Much less substantial 
decreases in age-standardised rates were seen for NCDs 
and  injuries  except  in  the  high-middle  and  high  SDI 
quintiles.

Global trends in DALYs, 2010–23
Although  the  2023  all-cause  global  DALYs  rose  6·1% 
(95% UI 4·0–8·1) from 2∙64 billion (2∙46–2∙86) in 2010 
to  2·80  billion  (2·57–3·08)  in  2023,  the  global  age-
standardised  DALY  rate  declined  by  12·6%  (11·0–14·1; 
appendix  3  table  S10).  Across  level  1  causes,  NCDs 
contributed the highest burden globally in 2023 and were 
the only disease group for which DALY counts increased 
between  2010  and  2023,  from  1·45  billion  (1·31–1·61) 
to  1·80  billion  (1·63–2·03).  However,  age-standardised 
DALY  rates  for  NCDs  decreased  during  this  period 
by  4·1%  (1·9–6·3;  appendix  3  table  S10).  DALY  counts 
for CMNN diseases decreased from 874 million (837–917) 
in  2010  to  681  million  (642–736)  in  2023,  and  the  age-
standardised  DALY  rate  decreased  more  markedly 
by 25·8% (22·6–28·7). DALY counts due to injuries also 
exhibited  a  decreasing  but  non-significant 
trend 
from  319  million  (288–357)  in  2010  to  316  million 
(280–356) in 2023. The age-standardised DALY rate due 
to  injuries  decreased  by  15·6%  (10·7–19·8)  during  the 
same period (appendix 3 table S10).

Figure 1: Trends of total DALYs (A) and age-standardised DALY rates (B) by GBD level 1 cause and by SDI quintile, 1990–2023
The grey shading indicates the 2010–23 period. The bump in injury-related DALYs that can be seen in the low SDI and global panels in 1994 is largely the result of the 
Rwanda genocide. The larger bump in CMNN diseases in almost all plots in 2021 and 2022 is the larger DALY effect of the COVID-19 pandemic. Shading around mean 
trend lines represents 95% uncertainty intervals. CMNN=communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional. DALY=disability-adjusted life-year. GBD=Global Burden 
of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study. NCDs=non-communicable diseases. SDI=Socio-demographic Index.

(70·8  million 

for  1·33  billion  (1·20–1·49;  appendix  3  table  S3;  see 
figure  2  for  age-cause-specific  DALYs,  by  sex).  For  both 
sexes,  ischaemic  heart  disease  was  the  leading  level  3 
cause of DALY burden in 2023 (74·8 million [64·2–84·8] 
DALYs  in  females  and  118  million  [106–130]  in  males), 
followed by neonatal disorders (71·7 million [65·7–78·9] 
in  females  and  98·3  million  [89·4–107]  in  males)  and 
stroke 
females 
and  85·7  million  [75·8–97·8]  in  males;  appendix  3 
table  S3).  By  age  group,  CMNN  diseases  were  leading 
causes of burden in children younger than 5 years, with 
maternal  and  neonatal  disorders  the  greatest  cause  of 
DALYs in the neonatal phase (age <28 days), accounting 
for  72·2%  (68·4–75·3)  of  184  million  (178–190)  total 
DALYs  in  this  age  group  in  2023  (figure  2;  see  the 
GBD  2023  Results  Tool  for  total  DALYs  by  age  group). 
NCDs  increasingly  contributed  to  disease  burden  with 
ageing, accounting for 45·0% (40·8–49·8) of 152 million 
(130–180)  total  DALYs  in  individuals  aged  5–14  years, 
61·6% (58·6–64·1) of 882 million (778–1006) total DALYs 
for  those  aged  15–49  years,  and  85·5%  (84·6–86·3)  of 
1150  million  (1060–1260)  total  DALYs  for  those  aged 
55 years and older. The burden of injuries was higher in 
for  24·7% 
males  aged  10–54  years,  accounting 
(22·4–27·0) of 590 million (529–662) total DALYs in this 
age group, compared with 11·1% (9·7–12·5) of 540 million 
(463–631)  total  DALYs  in  females  of  the  same  age,  with 

the  difference  between  sexes  declining  gradually  for 
those 55 and older.

In total, 15 NCDs, seven CMNN diseases, and three types 
of injuries featured within the 25 leading level 3 causes of 
global  DALYs  in  2023  (figure  3).  In  2010,  neonatal 
disorders,  ischaemic  heart  disease,  and  stroke  were  the 
leading causes of DALYs for all ages and sexes combined. 
In  2023,  the  top  five  causes  were  ischaemic  heart 
disease  (193  million  [95%  UI  176–209]  DALYs),  neonatal 
disorders  (170  million  [159–183]),  stroke  (157  million 
[141–172]),  lower  respiratory  infections  (98·7  million 
[87·7–112]), and diabetes (90·2 million [75·2–107]). Notable 
health  gains  among  leading  CMNN  diseases  included 
lower  respiratory  infections  (with  a  decrease  in  the  age-
standardised  DALY  rate  of  24·8%  [7·4–36·7]  between 
2010 and 2023) and diarrhoeal diseases (decrease of 49·1% 
[32·7–61·0]). Rates also declined for HIV/AIDS (by 42·9% 
[38·0–48·0]), 
[23·6–56·6]),  and 
malaria  (21·4%  [5·4–45·4]).  Another  notable  health  gain 
among  CMNN  diseases  was  observed  for  neonatal 
disorders, which decreased in age-standardised DALY rate 
by  16·5%  (10·6–22·0)  and  dropped  from  first  ranking 
in 1990, 2000, and 2010 to second ranking globally in 2023.
Among  the  leading  level  3  causes  of  DALYs  in  2023, 
the  largest  health  declines  between  2010  and  2023—
ie,  increases  in  age-standardised  DALY  rates—were 
observed  for  NCD  causes,  including  anxiety  disorders

Figure 3: Leading 25 GBD level 3 causes of global DALYs in 1990, 2000, 2010, and 2023, for both sexes combined, and all ages
Causes are connected by lines between time periods: solid lines represent an increase or no change in rank, and dashed lines represent a decrease in rank. Faded colours indicate that the cause is not 
within the top 25 causes of DALYs for that year. Data in parentheses are 95% uncertainty intervals. DALY=disability-adjusted life-year. GBD=Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study.

[11·6–42·9]), 

with  an  increase  of  62·8%  (95%  UI  34·0–107·5), 
depressive  disorders 
and 
diabetes  (14·9%  [7·5–25·6];  figure  3).  Alzheimer’s 
disease  and  other  dementias  also  moved  into  the 
top 25 causes of DALYs for the first time (non-significant 
increase in age-standardised rate of 2·8% [–0·4 to 5·7]). 
With  respect  to  level  3  categories  of  injury,  age-
standardised  DALY  rates  did  not  show  a  statistical 
change  for  road  injuries  (non-significant  decrease 
of 13·3% (–25·5 to 2·9), but declined for falls by 11·8% 
(6·1  to  16·3)  and  self-harm  by  14·4%  (4·2  to  23·7). 
DALY counts and age-standardised DALY rates by cause 
for  2010  and  2023  are  presented  in  appendix  3 
(tables S3, S4).

Decomposition of DALYs into YLDs and YLLs
in  2023  were  composed 
Global  all-cause  DALYs 
of  990  million  (95%  UI  756–1280)  YLDs  (equivalent 

to  35·4%  [29·5–41·5]  of  2·80  billion  total  DALYs; 
appendix  3  tables  S5,  S6)  and  1·81  billion  (1·78–1·84) 
YLLs  (equivalent  to  64·6%  [59·5–69·5]  of  total  DALYs; 
appendix 3 tables S7, S8). Global YLDs exhibited a non-
significant increase from 786 million (597–1000) in 2010, 
and  YLLs  decreased  significantly  from  1·85  billion 
(1·84–1·86)  in  2010.  All-cause,  age-standardised  YLD 
rates remained statistically stable between 2010 and 2023, 
with  a  non-significant  increase  of  2·3%  (–0·2  to  5·4; 
appendix 3 table S11). A total of 21 NCDs, three CMNN 
diseases, and one injury featured within the 25 leading 
level 3 causes of YLDs globally in 2023 (table 1). Low back 
pain,  depressive  disorders,  and  anxiety  disorders  were 
the  top  three  causes  of  YLDs.  Global  YLLs  decreased 
by  2·4%  (0·9–3·9)  between  2010  and  2023,  and  age-
standardised YLL rates decreased considerably by 18·7% 
(17·5–19·9; appendix 3 table S12). Age-standardised YLD

Figure 4: Age-specific DALY rates for CMNN diseases (A), NCDs (B), and injuries (C), by age, sex, year, and SDI quintile
The y axis shows DALYs per 100 000 person-years on a logarithmic scale. CMNN=communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional. DALY=disability-adjusted life-year. GBD=Global Burden of 
Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study. NCDs=non-communicable diseases. SDI=Socio-demographic Index.

cause and sex for 2010, 2020, and 2023 are in appendix 3 
(tables S5–S8).

in  2023 

Trends in DALYs by SDI, location, age, and sex
Trends  in  DALYs  at  the  global  level  were  informed  by 
complex patterns of cause-specific burden across location, 
age,  and  sex.  Age-standardised  DALY  rates  for  NCDs  in 
(95%  UI 
males 
17 667·9–21 818·2)  per  100 000  in  the  high  SDI  quintile 
to 25 205·2 (23 054·5–27 396·0) per 100 000 in the low SDI 
quintile. In females, age-standardised DALY rates for NCDs 
ranged from 17 017·8 (14 711·8–20 005·1) per 100 000 in the 
high  SDI  quintile  to  25 574·4  (22 701·9–28 560·9)  per 

from  19 519·6 

ranged 

100 000 in the low SDI quintile (GBD 2023 Results Tool and 
GBD Compare). Across all SDI quintiles, age-specific DALY 
rates  from  NCDs  decreased  with  increasing  age  from 
0–6 days to 5–9 years and then increased gradually with age 
(figure 4).

in 

the  high  SDI  quintile 

Age-standardised  DALY  rates  for  CMNN  diseases  in 
males in 2023 ranged from 2257·1 (95% UI 2033·9–2553·5) 
to  19 212·4 
per  100 000 
(18 052·2–20 819·7) per 100 000 in the low SDI quintile. In 
females,  they  ranged  from  1909·6  (1655·9–2271·7)  per 
100 000 
18 824·3 
the  high  SDI  quintile 
(17 538·6–20 419·6)  per  100 000  in  the  low  SDI  quintile 
(GBD  2023  Results  Tool  and  GBD  Compare).

Age-standardised  DALY  rates 
for  CMNN  diseases 
decreased  between  2010  and  2023  in  all  SDI  quintiles, 
ranging from a decrease of 34·9% (31·6–38·0) in the low 
SDI quintile to a decrease of 13·0% (7·2–17·8) in the high 
SDI quintile. Age-specific DALY rates for CMNN diseases 
were  higher  in  females  than  in  males  in  age  groups 
younger than 45 years, and markedly higher among males 
than females in age groups 45 years and older (figure 4).

Age-standardised  DALY  rates  for  injuries  in  males 
in 2023 ranged from 4271·2 (95% UI 3792·2–4896·0) per 
100 000 in the high SDI quintile to 6401·8 (5445·7–7262·9)

ArticlesAge-standardised  DALY  rates  for  injuries  decreased 
between 2010 and 2023 in all SDI quintiles, ranging from 
a decrease of 13·5% (10·2–16·1) in the high SDI quintile 
to  a  decrease  of  20·2%  (15·7–23·6)  in  the  high-middle 
SDI  quintile.  Across  all  SDI  quintiles,  DALY  rates  for 
injuries emerged 0–6 days after birth, declined between 
the age groups of 7–27 days after birth and 5–9 years, and 
increased with age thereafter. For age 15 years and older, 
DALY  rates  for  injuries  in  males  remained  relatively 
stable with increasing age, except after about the age of 
70 years, when it increased; for females, rates increased 
steadily with age after 40 years (figure 4).

Drivers  of  changes  in  DALYs  by  location  are  further 
illustrated in figure 5, which shows the ten leading level 3 
causes  of  DALYs  in  2023  and  their  annualised  rate  of 
change (ARC) between 2010 and 2023 by region, super-
region, and SDI quintile. In the low SDI quintile, six of 
the  ten  leading  level  3  causes  of  DALYs  were  CMNN 
diseases, 
led  by  neonatal  disorders  (92·6  million 
[95%  UI  85·7–100]  DALYs),  lower  respiratory  infections 
(48·1  million  [40·2–58·0]),  and  malaria  (41·9  million 
[17·5–77·3]; GBD 2023 Results Tool). As SDI increased, 
more  NCDs  emerged  in  the  top  ten  leading  causes  of 
DALYs  (figure  5).  In  the  high  SDI  quintile,  nine  of  the 
ten leading level 3 causes of DALYs were NCDs, with the 
top  three  causes  in  total  DALYs  being  ischaemic  heart 
disease 
[65·7–74·8]  DALYs),  stroke 
(49·7  million 
[45·2–53·2]),  and  falls  (33·1  million 
[25·6–43·2]).  The  largest  changes  in  age-standardised 
DALY  rates  for 
ischaemic  heart  disease  between 
2010  and  2023  ranged  from  a  non-significant  increase 
of 7·7% (–13·7 to 30·3) in low SDI locations to a decrease 
of 25·5% (22·9 to 28·1) in high SDI locations (GBD 2023 
Results Tool).

(71·0  million 

The  leading  level  3  causes  of  age-standardised  DALY 
rates  by  location  in  2023  are  shown  in  appendix  3 
(figure  S1).  Ischaemic  heart  disease  was  the  leading 
cause  of  age-standardised  DALY  rates  in  73  (35·8%)  of 
204 countries and territories. COVID-19 was not a leading 
cause  of  global  DALYs  in  2023.  In  sub-Saharan  Africa, 
neonatal  disorders,  HIV/AIDS,  malaria,  and 
lower 
respiratory infections were the leading level 3 causes of 
burden 
in  western  and  eastern 
sub-Saharan  Africa,  with  HIV/AIDS  leading  in  all 
continental countries in central sub-Saharan Africa, bar 
DR Congo and the Central African Republic. Ischaemic 
heart  disease  was  the  leading  cause  of  burden  in 
ten  countries  and  territories  in  north  Africa  and  the 
Middle  East,  five 
in 
western  Europe,  and  six  countries  and  territories 
in central Asia. Stroke was the most burdensome cause 
in most locations in east Asia (appendix 3 figure S1).

Trends in exposure to risk factors, 2010–23
At  level  1  of  the  risk  factor  hierarchy  (appendix  2 
table  S15),  age-standardised  SEVs  grew  between 
2010 and 2023 only for metabolic risks, with an increasing 

mean ARC of 1·1% (95% UI 0·3–2·0; table 2). Conversely, 
there  were  small  but  significant  decreases  in  SEVs  for 
environmental and occupational risks and for behavioural 
risks, with ARC decreases of 0·8% (0·5–1·1) and 0·4% 
(0·2–0·7),  respectively.  Among  specific  level  2  risk 
increased  significantly  between 
factors,  exposure 
2010 and 2023 only for high BMI (ARC 1·3% [0·5–2·2]), 
kidney  dysfunction  (0·1%  [0·1–0·2]),  drug  use  (1·9% 
[0·5–2·6]),  and  low  physical  activity  (0·5%  [0·2–0·8]).

level 1 risks, 2010–23. (C) Global total DALY counts unattributed or attributable to level 1 risk factors, 2023. Mean 
estimates by level 1 risk factor in panels A and B are represented by coloured lines; the shading indicates 
95% uncertainty intervals. For panel C, ∩ refers to a burden that is attributed to two or all three level 1 risk factors 
(ie, the intersecting set of DALYs that belong to both or all three risk factors). Mean estimates in panels A and B are 
aggregated to include all DALYs attributable exclusively to the specific level 1 risk factor plus those attributable to 
the intersection of that risk and one or both of the other level 1 risk factors (ie, for a single year, the DALY counts 
combined across the three lines sum to more than the total number of attributable DALYs for that year). In 
GBD 2023, 45·6% of total global DALYs were attributable to risk factors (appendix 3 table S13). DALY=disability-
adjusted life-year. GBD=Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study.

SEVs  between  2010  and  2023  included  unsafe  water, 
sanitation,  and  handwashing,  with  a  decreasing  ARC 
of  1·4%  (0·3–2·6),  air  pollution  (decrease  of  1·4% 
[1·2–1·7]), and tobacco use (decrease of 1·1% [0·5–1·6]). 
Results  at  more  disaggregated  levels  of  the  risk  factor 
hierarchy  reveal  that  SEVs  for  some  components  of  air 
pollution  decreased,  with  household  air  pollution  from 
solid fuels declining at an ARC of 3·2% (2·5–3·7), while 
exposure  to  ambient  particulate  matter  and  ambient 
ozone  pollution  increased,  rising  by  1·2%  (0·9–1·5) 
and 1·3% (1·1–1·4), respectively. Age-standardised SEVs 
and percentage change over time by risk factor and sex 
are provided in appendix 3 (table S15).

then environmental and occupational risks (445 million 
[395–496]  or  16·0%  [14·1–18·0];  figure  6).  In  aggregate, 
1·27 billion (1·18–1·38) global DALYs (45·5% [43·4–47·8] 
of 2·80 billion total DALYs in 2023) were attributable to 
all  88  GBD  2023  risk  factors  combined  (appendix  3

Articlessmoking ranked third (5·8% [4·8–7·1]), high FPG ranked 
fourth  5·8%  [5·2–6·5]),  and  low  birthweight  and  short 
gestation ranked fifth (5·2% [4·7–5·7]). Of the 25 leading 
level  3  risk  factors  in  2023,  more  than  half  (13)  were 
behavioural risks.

The contribution of level 3 risk factors to global DALYs 
in 2023 varied by age (appendix 3 figure S2A–E) and sex 
(appendix  3  figure  S2F–G).  Among  children  younger 
than  5  years,  risks  related  to  child  and  maternal 
malnutrition,  particulate  matter  pollution,  and  unsafe 
water, sanitation, and handwashing were leading level 3 
risk factors, with no metabolic risks among the top ten. 
For  children  and  adolescents  aged  5–14  years,  iron 
deficiency was the leading risk, followed by others related 
to unsafe water, sanitation, and handwashing, and child 
and  maternal  malnutrition.  For  the  age  group  of 
15–49  years,  the  top  two  risks  were  unsafe  sex  and 
occupational  injuries.  Metabolic  risk  factors  gained 
prominence in this group, with high BMI and high SBP 
the  third-ranked  and  fourth-ranked  risks,  followed  by 
high alcohol use. For individuals aged 50–69 years, high 
SBP  and  smoking  were  the  top  risks,  with  metabolic 
risks such as high FPG, high BMI, high LDL cholesterol, 
and kidney dysfunction also prominent. A similar pattern 
was seen for individuals aged 70 years and older. The top 
ten  risks  for  all-age  females  and  males  were  similar, 
although smoking was the leading risk for males, but the 
12th-ranked  risk  for  females.  Additionally,  high  alcohol 
use  was  the  ninth-ranked  risk  factor  among  males,  but 
for females was not among the top 25 risks. By contrast, 
unsafe sex and iron deficiency were the ninth-ranked and 
11th-ranked  risks,  respectively,  for  females,  but  ranked 
19th and 23rd for males.

The  2023  disease  burden  attributable  to  risk  factors 
varied  considerably  by  geography,  as  illustrated  by  the 
global  distribution  of  age-standardised  risk-attributable 
DALY rates for all GBD risk factors combined (appendix 3 
figure S3) and maps of rates attributable to the ten leading 
global level 3 risks (figure 8; ranked according to percentage 
of total DALY counts). Age-standardised attributable DALY 
rates for high SBP, the leading level 3 risk factor in 2023, 
were highest in the super-regions of north Africa and the 
Middle  East  and  central  Europe,  eastern  Europe,  and 
central Asia (figure 8A). At a regional level, high SBP was 
the leading contributor to burden in central Asia (highest 
in  Tajikistan,  at  7298·3  [95%  UI  5930·8–8496·6]  age-
standardised  DALYs  per  100 000),  Oceania  (highest  in 
Nauru,  at  12 800·7  [10 101·2–15 840·3]  age-standardised 
DALYs  per  100 000),  north  Africa  and  the  Middle  East 
(highest 
[6389·3–10 311·6]  age-
standardised DALYs per 100 000), eastern Europe (highest 
in  Belarus,  at  5604·4  [4514·0–6479·7]  age-standardised 
DALYs per 100 000), southeast Asia (highest in Myanmar, 
at  6429·9 
[4736·2–8134·3]  age-standardised  DALYs 
per  100 000),  central  sub-Saharan  Africa  (highest  in  the 
Central  African  Republic,  at  4557·5  [3212·2–6066·3]  age-
and  western 
standardised  DALYs  per 

in  Egypt,  at  8241·6 

100 000), 

sub-Saharan  Africa  (highest  in  Guinea-Bissau,  at  5541·2 
[4302·6–6899·5]  age-standardised  DALYs  per  100 000; 
figure 9; appendix 3 table S13). High SBP was the leading 
contributor  to  age-standardised  burden  in  the  middle, 
high-middle, and high SDI quintiles and the second-ranked 
contributor  in  the  low  and  low-middle  SDI  groups 
(figure 9).

Attributable  age-standardised  2023  DALY 

rates 
per 100 000 for the second leading risk, particulate matter 
pollution,  were  highest  at  the  super-region  level  in 
south Asia, sub-Saharan Africa, and north Africa and the 
Middle  East  (figure  8B),  and  at  the  regional  level  in 
Oceania  (highest  in  the  Solomon  Islands,  at  10 226·8 
[95%  UI  8375·4–12 034·4]),  south  Asia  (highest  in 
Bangladesh,  at  6095·0  [5340·3–6971·4]),  and  central, 
eastern, and western sub-Saharan Africa (highest in the 
Central  African  Republic,  at  7933·3  [6052·0–9660·4], 
South  Sudan,  at  6524·5  [5025·2–7984·6],  and  Chad, 
at  7342·7 
[5849·1–8652·9],  respectively;  figure  9; 
appendix  3  table  S13).  Particulate  matter  pollution  was 
the leading level 3 risk factor in the low and low-middle 
SDI groups and the second leading risk factor in middle 
and  high-middle  SDI  groups  (figure  9).  Smoking,  the 
third  leading  level  3  contributor  to  global  burden  (as 
measured by percentage of total DALY counts), exhibited 
the  highest  age-standardised  DALYs  per  100 000  in 
central  Europe,  eastern  Europe,  and  central  Asia; 
southeast Asia, east Asia, and Oceania; north Africa and 
the Middle East; and south Asia super-regions (figure 8C). 
At a regional level, smoking was the leading risk in high-
income  Asia  Pacific  and  western  Europe  (highest  in 
[1123·5–2185·0]  age-standardised 
Brunei,  at  1581·3 
in  Monaco,  at  2204·1 
DALYs  per  100 000,  and 
[1637·0–2880·9]  age-standardised  DALYs  per  100 000, 
respectively;  figure  9;  appendix  3  table  S13).  Smoking 
was  the  third  leading  risk  in  the  middle  SDI  group 
(figure 9).

Global maps of 2023 age-standardised risk-attributable 
burden  for  the  fourth  to  the  tenth  leading  level  3  risk 
factors—high FPG, low birthweight and short gestation, 
high  BMI,  kidney  dysfunction,  high  LDL  cholesterol, 
child  growth  failure,  and  lead  exposure—are  shown  in 
figure  8D–J.  Of  these  risks,  high  FPG  was  the  leading 
risk  factor  at  a  regional  level  in  central  Latin  America, 
and high BMI was the top risk in Australasia, southern 
Latin  America,  Andean  Latin  America,  and  tropical 
Latin America (figure 9). Notably, in only two of 21 GBD 
regions were the leading risk factors not reflected in the 
top  ten  level  3  risks  globally;  these  were  high-income 
North  America  (and  correspondingly  the  high  SDI 
quintile),  where  drug  use  was  the  leading  risk,  and 
southern sub-Saharan Africa, where unsafe sex was the 
top risk (figure 9).

See  appendix  3  for  detailed  estimates  related  to  the 
attributable  burden,  including  relative  risks  (table  S17) 
and  PAFs  (tables  S13,  S14,  S16)  used  to  calculate 
attributable  burden,  and  attributable  burden  measured

Trends in risk-attributable DALYs, 2010–23
Over  the  period  2010–23,  all-age  global  DALY  counts 
attributable  to  behavioural  risks  declined  by  8·4% 
(95%  UI  4·5–13·2),  and 
to 
environmental and occupational risks declined by 10·4% 
(5·3–15·0).  Conversely,  global  counts  attributable  to 
metabolic risks increased by 30·7% (24·8–37·3; figure 6; 
appendix 3 table S13). This seeming contradiction is due 
largely to the greater impact of metabolic risk factors on 
increasingly  ageing  populations,  as  evidenced  by  the 
decrease  of  6·7%  (2·0–11·0)  seen  in  age-standardised 
global DALY rates attributable to metabolic risks over the 
same  period.  Notably,  however,  this  decline  in  age-
standardised  DALY  rates  for  metabolic  risk  factors  was 
less pronounced than it was for behavioural risks (decline 
[19·2–25·4])  and  environmental  and 
of  22·2% 
occupational risks (decline of 27·3% [23·4–31·1]; figure 6, 
appendix  3  table  S13).  The  smaller  decline  in  age-
standardised  burden  attributable  to  metabolic  risks 
between 2010 and 2023 was due in part to a significant 
global  increase  in  rates  of  burden  attributable  to  high 
BMI,  which  rose  by  10·5%  (0·1  to  20·9),  and  a 

GBD super-region

non-significant  increase  in  high  FPG,  which  rose 
by 6·2% (–2·7 to 15·6; figure 7). These increases stand in 
contrast to declining global age-standardised DALY rates 
over the same period for all other leading 25 level 3 risk 
factors except drug use, which rose by 8·4% (2·6–15·3; 
figure  7).  The  greatest  decreases  among  the  22  other 
leading level 3 risk factors were for risks associated with 
unsafe  water,  sanitation,  and  handwashing  (declines 
of 
sanitation, 
50·5% 
[33·3–63·1]  for  unsafe  water  source,  and 
45·2% [25·6–72·0] for no access to handwashing facility). 
Other  notable  declines  in  age-standardised  DALY  rates 
were  seen  for  child  growth  failure  (decrease  of  44·9% 
[37·3–53·5]), unsafe sex (decrease of 30·3% [24·3–36·7]), 
smoking  (decrease  of  25·1%  [16·4–33·0]),  occupational 
injuries (decrease of 24·6% [16·2–32·8]), and particulate 
matter  pollution 
[20·9–28·6];

declined over this period at a slower rate in higher than 
in  lower  SDI  countries  and  territories.  ARCs  were 
negative in most countries, indicating a decline over time 
in burden attributable to behavioural risks; however, this 
burden increased over time in some countries, including 
Venezuela, the Solomon Islands, Lebanon, and the USA, 
where age-standardised DALYs attributable to behavioural 
(95%  UI 
risks 
15·1–36·1), 
13·9% 
(2·9–23·0),  and  11·9% 
(7·6–16·1),  respectively  (appendix  3  table  S13).  The  rise 
in behavioural risk-attributable burden in the USA—the 
only  country  other  than  Canada  in  the  high-income 
super-region that showed such an increase—was driven 
largely  by  a  124·2%  (96·1  to  157·0)  increase  in  age-
standardised burden attributable to drug use, in addition 
to an increase in attributable burden for intimate partner 
violence (54·7% [5·8 to 99·2]) and non-significant rise in 
sexual  violence  against  children  (33·5%  [–8·4  to  59·3]; 
appendix  3  table  S13).  In  contrast  to  the  overall  pattern 
for  behavioural  risks,  burden  attributable  to  metabolic 
risks  generally  declined  at  a  faster  rate  with  increasing 
SDI. Approximately half as many countries and territories 
had  positive  ARCs  (75)—indicating  increasing  burden 
attributable to metabolic risks—as negative ARCs (129), 
with  age-standardised  DALYs  increasing  in  countries 
such  as  the  Dominican  Republic  (31·2%  [22·1–42·0]), 
the 
[13·6–43·2]), 
Venezuela  (24·6%  [18·8–31·8]),  Côte  d’Ivoire  (23·5% 
[6·7–40·7]; 
[8·2–42·3]),  and  The  Gambia 
appendix  3 
table  S13).  For  environmental  and 
occupational  risks,  there  was  minimal  association 
between SDI and rate of change in attributable burden, 
and ARCs were generally negative.

Disaggregating  to  a  more  detailed  level  of  the  risk 
factor  hierarchy,  figure  9  presents  ARCs  between 
2010 and 2023 for age-standardised DALYs attributable to 
the ten leading level 3 risk factors, stratified by SDI and 
GBD  region.  For  countries  in  low  and  low-middle  SDI 
quintiles,  the  greatest  ARC  declines  over  time  were  for 
child growth failure (in addition to unsafe sex and unsafe 
water  source  in  the  low  SDI  quintile),  whereas  the 
greatest  increases  were  for  metabolic  risks:  high  BMI 
and  high  FPG.  Middle,  high-middle,  and  high  SDI 
quintiles saw the greatest declines in burden attributable 
to  particulate  matter  pollution,  with  decreasing  burden 
attributable  to  smoking  also  common  across  these 
groups.  As  in  the  lower  SDI  regions,  the  greatest 
increases  in  attributable  burden  in  middle  and  high-
middle SDI quintiles were for high BMI and high FPG. 
In the high SDI quintile, the highest annualised rates of 
increase  were  for  drug  use,  along  with  considerably 
lower rates of increase for high BMI.

With  respect  to  the  three  leading  2023  level  3  risk 
factors globally—high SBP, particulate matter pollution, 
and smoking—annual rates of age-standardised burden 
attributable to high SBP declined between 2010 and 2023 
in  17  of  21  GBD  regions,  with  the  highest  rates  of 

decrease in eastern Europe and central Asia (figure 9). 
Conversely,  burden  attributable  to  high  SBP  increased 
in the Caribbean and, to a lesser extent, in central and 
western  sub-Saharan  Africa.  Of  the  regions  in  which 
particulate matter pollution was one of the ten leading 
risk  factors,  age-standardised  DALYs  attributable  to 
particulate matter pollution decreased in nine regions, 
with the highest rates of decline in eastern Europe, east 
Asia,  and  central  Europe.  Notably,  burden  attributable 
to particulate matter pollution rose slightly in Australasia 
and  the  Caribbean.  Smoking  showed  attributable 
burden  decreases  over  time  in  all  regions,  with  the 
highest rates of decline in central Asia, eastern Europe, 
tropical Latin America, and south Asia. Time trends in 
the 
attributable  burden  for 
tenth-ranking level 3 risk factors, by region and by SDI, 
can  also  be  seen  in  figure  9.  Detailed  estimates  of 
change over time in attributable DALYs and deaths for 
each  risk  factor  and  outcome—by  GBD  super-region, 
region,  and  country—are  available  in  appendix  3 
(table S13).

Discussion
The  findings  from  GBD  2023  highlight  the  continuing 
epidemiological  transition,  with  substantial  reductions 
in CMNN disease burden contrasted by a rising burden 
of  NCDs  and  metabolic  risk  factors,  largely  driven  by 
ageing and population growth. Between 2010 and 2023, 
global  age-standardised  DALY  rates  decreased  by 
nearly 13%, despite total DALY counts rising by about 6%. 
in  CMNN  diseases—particularly 
The 
diarrhoeal  diseases,  HIV/AIDS, 
tuberculosis,  and 
malaria, with approximate decreases in age-standardised 
DALY  rates  of  49%,  43%,  42%,  and  21%,  respectively—
represents a major global health achievement up to 2023, 
yet  neonatal  disorders  and  lower  respiratory  infections 
remain leading causes of burden. NCDs now account for 
nearly two-thirds of global DALYs, with ischaemic heart 
disease, stroke, diabetes, and chronic respiratory diseases 
among the top contributors. Our analysis estimated that 
about  46%  of  total  2023  DALYs  were  attributable  to  the 
modifiable risk factors included in GBD 2023, particularly 
high  SBP,  particulate  matter  pollution,  and  smoking. 
Notably, age-standardised DALY rates attributable to high 
BMI,  high  FPG,  and  drug  use  increased,  underscoring 
emerging global health challenges. Although substantial 
gains in health have been made, these results emphasise 
the  need 
targeted 
for  risk-factor  mitigation  and 
interventions to address the ever-rising burden of NCDs 
and  sustain  progress  towards  reducing  the  burden  of 
CMNN  diseases.  Without  advances  in  prevention,  early 
diagnosis,  and  chronic  disease  management  of  NCDs, 
gains in longevity risk being offset by a rising burden of 
non-fatal diseases. This underscores the need for health 
systems  and  policy  makers  to  prioritise  healthy  ageing, 
focusing not only on reducing mortality rates, but also on 
improving  preventive  care  and  disease  management.

ArticlesMoreover,  recent  budgetary  cuts 
to  development 
assistance  are  re-ordering  the  global  health  system, 
posing a real and immediate threat to sustaining health 
gains.31,32  The  evolving  situation  demands  not  only 
targeted  policy  responses,  but  also  rigorous,  objective, 
ongoing monitoring.

A hallmark of GBD is the continued emphasis on data-
driven estimation and ongoing collection and curation of 
health data. For this cycle of GBD, we added more than 
34 000 new inputs of data for disease and injury burden 
estimation  and  about  16 000  new  inputs  for  risk  factor 
analysis.  These  additions  represent  surveys  newly 
identified  through  active  data  seeking;  collaborator 
feedback; expanded use of already-identified surveys and 
new  phases  of  existing  surveys,  such  as  Multiple 
Indicator Cluster Surveys, available for the first time in 
this cycle; updates and revisions to reporting time series; 
and  new  systematic  reviews  to  identify  the  latest  data 
reported in the literature. Data updates not only focus on 
the new estimate years of 2022 and 2023, but also revisit 
the  past,  providing  additional  datapoints  on  causes  and 
locations  where  past  surveys  are  newly  accessible,  or 
filling  in  previous  gaps  in  our  database.  Although 
differences remain among locations in the total amount 
of  data  accessible,  we  have  successfully  accessed  data 
inputs  from  each  of  204  countries  and  territories, 
including  660  subnational  locations,  from  every  year 
estimated, and for each cause and risk factor. Data inputs 
by  cause  and  risk  factor  are  detailed  in  the  GBD  2023 
Sources Tool, which allows users to explore the full array 
of data inputs by metric, by disease, injury, or risk, and by 
location.

social 

We have seen the epidemiological transition continue 
despite  a  global  financial  crisis  and  the  COVID-19 
pandemic.  Sociodemographic  factors  such  as  poverty, 
education,  employment,  and 
inequalities 
continue  to  shape  health  outcomes  by  influencing 
access  to  health  services,  nutritional  quality,  and  the 
ability to engage in preventive health behaviours. These 
determinants  are  particularly  relevant  with  respect  to 
the  CMNN  diseases,  for  which—despite  progress  in 
infectious  diseases  and 
reducing  mortality  from 
maternal and neonatal conditions—the burden remains 
disproportionately  high 
low  and  middle  SDI 
in 
countries  due  to  persistent  disparities  in  health-care 
access,  vaccination  coverage,  and  nutrition.  This 
pattern  can  be  seen  at  large  geographical  scales,  as  in 
the Sahel, the semi-arid expanse that includes countries 
within  the  GBD  regions  of  central  and  western 
sub-Saharan  Africa,  and  Eritrea.  Malnutrition,  both 
under-nutrition  and  the  rising  prevalence  of  obesity, 
represents  a  double  burden  of  disease,  demanding 
integrated  strategies  that  address  food  security,  health 
system strengthening, and social policies that promote 
health equity.

Effective  solutions  must  extend  beyond  individual

structural  determinants, 
including  food  availability  and  affordability,  urban 
design,  and  public  messaging  on  the  health  risks  of 
high  BMI.  Despite  no  success  in  reversing  obesity 
trends at the population level, governments and global 
health  organisations  must  prioritise  comprehensive 
strategies  that  promote  healthier  diets  and  increased 
physical activity, beginning with early-life interventions. 
Ischaemic heart disease, the leading cause of DALYs for 
both males and females globally, is another high-burden 
disease  that  requires  a  redoubling  of  efforts.  As  new 
approaches  and  innovative  strategies  for  defining  and 
treating  coronary  artery  disease  continue  to  evolve,38 
health policy efforts must prioritise equitable access to 
prevention,  detection, 
and 
treatment,  particularly  in  under-served  and  lower-
resourced  settings.  Equitable  access  to  evidence-based 
treatments  should  also  be  part  of  a  broader  effort  to 
reduce weight-related disease burden and mortality. For 
example, a recent study showed that statin therapy was 
prescribed  to  less  than  10%  of  eligible  individuals  for 
primary  prevention  of  cardiovascular  disease  in  many 
low-income  and  middle-income  countries.39  Novel 
therapies, such as GLP-1 receptor agonists, which have 
demonstrated effectiveness in managing obesity, type 2 
diabetes,  and  cardiovascular  risk,  remain 
largely 
inaccessible  outside  high-income  countries.40  There  is 
an urgent need to expand access to established essential 
medicines,  while  also  improving  clinical  studies  and 
population-level 
treatments 
globally.41,42  Beyond  obesity, 
tackling  other  major 
modifiable  metabolic  and  behavioural  risk  factors—
including high SBP, tobacco use, and substance use—is 
crucial.  Although  tobacco  use  has  declined  in  high-
income  regions,  it  remains  alarmingly  high  in  others. 
Designed to align with the WHO Framework Convention 
on  Tobacco  Control,  MPOWER  measures43  provide  a 
framework  for  enacting  tobacco  control,  yet  full 
implementation 
is  needed  to  accelerate  progress. 
Managing  high  blood  pressure  effectively  requires 
widespread access to high-quality primary care, an area 
in which many health systems still fall short.

Despite substantial declines in exposure due to removal 
from  motor  vehicle  fuels,  lead  exposure—recognised 
since  the  Roman  Empire  as  a  health  risk  factor44,45—
persists  as  an  important  contributor  to  cardiovascular 
disease burden, especially in central and eastern Europe 
and  central  Asia.  Although  these  effects  largely  reflect 
accumulated  bone  lead  concentrations  driven  by  past 
exposure before removal of leaded gasoline, lead remains 
a  ubiquitous  environmental  contaminant.  Efforts  to

contaminated  soil,  drinking  water,  battery  recycling, 
electronic waste, spices, cookware, and other consumer 
products,  combined  with  surveillance  to  identify  highly 
exposed populations, should be prioritised. Additionally, 
evidence continues to accumulate for the scope of NCDs 
affected  by  exposure 
to  particulate  matter  air 
pollution  (PM₂·₅),  a  risk  factor  for  the  eight  leading 
causes of death globally, including dementia46 and type 2 
diabetes,47 which have rapidly increasing mortality rates.16 
Even  low  levels  of  PM₂·₅  have  been  associated  with 
increased  dementia  risk,48  and  more  than  a  sixth  of  the 
global burden of type 2 diabetes was attributable to PM₂·₅ 
in 2023 (GBD 2023 Results Tool). Although the burden 
associated  with  one  PM₂·₅  risk  factor,  household  air 
pollution,  has  declined  dramatically 
in 
sub-Saharan Africa,49 ambient PM₂·₅ remains the leading 
global environmental risk factor. It is essential that policy 
makers  align  national  standards  with  WHO  guidelines 
and,  crucially,  develop  implementation  approaches  to 
reduce exposures and consequent effects on health.50 The 
increasing  evidence  for  the  involvement  of  PM₂·₅  in 
major  diseases  suggests  an  opportunity  for  future 
research to help identify individuals at high risk and to 
inform potential prevention options.

GBD 2023 also highlights the staggering increase in 
the burden of mental disorders globally, the underlying 
causes,  and  even  temporal  trend,  of  which  remain 
widely debated.51 There is convincing evidence that the 
COVID-19 pandemic resulted in secondary deterioration 
of  mental  health,  leading  to  an  increase  in  the 
prevalence  of  depressive  and  anxiety  disorders.52 
Notably,  the  largest  increases  in  these  disorders  were 
estimated  to  have  occurred  following  the  onset  of  the 
COVID-19 pandemic. However, there is also convincing 
evidence  that  the  prevalence  of  these  disorders  has 
been  increasing  steadily  over  the  past  two  decades, 
especially  for  some  locations  within  the  high-income 
super-region.7  There  are  several  competing  and 
complementary  theories  for  this  increase,  including 
increases  in  social  media  use,  cyberbullying,  child 
maltreatment, climate despair, and rising costs of living 
and income inequality,51,53 with expanded mental health 
awareness and increased reporting further highlighting 
the  problem.  Meta-analyses 
significant 
associations  between  social  media  use  and  symptoms 
of  depression  and  anxiety,  but  further  research  is 
needed  to  explore  the  causal  direction.54  However,  the 
widespread use and influence of social media in many 
parts  of  the  world  might  make  it  difficult  to  detect  its 
effects  at  the  individual  level.  Population-level  studies 
are  required  to  determine  the  relationship  between 
social  media  use  and  mental  disorders,  as  well  as  to 
design suitable interventions. For example, in Australia, 
the federal government recently passed a law effectively 
banning children younger than 16 years from accessing 
certain  forms  of  social  media.  This  presents  a  unique 

suggest 

opportunity  for  researchers  to  further  examine  the 
effects  of  public  health  policy  on  social  media  and  its 
effects  on  youth  mental  health.  Focused  efforts  are 
needed  to  better  understand  these  drivers  and  inform 
policies that can effectively address the growing mental 
health crisis.

GBD  2023  presents  strong  evidence  for  exposure  to 
sexual abuse and intimate partner violence as additional 
preventable  contributors  to  several  mental  disorders, 
notably major depressive disorder and anxiety disorders, 
as  well  as  a  large  set  of  other  conditions  ranging  from 
maternal  disorders  to  asthma,  as  well  as  homicide  and 
suicide  (appendix  3  table  S13).27  The  highest  rates  of 
DALYs  attributable  to  intimate  partner  violence  and 
in 
sexual  violence  against  children  were  seen 
sub-Saharan  Africa,  but  high  rates  were  also  seen  in 
high-income regions, demonstrating that the detrimental 
effects  of  sexual  and  intimate  partner  violence  span 
across  societies,  regardless  of  socioeconomic  status. 
Among  reproductive-aged  females,  intimate  partner 
violence  ranked  in  the  top  five  health  risks,  with  an 
attributable DALY rate similar to that of iron deficiency, 
while the global DALY rate attributable to sexual violence 
against children was similar to that of unsafe sanitation 
(GBD  Compare;  appendix  3 
table  S13).  Bullying 
victimisation also merits discussion as a modifiable risk 
factor, ranking sixth among the behavioural risk factors 
in  attributable  DALYs  among  young  people  aged 
the 
10–24  years,  with  highest  rates  observed 
north Africa and the Middle East and high-income super-
regions  (GBD  Compare).  Our  estimates  highlight 
specific  health  outcomes  associated  with  exposure  to 
violence—and 
violence—particularly 
quantify the health burden it engenders, adding further 
detail to the growing body of data illuminating the high 
prevalence  of  gender-based  violence.55,56  Together,  these 
data are a call to action. Compared with other conditions 
with  a  similar  magnitude  of  burden,  efforts  to  prevent 
exposure  to  violence,  as  well  as  address  the  needs  of 
survivors,  have  historically  been  under-prioritised.  It  is 
essential  to  better  quantify  and  understand  intimate 
partner  violence  and  sexual  violence  against  children, 
especially  because  both  are  often  hidden  and 
under-reported.

Overall,  progress 

in  CMNN  diseases  has  been 
astounding  over  the  period  of  study;  despite  profound 
setbacks  in  the  form  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  this 
progress  remains  one  of  the  shining  achievements  of 
global health. These gains are not unidirectional and are 
sustained through an imperfect constellation of national 
and  international  efforts  in  prevention,  treatment,  and 
cure. In an environment of reduced funds to combat the 
major  sources  of  communicable  disease  burden,57  it  is 
possible  that  we  will  see  reversals  in  some  of  these 
trends. As we face these challenges and their effects, we 
believe that there has never been a time in which global 
health measurement is so important.

ArticlesThere  are  several  limitations  to  the  overall  GBD 
enterprise  that  provide  opportunities  to  refine  and 
improve  the  quality  and  accuracy  of  the  results.  The 
iterative  nature  of  GBD  reflects  the  incorporation  of 
new  data  sources,  methodological  improvements,  and 
to  stabilise  data  and  analytical 
ongoing  efforts 
processes. Despite these efforts, challenges persist due 
to variability in the availability and quality of input data. 
Inconsistent quality, flawed methodologies, and gaps in 
the  collection  of  primary  data  make  it  difficult  to 
accurately  quantify  the  burden  of  disease  without 
ongoing  and  thorough  assessments  of  data  quality. 
Additionally,  lags  in  the  availability  of  data  for  more 
recent years further contribute to these challenges. For 
to 
example,  because  surveys  were  delayed  due 
COVID-19, just 19 STEPS surveys conducted since 2020 
have been released to date, only five of which have the 
individual-level  record  data  necessary  to  analyse  some 
causes  and  risk  factors.  By  contrast,  the  4-year  period 
before 2020 had more than 41 STEPS surveys. In time, 
more  data  will  become  available  for  this  period,  with 
additional  details  enriching  summary  reports,  but  the 
typical delays we see in the release of surveys and other 
datasets  were  compounded  by  COVID-19  physical 
distancing restrictions. To the extent possible, the GBD 
analytical  framework—using  a  modelled  statistical 
approach 
to  synthesise  all  evidence  available—is 
designed to account for issues of sparse or missing data 
and  uncertainty  arising  from  a  multitude  of  sources, 
such as stochastic variation in input data, demographic 
adjustments, and bias due to input study characteristics. 
Input bias can be particularly impactful with respect to 
sex and age metadata related to summary statistics, as 
reporting of outcomes stratified by age and sex is often 
not  available,  requiring  processing  using  age-splitting 
and  sex-splitting  algorithms  to  produce  the  more 
granular  estimates  presented 
in  GBD.  However, 
limitations associated with the quality and methods of 
primary data collection remain a recurring obstacle and 
highlight  the  need  to  strengthen  data  collection 
systems. Fully accounting for the range of uncertainties 
inherent in burden and risk factor estimation processes 
remains  an  ongoing  challenge,  and  uncertainty  and 
statistical variation cannot be eliminated.

There  are  also  limitations  specific  to  GBD  disease 
burden  measures.  Time-varying  differences  in  disease 
detection or reporting can bias estimates of prevalence or 
incidence,  making  it  challenging  to  accurately  quantify 
changing  morbidity  over 
time.  Although  we  use 
crosswalking  and  MR-BRT  adjustment  tools  to  account 
for varying case definitions and data collection methods, 
and  have  further  introduced  an  advanced  DisMod-AT 
tool that will allow us to more accurately model temporal 
trends, we acknowledge that YLD trends over time might 
reflect both true morbidity and detection artifacts. More 
detailed  and  improved  diagnostic  data  are  therefore 
in

morbidity.  Temporal  trends  in  causes  might  also  be 
the  ability  of 
limitations 
attenuated  due 
DisMod-MR 2.1 to accurately estimate trends when data 
are  sparse. For  most  causes  that require the prevalence 
by  severity  to  estimate  YLDs,  the  estimated  severity 
distribution  is  largely  sourced  from  a  small  number  of 
survey  series  conducted  in  Australia  and  the  USA 
because  of  the  scarcity  of  comprehensive  data  available 
in other countries. Without more data on severity across 
geography,  there 
in  YLD 
estimation—particularly  in  settings  in  which  access  to 
care,  diagnostic  practices,  and  treatment  availability 
differ  considerably.  However,  work  to  address  this 
concern  is  currently  underway  for  some  causes.58,59  The 
quality  and  accuracy  of  comorbidity  corrections,  which 
are essential to ensure that estimated YLDs are unique to 
each  cause  and  additive  across  causes,  also  require 
continuous  improvement.  For  GBD  2023,  we  assumed 
independent  comorbidity—ie,  the  chance  of  having  a 
comorbid  cause  is  equal  to  its  prevalence.  Assuming 
independent comorbidity can lead to underestimation of 
comorbidity,  especially  for  causes  such  as  mental 
disorders, which have substantial dependent comorbidity, 
and  in  turn  might  overestimate  YLDs  for  some  causes. 
However, in the context of sparse data on joint prevalence 
and  functional  health  loss  from  comorbid  states  across 
all  causes  in  GBD,  the  independence  assumption  is 
necessary  to  make  estimation  possible.  Fortunately, 
simulation  testing  within  epidemiological  datasets  has 
suggested  accounting  for  dependent  comorbidity  has  a 
minimal  impact  on  the  overall  YLD  counts  (appendix  1 
section  2.10).  Limitations  related  to  our  estimation  of 
YLLs are discussed in a parallel GBD 2023 publication.16

combinations  of 

With respect to our risk factor analyses, it is unlikely 
that  our  present  estimates  capture  all  existing 
relationships between risk factors and health outcomes 
and  all  risk-attributable  burden,  although  with  every 
iteration of GBD we add new relationships and update 
evidence.  Not  only  are  additional  risk  factors  and  risk–
outcome pairs considered in every round of GBD, so too 
are mediation relationships. With respect to mediation, 
we adjusted relative risk estimates for mediation based 
on the assumption that joint risks are multiplicative, but 
some 
super-
multiplicative or sub-multiplicative. This issue might be 
particularly  relevant  to  analyses  of  dietary  risk  factors 
that yield protective effects, such as fruit or wholegrain 
intake, or other coincident exposures, such as PM₂·₅ and 
high  temperatures.  More  research  is  needed  to  better 
understand mediation effects to fully account for them 
to  more  accurately  estimate  attributable  burden  for 
factors;  refining  our  mediation 
inter-related  risk 
methods remains a continuing priority. With respect to 
TMRELs,  we  generally  set  them  to  equal  to  zero  for 
those harmful risks where zero exposure is theoretically 
achievable or used the data to empirically derive non-zero 
levels reflecting minimum risk (or used clinical guidance

Articleswhere  data  are  sparse  or  biological  thresholds  are  well 
defined),  with  monotonically  increasing  risk  functions. 
For  protective  risks,  we  generally  set  TMRELs  at  the 
85th percentile of exposure in the available data to avoid 
extrapolating  the  risk  function  outside  the  data-rich 
range  of  the  available  literature,  which  could  lead  to 
exaggerated  estimates  of  attributable  burden  and 
implausible  levels  of  consumption.  Although  evidence 
suggests that these TMRELs yield accurate estimates of 
relative risk,23 further refinements might be needed.

In  the  present  iteration  of  GBD,  our  burden-of-proof 
flexible  meta-regression  framework  more  accurately 
describes the true shape of the risk–outcome relationship 
rather  than  imposing  log-linearity,  systematically  trims 
data outliers, tests and adjusts for bias in the input data, 
and formally quantifies and incorporates between-study 
heterogeneity  unexplained  by  individual  study  design 
features  into  a  measure  of  evidence  strength  that 
combines effect size and uncertainty accounting for this 
between-study heterogeneity. This analytical framework, 
however,  has  not  yet  been  applied  to  all  risk–outcome 
pairs  because  the  work  remains  ongoing.  Moreover, 
because the covariate selection and adjustment methods 
used  to  control  for  bias  are  data  driven  and  rely  on  the 
high-level  information  that  is  available  about  input 
studies  to  meta-analyses  (eg,  which  studies  were  gold 
standard  vs  not),  they  are  unable  to  provide  a  more 
nuanced understanding of the impact of deviations from 
the  gold  standard,  beyond  testing  and  adjusting  for 
systematic  bias.  A  final  limitation  of  the  present  risk 
analysis  is  that  our  assumption  that  the  risk–outcome 
relationships assessed were constant across location and 
time  (with  the  exception  of  relative  risk  functions 
involving  temperature,  which  we  varied  according  to 
annual mean temperature, and the relationship between 
high  BMI  and  breast  cancer,  which  has  been  shown  to 
vary  between  Asian  and  non-Asian  populations60)  is 
unlikely  to  hold  true  for  all  cases.  Burden-of-proof 
methods  provide  an  analytical  framework  to  identify 
variation  in  risk–outcome  relationships  by  location  or 
other population characteristics, but ultimately to do so 
will  require  additional  primary  studies  systematically 
evaluating  differences  between  population  subgroups. 
We  continue  to  evaluate  the  available  evidence  and  will 
incorporate  more  location-specific  or  subgroup  relative 
risk estimates as they are identified.

GBD evolves to ensure its scientific findings remain 
relevant, useful, and timely. With a strong commitment 
to exploring new scientific horizons and opening new 
opportunities  for  research,  our  goal  is  to  update  and 
publish the next iteration of GBD (GBD 2025) as soon 
as  results  are  available.  In  addition  to  quantifying 
additional risk–outcome pairs and evaluating potential 
new  metabolic,  behavioural,  and  environmental  risk 
factors,  we  aim  to  quantify  the  attributable  burden  of 
low educational attainment in GBD 2025, an effort we 
acknowledge  will  be  challenging  as  the  effects  of 

education on disease burden are also mediated through 
numerous  other  risk  factors.  We  hope  to  be  able  to 
expand  to  additional  social  determinants  of  health  in 
future iterations of GBD. In addition to expanding the 
scope  of  GBD,  efforts  to  continually  improve  the 
available  estimates  include  incorporating  additional 
health  conditions  and  geographical  areas,  procuring 
and  assimilating  new  data,  improving  methods  to 
correct  data  discrepancies,  and  better  representing 
uncertainty  in  our  findings.  Additionally,  we  are 
transitioning  to  DisMod-AT,  an  improved  version  of 
DisMod-MR, for most health outcomes. DisMod-AT is 
anticipated  to  improve  the  precision  of  age  and  time 
trends  in  our  prevalence  estimates,  particularly  by 
integrating  the  effects  of  population  shocks.  We  will 
continue  to  test  and  validate  DisMod-AT  and  will 
remain  focused  on  ensuring  harmonisation  and 
consistency in estimates generated using this tool. For 
GBD  2025,  we  plan  to  integrate  severity  distributions 
according  to  levels  of  health-care  access  for  several 
conditions.  We  also  plan  to  account  for  changes  to 
disease  detection  and  diagnosis  across  time  and 
location 
iterations.  Regarding 
adjustments  to  clinical  data,  future  research  could  be 
enhanced by integrating alternative causal frameworks 
and using more granular data on health system usage. 
Last,  there  are  efforts  to  improve  the  methods  that 
account for comorbidities.

researchers, 

This  GBD  2023  synthesis  of  estimates  of  disease  and 
injury  burden  and  risk-attributable  burden  provides 
policy  makers, 
and  public  health 
practitioners with crucial insights to inform global health 
strategies.  It  shows  a  growing  and  ageing  world  where 
progress  against  CMNN  diseases  has  been  remarkable 
across  all  SDI  levels  and  where  continued  progress 
against  NCDs  has  been  modest  and  outpaced  by 
demographic  changes.  With 
focused  efforts  on 
prevention,  risk  mitigation,  and  more  robust  health 
systems,  substantial  strides  can  be  made  towards 
improving  population  health  and  achieving  long-term 
sustainable development targets, as we move ever closer 
to  consensus  goals  for  health  and  wellbeing  impact 
by  2030.  The  challenges  remain  considerable,  however, 
with  the  potential  for  reversal  of  progress  on  CMNN 
diseases resulting from new and substantial reduction in 
funding  for  global  health  alongside  rises  in  metabolic 
disease and risk factors.
