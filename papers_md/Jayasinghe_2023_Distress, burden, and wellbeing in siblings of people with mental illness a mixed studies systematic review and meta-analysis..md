Background. Family members of people with mental illness (MI) may experience a host of psy-
chological adversities such as increased stress, burden, and reduced wellbeing. However, relatively
little is known about siblings. This study aimed to characterise the experience of distress (viz.
depressive and anxiety symptoms), burden, and wellbeing in siblings of people with MI.
Methods. Studies reporting on quantitative measures of depression, anxiety, burden, or well-
being in siblings; and/or qualitative findings on siblings’ experience were eligible. The litera-
ture search was conducted up until 20th October 2022.
Results. Sixty-two studies comprising data from 3744 siblings were included. The pooled
mean percentage of depressive symptoms fell in the mild range at 15.71 (k = 28, N = 2187,
95% CI 12.99–18.43) and anxiety symptoms fell in the minimal range at 22.45 (k = 16, N =
1122, 95% CI 17.09–27.80). Moderator analyses indicate that siblings of people with a schizo-
phrenia spectrum disorder experience greater depressive symptoms than siblings of people with
other types of MI (β = −16.38, p < 0.001). Qualitative findings suggest that individuals may be
particularly vulnerable during their siblings’ illness onset and times of relapse. Limited commu-
nication, confusion about MI, and the need to compensate may contribute to siblings’ distress
and/or burden. Siblings’ experience of wellbeing and caregiving were closely related.
Conclusion. This review highlights the complex psychological experience of siblings and the
need for greater research and clinical support for this important yet often overlooked cohort.

Introduction

More than 12% of the global population live with a mental illness (MI; James et al., 2018;
World Health Organisation, 2022, June 8). People with MI are more likely to experience phys-
ical illness, unemployment, homelessness, incarceration, and are at increased risk of suicide
(World Health Organization, 2013). Deinstitutionalisation, (i.e. the replacement of long-stay
psychiatric hospitals with smaller, community-based services), has occurred across most devel-
oped nations, resulting in many family members of people with MI shouldering a substantially
greater burden of care (Bredewold, Hermus, & Trappenburg, 2020; Lin et al., 2018; Ohaeri,
2003). As a result, family members may experience a host of psychological adversities them-
selves such as stress, caregiver burden, helplessness, depression, and reduced wellbeing
(Baronet, 1999; Fekadu, Mihiretu, Craig, & Fekadu, 2019; Maon, Horesh, & Gvion, 2020;
Phillips, Durkin, Engward, Cable, & Iancu, 2022; Saunders, 2003). These psychological char-
acteristics can be comprehensively conceptualised under three overarching domains: distress,
burden, and wellbeing. Distress is the experience of negative psychological states characterised
by symptoms of depression and anxiety (Drapeau, Marchand, & Beaulieu-Prévost, 2011;
Ridner, 2004), while burden is the strain associated with providing care (Platt, 1985;
Schene, 1990). Wellbeing refers to psychological health or ‘flourishing’ which comprises posi-
tive states, such as pleasure or joy, and an enduring sense of contentment with one’s life
(Marino, Haley, & Roth, 2017; Ryff & Keyes, 1995).

Aging parents often consider siblings to be the next-generation caregivers for their child
(ren) with MI (Smith, Hatfield, & Miller, 2000). Siblings are individuals who share a parent
or guardian via a biological or social relationship. Strong sibling relationships are associated

6946

with mental health benefits for both siblings (Buist, Deković, &
Prinzie, 2013), and sibships are one of the most enduring types
of relationship, often outlasting parental and marital bonds
(Noller, 2005; Smith, Fadden, & O’Shea, 2009). As such, siblings
can be an important and enduring protective factor in the lives of
people with MI.

Despite their importance, relatively little is known about the
psychological characteristics of siblings of people with MI.
Previous narrative reviews of quantitative literature have produced
mixed findings (Maon et al., 2020; Shivers & Textoris, 2021). For
example, Shivers and Textoris (2021) found that some studies
indicate siblings of people with MI experience significantly
worse depressive symptoms and poorer quality sibships than sam-
ples of comparison individuals (Latzer, Katz, & Berger, 2015;
Tschan, Ludtke, Schmid, & In-Albon, 2019), while others suggest
siblings experience less emotional distress and sibling conflict
(Jacoby & Heatherington, 2016; Zauszniewski & Bekhet, 2014);
or no difference in internalisation, externalisation, expressed emo-
tion, and emotionality (Hudson & Rapee, 2002; Kelvin, Goodyer,
& Altham, 1996; Moulds et al., 2000). The synthesis of such
broad-ranging constructs is likely to have contributed to the
mixed findings in previous reviews and hinders our ability to elu-
cidate the nature of specific psychological characteristics in sib-
lings. A recent meta-analytic review conducted by our study
team suggests that individuals with a sibling with MI experience
significantly greater symptoms of depression and anxiety than
those without (Jayasinghe et al., 2022). However, no review to
date has synthesised quantitative findings on burden and well-
being in siblings, and the extent of distress in siblings remains
unclear. In a narrative review including qualitative literature on
siblings of people with an eating disorder, Maon et al. (2020)
found that reoccurring themes included worries about the future,
guilt, sacrifice, and grief. Representing a clear gap, no review to
date has examined qualitative findings on siblings of individuals
with most other types of MI (e.g. schizophrenia spectrum,
mood, personality, or trauma-related disorders).

Thus, the aim of this systematic review was to characterise dis-
tress, burden, and wellbeing in siblings of people with MI. To pro-
vide a comprehensive examination of the literature, a broad range
of psychiatric illnesses were considered and both quantitative and
qualitative data were synthesised using a novel sequential explana-
tory approach (Pluye & Hong, 2014). First, quantitative data were
synthesised to estimate the extent of distress, burden, and well-
being experienced by siblings. Subsequently, qualitative data
were synthesised to contextualise the quantitative findings.

Methods

In this study we address a subset of research questions stemming
from a review of the psychological characteristics, viz., distress,
burden, and wellbeing, of siblings of people with MI. The review
was prospectively registered with the International Prospective
Register of Systematic Reviews (CRD42020202757). The current
study adheres to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic
Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA 2020) guidelines (Page
et al., 2021). PRISMA 2020 checklists can be found in
Supplementary Material (online Supplementary Tables S1 and S2).

Search strategy

The literature searches were conducted in MEDLINE Complete
(EBSCOhost), PsycINFO (EBSCOhost), and Embase (EBSCOhost),

with the final search occurring on 20th October 2022. The search
terms included the concepts of siblings, mental illness, distress,
burden, and wellbeing (online Supplementary Table S3). The
search was limited to articles published in English with no restric-
tion on publication date.

Eligibility criteria

Studies were eligible for inclusion if they were full-text articles
presenting original qualitative or quantitative findings. Studies
were required to present either qualitative themes relating to the
psychological experience of siblings or to report on the mean
and standard deviation on a measure of distress (i.e. depressive
or anxiety symptom severity – henceforth depressive or anxiety
symptoms), burden, or wellbeing. Studies were also required to
report on individuals aged 10 years or above who had at least
one biological, step, adoptive, or foster sibling with MI. Mental ill-
ness was understood as any psychiatric disorder, including personal-
ity disorders and excluding neurodevelopmental and neurocognitive
disorders. Studies were excluded if they reported on samples of fewer
than 10 participants or if the available data were obtained via parent,
guardian, or proband report. Online Supplementary Table S4 pro-
vides full details of the eligibility criteria.

Study selection

AJ and AW independently screened titles and abstracts, followed
by full-text articles, against the criteria specified for the broader
review (online Supplementary Table S4). AJ and AW independ-
ently screened full-text articles against criteria for the current
review (online Supplementary Table S4). Study authors were con-
tacted if data on a quantitative outcome of interest were collected
but not reported, and/or if further clarification was required (e.g.
scoring of a measure). Ten authors (45.45% of requests) provided
information. Where multiple publications reported on overlap-
ping samples, the article reporting on the largest sample was
reviewed unless the publications reported on unique outcomes
of interest. Online Supplementary Table S5 provides a list of arti-
cles that fulfilled most but not all eligibility criteria.

Data extraction

Data from each publication was extracted independently by at
least two authors (AJ, AW, CM, or SM). Information on the char-
acteristics of each study, sibling sample, and proband sample were
extracted. For qualitative studies, authors extracted (sub)themes
along with an illustrative quote, where possible. For studies
where both themes and subthemes were provided, data was
extracted only at the subtheme level to avoid the inclusion of over-
lapping qualitative data.

Quality appraisal and certainty assessment

Authors (AJ, AW, SM and CM) independently used the Joanna
Briggs Institute (JBI) Critical Appraisal Checklist for Analytical
Cross Sectional Studies or the JBI Critical Appraisal Checklist
for Qualitative Research to assess the methodological quality of
included reports (Lockwood, Munn, & Porritt, 2015; Moola
et al., 2017). An overall rating of ‘High’ or ‘Low’ was assigned to
each publication. AJ utilised the Grading of Recommendation,
Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) framework

Psychological Medicine

6947

to assess the certainty of evidence for each quantitative outcome
(Guyatt et al., 2011). AW subsequently reviewed GRADE ratings.
Any disagreements during the screening, extraction, or quality
appraisal phase were resolved via discussion between AJ, AW, SM,
and CM, and/or with senior authors (KF, GM, LKB, and SC).

Data analysis
As noted above, to characterise siblings’ experience of distress, bur-
den, and wellbeing; we employed a sequential explanatory approach
to data synthesis (Pluye & Hong, 2014). Quantitative findings were
synthesised first and used to guide our analysis of qualitative find-
ings. Results of the qualitative analysis were then used to context-
ualise quantitative findings. Although the contextualisation of
quantitative findings using qualitative findings could be considered
results of this review (Pluye, Bengoechea, Granikov, Kaur, & Tang,
2018; Pluye & Hong, 2014), this content has been presented as part
of the discussion section due to the dearth of other relevant litera-
ture in this field. Figure 1 illustrates the data analysis process and
online Supplementary Table S6 provides further details.

Quantitative analysis
Quantitative data were tabulated according to the following a
priori groupings: depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, bur-
den (overall), burden (positive aspects), burden (negative
aspects), burden (objective), burden (subjective), wellbeing (nega-
tive affect), wellbeing (positive affect), and wellbeing (eudemo-
nic). Burden was initially conceptualised as comprising two
major components: objective and subjective burden (Hoenig &
Hamilton, 1966). Objective burden refers to observable difficulties
such as loss of employment while subjective burden refers to an
individual’s evaluation of the strain associated with caregiving
(Platt, 1985). More recently, burden has been considered within
a stress-appraisal-coping framework which posits that the impact
of caregiving is dependent on an individual’s appraisal of their
experience (Lazarus & Folkman, 1984). With this shift, new mea-
sures of burden were developed to capture the negative and posi-
tive aspects of caregiving (Szmukler et al., 1996). The above listed
groupings of burden were utilised given that available measures –
while highly correlated – capture distinct
facets (Schulze &
Rössler, 2005). Similarly, two types of wellbeing are commonly
recognised: hedonic and eudemonic (Marino et al., 2017; Ryff,
1989). Hedonic wellbeing refers to fleeting states that are often
captured in three dimensions: the presence of positive affective
states, the absence of negative affective states, and feelings of uplift
typically referred to as ‘satisfaction with life’ (Marino et al., 2017).
Eudemonic wellbeing, in contrast, pertains to a lasting sense of
contentment (Ryff & Keyes, 1995). In line with prior reviews
(e.g. van Agteren et al., 2021), the outlined groupings were
selected to capture these aspects of wellbeing.

Statistical analyses were conducted using Comprehensive
Meta-Analysis Software Version 3 (Borenstein, Hedges, Higgins,
& Rothstein, 2013). To calculate the pooled mean, we used a
random-effects model for each outcome of interest as per the
above listed groupings. To allow for comparability across mea-
sures, raw scores were standardised prior to meta-analysis.
Scores were standardised by calculating a fraction using the
mean or standard deviation as the numerator and the possible
range of scores on the relevant measure as the denominator
(Bath, Deeg, & Poppelaars, 2010). The fraction was then multi-
plied by 100. Based on cohesiveness with the measures used in
for
this body of

the Hamilton Rating Scale

literature,

Depression (HAM-D) and Anxiety (HAM-A) were selected to
facilitate the interpretation of depressive and anxiety symptom
data. To do so, cut-off scores on these measures were standardised
as outlined above. This resulted in the following ranges: HAM-D
0–13 minimal; 14–30 mild; 31–44 moderate; 45+ severe; and
HAM-A 0–29 minimal; 30–43 mild; 44+ moderate to severe
(Thompson, 2015; Zimmerman, Martinez, Young, Chelminski,
& Dalrymple, 2013). Where the analysis included >10 publica-
tions, we assessed small study bias visually via inspection of fun-
nel plot asymmetry, and statistically using Egger’s regression test
(Higgins et al., 2022, August 4). We used Cochran’s Q to assess
the significance of heterogeneity across studies and Higgins I2
to examine the extent of heterogeneity with the following inter-
pretations: I2<40% = low; 40–75% = moderate; and >75% = high
variance in effect size (Higgins et al., 2022, August 4).

Several sensitivity and moderator analyses were conducted to
provide a nuanced evaluation of the quantitative data (Fig. 1).
A detailed description of these analyses can be found in online
Supplementary Table S6.

Qualitative analysis
Each extracted (sub)theme was assigned a credibility rating of
‘unequivocal’,
‘credible’, or ‘not supported’ based on the (sub)
theme’s name, description, and illustrative quote as presented in
the original publication (online Supplementary Table S7;
Lockwood et al., 2020). A rating of ‘unequivocal’ was assigned
where there was clear cohesion between (sub)theme name, descrip-
‘Credible’ was assigned where there
tion, and illustrative quote.
were some doubts about the association between information cap-
tured in a (sub)theme name, description, and illustrative quote.
‘Not supported’ was assigned where there was little or no associ-
ation between captured information. (Sub)themes with a rating of
‘not supported’ were excluded from the subsequent analysis.
Included (sub)themes were assigned to a category based on the
established quantitative concepts of distress, burden, and wellbeing.
AJ and AW synthesised (sub)themes using an inductive con-
tent meta-analysis approach (Cho & Lee, 2014; Mayring, 2000).
In this approach, new categories and subcategories were induct-
ively developed based on the latent content meaning of extracted
primary data. This process involved ongoing revision of the emer-
ging (sub)categories with the progressive incorporation of pri-
mary data. SM reviewed the preliminary results of the synthesis
to assess for clarity and representativeness of primary data.
Results were then tabulated and narratively reviewed. With refer-
ence to the initial classifications based on the concepts of distress,
burden, and wellbeing (see online Supplementary Table S7); results
of the content meta-analysis were used to contextualise quantitative
meta-analytic findings (e.g. where a subcategory was primarily
comprised of extracted data classified as ‘burden’, this subcategory
was used to contextualise quantitative findings on burden).

To enrich our interpretation of qualitative data, we utilised
repeated readings during all stages of extraction and synthesis.
Any disagreements were resolved via discussions (between AJ,
AW, SM, CM, KF, LKB, GM, and/or SC) that aimed to incorpor-
ate multiple interpretations of the data.

quantitative data and 21 studies provided qualitative data. Three
publications used mixed methods; however, one reported only
quantitative data and two reported only qualitative data that
were eligible for inclusion.

Study characteristics

Included studies comprised data from 3744 siblings. Based on avail-
able data, siblings were on average 32.76 years old (S.D. = 16.32; n =
2784) and 59.70% were female (n = 2199). Studies predominantly
considered siblings of people with a schizophrenia spectrum dis-
order (k = 22) and most were conducted in Europe (k = 26).
Tables 1 and 2 present key characteristics for included publications
and online Supplementary Tables S8–S11 detail additional informa-
tion on siblings, probands, and sibships for each report.

Quality appraisal

Of the 42 publications contributing to the quantitative synthesis,
28 were deemed ‘High’ quality and 14 ‘Low’
(see online

Supplementary Table S12 for full details). Most studies (k = 39)
employed a validated measure of depressive symptoms, anxiety
symptoms, burden, and/or wellbeing. In contrast, studies varied
in their description of eligibility criteria, as well as their character-
isation of siblings and probands. Only 15 studies (35.71%)
employed a structured clinical interview to determine the pres-
ence of a MI in probands.

Of the 22 reports included in the qualitative synthesis, seven
were considered High quality while the remainder were evaluated
Low (online Supplementary Table S11). Most publications (k =
15) represented participants’ accounts well by providing illustra-
tive quotes to support the findings of the research. However, stud-
ies varied in reporting research methodology. As a result, the
congruity between research methodology and philosophical per-
spective, research question(s), data collection methods, and
approach to data analysis in many (k = 9) publications was
unclear. Finally, representing a major area of concern, only one
report discussed the influence of the authors on the research
and no study provided a statement locating the authors culturally
and/or theoretically.

Quantitative results

Distress
Depressive symptoms. After standardisation, the pooled mean
for depressive symptoms was 15.71 (Table 3 and Fig. 3). In uni-
variate meta-regression analyses (Table 4), the mean age, region
of study, and income status of study country were not significant
moderators of effect sizes ( p = 0.413, p = 0.903, and p = 0.096
respectively). Estimates of effect size were significantly moderated
by the proportion of female participants, category of mental illness
(schizophrenia spectrum v. mood v. eating disorders), and instru-
ment rater (clinician v. self-rated). Mean depressive symptoms
were significantly higher in samples with greater proportions of
male participants (i.e. male siblings of people with MI, β = −0.25,
p = 0.041, R2 = 0.13). Category of mental
illness accounted for
52% of variance in effect sizes, with mean depressive symptoms
being significantly higher in studies considering siblings of people
with a schizophrenia spectrum disorder compared to an eating
disorder (β = 17.16, p = 0.0007) or a mood disorder (β = 22.26,
p < 0.001). Finally, mean depressive symptoms were significantly
greater in studies using a self-report measure compared to those
using a clinician-rated instrument (β = 16.29, p = 0.0002, R2 = 0.36).
In a subsequent multivariate meta-regression analysis of cat-
illness (schizophrenia spectrum disorder v.
egory of mental
other) and proportion of female participants, only category of

mental illness remained a significant covariate (β = −19.23, p <
0.001, R2 = 0.48). That is, depressive symptoms were significantly
higher in siblings of people with a schizophrenia spectrum dis-
order compared to other MIs irrespective of the proportion of
female participants. In an analysis of proportion of female parti-
cipants and instrument rater, both covariates remained significant
(β = −0.23, p = 0.018 and β = −15.96, p < 0.001 respectively; R2 =
0.47). Similarly, in an analysis of category of mental illness and
instrument rater, both covariates were significant (β = −16.38,
p < 0.001 and β = −11.40, p = 0.001 respectively; R2 = 0.63).
Importantly, when two outlying effects
(Fekih-Romdhane,
Nsibi, Sassi, & Cheour, 2020; Pignon et al., 2021) were removed
from the analysis, only category of mental illness and instrument
rater remained significant covariates. Outlying estimates were
identified using Tukey’s method in SPSS (IBM Corp, 2020;
Tukey, 1977). Full details of all sensitivity analyses are provided
in online Supplementary material (Sections 2–5).

Anxiety symptoms. The pooled standardised mean for anxiety
symptoms was 22.45 (Table 3 and Fig. 4). A univariate meta-
regression analysis indicated that sibling age accounted for 54%
of variance in effect sizes, with mean anxiety symptoms signifi-
cantly decreasing with mean age of siblings (β = −0.80, p <
0.001; Table 4). A further univariate analysis indicated that region
of study accounted for 40% of variance in effect sizes ( p = 0.009,

Table 4). Effect sizes were significantly higher in studies con-
ducted in Asia and Oceania compared to studies conducted in
the Americas (β = 21.43, p = 0.002). No significant difference
was found in studies conducted in the Americas compared to
Europe ( p = 0.057). Proportion of
female participants and
category of mental illness (mood v. eating disorders) were not
significant moderators ( p = 0.317 and p = 0.567).

No further meta-regression analyses were conducted across all
outcomes of interest due to an insufficient number of included
studies.

Burden and wellbeing
The pooled standardised means for burden outcomes were: 36.27
(overall burden); 37.29 (negative aspects); 49.91 (positive aspects);
40.19 (objective burden); and 41.97 (subjective burden; Table 3
and online Supplementary Section 4). For wellbeing outcomes,
the pooled standardised means were: 14.64 (negative affect);
55.64 (positive affect); and 69.39 (eudemonic wellbeing; Table 3
and online Supplementary Section 5).

Certainty of evidence
Online Supplementary Table S14 provides a summary of certainty
of evidence rating for each quantitative outcome of interest.
Certainty of evidence ratings was determined in accordance
with GRADE (Guyatt et al., 2011).

Qualitative findings

The content of qualitative data was organised into a structure
comprising three levels (Fig. 5). We used the term ‘category’ to
denote the highest level. Four categories emerged from our ana-
lysis. Our four categories encompassed nine ‘subcategories’,
which constitute the second level of our structure. We used the
term ‘component’ to denote our third and final level. Four com-
ponents emerged from our analysis, each of which highlights a
specific aspect of a subcategory.

Category 1: The illness shapes home life
Almost half (40.91%) of included qualitative studies suggested
that siblings’ experience of home life was adversely affected by
MI. Three subcategories emerged in characterising these impacts.
Subcategory 1.1: I bear witness to the struggles of our fam-
ily. Siblings were highly aware of the challenges faced by their
family members. For example, siblings observed arguments
between parents and/or parent(s) and their sibling with MI.
Siblings also noticed numerous failed attempts made by their par-
ents to help their sibling with MI. Such experiences resulted in
siblings feeling sad, helpless, frustrated, and/or angry.

I felt helpless, but also aggressive because she was so indifferent. Our par-
ents sat there, crying, and she just sat there and said, ‘just leave me alone!’
I was so angry, and I screamed at her. One time I even resorted to vio-
lence. (Jungbauer, Heibach, & Urban, 2016, pg. 81–2)

One study revealed that some parents reach the point of giving up,
leaving siblings feeling further disappointed and isolated. All primary
data included in this subcategory were classified under ‘burden’.

Subcategory 1.2: I live with and without my sibling. Siblings
described experiencing ongoing grief due to the loss of the con-
nection they shared with their sibling prior to illness onset.
Participants described their sibling with MI as both present and
impacted their broader
not present, which subsequently

experience of home life. For some, their grief was compounded by
the difficulties that resulted from caring for their sibling which
remained in the absence of connection to their sibling. Others did
not allow themselves to grieve as this was associated with a deep
loss of hope: ‘it is the same as if you have pronounced the person
dead.’ (Kristoffersen & Mustard, 2000, pg. 25). Primary data in
this subcategory were classified as ‘burden’ and/or ‘distress’.

Subcategory 1.3: We only talk around the issues. Siblings
shared that communication became limited and superficial in
their families. This occurred in various relationships and for vari-
ous reasons. For example, some parents intentionally did not dis-
cuss illness-related issues with the siblings of their child with MI.
In some families, members talked often among themselves but
not with the individual with MI. In others, siblings struggled to
talk openly about their own challenges. Across studies, siblings
‘It is
felt that more open communication would be relieving:
like having gas in your stomach. You cannot keep things that
way.
(Ewertzon, Cronqvist, Lutzen, &
Andershed, 2012, pg. 161). Primary data in this subcategory
were all classified under ‘burden’.

to pain.’

Category 2: The illness shapes me
Over seventy per cent (72.73%) of included qualitative studies
reported at least one (sub)theme relating to pervasive effects on
siblings’ development of self, values, and/or understanding of
the world. Two subcategories captured these impacts.

Subcategory 2.1: I am secondary to my sibling. Many studies
(54.55%) suggested that having a sibling with MI can profoundly
affect an individual’s sense of self, the world, and their relation-
ships. In some instances, this occurred to the extent where indi-
viduals understood themselves solely in relation to their sibling
with MI. One sibling questioned, ‘Do I exist in this world, really,
just her?’ (Fjermestad, Ro, Espeland, Halvorsen, &
or is it
Halvorsen, 2020, pg. 87). Siblings reported feeling that their

needs were less important than others, particularly their sibling
with MI. Contributing to this experience, siblings reported that
extended family often focused on how their sibling with MI was
doing and rarely asked about them. Primary data in this subcat-
egory were classified as ‘burden’ and/or ‘wellbeing’. Two specific
components emerged within this subcategory.

Component 2.1.1: I compensate for their illness. Siblings
described responding to the struggles of their families in a com-
pensatory manner. For instance, siblings reported striving to
achieve, maturing faster than their peers, or even adopting certain
roles: ‘it was my job to be sane, to leave the house, to go to college’
(Lukens, Thorning, & Lohrer, 2004, pg. 495). One participant
recalled evading neighbours who would complain about their sib-
ling’s symptomatic behaviours: ‘it was embarrassing and uncom-
fortable talking to people about his condition…We were
deliberately avoiding them’ (Amaresha, Venkatasubramanian, &
Muralidhar, 2019, pg. 417). These compensatory responses typic-
ally resulted in siblings feeling grief, resentment, and/or burden.
Primary data in this component were predominantly classified
under ‘burden’.

Component 2.1.2: My emotional

landscape is intertwined
with their illness. Siblings described an inextricable link between
their day-to-day emotions and the health of their sibling with MI.
For example, an inescapable consequence of loving a sibling with
MI was to feel sorrow when they suffer. As one participant high-
lighted, the emotional impact of a sibling’s ill-health can be severe:

I couldn’t sleep in the night… I would be crying day and night, I think
because I used to go there [hospital] and the things she was saying…. I
had so many problems, I couldn’t eat or sleep, and that just affected me
badly. (Sin, Moone, & Harris, 2008, pg. 35)

Siblings also described ongoing guilt and/or internal conflict in
deciding how much caregiving they ought to provide. Primary data
in this component were predominantly classified under ‘distress’.

data comprising each subcategory.
Note. Figure and method of analysis used to produce figure were adapted from “Positive and negative impacts of schizophrenia on family caregivers: a systematic
review and qualitative meta-summary” by Shiraishi and Reilly (2019); and by Sandelowski and Barroso (2007). The proportional intensity of thematic reporting
(PI-TR) was calculated by dividing the number of included (sub)themes from one study by the total number of included (sub)themes. The PI-TR represents the
contribution of each study to the overall synthesis. Similarly, the proportional frequency of qualitative findings (PF-QF) was calculated by dividing the number
of studies that reported on a specific subtheme by the total number of studies eligible for inclusion. The PF-QF represents the extent to which each subtheme
of the current synthesis features in the qualitative studies included in this review. The figure also provides a heat map illustrating the number of extracted
(sub)themes from each included study that contributed to each subtheme of the resultant thematic structure.

Subcategory 2.2: I live with the unknowns of mental illness.
Siblings reported struggling with unanswered questions about the
illness. For example, participants attempted to make sense of why
their sibling developed a MI: ‘We often ask ourselves ‘why’, but
there is no particular reason… We try to understand, but we
don’t know anything, so we feel ill at ease’ (Persico, Grandclerc,
Giraud, Moro, & Blanchet, 2021, pg. 5). As a result, siblings
described experiencing grief coupled with a sense of injustice
and/or fear that they or their children may also become unwell.
Some siblings lived with persistent fear due to the unpredictability
of their sibling’s illness, while others experienced confusion about
the cause of unusual symptoms, hypervigilance to symptoms of
MI in others, uncertainty about their own mental health, and/or
powerlessness in not knowing how to help. Within this subcat-
egory, primary data were mostly classified under ‘distress’. Two
specific components emerged in characterising this subcategory.
Component 2.2.1: I live with others’ confusion. An integral
aspect of living with the unknowns of MI was living with other
people’s misunderstandings, e.g. stigma. Siblings reported that
this difficulty was most pronounced during illness onset.
Importantly, one study found that stigma can extend to siblings’
interactions with support services. As one sibling described:

…The hardest part was that people do not understand it is an illness.
When he was violent, police would come to our house and handcuff
him… then we would go to the hospital and see him shackled to a bed
because he was violent. (Friedrich, Lively, & Buckwalter, 1999, pg., 16)

All primary data in this component were classified under

‘burden’.

Component 2.2.2: What belongs to their illness? Participants
struggled to differentiate their sibling from symptoms of the ill-
ness. As a result, participants struggled to connect with their sib-
ling. As one sibling described:

It’s hard to determine what is the illness and what is the person… What
should I get mad about and what should I just let slide? … How do I deal
with this in a positive way…? (Lukens, Thorning, & Lohrer, 2002, pg. 358)

Importantly, participants who attributed control over illness-
related behaviours to their sibling with MI experienced frustration
and anger towards their sibling. In some instances, individuals felt
envious of the perceived advantages their sibling received due to
their illness. Primary data in this component were mostly classi-
fied as ‘distress’.

Category 3: I feel the weight of responsibility
Over sixty per cent (63.64%) of included studies reported on sib-
lings’ experience of burdensome responsibilities. Four subcategor-
ies emerged in the characterisation of this experience.

Subcategory 3.1: Am I to blame for their illness? Individuals
questioned whether they are in some way responsible for their sib-
ling’s illness: ‘I thought and wondered if I had anything to do with
why it’s like this and wondered if anyone in the family caused this
illness’ (Stålberg, Ekerwald, & Hultman, 2004, pg. 449). This man-
ifested in feelings of guilt over things they had done and/or fears
that they may do something to cause an escalation in their sibling’s
symptoms. One study indicated that, with time, siblings can move
past these feelings by accepting that their actions are unrelated to

their sibling’s illness. Primary data in this subcategory were mixed
with classifications of ‘distress’, ‘burden’, and ‘wellbeing’.

Subcategory 3.2: Caring feels good but I pay a price. For many
siblings, the positive and negative aspects of caregiving were inter-
connected: ‘it makes us feel good inside, but at the same time, it
destroys us’ (Persico et al., 2021, pg. 6). Siblings revealed that pro-
viding care requires sustaining hope that one’s efforts are helpful
and, as an unavoidable consequence, the experience of despair
when their sibling relapses. Participants acknowledged that, because
of having a sibling with MI, they developed positive traits such as a
deep compassion for others. This was seen as ‘both a curse and a
blessing’ as such traits drew others to seek out their support as
well (Lukens et al., 2004, pg. 494). Primary data in this subcategory
were classified as ‘burden’ and/or ‘wellbeing’.

Subcategory 3.3: My responsibility goes beyond that of a sib-
ling. Siblings described needing to step into parental and/or adult
roles: ‘dad was upset, my sister was upset, and I was the one comfort-
ing them’
(Karlstad, Moe, Wattum, Adelsten Stokland, &
Brinchmann, 2021, pg. 5). For some, their relationship with their sib-
ling with MI bore a closer resemblance to a parent-child relationship
than a sibship. In adopting adult roles, siblings reported acting as a
therapist, mediator, and/or social worker for other family members.

‘I was ‘this’ with that person, ‘this’ with the other person, ‘this’ with my
brother, a lot of fragmentation and exerted energy. The family bonds
and relationships get confusing because my parents have secret conversa-
tions about my brother with me. There is a struggle because I’m not their
social worker [expressing frustration about being expected to fill this role
within the family]. I end up playing therapist for everyone.’ (Lukens et al.,
2004, pg. 495).

In response to these roles, siblings described feelings of stress,
frustration, guilt, fear, and inner conflict. Primary data in this sub-
category were mostly classified as ‘burden’.

Subcategory 3.4: The system ignores me. Two studies indi-
cated that siblings encounter difficulties when engaging with
mental health services, thereby increasing the challenges of their
caregiving role. The experience involved being unheard, excluded,
devalued, and/or dismissed: ‘yeah, I went, I always went to the
family therapies, and it was pretty shocking because they didn’t
really know what to do with me’ (Hutchison et al., 2022). This
data was classified as ‘burden’.

Category 4: There are positives that come with the negatives
Almost a quarter (22.73%) of included qualitative studies sug-
gested that siblings recognise there are positive aspects to having
a sibling with MI despite the difficulties. Some siblings reported
that their family grew closer. As one sibling recounted:

It has affected … [the family] but in a way, like, we’ve become a really,
really close family as well. Very close, so, at the same time, it’s a good
experience,
in getting us all close. (Sin, Moone, Harris, Scully, &
Wellman, 2012, pg. 56)

Others reported developing a stronger connection with their
sibling with MI or new ways of seeing life that prioritised balance,
happiness, compassion, meaning and/or gratitude. Primary data
in this category were mostly classified as ‘wellbeing’.

Discussion

This is the first study to systematically review quantitative and
qualitative literature on distress, burden, and wellbeing in siblings

of people with MI. We examined the extent of depressive symp-
toms, anxiety symptoms, burden, and wellbeing in siblings; as
well as individuals’ experience of having a sibling with MI.
Sixty-two studies involving 3744 participants from 24 countries
were reviewed.

Summary of main findings

in the minimal range of

Distress
The meta-analytic findings of this review suggest that siblings’
depressive symptoms fall in the mild range of the HAM-D and
their anxiety symptoms fall
the
HAM-A. Our qualitative analysis indicated that siblings may
experience particularly elevated distress during specific illness
stages. For example, siblings may experience heightened distress
during illness onset because of needing to reconsider how they
understand and relate to their sibling with MI. For siblings, this
process can involve considerable grief, loss, and confusion. Lack
of clarity about MI, which is likely to be more pronounced during
illness onset, emerged as another contributor to sibling distress in
our qualitative analysis. An important aspect of this lack of clarity
was siblings’ uncertainty about how much control individuals
have over their illness-related behaviours. This finding is consist-
ent with prior reviews linking attributions of control over illness-
related behaviours with greater expressed emotion (Barrowclough
& Hooley, 2003) and caregiver distress (Jansen, Gleeson, & Cotton,
2015) in family members of people with MI. Finally, our qualitative
findings suggest that individuals experience greater distress when
their sibling with MI is acutely unwell. This finding is consistent
with prior reviews associating illness severity with adverse psycho-
logical characteristics in family members of people with MI
(Fekadu et al., 2019; Steele, Maruyama, & Galynker, 2010).

Our moderator analyses shed further light on factors relating
to siblings’ experience of distress. Regardless of MI category, sib-
lings reported experiencing moderate depressive symptoms while
clinicians evaluate siblings as experiencing mild symptoms.
Discrepancies between self-reported and clinician-rated depres-
sive symptoms have been identified in prior literature and may
be the result of variations in instrument content and/or personal-
ity factors (Enns, Larsen, & Cox, 2000; Uher et al., 2012). Given
that siblings remain largely overlooked in research and clinical
settings, a further possible explanation for this difference is that
researchers and/or clinicians may underestimate the difficulties
experienced by siblings. Of note, regardless of instrument rater,
siblings of people with a schizophrenia spectrum disorder experi-
ence moderate depressive symptoms while siblings of people with
other types of MI experience minimal depressive symptoms.
There are many possible causes of this difference, e.g. siblings
of people with a schizophrenia spectrum disorder may experience
greater adversities relating to symptoms of psychosis, social exclu-
sion, and/or stigmatisation. However, there are no prior reviews
comparing sibling subgroups to shed further light on this differ-
ence. Our finding that male siblings experience greater depressive
symptoms, while potentially interesting due to its discrepancy
with previous reviews (Baronet, 1999; Fekadu et al., 2019;
Jayasinghe et al., 2022; Shivers & Textoris, 2021), should be inter-
preted with caution. Gender was no longer a significant covariate
after removal of two outlying studies, which both included sib-
lings of people with a schizophrenia spectrum disorder. Thus, it
is possible that our initial finding was driven by category of MI
rather than gender. Anxiety symptoms for siblings living in
Asia and Oceania fell in the mild range while siblings living in

6960

Anuradhi Jayasinghe et al.

Europe and the Americas experienced minimal anxiety symp-
toms. Importantly, this analysis included only 16 publications
and may, therefore, not be generalisable. If our findings were to
be replicated, one possible explanation for this difference is that
Asia and Oceania may include more collectivist cultures, which
tend to promote greater willingness in individuals to take up
informal caregiving duties (Zarzycki, Morrison, Bei, & Seddon,
2023). Cultural values influence the extent and nature of the
stigmatisation of mental illness (Abdullah & Brown, 2011). Such
differences might contribute to the difference seen between
regions; however, the specific role of culture in individuals’ experi-
ence of mental illness stigma is likely to be nuanced and requires
further clarification (Abdullah & Brown, 2011). Finally, our
moderator analyses indicate that siblings’ anxiety symptoms
decrease with their age. This stands in contrast with the findings
of our prior review, which suggests sibling age is unrelated to the
severity of their anxiety symptoms (Jayasinghe et al., 2022).
One possibility for this inconsistency is that siblings’ anxiety is
moderated by factors that we were unable to assess such as cat-
egory of MI, stage of illness, illness severity, level of parental
involvement, time spent with a sibling with an MI, and/or extent
of caregiving.

Burden
Our meta-analytic findings across burden outcomes, i.e. overall
burden, negative aspects of burden, objective, and subjective bur-
den, were similar in that each outcome approached the mid-point
of the spectrum. Siblings’ experience of positive aspects of burden
fell at the middle of the spectrum. In concord with these results, a
major finding of the qualitative synthesis is that siblings experi-
ence a considerable weight of responsibility. Qualitative findings
revealed several factors that may contribute to siblings’ burden:
for example, the need to compensate for a sibling’s MI; uncer-
tainty about whether one’s actions have and/or will contribute
to a sibling’s illness; or the undertaking of adult roles in attempt-
ing to help one’s family. Siblings who struggle with challenges in
their home life – particularly constrained communication – also
experience elevated burden.

Wellbeing
In our meta-analytic findings, sibling’s positive affect appeared to
be higher than their negative affect and their eudemonic wellbeing
approached the higher end of the spectrum. Qualitative findings
suggest that siblings’ sense of wellbeing is closely related to the
nature of their caregiving role. Siblings who internalise the belief
that their needs are less important than others may experience
reduced wellbeing. However, when siblings acknowledge their
personal gains and balance caring for themselves and others,
their caregiving role can be a meaningful and enriching part of
their life.

Completeness and generalisability of evidence

We identified several important factors limiting the meaningful
development of this field of research. First, the reviewed studies
examined various quantitative constructs relating to burden,
thereby precluding an overall synthesis of findings on burden.
Second, there are currently no quantitative instruments designed
to capture the unique experience of siblings. As such, the available
data does not capture important aspects such as burden resulting
from a need to compensate for the impacts of a sibling’s MI.
Third, many qualitative studies reported on broad-ranging (sub)

that captured numerous

themes
interrelated concepts. For
example, one theme titled ‘continuum of illness impacts’ com-
prised severe alcoholism in parents, the need to mediate between
one’s family and health care services, social isolation, as well as
increased tolerance for peoples’ differences (Gerace, Camilleri,
& Ayres, 1993). This hinders meaningful meta-synthesis of find-
ings as important aspects of siblings’ experiences are necessarily
lost in the distillation of such data. Fourth, some studies relied
on sibling attestation (10.94%) to verify the presence of a MI
while others did not
report how diagnosis was confirmed
(43.75%) thereby impeding an assessment of the reliability and gen-
eralisability of findings. Finally, there are no validated cut-off scores
for the measures of burden and wellbeing. So, we are currently
unable to consider subgroups of siblings who experience notably
elevated burden and/or reduced wellbeing. This represents a sub-
stantial limitation to the effective development and use of mental
health resources.

As a result of our review, several gaps in the current literature
emerged as important areas for future research. First, there is lim-
ited quantitative data on siblings’ wellbeing. This is problematic as
strong evidence suggests mental illness and wellbeing are related
but distinct continuums, such that the absence of mental illness
does not indicate greater wellbeing (Westerhof & Keyes, 2010).
An understanding of wellbeing is crucial in providing support
to siblings of people with MI: a cohort who, although they may
not be psychiatrically unwell, are vulnerable to reduced wellbeing.
Second, data predominantly related to siblings of people with a
schizophrenia spectrum, eating, or affective disorder. So, there is
a lack of information about siblings of people with other types
of MIs such as personality or trauma-related disorders. Third,
only two qualitative studies reported a (sub)theme relating to sib-
lings’ interactions with mental health services. This may be due to
inadequate enquiry because of researchers underestimating the
importance of such interactions in the lives of siblings. Fourth,
there is currently no available data on distress, burden, or well-
being in individuals who have a deceased sibling who experienced
MI. This is concerning given that people with MI have consider-
ably reduced life expectancy largely due to increased rates of phys-
ical illness and suicide (Walker, McGee, & Druss, 2015). Fifth, few
studies reported on illness characteristics (such as stage or severity
of illness) precluding their inclusion in our moderator analyses.
This is surprising given that illness-related variables have been
consistently linked with psychological difficulties in family mem-
bers of people with MI (Baronet, 1999; Saunders, 2003; Steele
et al., 2010). Sixth, no studies provided data beyond binary gender
constructs precluding any analysis of the experience of those who
do not
identify with these classifications. Seventh, only one
included study was conducted in a low-income status country.
This is notable as family members, including siblings, in develop-
ing nations are likely to have higher caregiving responsibilities and
less access to professional support due to under-resourced mental
health sectors (Jacob et al., 2007). Finally, it was beyond the scope
of this study to examine differences in siblings’ experiences based
on the category of mental
illness in the qualitative analysis.
Investigation of such nuances is an important direction for future
research given that qualitative findings have linked specific illness
features with impacts on siblings. For example, siblings of people
with an eating disorder have highlighted declines in family
dynamics at mealtimes (Fjermestad et al., 2020), while siblings
of people with schizophrenia have reported increased distress in
relation to positive symptoms in their family member (Sin
et al., 2012).

Strengths and limitations of the review

The novel sequential explanatory design employed in the current
review represents a major strength. Quantitative data on distress,
burden, and wellbeing were identified according to well-recognised
operationalisations and synthesised using meta-analytic techniques.
Qualitative data were synthesised using a content meta-analytic
approach and findings were subsequently used to contextualise
and enhance our understanding of quantitative results. In so
doing, we have provided a comprehensive analysis of well-
recognised psychological characteristics in siblings.

This review has four main limitations. First, there was insufficient
data to investigate sources of heterogeneity in our outcomes of anx-
iety symptoms, burden, and wellbeing. In our analysis of anxiety
symptoms, there was evidence of small study bias that could not
be assessed further. Additionally, our meta-analyses relating to bur-
den and wellbeing comprised relatively small samples and the gen-
eralisability of these findings remains unclear. Second, reviewed
studies included only cross-sectional data. As a result, each quanti-
tative outcome of interest received a ‘very low’ certainty of evidence
rating according to the GRADE assessment framework, and no con-
clusions can be drawn about changes across developmental phases
or stages of illness. Third, this review did not include studies pub-
lished in other languages. We might, therefore, have introduced a
bias toward data available to English-speaking authors. Fourth,
only studies with ⩾10 siblings were eligible for inclusion, which
resulted in the exclusion of nine potentially eligible reports that pre-
dominantly provided qualitative literature (online Supplementary
Table S5). This too might have introduced bias into the findings.

Clinical implications

The findings of this review underscore the need to consider sib-
lings in interventions that seek to support caregivers and/or fam-
ilies of people with MI. Our qualitative findings revealed several
important areas for intervention. For instance, siblings may bene-
fit from support in the development of a new understanding of
their sibling as an individual with MI. Siblings may also benefit
from assistance in identifying ways to help their family without
compromising their own wellbeing, and to recognise personal
gains
that may have emerged from their caregiving role.
Increasing open communication within families emerged as a fur-
ther area of importance for siblings. Information about MI is
likely to benefit siblings. Crucially, information about the cause
(s), symptoms, and prognosis of their sibling’s MI, as well as
information about the level of control
individuals have over
illness-related behaviours is recommended.

Our qualitative findings suggest that some parents, particularly
those with strained resources, underestimate difficulties faced by
siblings and that some siblings may themselves minimise the extent
of their difficulties to prevent further burden on their family. In
such instances, it is critical for clinicians to acknowledge the poten-
tial struggles of siblings to avoid further reinforcing the notion that
the needs of siblings are secondary to the needs of a child with MI.
This point warrants further emphasis given that our moderator ana-
lyses indicate siblings’ self-reported psychological challenges are
greater than those reflected in clinician-rated instruments.

Conclusion

The findings of this systematic review and meta-analysis under-
score the psychological vulnerability of siblings of people with

MI to distress and burden, as well as reduced wellbeing. Several
areas were identified as potential intervention targets including
communication within families, siblings’ knowledge of MI, recog-
nition of personal gains resulting from having a sibling with MI,
and balancing siblings’ needs with those of other family members.
To support the development of meaningful, evidence-based inter-
ventions for this important cohort, further research is required to
clarify the mechanisms underlying siblings’ experience of distress,
burden, and wellbeing.
