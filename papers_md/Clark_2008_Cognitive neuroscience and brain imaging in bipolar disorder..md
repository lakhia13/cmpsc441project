he bipolar states of mania and depression have
a clear impact on cognitive function. The clinical crite-
ria for mania include distractibility, inappropriate speech
and behavior, increased goal-directed behavior, and a
tendency to make decisions associated with potential
painful consequences.1 The depressive state is also char-
acterized by cognitive changes, including a lack of con-
centration, difficulty making decisions, motor slowing,
and  changes  in  memory. Understanding  the  brain
changes that accompany these illness states is an impor-
tant target for psychiatric neuroscience, for a number of
reasons. The identification of illness markers for bipolar
disorder  will  facilitate  the  early  detection  of  bipolar
episodes, which may spare patients and their families
considerable distress. Earlier detection of the illness itself
is also of significant benefit: bipolar disorder continues
to  be  frequently  misdiagnosed  as  Major  Depressive
Disorder in individuals without a clear history of manic
episodes,2,3 with the consequence that patients may be
maintained  on  a  suboptimal  medication  regime  until
their bipolar diathesis is noticed. Second, characterizing
the profile of brain dysfunction in bipolar disorder will
also help identify novel targets for pharmacological treat-
ment, and may eventually allow identification of individ-
uals at high risk for developing bipolar disorder. Third,

Bipolar disorder is characterized by a combination of
state-related changes in psychological function that are
restricted to illness episodes, coupled with trait-related
changes that persist through periods of remission, irre-
spective of symptom status. This article reviews studies
that  have  investigated  the  brain  systems  involved  in
these state- and trait-related changes, using two tech-
niques: (i) indirect measures of neurocognitive function,
and (ii) direct neuroimaging measures of brain function
during performance of a cognitive task. Studies of neu-
rocognitive function in bipolar disorder indicate deficits
in three core domains: attention, executive function, and
emotional processing. Functional imaging studies impli-
cate pathophysiology in distributed neural circuitry that
includes the prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortices,
as  well  as  subcortical  limbic  structures  including  the
amygdala and the ventral striatum. Whilst there have
been  clear  advances  in  our  understanding  of  brain
changes in bipolar disorder, there are limited data in
bipolar depression, and there is limited understanding
of the influence of clinical variables including medica-
tion status, illness severity, and specific symptom dimen-
sions.

bipolar disorder can also be useful in the management of
individual patients, in order to assess functional capacity
(eg, ability to concentrate or problem-solve), and to chart
progressive changes occurring with advancing chronicity,
acute treatment, or prophylactic medication.
The purpose of the present article is to summarize psy-
chological and neurobiological studies that have sought
to characterize the profile of brain dysfunction in bipo-
lar disorder. In the first part of the review, we will exam-
ine the evidence from studies of neurocognition in bipo-
lar  disorder. Neuropsychological 
testing  with
standardized assessment procedures can provide indirect
measures of activity in brain systems, based on validatory
research from neuroimaging, studies of human lesion
patients, and translational data from nonhuman species.4
Although the index of underlying brain function is indi-
rect, the advantage of this approach is that neuropsy-
chological testing is relatively inexpensive, and can be
readily administered in a clinical or hospital setting. In
the second part of the review, we will examine studies
that have used brain imaging techniques, chiefly func-
tional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), to directly
quantify the neural abnormalities associated with bipo-
lar disorder.
Investigation of the profile of brain changes in bipolar
disorder  has  been  hampered  by  a  number  of  factors.
First, it has become apparent that in bipolar disorder,
there is a combination of both state-related changes dur-
ing  illness  episodes, and  more  enduring  trait-related
changes which persist through periods of symptom remis-
sion.5 This  accumulating  evidence  for  trait  deficits  in
bipolar disorder contrasts with the original Kraepelinian
concept of bipolar disorder, which highlighted the appar-
ent recovery of function between episodes (in contrast to
the  chronic  deteriorating  course  of  schizophrenia  –
dementia praecox). Of course, the identification of trait
markers for bipolar disorder raises the possibility that
neurocognitive variables may represent illness endophe-
notypes, related to underlying genetic liability.6 A second
complication pertains to the state-related changes: whilst
the manic and depressive states of bipolar disorder have
some  neuropsychological  similarities, they  also  have
some important differences. For example, the florid dis-
inhibition and risk-taking during mania are highly rem-
iniscent of the effects of brain lesions to the orbitofrontal
cortex, as we will discuss further below. A related third
point is that multiple domains of cognitive function are
clearly disrupted in bipolar disorder, including attention,

executive function, emotional processing, and memory,7,8
and  these  cognitive  domains  may  be  differentially
affected by state and trait variables. Finally, the current
literature on bipolar disorder has failed to consistently
control for a range of clinical factors that may putatively
impact on neurocognition, including medication status,9
comorbidities including substance use disorders,10 and
specific  symptom  dimensions  such  as  suicidality11 or
insomnia.12

Cognition in bipolar disorder

The  current  article  will  focus  on  three  areas  of  neu-
ropsychological function that have been studied in detail
in  bipolar  disorder: attention, executive  function  and
emotional processing. For in-depth reviews, the reader is
referred to refs 7, 8, and 13.

Attention

Attention refers to our ability to selectively and flexibly
process some of the information in the environment at
the expense of other information. The attentional system
of the human brain can be decomposed into several dis-
tinct mechanisms, including those responsible for selec-
tive attention, attentional shifting, and sustained atten-
tion.14 The  former  two  processes  have  considerable
overlap with executive function, and will be considered
in the following section. Sustained attention has been
widely  studied  in  bipolar  disorder, and  relates  to  the
capacity to maintain selective processing over prolonged
periods of time (“vigilance”). Sustained attention can be
measured  with  continuous  performance  tests  (CPTs)
including the Rapid Visual Information Processing task
in  the  Cambridge  Neuropsychological  Automated
Testing Battery (CANTAB) assessment.15 In these tasks,
the subject must monitor a stream of stimuli (eg, digits)
for target stimuli that are specified by the experimenter.
The target stimuli occur infrequently and unpredictably,
and healthy subjects typically show a deterioration in tar-
get detection as the task progresses.
CPT target detection is reliably impaired during the manic
state,16,17 and was one of the strongest predictors of the
manic  state  across  a  wide-ranging  neuropsychological
assessment.16 As well as deficits in target detection, manic
patients also committed more false alarms—responses to
nontarget stimuli.16,18 This is likely to reflect clinical symp-
toms of impulsivity and disinhibition in the manic state.

The deficit in target detection (but not impulsive errors)
was shown to persist in remitted patients with bipolar dis-
order, albeit at a somewhat less severe level compared
with mania.5,19-21 The deficit in euthymic patients was unre-
lated to subclinical symptoms,19,22 which are common in
remitted patients and may impact upon functional capac-
ity and cognitive performance. In fact, after controlling
for subclinical symptoms, target detection was the only
variable to remain significantly impaired in euthymic
cases across a wide-ranging neuropsychological assess-
ment. Target detection impairment was present in a sub-
set of patients who were early in the illness course, but
also  correlated  with  disease  duration  and  number  of
episodes.19 The sustained attention deficit in euthymic
cases was also present regardless of the working memory
load of the CPT.23 It is likely that the deficit is also exac-
erbated during depressed states,24 although, as discussed
below, there are currently limited data in bipolar depres-
sion.

Executive function

Executive function refers to a collection of higher-level
psychological processes that enable the flexible organi-
zation of behavior, including planning, working memory,
inhibitory control, strategy development, and attentional
shifting.25 These processes are intimately associated with
the integrity of the prefrontal cortex. Specifically, execu-
tive control has been mapped to a lateral prefrontal sys-
tem comprising the dorsolateral and ventrolateral pre-
frontal cortices.26 Executive dysfunction may impact upon
functional capacity, that is, patients’ ability to complete
everyday tasks and work-related activities, and it also
impacts more broadly upon quality of life.
Patients during a manic episode show significant impair-
ments in a variety of classic measures of executive func-
tion, like the Wisconsin Card Sort Test, the Stroop test,
and the Tower of London27-29 (although notably, the effect
size for the deficits was less than for sustained attention
and verbal memory in the study by Clark et al).16 A num-
ber of studies have also reported executive impairments
in bipolar depression; for example, on the ID-ED task of
attentional shifting, which aims to dissect some compo-
nent processes of the Wisconsin Card Sort Test.30 Basso
et al31 reported significant deficits on Verbal Fluency and
the Trail Making Test (part B) in bipolar groups tested in
either depressed, manic, or mixed episodes, with no sig-
nificant differences between groups. A study in unmed-

icated patients reported significantly worse performance
on the Wisconsin Card Sort Test, the Trail Making Test,
and the Stroop test in bipolar depressed patients com-
pared with a group of unipolar depressed cases who were
matched for duration and severity of illness.32
These deficits in bipolar depression appear highly sen-
sitive to symptom severity: an earlier study by Sweeney
et al33 compared depressed bipolar, depressed unipolar,
and manic bipolar patients on a number of tasks from the
CANTAB  assessment. Whilst  executive  deficits  were
pronounced in the manic patients, the two depressed
groups were not significantly impaired on the Tower of
London  planning  and  the  ID-ED  attentional  shifting
task. The depressed groups in that study showed only
moderate symptom scores on the HDRS. A recent study
in a group of unmedicated depressed patients with bipo-
lar  II  diagnoses  also  detected  reasonably  intact  neu-
rocognitive function across measures of executive con-
trol, memory, decision-making and impulsivity,34 see also
ref 35).
Thus, impaired executive function is consistently reported
in the manic and depressed states of bipolar disorder, but
appears to be highly sensitive to mood state and symp-
tom/illness severity. From these observations, we might
not anticipate executive deficits to persist in euthymia,
and  indeed, a  number  of  studies  have  suggested  that
executive deficits are not an invariable feature of the
recovered state.10,19,36 However, a number of studies have
detected executive deficits in remitted patients, after con-
trolling carefully for residual mood symptoms that are
common in bipolar outpatient populations.9,37-40 The pres-
ence or absence of executive deficits in remitted cohorts
may depend upon a variety of clinical factors including
illness severity, illness duration, and medication effects.
In addition, it is possible that the size of the battery may
affect performance—results in very long test assessments
could be attributable to an overriding deficit in sustained
attention rather than executive control.

Emotional processing

Whilst the dorsal and lateral aspects of the prefrontal
cortex are typically associated with relatively “cold” exec-
utive processing, the orbital sector of the prefrontal cor-
tex is linked to a distinct set of emotional “hot” processes
including reward evaluation, risky decision-making, and
impulse  control.4,41 Following  damage  to  this  region,
lesion  patients  typically  show  changes  in  emotional

1 5 5

T r a n s l a t i o n a l   r e s e a r c h

behavior, as well as reward-driven and impulsive judg-
ment.42,43 These changes are highly reminiscent of some
of the behaviors seen during manic episodes, leading to
the hypothesis that mania may be selectively associated
with a disruption of orbitofrontal function.16,29,44 In addi-
tion, researchers have recently begun to use broader tests
of emotion processing in bipolar groups, for example,
tasks assessing the recognition of emotional facial expres-
sions.45-47 In  the  healthy  brain, these  emotional  tasks
recruit a limbic neural system that comprises the orbital
and medial parts of the prefrontal cortex (including the
subgenual cingulate cortex) as well as subcortical struc-
tures including the amygdala and ventral striatum.48,49
There is accumulating evidence that patients with bipo-
lar disorder tested in manic states show impaired per-
formance on measures of risk-taking and emotional deci-
sion-making. These  tasks  are  based  upon  gambling
scenarios, and  have  been  validated  as  measures  of
orbitofrontal cortex integrity through studies in human
lesion patients.50 Clark et al16 reported a moderate deficit
in mania on the Iowa Gambling Task, although a recent
follow-up  study  in  a  larger  group  of  manic  patients
(n=45) found a more substantial decision-making impair-
ment  that  was  correlated  with  ratings  of  (lack  of)
insight.51 On the Cambridge Gamble Task, manic patients
were found to display poor probabilistic judgment and
increased deliberation times compared with healthy con-
trols.36 The former deficit was correlated with symptom
ratings on the Young Mania Scale, consistent with a state-
sensitive marker.
During  manic  episodes, bipolar  patients  also  showed
deficits in impulse control on Go-No Go tasks and CPTs,
as  discussed  above. Murphy  et  al29 examined  perfor-
mance on an affective variant of the Go-No Go proce-
dure that used positive and negative-valenced words. As
well as making more commission errors to No Go stim-
uli, the  manic  group  also  showed  a  mood-congruent
attentional bias, responding faster to the positive words
(eg, SUCCESS) than the negative words (eg, GUILT).
An affective bias in the opposite direction (ie, preferen-
tial processing of negative information) has been demon-
strated in major depressive disorder,52,53 a finding that has
also been reported in bipolar depression.54
Patients with bipolar depression did not show the ten-
dency of manic patients to make more Go-No Go com-
mission errors.30 In terms of decision-making, our study
in bipolar II depression (with a mean Montgomery-
Asberg Depression Rating Scale [MADRS] score of

24, in the moderately depressed range) found no effects
on the Cambridge Gamble Task.34 However, a recent
study  in  more  severely  depressed  bipolar  I  patients
(mean Hamilton score of 25) did indicate deficits on
this  test  in  probabilistic  judgment  and  deliberation
times,30 similar  to  those  reported  in  mania.44 In
euthymic  cases, two  studies  reported  intact  perfor-
mance on the Iowa Gambling Task and the Cambridge
Gamble Task,19,36 and similarly, recognition of emotional
facial expressions appears fairly intact during testing in
remission.46,47 Thus, during remission, emotional pro-
cessing and decision-making functions seem to recover
substantially, indicating that these may be predomi-
nantly state-related changes. Whether these changes
are restricted to the manic state (perhaps indicative of
an orbitofrontal “lesion” syndrome), or occur in both
mania and bipolar depression, is difficult to ascertain
at the current time given the small number of studies
examining these processes in bipolar depression.

Brain imaging in bipolar disorder

Structural and functional brain imaging studies in bipo-
lar disorder lend direct support to the indications of pre-
frontal cortical pathophysiology from studies of neu-
rocognition. Classic studies of patients with secondary
mood disturbance as a consequence of organic pathology
like stroke or tumor reported increased prevalence of
depressed mood following damage to the left frontal cor-
tex  and  the  left  basal  ganglia.55,56 Cases  of  secondary
mania are unsurprisingly less common than poststroke
depression, but are reported to show the reverse pattern
of laterality, associated with right-lateralized damage to
the frontal cortex and basal ganglia.57 These data high-
light the connectivity between the frontal cortex and
basal ganglia, and this frontostriatal circuitry is thought
to support many aspects of attentional, executive and
emotional function.58 Neurological patients with basal
ganglia  pathology  (eg, Parkinson’s  disease  and
Huntington’s  disease)  also  show  elevated  levels  of
depression, compared with other patient groups with dis-
orders matched for level of disability.59
In bipolar disorder, structural brain abnormalities in the
prefrontal cortex have been confirmed in postmortem
studies60,61 and with structural MRI. For example, the sub-
genual  portion  of  the  anterior  cingulate  cortex  was
reduced in volume in patients with bipolar disorder with
a family history of affective disorder.62 Recent studies

1 5 6

using  voxel-based  morphometry  (VBM)  have  also
reported gray-matter reductions in the prefrontal cortex
in patients with bipolar disorder.63-65 In light of the evi-
dence for structural brain changes in prefrontal cortex,
the  following  sections  will  consider  the  evidence  for
changes in functional brain activity in bipolar disorder.

Imaging studies of mania

Data from neurocognitive studies indicate widespread
impairments  in  executive, attentional, and  emotional
function  during  the  manic  phase  of  bipolar  disorder.
Functional imaging studies that scanned manic patients
at rest have indicated changes in blood flow and metab-
olism, particularly in the orbitofrontal cortex.62,66,67 The
disadvantage of these resting state studies is that it is not
possible to control for thought content during scanning,
and increased activity may relate to aspects of the manic
state like flights of ideas. Consequently, recent work has
scanned patients while they perform a neuropsychologi-
cal task, in order to investigate task-related neural activ-
ity. For example, Rubinsztein et al68 scanned a small num-
ber of manic patients with positron emission tomography
while  they  performed  a  variant  of  the  Cambridge
Gamble Task in the scanner (Figure 1). Blocks of a deci-
sion-making task were contrasted against blocks of a con-
trol task that was matched for visual and motor demands,
but  without  the  requirement  for  risk  assessment  and
decision-making. Compared  with  demographically-
matched healthy controls, the manic cases showed a dys-
regulation of medial and ventral prefrontal circuitry dur-
ing risky decision-making.
Using fMRI, Altshuler et al, scanned manic patients dur-
ing performance of a Go-No Go task that required the
suppression  of  impulsive  responses. Compared  with
matched healthy controls, the manic patients showed
blunted activation of the right lateral orbitofrontal cor-
tex,69 a region that is thought to be critical for inhibitory
control. The affective variant of the Go-No Go task used
by Murphy et al29 has also been adapted for fMRI by
Elliott  et  al.70 In  a  comparison  of  manic  patients  and
healthy controls, the manic group showed reduced activ-
ity in ventrolateral prefrontal cortex during blocks of
affective Go-No Go against a nonemotional control con-
dition. Manic patients also showed evidence of increased
activity in the medial orbitofrontal cortex during blocks
when positive stimuli were distractors (ie, to be ignored,
Figure 2). Thus, the available evidence clearly indicates

pathophysiology in the ventral, orbital sectors of the pre-
frontal cortex. This pathophysiology is perhaps better
described as a dysregulation, rather than a more simplis-
tic “lesion” account, underlying the changes in emotional
processing in the manic state.

Imaging studies of euthymia/remission

A number of studies have examined remitted patients
with bipolar disorder in similar imaging protocols to those
employed in mania. The Stroop test, where color words
(eg, RED) are presented in congruent or incongruent inks,

with mania and healthy controls. This section shows areas of
increased activity in patients relative to controls, in blocks when
positive (happy) words were distracters compared with blocks
where neutral valenced words were distracters, consistent with
increased brain activity to mood-congruent, task-irrelevant infor-
mation.

has been widely validated for use in neuroimaging. This
paradigm yields a robust signal in the anterior cingulate
cortex during presentation of incongruent stimuli, where
the natural tendency to read the color word must be over-
riden. Gruber et al71 reported reduced anterior cingulate
activity in remitted bipolar patients compared with con-
trols, which may indicate a failure to recruit prefrontal cor-
tex during effortful executive control.72-74 Remitted bipo-
lar patients have also been reported to show deactivation
in orbital and medial prefrontal cortex during the incon-
gruent Stroop blocks,72,75 an effect that was also seen in
manic and depressed bipolar groups, suggesting a trait
marker of pathophysiology in the orbitofrontal cortex.
Other studies using emotional tasks such as recognition of
emotional facial expressions have reported abnormally
increased subcortical limbic activity in remitted patients
with bipolar disorder.76,77 Limbic hyperactivity has also
been reported during nonemotional tasks, for example,
during performance of a sustained attention task,78 and a
serial reaction time task with implicit sequences.79 These
findings suggest that patients with bipolar disorder may
recruit emotional (“hot”) neural systems in the processing
of emotionally neutral “cold” material.These findings are
consistent with studies showing high trait emotionality in
bipolar  patients  using  psychological  mood  manipula-
tions.80,81

Imaging studies of bipolar depression

The limited number of imaging studies in bipolar depres-
sion have also highlighted changes in prefrontal and sub-
cortical activity. A resting state positron-emission tomog-
raphy (PET) study in a notably large group (n=43) of
patients with bipolar depression reported decreases in pre-
frontal cortical metabolism, and increases in subcortical
metabolism, compared with healthy controls.82 Both of
these effects were correlated with depressive severity on
the Hamilton scale. Using cognitive activation designs,
decreased activation (or reduced deactivation) in the pre-
frontal cortex has also been reported, where attentional or
executive tasks have been employed.77 In addition, resting
state activation in the subgenual cingulate region was pos-
itively correlated with target detection performance on a
CPT performed outside the scanner.83 Decreased blood
flow in medial prefrontal cortex was also reported during
a sad mood induction in remitted and depressed patients
with type 1 bipolar disorder,84 although this study did not
include a healthy comparison group.

Malhi et al85 scanned patients with bipolar depression on
an affect generation task where they viewed captioned
emotional pictures. In comparison with healthy controls,
the bipolar depressed group showed enhanced subcortical
activation in the amygdala, thalamus, and basal ganglia.A
comparable finding was reported by Chen et al,86 who used
a facial expression task in two groups of bipolar patients
with depression and mania. The bipolar depressed group
displayed relative increases in subcortical limbic activity
in response to happy faces.
These findings of subcortical/limbic hyperreactivity are
consistent with the findings discussed above in the remit-
ted phase. Notably, this pattern of neural response may
also be capable of distinguishing bipolar disorder from
major depressive disorder. Lawrence et al87 directly com-
pared neural activity to emotional facial expressions in
bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder.The bipo-
lar  group  were  stable  outpatients  who  had  subclinical
depressive symptoms.This study found increases in amyg-
dala and subcortical limbic activity predominantly to mild
happy, but  also  to  fearful, facial  expressions. Thus, the
imaging studies in bipolar depression to date indicate a
pattern of decreased prefrontal activity during cognitive
challenge paradigms, coupled with a relative hyperactivity
of subcortical limbic structures.There is clearly a need for
further studies comparing neural activity across illness
states in bipolar disorder, and contrasting these effects
against major depressive disorder. In addition, there are
few neuroimaging studies in unmedicated patients, and
studies may benefit from using longitudinal designs in
addition to the more standard parallel-groups designs.

Relevance for treatment

Cognitive effects of bipolar medications

Studies examining cognitive function and neural systems
in bipolar disorder are typically confounded by medica-
tion status. It is common for patients in research studies
to be maintained on mood-stabilizing medications, and
many studies also include subgroups of patients receiv-
ing neuroleptics, antidepressants and sedatives. These
medications may act directly to influence cognitive func-
tion in either a beneficial or detrimental manner. A num-
ber of studies have investigated the effects of lithium
medication on cognition, (reviewed in refs 88, 89). These
studies have employed a variety of designs, either com-
paring bipolar patients on and off lithium medication,90

comparing lithium-treated euthymic patients against con-
trols,91 or studying the effects of lithium versus placebo in
healthy volunteers.92-94 These studies have shown reliable
effects on psychomotor speed, consistent with frequent
complaints of mental slowing from patients. There is also
some evidence for impaired learning and memory func-
tion, but higher-level executive function and attention
appear to be spared, and there is no evidence for cumu-
lative effects of long-term treatment.88 A number of the
neuropsychological studies in euthymic bipolar patients
have also performed post-hoc analyses to examine poten-
tial confounding effects of lithium treatment19,95 and have
generally found patients receiving lithium to perform
similarly to those not receiving lithium.
There is less evidence for cognition-enhancing or -impair-
ing effects of other mood stabilizers. Two studies have
reported that the use of antipsychotic medications was
associated with deficits in executive function9,95; an effect
that remained present after controlling for levels of psy-
chosis, and applied equally to atypical and conventional
antipsychotics.9 It is generally thought that selective sero-
tonin  reuptake  inhibitor  (SSRI)  medication  does  not
induce significant cognitive impairment,96 but benzodi-
azepines and anticholinergic drugs may have some detri-
mental effects, mainly on psychomotor speed and memory
rather than higher-level executive function.97,98 It is also dif-
ficult to assess the cumulative impact of polypharmacy on
cognitive function.

Predictors of treatment response

Recent research has begun to use neurocognitive testing
and functional imaging to investigate markers associated
with treatment response. In major depressive disorder,
metabolism in the medial prefrontal cortex prior to ini-
tiating  treatment  has  been  reported  to  predict  the
response  to  antidepressant  medication, although  the
direction of effect has been somewhat inconsistent: sev-
eral  studies  have  associated  a  positive  response  with
increased metabolism,99,100 whereas a further study asso-
ciated a positive response with decreased metabolism in
the same region.101 Recent research has begun to exam-
ine effects associated with treatment response in bipolar
disorder. One study reported decreases in subcortical
limbic activity (ventral striatum and amygdala) whilst at
rest, following a positive response to levothyroxine in
bipolar  depression.102 A  recent  study  also  indicated  a
reduction in dorsolateral prefrontal activity during pro-

1 5 9

T r a n s l a t i o n a l   r e s e a r c h

cessing of emotional stimuli, in bipolar depressed patients
who responded to sleep deprivation and light therapy.103
Future  work  may  also  fruitfully  examine  treatment
response in relation to neurocognitive variables, as these
are considerably more amenable for use in clinical settings
compared with fMRI. In bipolar disorder, there is clear
evidence  that  neurocognitive  abnormalities  adversely
affect functional outcomes.104,105 A recent study reported
that  two  neurocognitive  indices  of  executive  control
(Stroop score and verbal fluency) predicted the time to
remission in first episode bipolar disorder,106 although this
group  included  a  mixture  of  patients  in  manic  and
depressed states. Further research is clearly required to
examine neurocognitive and neuroimaging predictors of
response to pharmacotherapy, and also to psychological
treatments in bipolar disorder.

Conclusions

Evidence from neurocognitive testing indicates a complex
array of neuropsychological impairments in patients with
bipolar disorder. A surge of complimentary studies using
functional brain imaging indicate that these deficits may
be associated with pathophysiology in a neural system
comprising the prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortex, as
well as subcortical limbic regions including the amygdala
and ventral striatum. A detailed description of this cogni-
tive and neurobiological profile has been elusive, due to a
combination of both state- and trait-related changes in
bipolar disorder.
In principle, three distinct profiles may exist. An abnor-
mality may be a state-related deficit that recovers fully dur-
ing periods of remission, but is similarly affected by both
manic and depressive episodes. We have presented evi-
dence that executive dysfunction may adhere to this pro-
file, associated with reduced neural activation in the dor-
sal and lateral aspects of the prefrontal cortex. However,
it should be noted that executive dysfunction in bipolar dis-
order is heterogeneous, and this deficit can persist in some
patients, probably as a function of clinical features such as
illness severity and possibly medication status.
The second profile of deficit is the trait marker: an impair-
ment that is present during acute episodes but which also
persists during periods of remission. There is reasonable
evidence that deficits in target detection on sustained atten-
tion (CPT) tasks adhere to a trait profile.Trait deficits may
occur as a consequence of repeated illness episodes (as may
be the case for executive dysfunction), or may predate the

onset of the illness and be associated with genetic liability
to bipolar disorder. Ongoing research in high-risk popu-
lations, such as the unaffected first-degree relatives of bipo-
lar probands, may identify neurocognitive markers asso-
ciated with bipolar vulnerability, but studies so far have
been inconclusive and limited by small sample sizes.107-109
The  third  profile  is  of  a  state-related  marker  that  is
restricted to either the manic or the depressive episodes.
We have presented some evidence that deficits in risk
assessment, emotional decision-making, and impulsive
responding are pronounced during the manic episodes,
and these may represent objective, quantifiable indicators
of the classic manic symptoms of disinhibition and behav-
ior with harmful consequences (eg, spending sprees and
sexual indiscretions). It is likely that these deficits are
linked to dysregulation of the orbitofrontal cortex. The
degree to which these changes are restricted to mania is
equivocal  currently, given  the  lack  of  data  in  bipolar
depression. Functional imaging studies in bipolar depres-
sion have indicated a hyperreactivity of subcortical limbic
systems, such that emotionally neutral material may be
processed in an emotional manner. Whilst it is promising
that this phenomenon may show specificity to bipolar dis-
order compared with major depressive disorder,87 it is not
yet fully clear whether this effect is restricted to bipolar
depression or could represent a trait marker.
The clinical implications of this program of research are
substantial. By identifying illness markers that are selec-
tively associated with bipolar disorder, we may be able to
diagnose patients earlier in the course of the illness, and at
an earlier stage during illness episodes, with considerable
benefits to long-term functional outcome and quality of
life. Cognitive and imaging variables have the potential to
predict treatment response in symptomatic patients, and
possibly to predict which course of treatment (eg, phar-
macotherapy versus psychotherapy) may be best suited to
individual patients. This raises the possibility that these
instruments should be incorporated into routine clinical
management. The findings discussed in this review illus-
trate one of the current aims for the development of the
DSM-V (to be released in 2011), which is the need to
translate research findings from basic and clinical neuro-
science into a system of psychiatric classification based on
pathophysiological and etiological processes.110,111 ❏

Neurociencias cognitivas e imágenes 
cerebrales en el trastorno bipolar

Neuroscience cognitive et imagerie cérébrale
dans les troubles bipolaires

El trastorno bipolar se caracteriza por la combinación
de cambios en la función psicológica estado-depen-
diente, la que está restringida a los episodios de la
enfermedad, y cambios rasgo-dependientes que per-
sisten a través de los períodos de remisión indepen-
diente de la sintomatología. En este artículo se revi-
san  estudios  que  han  investigado  los  sistemas
cerebrales involucrados en estos cambios estado y
rasgo-dependientes utilizando dos técnicas: 1) medi-
ciones indirectas de la función neurocognitiva y 2)
mediciones directas con neuroimágenes de la fun-
ción cerebral durante el rendimiento frente a una
prueba cognitiva. Los estudios de la función neuro-
cognitiva en el trastorno bipolar revelan déficit en
tres áreas principales: atención, función ejecutiva y
procesamiento emocional. Los estudios de imágenes
funcionales incorporan la fisiopatología de circuitos
neurales distribuidos en las cortezas prefrontal y del
cíngulo anterior, como también de estructuras lím-
bicas  subcorticales  que  incluyen  la  amígdala  y  el
estriado ventral. Aunque han existido claras eviden-
cias acerca de nuestra comprensión de los cambios
cerebrales en el trastorno bipolar, hay datos limita-
dos para la depresión bipolar, y hay una comprensión
reducida de la influencia de variables clínicas como
la medicación, la gravedad de la enfermedad y las
dimensiones de síntomas específicos.

Les troubles bipolaires sont caractérisés par une
association de modifications psychologiques liées à
l’état qui sont limitées aux épisodes de la maladie,
et de modifications « trait » qui persistent lors des
périodes de rémission, indépendamment du statut
thymique.. Cet article passe en revue les études qui
ont utilisé deux techniques pour observer les méca-
nismes cérébraux impliqués dans ces modifications
trait et état dépendantes : 1) des mesures indirectes
de la fonction neurocognitive et 2) des mesures
directes par neuro-imagerie de la fonction céré-
brale pendant l’exécution d’une tâche cognitive.
Les études de la fonction neurocognitive dans les
troubles bipolaires montrent des déficits dans trois
domaines clés : l’attention, les fonctions exécutives
et les processus émotionnels. Les études d’imagerie
fonctionnelle impliquent la physiopathologie de la
distribution des circuits neuronaux, dont les cortex
cingulaire antérieur et préfrontal, comme celle des
structures limbiques sous-corticales, dont l’amyg-
dale et le striatum ventral. Les connaissances sur les
modifications cérébrales dans la maladie bipolaire
ont bien progressé mais les données sur la dépres-
sion bipolaire sont peu nombreuses et l’influence
de variables cliniques comme le traitement, la sévé-
rité de la maladie et l’importance des symptômes
spécifiques est mal comprise.
