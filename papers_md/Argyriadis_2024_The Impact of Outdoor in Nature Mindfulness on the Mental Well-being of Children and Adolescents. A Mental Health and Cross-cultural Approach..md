ABSTRACT
Background:  Mindfulness,  originating  from 
ancient  meditation  practices,  has  garnered 
substantial scientific interest in recent decades 
due to its potential to enhance various aspects 
of  well-being.  The  rise  of  scientific  interest  in 
mindfulness  has  led  to  the  development  of 
Mindfulness-Based  Stress  Reduction  (MBSR) 
and  other  mindfulness-based  interventions 
(MBIs),  which  have  demonstrated  positive  ef-
fects on stress reduction, emotional regulation, 
and  cognitive  flexibility.  Objective:  This  study 
aimed to explore the characteristics and appli-
cations of mindfulness, investigate its impact on 
mental health, and assess the potential benefits 
of  combining  mindfulness  with  nature-based 
interventions  in  promoting  the  well-being  of 
children  and  adolescents.  Methods:  This  re-
view  draws  from  existing  literature,  scholarly 
articles, and empirical studies related to mind-
fulness,  nature  exposure,  and  their  effects  on 
mental  health.  Results:  The  results  highlight 
the manifold benefits of mindfulness in differ-
ent populations, including health professionals, 
patients, children, adolescents, and the general 
public.  Mindfulness  practice  has  been  associ-
ated with notable reductions in stress, anxiety, 
and depression, and has shown positive effects 
on  brain  plasticity  and  cognitive  functioning. 
Furthermore,  the  integration  of  mindfulness 
with  exposure  to  natural  environments  holds 

potential  for  enhanced  stress  reduction  and 
cognitive restoration. Conclusion: The findings 
underscore  the  potential  of  mindfulness  as  a 
cost-effective and accessible intervention to pro-
mote mental health across diverse age groups 
and settings. Further research should explore the 
specific  mechanisms  and  long-term  effects  of 
this integrated approach to optimize its benefits.

1. BACKGROUND

Mindfulness-based  interventions  (MBIs) 
include the application of meditation as well 
as mind-body practices to promote conscious 
awareness in everyday life. The aim is to help 
individuals cope with everyday stressors, ad-
versities, adverse life events, and unpleasant 
situations through disengagement and posi-
tive and negative emotional regulation. Mind-
fulness application can be seen as a process 
measure for describing and quantifying how 
people  actively  apply  mindfulness  practice 
to their life experiences (1). Mindfulness is a 
science-based  practice  that  involves  paying 
non-judgmental attention to the present mo-
ment. It is also associated with the cultivation

The Impact of Outdoor in Nature Mindfulness on the Mental Well-being of Children and Adolescents. A Mental Health and Cross-cultural Approach 

of positive emotions such as empathy, compassion, and 
kindness (2).

Mindfulness programs have been implemented in var-
ious settings such as schools, universities, institutions, 
and companies to improve thinking skills (3). They are 
also targeted towards health professionals (4), patients 
and caregivers, children, adolescents, the elderly (5), in-
dividuals struggling with substance use (5, 6) and can be 
practiced at home, school, or in any work environment 
(7). In conclusion, these programs are inclusive and can 
be discreetly applied anywhere and at any time (8).

Mindfulness training and teaching can be conducted 
by specially trained individuals in the technique (9) as 
well as through web and smartphone applications that 
offer guided meditations. These applications are easily 
accessible, efficient, and cost-effective (3, 10, 11).

2. SPECIAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE 
MINDFULNESS TECHNIQUE AND ITS 
PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS
Conscious  awareness  is  characterized  by  several 
key elements. Firstly, mindfulness involves purposeful 
action  in  the  form  of  intentionally  directing  attention. 
Secondly, it embodies presence, encouraging individu-
als to fully engage with and pay attention to the present 
moment.  Lastly,  an  essential  aspect  of  mindfulness  is 
acceptance, which entails being non-judgmental about 
whatever arises in the moment. This includes observing 
thoughts, feelings, and sensations without categorizing 
them as good or bad, positive or negative, pleasant or un-
pleasant. Instead, the mindful individual acknowledges 
these  aspects  as  they  are,  recognizing  that  they  will 
eventually pass (8). Through experiential exercises and 
practices, participants learn how to retreat or disengage 
from their initial negative thoughts and increase their 
cognitive flexibility (10). At a professional level, mindful-
ness programs can be implemented in the workplace to 
help  employees,  including  health  professionals,  effec-
tively cope with stressful situations and promote their 
overall  well-being  (12,  13).  The  mechanisms  involved 
in  these  programs  include  awareness/self-regulation, 
self-care, growth mindset, goal achievement, and accep-
tance/compassion. A supportive environment is crucial 
for their effectiveness (14).

Interventions can be implemented at the individual 
level  (i.e.,  personalized),  group  level,  and  organiza-
tional level. At the individual level, using a mindfulness 
meditation app can help establish a meditation routine. 
For  example,  one  can  integrate  their  daily  meditation 
practice into their existing routine, such as an evening 
walk, to establish a consistent practice. Personalization 
is an important aspect of many health interventions, as 
research has shown (11).

At the group level, face-to-face contact is emphasized, 
as it has the highest level of evidence for effectiveness. 
During group discussions, participants can share their 
personal  experiences,  challenges,  and  successes  in 
practicing mindfulness (10). At the organizational level, 
the  implementation  of  mindfulness  can  contribute  to 
creating a safer work environment, increasing staff sat-

isfaction, and improving relationships between leader-
ship and staff by managing workloads more effectively. 
The transformation of any activity into a mindfulness 
practice is contingent upon the incorporation of specific 
elements. To begin with, the activity should involve the 
direct engagement of one of the five senses. Focusing on 
a sense serves the purpose of anchoring the individual 
in the present moment and facilitating a separation from 
distracting  thoughts.  Additionally,  an  integral  compo-
nent of this mindful transformation is the inclusion of 
an "anchor." This anchor serves as the focal point of at-
tention during the practice. Examples of such anchors 
could include the breath, the texture of a meal, the sound 
of running water, or any other sensory aspect that aids in 
cultivating mindfulness. The essence of the mindfulness 
technique lies in returning to the "anchor," maintaining 
focus on it before being distracted, and gently bringing 
the  focus  back  to  the  anchor  when  distractions  arise. 
Over  time  and  with  practice,  the  mind  becomes  less 
prone to being consumed by distractions (sensations or 
thoughts)  and  instead  learns  to  observe  them  without 
judgment and let them go. (8) The primary mindfulness 
practices  include  breathing  and  walking  meditation 
(formal practices involving relaxation and concentration 
exercises) and non-judgmental attention to daily activi-
ties (informal practice) (15). 

3. EFFECTS OF THE MINDFULNESS 
TECHNIQUE ON MENTAL HEALTH
Mindfulness  is  a  mind-body  practice  that  has  been 
found to have a beneficial impact on both psychological 
and physical well-being. It involves self-regulation of at-
tention and adopting a specific orientation towards one's 
present-moment experiences (Portella et al., 2021). The 
mindfulness technique has a history of over 25 centuries, 
and in the last two decades, there has been a significant 
increase in interest among researchers to scientifically 
and systematically study its effects in various domains 
of life (16).

Davis and Hayes, (9) backed by data from the Ameri-
can Psychological Association (APA), proposed that the 
mindfulness  technique  yields  effects  across  physical, 
psychological, and spiritual dimensions.

Psychologically,  mindfulness  has  been  observed  to 
have  a  range  of  positive  effects,  as  highlighted  by  re-
search. This includes the reduction of stress and nega-
tive emotions, offering individuals a means to gain in-
creased control over ruminative thinking—characterized 
by  intrusive  and  repetitive  negative  thought  patterns. 
Furthermore,  engagement  in  mindfulness  practices 
has been associated with notable psychological benefits, 
such as an increase in empathy, conscientiousness, and 
compassion. It has been found to improve mental focus 
and  flexibility  while  enhancing  overall  awareness  of 
the mind. 

Studies  examining  the  impact  of  mindfulness  on 
academic  education  have  identified  both  short-term 
and long-term memory enhancement as a noteworthy 
psychological  outcome.  Additionally,  mindfulness  has 
been linked to a reduction in distracting thoughts and a

decrease in emotional reactivity, contributing to a more 
balanced and resilient psychological state.

Within the spiritual domain, the practice of mindful-
ness has been associated with various positive outcomes. 
Research  suggests  an  augmentation  of  empathy  and 
compassion, reflecting an enhanced capacity for under-
standing and connecting with others on a deeper level.
Furthermore,  individuals  engaging  in  mindfulness 
have  reported  an  increase  in  discipline,  cultivating  a 
sense of self-control and purpose. The spiritual benefits 
extend to an elevation in the sense of intuition, moral-
ity, and courage, fostering a more profound connection 
with  one's  inner  values  and  convictions.  Mindfulness 
practices have also been linked to an increase in self-
awareness and self-acceptance, promoting a more pro-
found understanding and acknowledgment of one's own 
thoughts and emotions. This, in turn, contributes to a 
greater  sense  of  acceptance  toward  others.  Moreover, 
mindfulness  has  been  associated  with  an  increase  in 
the  control  of  automatic  behaviors,  allowing  individu-
als to navigate situations with greater spontaneity while 
maintaining a conscious awareness of their actions in 
alignment with spiritual values (17).

Mindfulness practice has been identified as a multi-
faceted  approach  contributing  to  several  positive  out-
comes. Primarily, it has demonstrated effectiveness in 
reducing stress and depression, potentially leading to a 
diminished reliance on corresponding medications for 
mental health management.

In addition to its impact on mental well-being, mind-
fulness  has  been  associated  with  an  increased  ability 
to  tolerate  pain  or  disability  and  a  reduction  in  pain 
perception. This suggests potential applications in pain 
management and coping with physical challenges.

Mindfulness practices also extend their influence to 
interpersonal  relationships,  promoting  improved  dy-
namics and communication between individuals. Fur-
thermore, they have been found to enhance the overall 
effectiveness of medical treatments, fostering a reflective 
approach to the treatment process (18).

Additionally, engaging in mindfulness has been linked 
to an increased motivation for making positive lifestyle 
changes. This includes adjustments related to diet, smok-
ing, physical activity, and substance abuse, suggesting a 
comprehensive impact on various aspects of well-being.
Moreover, the benefits of mindfulness extend to physi-
ological  functions,  as  evidenced  by  improvements  in 
endocrine function, including the reduction of cortisol 
levels in the blood. Furthermore, mindfulness has been 
associated with positive effects on immune and nervous 
system function, emphasizing its potential role in pro-
moting holistic health.

Mindfulness-based  stress  reduction  programs  can 
serve as effective tools to reduce stress, increase resil-
ience, lower heart rate and blood pressure, enhance job 
satisfaction,  promote  calmness,  strengthen  self-com-
passion, and foster inner peace among participants (19). 
Effective  interventions  not  only  improve  participants' 
health-related quality of life but also enhance the qual-
ity of working life for healthcare professionals. Further-

more, mindfulness practice contributes to better time 
management, resulting in immediate improvements in 
performance and productivity in the workplace. More-
over, mindfulness practices foster psychological safety in 
the workplace. Participants strengthen their ability to ex-
press themselves without fear of negative consequences 
for their self-image, situation, or career. This creates a 
psychologically  safe  working  environment  where  em-
ployees can freely express their thoughts, care for one 
another, and feel safe to experiment and take risks (20).
Mindfulness practice has also shown positive results 
in improving cognitive abilities such as cognitive flex-
ibility and memory in healthy individuals. It has been 
associated  with  structural  and  functional  differences 
in various brain regions. These include the prefrontal 
cortex, which is related to enhanced metaconsciousness 
and reappraisal; the sensory cortices and insula, which 
are related to body awareness; the hippocampus, which 
is related to memory and refocusing; and the cingulate 
cortex, which is related to self-regulation and emotion 
regulation (21).

In  terms  of  interpersonal  benefits,  mindfulness  is 
associated  with  higher  relationship  satisfaction,  the 
ability to respond constructively to relationship stress 
and conflict, improved emotional recognition and com-
munication  with  partners,  reduced  negativity,  and 
increased  empathy  (5).  Individuals  with  higher  levels 
of  mindfulness  report  less  emotional  stress  and  an-
ger  in  response  to  relationship  conflict.  Intrapersonal 
benefits  of  practicing  mindfulness  include  enhancing 
self-awareness, ethical decision-making, intuition, and 
fear conditioning. Mindfulness also improves informa-
tion processing speed, reduces work effort, and reduces 
work-related irrelevant thoughts (19).

4. MINDFULNESS IN NATURE

Nature-based interventions, including spending time 
in green spaces, have been associated with various posi-
tive outcomes, such as reduced stress, increased positive 
affect, and improved cognitive functioning (20). More-
over, research has suggested that exposure to natural 
environments can enhance the experience of mindful-
ness, leading to increased attentional capacity, emotional 
regulation, and self-awareness (22). Therefore, the inte-
gration of mindfulness and nature-based interventions 
seems to be a promising approach to promote well-being 
and prevent mental health problems.

Theories of Attention Restoration and Stress Reduc-
tion have been proposed to explain the positive effects of 
nature exposure on well-being. (3) Attention Restoration 
Theory (ART) posits that exposure to natural environ-
ments can restore attentional capacity, which is depleted 
by the demands of daily life and the need for directed 
attention. According to ART, natural environments pos-
sess characteristics such as soft fascination, being away, 
extent, and compatibility, which promote the restoration 
of  attention.  On  the  other  hand,  the  Stress  Reduction 
Theory (SRT) suggests that exposure to natural environ-
ments can evoke positive emotional responses, leading to 
a reduction in physiological arousal and stress levels (17.)
