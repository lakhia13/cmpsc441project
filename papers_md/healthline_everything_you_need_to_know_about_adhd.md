- ADHD symptoms may manifest differently based on gender. However, social expectations may affect the way these symptoms are viewed and whether you ultimately receive ADHD diagnosis.

- Although ADHD is not classified as a learning disability, its symptoms may create challenges in learning environments.

- Healthcare professionals use a combination of approaches, including structured routines, organizational tools, and lifestyle adjustments, alongside treatments like therapy and medication.

People with ADHD may have difficulty focusing their attention on a single task or sitting still for long periods of time.

Many people experience inattention and changes in energy levels. But for a person with ADHD, this happens more often than in people who do not have the condition.

This can have a significant effect on school, work, relationships, and home life.

Both adults and children can have ADHD. It’s a diagnosis the American Psychiatric Association (APA) recognizes.

A wide range of behaviors is associated with ADHD. Some of the more common ones include:

- having difficulty focusing or concentrating on tasks

- beingforgetfulabout completing tasks

- being easily distracted

- having difficulty sitting still

- interrupting peoplewhile they’re talking

Signs and symptoms can be specific to different aspects of ADHD, such as hyperactivity, impulsivity, or difficulty focusing.

A person who is experiencing hyperactivity and impulsivity may:

- find it difficult to sit still or remain seated in class

- have difficulty playing or carrying out tasks quietly

- talk excessively

- find it hard to wait for their turn

- interrupt others when they’re speaking, playing, or carrying out a task

Someone who is having difficulty focusing might:

- make frequent mistakes or miss details when studying orworking

- find it hard to maintain focus when listening, reading, or holding a conversation

- have problems organizing their daily tasks

- lose items frequently

- be easily distracted by small things happening around them

If you or your child has ADHD, you may have some or all of these symptoms. The symptoms you have will depend on the type of ADHD you have.

### Key Terms Explained

Executive dysfunctionis a common symptom of ADHD and refers to difficulties in cognitive functions, such as paying attention, absorbing or remembering new information, ignoring distractions, and regulating emotions and behaviors.

To make ADHD diagnoses more consistent, the APA has grouped the condition into three categories, or types.These typesare predominantly inattentive, predominantly hyperactivity-impulsive, and a combination of both.

The type of ADHD you or your child has will determine the treatment method. The ADHD type you have can change over time, so your treatment may change, too.

### Predominantly inattentive

As the name suggests, people with thistype of ADHDhave extreme difficulty focusing, finishing tasks, and following instructions.

Experts also think that many children with the inattentive type of ADHD may not receive a proper diagnosis because they don’t tend to disrupt the classroom.Some researchsuggests this is more common among girls with ADHD.

The use ofbinaryterms such as “male” and “female” or “men” and “women” in this article reflects the language of the sources we’ve used. Unless otherwise noted, it’s unclear whether the research we reference included participants withexpansive gender identities.

### Predominantly hyperactive-impulsive type

People with thistype of ADHDprimarily show hyperactive and impulsive behavior. This can include:

- interrupting people while they’re talking

- not being able to wait their turn

Although inattention is less of a concern with this type of ADHD, people with predominantly hyperactive-impulsive ADHD may still find it difficult to focus on tasks.

### Combined hyperactive-impulsive and inattentive type

This is the most commontype of ADHD. People with this combined type of ADHD display both inattentive and hyperactive symptoms.

These include an inability to pay attention, a tendency toward impulsiveness, and above-average levels of activity and energy.

## What causes ADHD?

Despite how common ADHD is, doctors and researchers still are not sure whatcauses the condition. Doctors believe that ADHD has neurological origins. Genetics may also play a role.

Recent researchsuggests that a reduction indopamine is a factor. Dopamine is a chemical in the brain that helps move signals from one nerve to another. It also triggers emotional responses and movements.

Another2024 studysuggests a structural difference in the brain. Findings indicate that people with ADHD have less gray matter volume. Gray matter includes the brain areas that help with:

- decision making

Researchers are still studying potential causes of ADHD, such as smoking during pregnancy.

## ADHD diagnosis and testing

If you suspect that you or your child has ADHD, talk with a healthcare professional about getting an evaluation.

For your child, you can also talk with their school counselor. Schools regularlyassess childrenfor conditions that may be affecting their educational performance.

Provide your doctor or counselor with notes and observations about your or your child’s behavior. If they suspect ADHD, they may refer you or your child to anADHD specialist.

Tomake a diagnosis, a doctor will assess any symptoms you or your child has had over the previous 6 months using a variety of checklists and rating scales.

Depending on the diagnosis, they may also suggest making an appointment with a psychiatrist or neurologist.

Treatment for ADHD typically includes therapy, medication, or both.

Behavioral therapycan help you or your child learn how to monitor and manage your behavior. Withtalk therapy, you or your child will discuss how ADHD affects your life and ways to help you manage it.

Medicationcan also be very helpful when you’re living with ADHD. ADHD medications are designed to affect brain chemicals in a way that enables you to better manage your impulses and actions.

The two main types of medications used to treat ADHD are stimulants and nonstimulants.

Healthcare professionals commonly prescribe ADHD medications, which are central nervous system (CNS) stimulants. These drugs work by increasing the amount of the brain chemicalsdopamineand norepinephrine.

Examples of these drugs includemethylphenidate(Ritalin) and amphetamine-based stimulants (Adderall).

If stimulants do not work well or cause troublesome side effects for you or your child, your doctor may suggest a nonstimulant medication. Certain nonstimulant medications work by increasing brain levels of norepinephrine.

These medications include atomoxetine (Strattera) and some antidepressants likebupropion(Wellbutrin).

ADHD medications can have many benefits, as well as side effects.

In addition to — or instead of — medication, severallifestyle changeshave been suggested to help ease ADHD symptoms. This includes:

- eating abalanced diet

- getting at least 60 minutes ofphysical activityper day

- gettingplenty of sleep

- limitingdaily screen timefrom phones, computers, and TV

Yoga,tai chi, andtime outdoorscan help calm overactive minds and may help ease ADHD symptoms.

Mindfulness meditationis another option.Recent researchsuggests meditation might improve attention span in people with ADHD.

Avoiding certainallergens and additivesis also a potential way to help reduce ADHD symptoms.

You may have heard the terms “ADD” and “ADHD” and wonderedwhat the difference isbetween them.

ADD, or attention deficit disorder, is an outdated term. It was previously used to describe people who have difficulty paying attention but are not hyperactive.

The type of ADHD called “predominantly inattentive” is now used in place of ADD. ADHD is the current overarching name of the condition.

## ADHD in children

Around8.8% of people ages 3 to 17 yearsin the United States have had a diagnosis of ADHD at some point. This includes 11.7% of boys and 5.7% of girls.

For children, ADHD is generally associated with problems at school.Children with ADHDoften have difficulties in a controlled classroom setting.

Boys are more than twice as likely as girls to receive an ADHD diagnosis. This may be because boys tend to exhibit hallmark symptoms of hyperactivity.

Although somegirls with ADHDmay have the classic symptoms of hyperactivity, many do not. In many cases, girls with ADHD may be hyper-talkative and daydream frequently.

Many ADHD symptoms can be typical childhood behaviors, so it can be hard to know what’s ADHD-related and what’s not.

More than60% of childrenwith ADHD still showsymptoms as adults.

For many people, hyperactivity symptoms often decrease with age, but inattentiveness and impulsivity may continue. That said, treatment is important.

Untreated ADHD in adults can have a negative impact on many aspects of life. Symptoms such as difficulty managing time, forgetfulness, and impatience can cause problems at work, home, and in all types of relationships.

## Is ADHD a learning disability?

While ADHD is a neurodevelopmental disorder, it’s not considered alearning disability. However, ADHD symptoms can make it harder for you to learn.

Teachers can map out individual guidelines for students with ADHD to help relieve any effect on their learning. This may include allowing extra time for assignments and tests or developing a personal reward system.

### Neurotypical vs. neurodivergent

Neurotypicaldescribes someone who processes information in ways that are typical within their culture and among their peers. Neurodivergent describes people who process information differently.

People with ADHD sometimes identify as neurodivergent, but ultimately, it’s a personal decision.

## Coexisting conditions

People with ADHD may have other health conditions. Some ofthese conditionsresult from the challenges of living with ADHD.

People with ADHD can find it hard to keep up with daily tasks, maintain relationships, and so on. This can increase the risk ofanxiety.

People with ADHD aremore likelyto experience an anxiety disorder than those without ADHD. Common anxiety disorders include:

- separation anxiety, when you are afraid of being away from loved ones

- social anxiety, which can make you afraid of going to school or other places where people socialize

- generalized anxiety, when you’re afraid of bad things happening, of the future, and so on

If you or your child has ADHD, you’re more likely to havedepressionas well. In one study from 2020, around50% of adolescentshadmajor depressionor an anxiety disorder compared with 35% of those who did not have ADHD.

Other research suggests that up to53.3% of adultswith ADHD may also have depression. Though managing more than one condition can present added challenges, treatments are available for both.

The treatments often overlap. Talk therapy can help treat both conditions. Certain antidepressants, such as bupropion, can sometimes help ease ADHD symptoms.

### Conduct and behavior disorders

Behavior and conduct disorders aremore commonamong children with ADHD than those without the condition. These disorders can arise when a person does not feel understood by those around them.

Someone who does not feel understood may argue a lot, lose their temper, or purposely annoy others. These may be signs ofoppositional defiant disorder.

Some people find they cannot help breaking rules or behaving aggressively toward others, maybe fighting, bullying, or perhaps taking things that do not belong to them. This is calledconduct disorder.

Treatment is available for people who face these challenges. Experts recommend starting treatment early and making sure the treatment fits the needs of the person and their family.

### Learning disorders

Some children with ADHD have a learning disorder that can make it additionally hard to carry out their study tasks. Examples includedyslexia, which makes reading difficult, or presents difficulties with numbers or writing.

These challenges can make it hard for a child to cope at school. They can also worsen feelings of anxiety and depression. Getting help early is essential in trying to minimize the effects of these challenges.

## Tips for coping with ADHD

For children, it can be helpful to focus on writing down homework assignments and keeping everyday items like toys and backpacks in assigned spots.

For adults, staying organized with lists,planners, and automated reminders can be helpful. Learning more about ADHD in general can also help you learn how to manage it.

Organizations likeChildren and Adults with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (CHADD)or theAttention Deficit Disorder Association (ADDA)provide management tips as well as the latest research.

A healthcare professional can provide more guidance on ways to manage your ADHD symptoms.

## The bottom line

For children and adults, untreated ADHD can have a lasting effect on school, work, and relationships. Treatment is important and can help lessen the effects of the condition.

Many people with ADHD enjoy fulfilling and successful lives. Some even express appreciation for the condition’s perceived benefits.

An important first step is talking with a doctor or another healthcare professional. They can make a diagnosis and create a treatment plan to help you manage your symptoms and live well with ADHD.
