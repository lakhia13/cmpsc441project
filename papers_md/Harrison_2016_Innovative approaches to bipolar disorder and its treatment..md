All psychiatric disorders have suffered from a dearth of truly novel pharmacological interventions. In bipolar disorder,
lithium remains a mainstay of treatment, six decades since its effects were serendipitously discovered. The lack of
progress reﬂects several factors, including ignorance of the disorder’s pathophysiology and the complexities of the
clinical phenotype. After reviewing the current status, we discuss some ways forward. First, we highlight the need for
a richer characterization of the clinical proﬁle, facilitated by novel devices and new forms of data capture and analysis;
such data are already promoting a reevaluation of the phenotype, with an emphasis on mood instability rather than
on discrete clinical episodes. Second, experimental medicine can provide early indications of target engagement
and therapeutic response, reducing the time, cost, and risk involved in evaluating potential mood stabilizers. Third,
genomic data can inform target identiﬁcation and validation, such as the increasing evidence for involvement of
calcium channel genes in bipolar disorder. Finally, new methods and models relevant to bipolar disorder, including
stem cells and genetically modiﬁed mice, are being used to study key pathways and drug effects. A combination of
these approaches has real potential to break the impasse and deliver genuinely new treatments.

Introduction

Bipolar disorder is classically described as clinically
signiﬁcant episodes of depression and elevated
mood (mania or hypomania) with intervening peri-
ods of normal mood (euthymia).1 A distinction
is made between type I and type II bipolar dis-
orders that depends on the duration and severity
of the episodes of mood elevation. In reality, the
proﬁle of bipolar disorder is complex and hetero-
geneous, both longitudinally and cross-sectionally,
and includes mixed mood states, persistent mood
instability, and cognitive dysfunction.2–7 During
mood swings there may be features of psychosis
(delusions and hallucinations) that are mood con-
gruent. Although psychotic symptoms are seen only
in a minority of patients, they explain the early ter-
minology of manic–depressive psychosis. Psychotic
symptoms also contribute to the uncertain posi-
tion of bipolar disorder within psychiatric classi-
ﬁcations that place it between schizophrenia and

other mood disorders.8 The substantial morbidity of
bipolar disorder arises primarily from the depressive
episodes,9 and there is frequent comorbidity with
anxiety disorders and substance misuse.10 Bipolar
disorder affects 1–4% of the population, depending
on the criteria used, with onset usually in adoles-
cence or early adulthood.11 It is one of the leading
causes of disability worldwide and is associated with
signiﬁcant direct and indirect costs.12 Suicide occurs
in at least 5% of patients,13 and there is a marked
increase in mortality rates from natural causes, espe-
cially cardiovascular disease.14 Consequently, life
expectancy in bipolar disorder is reduced by 10 years
or more.15,16

Innovative approaches to bipolar disorder

summary provides a brief overview of the cur-
rent evidence and recommendations for treatment
of bipolar disorder. Our discussion focuses on
the results of network meta-analyses, which are
advanced statistical approaches to evidence synthe-
sis that allow different interventions to be ranked
for their relative effectiveness, even if they have not
been compared in an individual trial17,18 (for fur-
ther review of bipolar disorder therapies see Ref. 19,
and for recent clinical guidelines see Refs. 20–22).

Evidence-based treatment
recommendations

The mainstay of therapy for all three phases of
bipolar disorder (mania, depression, and prophy-
laxis) is pharmacological. The ﬁrst-line treatment
for mania is an antipsychotic; inclusion of over
16,000 patients and 14 different treatments indi-
cated that olanzapine and risperidone had the best
proﬁles in terms of efﬁcacy and tolerability.23 A
subsequent update of the literature included sev-
eral newer antimanic agents (notably cariprazine, a
dopamine D2/D3 receptor partial agonist), but came
to broadly similar conclusions.24

Bipolar depression is often long lasting and difﬁ-
cult to treat, requiring a different approach from that
used in unipolar depression.25 The evidence regard-
ing effective interventions is limited, and network
meta-analysis has reached inconsistent conclusions
depending on how studies were included.26,27 The
broad consensus is that quetiapine, olanzapine,
antidepressants, lamotrigine, and lurasidone have
some efﬁcacy but show varying tolerability. Rela-
tive efﬁcacy is not well established by these analyses.
Several recent clinical trials not included in these
meta-analyses provide new avenues for treatment
of bipolar depression. Durgam et al.28 report efﬁ-
cacy of cariprazine (at 1.5 mg/day, but not at lower
or higher doses) in a relatively large 8-week trial.
In a 12-month double-blind, placebo-controlled,
randomized trial, Geddes et al.29 showed that the
combination of lamotrigine and quetiapine is more
effective than quetiapine alone in patients with bipo-
lar depression; unexpectedly, the beneﬁt of lamot-
rigine was not seen in patients also randomized to
folic acid. There is some evidence that the atypical
antipsychotic lurasidone may have particular efﬁ-
cacy in bipolar depression with mixed features,30
and preliminary data support use of armodaﬁnil as
an adjunctive therapy.31,32 Intravenous ketamine as

an add-on therapy to mood stabilizers shows poten-
tial to have a rapid but often transient antidepressant
effect.33 Finally, a recent study highlights that elec-
troconvulsive therapy remains a useful option for
treatment-resistant bipolar depression.34

For prevention of relapse in bipolar disorder,
lithium remains the most effective and best stud-
ied monotherapy.35,36 Comparison of lithium with
other treatments is limited by the design of most
relapse-prevention studies, which are enriched for
patients who have responded to the investigational
drug for treatment of an episode of mania or
depression.37 A network meta-analysis of mainte-
nance treatment was published in 2014, based on 33
trials involving 17 treatments or combinations and
6846 participants.38 This meta-analysis included
studies lasting at least 12 weeks with either a prophy-
laxis (where only euthymic participants were eligi-
ble) or a relapse-prevention design (responders to
the investigational drug during the acute phase were
randomly assigned to either remain on the drug or
be switched to placebo or comparator). The results
support efﬁcacy of a number of interventions, but
only quetiapine and lithium prevented recurrence
of both polarities of mood episode. Olanzapine,
risperidone, and lithium in combination with val-
proate were signiﬁcantly better than placebo in the
prevention of manic episodes, and lamotrigine was
better than placebo for depressive relapse. Valproate
did not differ from placebo when depression and
mania were considered separately. It is also notewor-
thy that, from a methodological viewpoint, the qual-
ity of the studies included in the meta-analysis var-
ied considerably, and these differences affected the
ﬁnal ranking of treatments. The efﬁcacy of lithium
was observed even when trial designs favored the
active comparator. Hence, despite not being par-
ticularly well tolerated, lithium was supported as
ﬁrst-line treatment; quetiapine, olanzapine, and
lamotrigine were considered second line.38

Although the preceding discussion has focused on
medication, because of their primary role in bipo-
lar disorder and the number of new randomized
clinical trials and meta-analyses to highlight, psy-
chological and psychosocial treatments, particularly
lifestyle interventions, also play a role.19 In a recent
systematic review,39 the authors concluded that the
evidence is strongest for psychoeducation in the pre-
vention of relapse in the early years after onset of
bipolar disorder, with much more limited evidence

for the use of cognitive behavioral and interpersonal
therapies in the acute phases of the illness.

Limitations of existing therapies

The preceding summary of evidence-based guide-
lines and meta-analyses emphasize that effective
treatments for bipolar disorder are available. How-
ever, their effectiveness is modest, and all the drugs
have signiﬁcant side effects and potential harms.

Lithium’s efﬁcacy has to be balanced against its
many side effects and potential toxicity. The risk of
renal failure is a particular concern for both patients
and clinicians. In fact, several recent studies show
that this risk, though real, is considerably lower
than often believed, especially if periods of acute
lithium toxicity are avoided.40–44 There is an addi-
tional concern for women of childbearing age with
bipolar disorder regarding pregnancy and breast-
feeding. As well as a high risk of puerperal relapse,45
there are teratogenic and other risks to the fetus
and baby associated with lithium and other mood
stabilizers. Again, however, it is reassuring that the
absolute pregnancy-associated risks of lithium are
not as great as previously thought,40,46,47 and some
of the adverse pregnancy outcomes are related to
bipolar disorder itself and not to its treatment.48
The risks of renal and other harms from lithium
also have to be weighed against the strong evidence
that it has an antisuicide effect49 and may also reduce
risks of dementia,50 stroke,51 and overall mortality.52
Thus, in total, lithium appears to be a safer drug,
when used judiciously, than usually considered.53,54
Nevertheless, it is clearly associated with many side
effects and risks, as are other mood stabilizers,55–57
and these limitations emphasize the need to develop
new treatments for bipolar disorder which are more
effective, tolerable, and safe.

Given the compelling need, why have there been
no new drug treatments for bipolar disorder (other
than repurposing of antipsychotics and anticonvul-
sants) since the introduction of lithium salts over 60
years ago? There are many reasons for this dearth
of innovation. Most importantly, we do not have
a good enough understanding of the pathophysi-
ology of bipolar disorder, and therefore of rational
drug targets for its treatment. The mechanisms of
action of drugs currently used for bipolar disorder
are unclear (in contrast to the better established
pharmacological targets of antipsychotic, antide-
pressant, and anxiolytic drugs) and remain under

active investigation. It is a paradox that lithium
has one of the most speciﬁc therapeutic actions
in psychiatry, yet has multiple different pharmaco-
logical and cellular effects.58 Prominent (and over-
lapping) hypotheses focus on lithium’s inhibition
of inositol monophosphatase and glycogen syn-
thase kinase 3, and its effects on calcium signaling,
mitochondrial function, and, more recently, neu-
roplasticity, neurogenesis, and G protein–activated
potassium channels.58–60 The ﬁnding that two non-
coding RNAs show genome-wide association with
lithium response may reveal additional targets and
novel insight.61

A better understanding of the mechanism of
action of lithium and other effective drugs should
generate targets and aid new drug development.
For example, the inhibition of inositol monophos-
phatase by lithium has led to evaluation of the puta-
tive lithium analogue ebselen, which shares this
property. Ebselen has been found to have thera-
peutically relevant effects in animal models and in
human subjects and is now proceeding into fur-
ther development.62,63 Although the mechanism of
action of sodium valproate is unknown, it includes
some of the effects noted for lithium in addition
to having epigenetic effects via histone deacetylase
inhibition.64,65 For lamotrigine, the mechanism of
action (at least in epilepsy) is thought to be via inac-
tivation of presynaptic voltage-gated sodium chan-
nels, and hence inhibition of glutamate release;66
however, it has many other actions which may be
relevant to its role in bipolar disorder.67

Other reasons for the lack of effective innova-
tion in bipolar disorder therapy include uncertainty
about how best to deﬁne and determine therapeu-
tic response, the lack of validated animal models
(see below), and neglect in research funding com-
pared to that for schizophrenia.68 Study of bipo-
lar disorder poses additional problems because of
the episodic nature of the condition, which requires
long-term studies to demonstrate prophylactic efﬁ-
cacy, as well as treatment trials for manic and depres-
sive episodes. This scientiﬁc failure is of course not
unique to bipolar disorder; it has been a problem
across psychiatry and has contributed signiﬁcantly
to the recent withdrawal of many pharmaceutical
companies from the ﬁeld.69 Fortunately, the ﬁeld
may have reached a turning point, ﬁrst, by taking
advantage of novel ways to measure the clinical phe-
notype and the impact of a therapeutic intervention;

and second, by building upon the advances in
understanding of the etiology and pathogenesis of
bipolar disorder that are emerging from genomics
and from novel experimental approaches, such as
genetic mouse models and human-induced pluripo-
tent stem cells (iPSCs). The remainder of this review
summarizes recent progress in these areas.

Reﬁning the bipolar phenotype and how it
is measured: a focus on mood instability

Psychiatric diagnoses are traditionally based on
retrospective assessment of the history; follow-up
assessments are similarly based on the patient’s
account of the intervening weeks or months since
the last appointment. Diagnosis has focused on the
identiﬁcation of “episodes,” and clinical outcome is
often dichotomized, so that if a patient is not judged
as reaching criteria for an episode, he/she is consid-
ered to be “well.”

These approaches are particularly problematic
in bipolar disorder, wherein mood may ﬂuctuate
considerably—in either direction—during any time
period evaluated in this way. The failure to mea-
sure symptom levels between episodes is a limita-
tion because subsyndromal symptoms predict poor
outcome and relapse.70,71 One way to address this
is to have more frequent and contemporaneous
assessments of mood. In the recently completed
CEQUEL trial of lamotrigine augmentation of que-
tiapine in bipolar depression,29 the primary out-
come variable was the self-report Quick Inventory
of Depressive Symptoms,72 which was completed
by participants remotely after a weekly text or e-
mail prompt. This approach had several advantages.
First, it allowed subjects to be followed up rela-
tively frequently and without requiring clinic vis-
its beyond those required for their usual care––a
valuable feature as trials become larger and longer.
Second, weekly rating allows for a much more
ﬁne-grained analysis of the response to treatment
than just the prespeciﬁed time points at 12, 22,
and 52 weeks, and reveals effects of lamotrigine
beyond simply its antidepressant action (unpub-
lished observations). In a separate study, analysis
of daily mood ratings collected via a smartphone
app showed a clear distinction in mood variability
(as well as mood symptoms) between subjects with
bipolar disorder and those with borderline person-
ality disorder.73

The use of novel technologies can not only
help us to capture mood and other mental state

data more efﬁciently and accurately, but can move
bipolar disorder research beyond our reliance on
psychopathology to capture physiological, behav-
ioral, and environmental data in order to identify
the biological correlates and ultimately the under-
lying processes. Such data capture is increasingly
feasible through the capabilities of smartphones,
smartwatches, and wearable devices, and can
include actigraphy, posture, GPS position, heart
rate, temperature, and other factors. Many of these
data can be acquired automatically, without requir-
ing any action on the part of the subject, while
others require their input. For example, in ongo-
ing studies, we and others are using smartphones,
wrist-worn devices, and skin patches to capture data
on physical activity, heart rate, and sleep, as well as
delivering bespoke tests of cognitive function and
emotional processing via apps on smartphones or
tablets.74 These uses of remote technologies to aug-
ment treatment trials in bipolar disorder comple-
ment their rapid––though still largely untested and
unregulated––implementation into routine clini-
cal monitoring and self-monitoring.75–77 In these
respects, bipolar disorder is at the forefront of the
big data revolution in health care. However, con-
siderable further work is required to demonstrate
the validity,78–80 feasibility,81,82 and acceptability83
of these devices and approaches.

The signiﬁcance of mood instability
in bipolar disorder

These issues can be well illustrated by reference
to the investigation of mood instability, which, as
we noted earlier, is a common feature of bipolar
disorder, despite the textbook view that the disor-
der is one of discrete mood episodes interspersed
with normal (and stable) mood. Although the pres-
ence of persistent mood instability is in fact well
known to experienced clinicians and demonstra-
ble using conventional methods,84,85 remote moni-
toring and multidimensional data capture facilitate
a more quantitative assessment and can be cou-
pled to sophisticated mathematical techniques for
data analysis.86–88 In addition to being a clinical
feature of bipolar disorder, there is increasing evi-
dence that mood instability is a symptom that is
relatively common in the general population and a
risk factor for a number of illness outcomes. Thus,
it occurs in those at high risk for bipolar disorder89
and predicts its onset,90 it occurs during the pro-
drome of the disorder,7,91 and it is independently

associated with poor prognoses.92–94 Mood insta-
bility also contributes to borderline personality dis-
order and attention-deﬁcit disorder phenotypes.5

Given these considerations, research into mood
instability will beneﬁt from better deﬁnition95,96 and
improved understanding of its neural, molecular,
and genetic bases.97 Indeed, there is an iterative pro-
cess whereby the need to characterize, quantify, and
understand mood instability and its correlates drives
the development of devices and methods to achieve
this, while the capabilities provided by the develop-
ments enhance the focus on the phenomenon and its
measurement. For example, advances in neuroimag-
ing methods and analysis tools allow investigation
of mood instability and its relationship to variation
in cognition, brain activity, and neural dynamics.
By looking at patterns of correlation among signals
across different brain areas, it is possible to reveal
the functional networks,98 with activity in these net-
works varying dynamically as individuals perform
psychological tasks or are at rest.99 By measuring
brain activity at high temporal resolution using
techniques such as magnetoencephalography,100 it
becomes possible to measure the ﬂuctuating dynam-
ics across brain networks as they unfold.101,102 Other
methods identify the functional networks that are
most active at any given time point103 and make
it possible to derive measures of neural instability,
and thereby to investigate what instabilities in neu-
ral processing may underpin cognitive and mood
instability at various time scales. These approaches
afford a new dimension to investigations of the neu-
ral bases of psychological disorders linked to mood
instability, potentially revealing differences in the
dynamics in brain networks linked to mood or cog-
nition or differences in their regulation by executive
control or reward-related functions.

A combination of these and other new methods
may also allow identiﬁcation of predictive mark-
ers for the effects of mood-stabilizing therapies and
development of experimental medicine models for
testing potential new bipolar disorder therapies. For
example, lithium may affect mood instability or its
cognitive and neural correlates independent of, and
earlier than, its established efﬁcacy against clinical
episodes of mania or depression. To test this hypoth-
esis, we are exploring the effects of ﬁrst exposure to
lithium on the variability of mood, neural response
and networks, and cognitive function (focused on
reward-based decision making, learning, and atten-

tion), in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study.74
An effect of lithium on one or more metrics of
variability will help identify biomarkers that can be
used to test novel candidate mood stabilizers more
rapidly than is the case using traditional random-
ized controlled trial designs. By reducing the time
and thereby the costs and risks involved, an exper-
imental medicine model of bipolar disorder would
encourage reinvestment in the ﬁeld. A precedent for
such a model is provided by the conceptually equiv-
alent discovery of cognitive and emotional biomark-
ers predictive of antidepressant efﬁcacy in unipolar
depression.104 The successful identiﬁcation and val-
idation of these markers is now used to inform and
reﬁne decision making about novel putative antide-
pressant medications.105

In summary, mood instability is of interest and
potential importance in bipolar disorder in its own
right. It also illustrates the novel conceptual and
technical approaches that are being taken to char-
acterize and understand the bipolar phenotype. In
principle, the same rationale and multidisciplinary
approaches can be applied to other features, such as
reward sensitivity106 and sleep and circadian rhythm
dysregulation (see below).

Better understanding of etiology
and pathophysiology

Although improving the measurement and clinical
characterization of the bipolar disorder phenotype
can facilitate more powerful and rapid identiﬁcation
of the effects of potential new treatments, transfor-
mative advances in therapy will require a substan-
tially better understanding of the biological basis
of the disorder. This, in turn, requires additional
knowledge and novel tools. Fortunately, progress
has been made in several areas, including genetics,
animal models, and cellular models.

Therapeutic potential of bipolar disorder
genetics

Bipolar disorder has a high heritability (over 80%),
with a complex non-Mendelian genetic basis.107 The
majority of genetic risk is associated with multi-
ple polymorphisms, with a very small contribu-
tion from copy number variants and other rare
variants.107–110 The leading bipolar disorder loci and
genes based on existing genome-wide association
studies (GWAS) are summarized in Table 1; many
more will emerge with a forthcoming much larger

assembly of data from GWAS from the Psychiatric
Genomics Consortium.108 As with other diseases,
genetic information has the potential to inform
and improve bipolar disorder treatments, both by
highlighting targets and pathways and by enabling
personalized medicine.107 However, the magnitude
and immediacy of such effects are limited because
of the complexities of the genetic architecture and
the many steps that lie between identiﬁcation of a
genetic locus and validation of a drug target.111–116
An abnormality of calcium signaling has long
been considered a potential pathophysiological
mechanism in bipolar disorder, based mostly on
biochemical data in peripheral blood cells.117–119 It
is therefore noteworthy that calcium channel genes
are prominent in the genomic data.107,113 The evi-
dence is threefold. CACNA1C, which encodes the
Cav1.2 subunit of L-type voltage-gated channel, is
one of the genes most robustly identiﬁed by GWAS;
second, the functional category of calcium signal-
ing is enriched among bipolar disorder–associated
genes; and third, rare variants in calcium channel
subunits are also implicated.107,118,120 The involve-
ment of calcium channel genes in bipolar disorder
is not only signiﬁcant in terms of prior pathophysi-
ological ﬁndings but because some data suggest that
calcium channel antagonists (used to treat hyper-

tension and angina) may have a role in bipolar dis-
order treatment.121 However, the ﬁndings are incon-
clusive, with randomized clinical trial data limited
to small trials of verapamil for mania.24,122 Never-
theless, the recent genetic data provide impetus to
further investigate the role of L-type calcium chan-
nel antagonists in bipolar disorder treatment; trials
using these agents in bipolar disorder can now select
or stratify participants based on CACNA1C risk
genotype.123 Compared to verapamil, other drugs
in this class have properties that may be advanta-
geous in bipolar disorder, such as improved brain
penetration, longer half-life, and greater L-type cal-
cium channel subunit selectivity. Looking ahead, the
ideal L-type calcium channel antagonist for bipolar
disorder would have speciﬁcity for isoforms that are
preferentially expressed in the brain, compared to
those expressed in the heart and blood vessels, in
order to maximize efﬁcacy and minimize cardio-
vascular side effects.122,124

Several of the other genes listed in Table 1 also
have potential as drug targets, although it may
prove difﬁcult to exploit these leads.125 For exam-
ple, ankyrin G (encoded by ANK3) is involved
in coupling voltage-gated sodium channels to the
axonal cytoskeleton.126 At ﬁrst sight, this suggests a
potential therapeutic role in regulation of neuronal

excitability; but recent studies emphasize the com-
plexity and diversity of ankyrin G distribution and
function, and it is not clear which aspects are most
relevant to bipolar disorder.127,128 It is also not
known what impact the ANK3 risk variants have
upon gene regulation or function, and therefore
whether a drug targeting this gene product should
enhance, inhibit, or stabilize ankyrin G activity.129
Genome-wide association studies also conﬁrm
that bipolar disorder is not a discrete entity, geneti-
cally speaking. That is, much of the genetic risk for
bipolar disorder is shared with schizophrenia, and a
lesser but still signiﬁcant amount with major depres-
sion, complementing the phenotypic overlaps and
comorbidities known to every clinician.8,130 There is
also evidence, albeit less robust, for genetically dis-
tinct subgroups within bipolar disorder, for exam-
ple in terms of the nature of psychotic or manic
symptoms.131–133 Genetics is thereby contributing
to the current interest in reconceptualizing psy-
chiatric disorders, such as bipolar disorder, both
transdiagnostically and in terms of their under-
lying biology, most prominently by the National
Institute of Mental Health Research Domain Cri-
teria initiative.134 This reformulation has therapeu-
tic implications, encouraging a search for treatment
targets and mechanisms that similarly cross con-
ventional diagnostic boundaries. For bipolar dis-
order, these might include attentional or cognitive
impairments2,7,135,136 and, as noted earlier, mood
instability independent of depressive or manic
episodes. It might also include treatments to nor-
malize sleep and circadian rhythms, with increas-
ing evidence that such abnormalities are not just
part of its symptomatology but may contribute to
its onset and maintenance.137–141 Given these con-
siderations, it is interesting that CACNA1C and
other calcium channel genes also show genome-
wide association with sleep quality142,143 and aspects
of memory,144,145 in addition to their role in risk for
bipolar disorder and other psychiatric disorders.

Better experimental methods to model
bipolar disorder and its treatment

Along with genomics, cellular and animal models
are crucial components of the target identiﬁcation
and drug discovery processes for many diseases.
Both have been used in a number of studies in
bipolar disorder, with interesting, though modest,
ﬁndings.

Cellular models
Existing data from bipolar disorder cellular mod-
els have recently been systematically reviewed.146
Most data come from studies using peripheral
cells, and hence have inherent limitations (because
they are non-neuronal; and in the specifc case of
lymphoblasts because they have undergone viral
transformation). Moreover, many positive ﬁndings
have not been replicated and their interpretation
is unclear. Nevertheless, as mentioned earlier, these
in vitro approaches have provided considerable evi-
dence in bipolar disorder for abnormalities affecting
calcium signaling, as well as alterations in mito-
chondrial function, apoptosis, and the circadian
system. Abnormalities are generally greater in the
presence of cellular stressors than at baseline, and
are often normalized by lithium treatment. Reas-
suringly, some of the in vitro ﬁndings are comple-
mented by similar ﬁndings in postmortem brain,
and together provide some clues for novel thera-
peutic targets.147

Most ongoing in vitro medical research now
uses iPSCs and cell reprogramming technologies
to produce (directly or indirectly) neural precur-
sors, neurons of various types, and even brain
organoids. Bipolar disorder is no exception to these
signiﬁcant research advances, although data thus
far remain limited and results modest.148–152 With
regard to therapy, three recent papers are perti-
nent. Yoshimizu et al.152 studied neurons induced
from subjects genotyped for the main bipolar
disorder risk polymorphism in CACNA1C to exam-
ine the expression and function of calcium chan-
nels. Neurons derived from subjects homozygous
for the risk variant expressed more CACNA1C
mRNA and showed enhanced current density, com-
pared to heterozygotes and nonrisk homozygous
subjects. These results suggest that the risk vari-
ants of CACNA1C involve a gain of
function
(see also Ref. 153), and thus strengthen the case,
discussed earlier, that L-type calcium channel antag-
onists might be potential therapeutic agents in bipo-
lar disorder. An alternative experimental design is to
compare cells derived from drug-responsive versus
nonresponsive patients and to help identify the key
molecular pathways and processes that may under-
lie therapeutic responsiveness in vivo. Using this
approach, neurons induced from ﬁbroblasts taken
from lithium responders were found to have greater
adhesiveness than those from nonresponders.148

Harrison et al.

Innovative approaches to bipolar disorder

Mertens et al.151 also showed a different molecular
and functional proﬁle of induced neurons from
bipolar disorder patients according to their lithium
responsiveness in vivo; notably, their data implicated
mitochondrial and calcium signaling abnormalities,
in line with the earlier data of this kind. The indica-
tions from iPSC studies that lithium responsiveness
may reﬂect a pathophysiologically meaningful sub-
type of bipolar disorder complement the increasing
evidence that it also delineates a clinically identi-
ﬁable subtype of the disorder,154 for example, in
terms of symptom proﬁle and family history, and
hence the potential value of biomarkers predictive
of lithium response.155

Although these and other ﬁndings using repro-
grammed cells are very preliminary, the rapid tech-
nical developments in the ﬁeld promise signiﬁcant
advances and increases of scale in the near future,
and the methods are likely to play a central role in
target validation and drug discovery for bipolar dis-
order, as well as in the understanding of its etiology
and pathophysiology.156

Mouse models
The value of rodents for modeling psychiatric dis-
orders and advancing treatment has been increas-
ingly questioned.157 This applies both to genetic
modiﬁcations and to phenotypes produced by
pharmacological or behavioral interventions (e.g.,
amphetamine sensitization, isolation rearing). The
problem is even greater for bipolar phenotype
than, for example, for schizophrenia, since the
animal model ideally needs to recapitulate spon-
taneous ﬂuctuation between states––its deﬁnitive
characteristic––as well as exhibit depressive-like,
manic-like, and psychotic-like phenotypes.158 How-
ever, progress is being made, partly due to a shift in
views about the bipolar phenotype and what is being
modeled,159 and partly due to technical advances in
genetic and neural circuit manipulation of rodents
(for recent examples, see Refs. 160–163).

Perhaps the best known genetic mouse model rel-
evant to bipolar disorder is the Clock(cid:2)19 mouse.
This mouse strain has a mutation in the gene
encoding CLOCK, a key regulator of the circa-
dian system,164 and exhibits a characteristic diurnal
behavioral proﬁle of manic-like (i.e., hyperactive)
activity, with more reward-related and less anx-
ious or depressive features during the light phase,
but normal behavior in the dark. The manic-like

behavior coincides with, and is at least partly caused
by, increased ﬁring of midbrain dopaminergic neu-
rons, as shown using an optogenetic approach.162
Another circadian protein (the nuclear receptor
REV-ERB(cid:2)) is involved in similar mood-related
behaviors and also regulates dopamine.163 Such
ﬁndings argue for a renewed focus on dopamine,
and on circadian rhythms, in the phenotype of bipo-
lar disorder and potentially as targets for treatment.
These examples show how genetically modiﬁed
mice are being used to investigate cellular and
molecular mechanisms contributing to bipolar
disorder–relevant phenotypes, even though the
genes concerned, Clock and Nr1d1 (encoding REV-
ERBa), do not currently show strong genetic associ-
ation with bipolar disorder itself. A complementary
approach is to study mice in which a manipulated
gene locus does show genome-wide association with
bipolar disorder. For example, Leussis et al.161 inves-
tigated ANK3 (Table 1) by examining heterozygous
Ank3+/– mice and by knocking down Ank3 selec-
tively in the dentate gyrus using RNA interference.
Both manipulations led to reduced anxiety and
increased reward motivation compared to wild-
type mice. The Ank3+/– mice also showed greater
stress reactivity, developing more depression-like
behaviors and enhanced corticosterone levels after
chronic stress. Furthermore, the phenotypes were
normalized by chronic administration of lithium.

Conclusions

Bipolar disorder exempliﬁes the challenges and the
opportunities faced by psychiatry as it attempts,
belatedly, to move forward from descriptive psy-
chopathology and serendipitously discovered ther-
apies of limited efﬁcacy and tolerability to a more
valid nosology and treatments that are based on
rational understanding of pathophysiology, the lat-
ter requiring advances in molecular genetics and
neuroscience. Althoug history cautions us to be pru-
dent and not expect fundamental breakthroughs to
be imminent, recent developments across a range
of disciplines have permitted real optimism. Our
discussion above has highlighted several develop-
ments: novel approaches to how the bipolar phe-
notype is conceptualized and measured and the
prospects of linking this phenotype mechanistically
to underlying genetic, molecular, and neural cir-
cuits. A range of new technologies (from remote
biosensors to reprogrammed cells and optogenetics)

and approaches (from big data to mathematical
modeling and experimental medicine) are driving
these developments. In addition to invigorating psy-
chiatric research and bringing cutting-edge neuro-
scientists and other disciplines to bear on these com-
plex problems, these innovative approaches should
encourage the pharmaceutical industry, other com-
mercial partners (including device and software
manufacturers), and funding bodies to invest in
the ﬁeld. The personal burden and substantial
costs of bipolar disorder––to patients, families, and
society––together with the unsatisfactory state of
current interventions and outcomes, provide addi-
tional motivation to ﬁnally break the impasse
regarding how the disorder is understood and
treated. Input is also required from patients them-
selves: research needs their full involvement and
engagement, both through participation and in
advocacy. They know only too well the limitations
of current treatments.
