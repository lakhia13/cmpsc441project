Abstract

Introduction: There is growing support to develop transdiagnostic approaches that

provide new insights into mental health problems and cut across the existing tra-

ditional diagnostic boundaries all over the world. The present study was conducted

to test the transdiagnostic cognitive behavioral therapy (TCBT) approach in treating

patients with common mental health problems and evaluate its effectiveness com-

pared to the current treatment settings of the healthcare system.

Methods: A randomized controlled trial was conducted in Semnan Province, north

of Iran. The study took pace in urban health centers. A sample of 520 Iranian adults,

tested as positive on the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale, were enrolled. Par-

ticipants who received a score above the cut-off point in any of the three mental

health disorders (depression, anxiety, or obsessive compulsive disorder [OCD]) based

on the locally validated study instrument were randomly allocated to the study. The

intervention group received TCBT during eight sessions provided by trained general

health service providers without previous mental health training; the standby control

group received Mental Health Services as Usual (MHSU). The post-test interviews

were conducted using the study instrument after the completion of both group

treatments.

Results: A total of 459 individuals (87.8% female) ultimately entered the study. The

withdrawal rate was 24% (53 participants in the TCBT and 56 in the MHSU). Reduction

in depression, anxiety, and OCD symptoms was significant within each group and when

comparing TCBT and MHSU (mean difference).

Conclusion: This trial recommends that the transdiagnostic CBT approach can

be effective in improving common mental health problems and functions among

“subjects had negative thoughts and worminess. I used relaxation exer-

cises and positive thinking to reduce stress and make the subject aware

of his thoughts”). This process allowed the supervisor to determine

which technique within the component was selected and delivered cor-

rectly. Supervisors provided the reports of the sessions for each case,

and the supervisor asked questions specific to the treatment process

and how they were completed. If errors within a session occurred (e.g.,

failure to complete a step, step delivered incorrectly), the supervisor

coached the counselor to redo this component or step during the fol-

Screening, assessments, and randomization

The enrollment of participants began in December 2018 and ended in

September 2019, considering the intervention sample size. All the indi-

viduals who rated positive in the UHC’s initial mental health screening

using K6 were referred to an assessment GHSP to enter the study. As

the assessment GHSPs were in charge of following up on all the par-

ticipants (intervention and control groups), they were instructed about

the study instruments, pretest and post-test, inclusion and exclusion

criteria, informed consent forms, randomization process, and monitor-

ing of participants by follow-up phone calls. They also completed the

organized participant monitoring forms designed by the research team

in a 2-day training workshop.

After the introduction process and providing information about the

study and its objectives, the assessment GHSPs conducted the screen-

ing interviews using the study instrument. All the participants who

obtained a score at least above the cut-off point for the examined men-

tal health problems were enrolled as the trial group. To participate in

the trial, the subjects had to sign consent forms; if they were illiterate,

the assessment GHSPs read the consent form to them and obtained

2.8

Sample size

To calculate the sample size, a pair-wise comparison was carried out

and the intervention (TCBT) and control (MHSU) conditions were com-

pared on the primary outcomes. The effect size analyses were used to

calculate the sample size and test power. To achieve a moderate effect

size (.50), each arm would need 100 participants. Considering test
power = .80, alpha = .05, a drop-out rate of 20%, and a 1:1 ratio of inter-

vention to control group members, 300 participants were included in
this RCT (n = 150 per group). Given the rates of symptomology in the

target population, the estimates showed that approximately 500 peo-

ple needed to be screened in order to identify 300 eligible and willing

participants.

2.9

Statistical analysis

Univariate descriptive statistics were used to describe the samples.

Bivariate analyses, including the t-tests and chi-square tests, were

applied to examine the association between the potential continu-

ous and categorical confounding variables, respectively, and the group

assignment. The paired-sample t-test was used to compare the mean of

the mental health variables at the end of the intervention compared to

before. This procedure was applied within each group. The changes in

each variable were also calculated as the difference between the values

DISCUSSION

First: TCBT is a flexible method and is used as a suitable approach

for controlling and treating comorbidities with a single approach (Stan-

cliffe et al., 2008). This method teaches us how, when, and to what

extent to treat comorbidities. This method equips GHSPs with skills

that enables them to well manage and treat the patient’s symptoms and

reactions.

Second: TCBT saves time and reduces the resources needed for

training GHSPs; this approach is thus very cost-effective and reduces

the gap in the provision of necessary treatments for mental health

problems by preventing the provision of repetitive training and

expanding the necessary training based on problems.

Third: TCBT can reduce the impact of cultural differences in the

use of standard diagnostic classifications such as DSM-V and ICD-11

(Canino & Alegría, 2008), because identifying problems in its context is

necessary for designing and implementing appropriate interventions,

and TCBT is well capable of these steps. For instance, during a qualita-

tive study, one may encounter mental health problems that are not well

differentiated according to the DSM-V and ICD-11 gold standards; that

is, the choice of treatment based on the conventional methods does not

of the monitoring process. Similar challenges were faced in the study
