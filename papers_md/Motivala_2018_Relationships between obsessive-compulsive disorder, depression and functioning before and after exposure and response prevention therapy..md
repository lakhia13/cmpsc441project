Abstract

Objective—Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is associated with impaired functioning and 
depression. Our aim was to examine relationships between OCD symptoms, depression, and 
functioning before and after exposure and response prevention (ERP), a type of cognitive-
behavioral therapy for OCD, specifically examining whether functioning, depression and other 
cognitive factors like rumination and worry acted as mediators.

Methods—Forty-four individuals with OCD were randomized to four weeks of intensive ERP 
treatment first (n = 23) or waitlist then treatment (n = 21). We used a bootstrapping method to 
examine mediation models.

Results—OCD symptoms, depression and functioning significantly improved from pre- to post-
intervention. Functioning mediated the relationship between OCD symptoms and depression and 
the relationship between functioning and depression was stronger at post-treatment. Depression 
mediated the relationship between OCD symptoms and functioning, but only at post-intervention. 
Similarly, rumination mediated the relationship between OCD symptoms and depression at post-
intervention.

Conclusions—Our findings suggest that after ERP, relationships between depression and 
functioning become stronger. Following ERP, treatment that focuses on depression and 
functioning, including medication management for depression, cognitive approaches targeting 
rumination, and behavioral activation to boost functionality may be important clinical 
interventions for OCD patients.

Objective

Depression is a significant problem in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Of all the 
mental health comorbidities associated with OCD, depression is the most common; more

than 50% of OCD patients meet lifetime criteria for major depressive disorder or dysthymia 
(Ruscio et al. 2010). In approximately 65% of these cases OCD preceded the onset of the 
depressive disorder or they developed in same year. Moreover, depression can significantly 
worsen OCD treatment outcomes (Overbeek et al. 2002). What accounts for this substantial 
comorbidity is not clear: is it the severity of the obsessions and compulsions themselves, the 
profound disruption in functioning, or some combination? With its laborious and often 
embarrassing compulsions paired with intense emotional disruption, OCD exerts profound 
effects on one’s family, friendships, and school and work success and even daily living 
activities. Even after successful treatment for OCD, social impairments often remain: the 
number of individuals with OCD that are celibate, living alone and/or have impaired global 
assessment of functioning scores is considerably higher when compared to the normative 
population (Thomsen 1995). In cross-sectional studies with OCD patients, poor global 
functioning has been significantly associated with increased depressive symptoms 
(Abramowitz et al. 2007). Does OCD exert an effect on depression and is this effect 
mediated by functioning? Are these relationships stable or can they vary, especially when 
individuals get treatment?

Naturalistic cross-sectional studies provide important static images of these relationships, 
whereas prospective studies provide a “time-lapse” perspective, but intervention studies offer 
a unique possibility to uncover dynamic relationships of these variables. For example, when 
treatment results in lessening of OCD symptoms, this affords an opportunity to look at the 
resulting impact on functioning and depression.

Exposure and response prevention (ERP) is a type of CBT for OCD. Compared with 
medication treatments, ERP achieves more rapid therapeutic responses, which persist after 
discontinuation of therapy (Abramowitz 1998). Multiple studies suggest that ERP yields 
larger therapeutic effects than serotonin-reuptake inhibitor medication treatment (Romanelli 
et al. 2014; Skapinakis et al. 2016). Intensive ERP treatment improves not only OCD 
symptoms but reduces depressive symptoms too. Improvements in OCD symptoms seem to 
predict reductions in depressive symptoms during ERP and pharmacotherapy (Meyer et al. 
2014); however, reductions in depressive symptoms do not appear to mediate reductions in 
OCD symptoms (Zandberg et al. 2015). Improvements in depressive symptoms could be 
secondary to improvements in OCD symptoms, and/or improvements in global functioning 
that are themselves the result of lessening of OCD symptoms.

As an exploratory set of mediation analyses, we examined rumination and worry and their 
role in the relationship between OCD symptoms and depression. Rumination plays an 
important contributory role in depression (Nolen-Hoeksema et al. 2008) and is associated 
with OCD diagnosis even after controlling for depressive symptoms (Abramowitz et al. 
2007). Similarly worry is a common symptom across anxiety disorders (Olatunji et al. 2010) 
and in both those with OCD and those with depression (Brown et al. 1992). As noted by 
Clark (Clark 2004), OCD patients often have meta-cognitive beliefs that distressing thoughts 
are meaningful, have detrimental consequences to one’s sense of self and that intrusive 
thoughts can and should be controlled. These beliefs in turn trigger repetitive thinking like 
worrying and ruminating as a potential strategy to manage the distressing thoughts. The 
frequent use of these repetitive thinking strategies may confer a cognitive vulnerability that

might explain how OCD can lead to depression symptoms. We sought to explore whether 
worry and rumination would significantly mediate the connection between OCD symptoms 
and depression pre- vs. post-intervention.

The purpose of the current study was to examine pathways between OCD, depression and 
functioning and to examine whether the nature of these pathways change following 
treatment for OCD. Specifically, we wanted to test the hypothesis that global functioning 
mediates the association between OCD symptoms and depression. We predicted that this 
mediation relationship would be present both prior to and following treatment. Secondarily, 
we rotated this model to test whether depression mediated the relationship between OCD 
and functioning. Lastly, as exploratory analyses, we tested whether rumination and/or worry 
mediated relationships between OCD and depression before and after treatment.

Methods

Participants

Forty-four men and women with OCD between the ages of 18–60 participated in this study 
after providing informed consent. The UCLA Institutional Review Board approved the 
study. Participants were recruited from UCLA clinics, local psychiatrists, psychotherapists, 
flyers, and internet advertisements. To determine diagnostic eligibility, one of the study 
authors and licensed clinician (JDF) conducted detailed structured interviews with each 
potential participant. Primary OCD and comorbid diagnoses were determined using the 
ADIS-IV-Mini (Di Nardo et al. 1994). Participants were eligible if they scored ≥16 on the 
Yale–Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (YBOCS) (Goodman et al. 1989). Comorbid 
anxiety disorders were allowed as long as OCD was the primary diagnosis. Comorbid major 
depressive disorder (MDD), dysthymic disorder, or depressive disorder not otherwise 
specified was allowed, but individuals were excluded if the ADIS-IV clinical significance 
rating was 6 or higher (severe).

Exclusion criteria included: 1) a lifetime diagnosis of psychotic disorder, bipolar disorder, 
lifetime substance dependence, or pervasive developmental disorder; 2) current diagnoses of 
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, primary diagnosis of hoarding disorder, or any 
current comorbid psychiatric or medical condition that would have warranted immediate 
initiation of treatment that could interfere with study treatment; 3) severe OCD that 
warranted immediate inpatient psychiatric intervention; 4) currently consuming more than 7 
units of alcohol per week; 5) prior treatment of more than 30 hours of CBT as part of an 
outpatient, inpatient, residential or intensive program that included exposure, response 
prevention, in session exposure, and development of a hierarchy; 6) IQ < 80 on Wechsler 
abbreviated scales of intelligence; 7) being currently pregnant; 8) medications for medical 
conditions that have psychoactive properties (e.g. thyroid hormone); 9) and because all 
individuals also participated in a neuroimaging study, presence of metal or electronic 
implants in the body.

Regarding medication use, individuals were excluded if they were taking any class of 
medication other than serotonin-reuptake inhibitors (SRIs, including clomipramine); if on an 
SRI, individuals had to be on a stable dose for at least 12 weeks. Use of anxiety medications

treatment when exposures were conducted.

Procedures

Intervention

This study was a randomized waitlist control trial of CBT, specifically ERP combined with 
neuroimaging assessments pre- and post-treatment, which have previously been described 
(Feusner et al. 2015; O’Neill et al. 2016). OCD patients were randomized to either a 
treatment first or waitlist first condition. In the latter condition, participants waited for four 
weeks and then received ERP. Treatment period was for four weeks for both groups. There 
were three assessment points in the study. At time 1, all participants received the battery of 
measures. After 4 weeks, at time 2, treatment-first participants received their post treatment 
assessment and waitlist first participants received their post waitlist assessment. The waitlist 
first group then received treatment and post treatment assessment at time 3. The study also 
included standardized assessment in a non-OCD, healthy control group assessed at time 1 
and time 2, but these data are not reported in the current paper.

Participants received 90-minute sessions of ERP treatment 5 days a week for 4 weeks. Two 
licensed therapists provided treatment using a manualized approach (Kozak and Foa 1997a; 
Kozak and Foa 1997b). Both had received 3 or more years of specialty training in the UCLA 
OCD Intensive Treatment Program under the supervision of JDF and other senior therapists 
in addition to 3 or more years of training in outpatient ERP for OCD.

Treatment quality assurance

Therapy sessions of participants who provided consent (61%) were videotaped and an 
independent evaluator (also a trained ERP therapist with 8 years experience treating OCD) 
rated all sessions for quality assurance, including adherence to the treatment manual and 
overall quality of the session. Average treatment adherence was rated at 97.7% and average 
quality of sessions was rated at 9.96 (0 to 10).

Assessments

Interview Measures—An independent evaluator not involved in treatment or initial 
assessment carried out all interviews. The YBOCS (Goodman et al. 1989) is a semi-
structured clinical interview for assessing symptom severity in OCD. The measure has ten 
items, scored 0 to 4 resulting in a range of scores from 0–40 points. Its items assess distress, 
frequency, interference and resistance to obsessions and compulsions. The YBOCS is a 
widely used severity measure in clinical trials with OCD patients (Benito and Storch 2011). 
A number of clinical trials have set a minimum of 16 for inclusion criteria, and scores 
between 20–29 reflecting moderate symptoms, 30–40 reflecting severe symptoms (Ruscio et 
al. 2010). For depressive symptom severity, we used the Montgomery-Asberg Depression 
Rating Scale (MADRS), a ten-item interview with scores that range from 0–60 
(Montgomery and Asberg 1979). The MADRS is an oft used assessment in clinical trials 
with good sensitivity to changes in symptoms (McDowell 2006). Scores below 6 suggest 
absence of depression, 7–19 reflect mild depression and scores from 20–34 representing

moderate depression; scores above 35 on this measure are suggestive of severe depression 
(Snaith and Taylor 1985). To measure anxiety we used the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA) 
(Hamilton 1959). The HAMA is used to measure anxiety severity across different anxiety 
disorders. It has 14 items and scores range from 0–56. Scores are summed to form a total 
with scores between 0 and 5 representing little/no anxiety; 6 to 14 suggests mild anxiety, and 
scores of 15 or higher indicate severe anxiety (Hamilton 1959). We used the Global 
Assessment Scale (GAS) as our measure of general functioning and social and occupational 
performance (Endicott et al. 1976). The GAS ranges in scores from 0–100, with scores 
above 81 reflecting good or superior functioning in social, occupational, or school settings, 
71–80 representing slight impairments, 61–70 representing some difficulties in functioning, 
51–60 representing moderate impairments, 41–50 serious impairments, 11–40 a range of 
gross to major impairments.

Self-Report measures—We used the Penn State Worry Questionnaire (PSWQ) (Meyer 
et al. 1990), and The Ruminative Responses Scale (RRS) (Treynor et al. 2003) as estimates 
of cognitive processes involved in both OCD and depression. The PSWQ is a 16-item 
questionnaire of worry, with scores ranging from 16–80. Higher scores indicate greater 
tendency to worry with scores above 60 indicating severe anxiety. Brown and colleagues 
found that mentally healthy controls had a mean score of 35 and OCD patients had a score 
of 60 (Brown et al. 1992). The RSS is a 22-item measure of rumination, defined as a process 
of repetitively attending to the symptoms, possible causes and consequences of one’s 
distress (Treynor et al. 2003). Higher scores indicate more rumination; scores can range 
from 22–88 and in a normative sample, mean scores on the RSS were 42 for women and 40 
for men (Nolen-Hoeksema et al. 1999).

Statistical Analyses

In our statistical approach we examined demographic and baseline psychometric differences 
between the treatment first and the waitlist first groups using one-way Analysis of Variance 
(ANOVA). Next, we conducted a 2 x 2 repeated measures ANOVA examining clinical 
outcomes, with group (treatment first, waitlist first) as the between-group factor and time 
(time 1, time 2) as the within-group factor. At time 1 both groups received a baseline 
assessment and at time 2 the treatment first group had just finished the ERP intervention and 
the waitlist first group had just completed its waiting period. Our outcome measures were 
YBOCS, MADRS, GAS, HAMA, PSWQ, and RRS.

We analyzed mediation at two time points: baseline and post treatment. We pooled data from 
both groups at time 1 (pre-intervention), and time 2 for the intervention first group and time 
3 for the waitlist first group (post-intervention). Only the waitlist first group received a time 
3 assessment, occurring after they underwent the treatment protocol after the initial waiting 
period between times 1 and 2. We used Hayes’s method of ordinary least squares regression 
(OLSR)-based path analysis for mediation analyses via the SPSS PROCESS macro, which 
includes bootstrap-based confidence intervals calculation (Hayes 2013; Hayes and 
Rockwood 2016). In this approach, the direct effect of X (the predictor variable) on Y (the 
outcome variable) and indirect effect of X on Y through M (mediator) were calculated. 
There was significant mediation if a) total effect of X on Y (direct effect of X on Y +

effect in total effect (indirect effect of X on Y through M) was significant. In PROCESS, the 
indirect effect is significant if the range between the lower and upper limits of the 
confidence interval did not include zero. For all mediation analyses, bias-corrected 
confidence intervals were determined using bootstrapping method implemented in 
PROCESS macro based on 10,000 bootstrap samples.

The specific mediation analyses tested whether: 1) GAS mediated the relationship between 
YBOCS and MADRS, at pre-intervention and post-intervention (our hypothesis); 2) 
MADRS mediates the relationship between YBOCS and GAS (termed the “rotated model”). 
Lastly, as exploratory analyses, we examined whether RSS and/or PSWQ mediate the 
relationship between YBOCS and MADRS.

Results

Demographics & Intervention effects

Table 1 presents basic demographic and psychometric information. Table 2 represents the 
percentages of participants with specific comorbid diagnoses. Of the total sample, 15 had 
one comorbid disorder, 8 had two comorbid disorders, and 6 had three or more comorbid 
disorders. Also of the total sample, 11 had a comorbid depressive disorder and 22 had one or 
more comorbid anxiety disorders. There were significant time effects for YBOCS, MADRS, 
GAS, HAMA, PSWQ and RSS scores, as indicated in Table 3. From pre- to post-
intervention, scores significantly improved for each of these variables.

GAS as mediator between YBOCS and MADRS scores

At pre-intervention, our mediation analysis was significant; total effect value = .83, p = .
0053. GAS significantly mediated the effect of YBOCS on MADRS; indirect effect value = 
0.46. The range of the lower and upper confidence intervals did not include zero, indicating 
that the indirect effect was significant; the lower level for confidence interval (LLCI) was 
0.01 and the upper level for confidence interval (ULCI) was 0.89.

Similarly, at post-intervention, GAS was a significant mediator. The total effect was 
significant (effect value = 1.08, p < .0001) and the indirect effect was significant as well 
(effect value = .18, LLCI = 0.01 and ULCI = 0.47)

MADRS as a mediator between YBOCS and GAS

Next, we rotated our model such that GAS became our outcome variable and MADRS 
became our mediator. At pre-intervention, MADRS was not a significant mediator. The total 
effect was significant (effect value = −1.07, p < .0001) but the indirect effect was not (effect 
value = −0.21, LLCI = −0.68 and ULCI = 0.00).

However, at post-intervention MADRS was a significant mediator. The total effect was 
significant (effect value = −1.05, p = .003) and the indirect effect was significant (effect 
value = −0.49; LLCI = −0.96, ULCI = −0.1).

Exploratory mediational analyses: cognitive processes of rumination and worry

We next wanted to examine rumination (measured with the RRS) and worry (measured with 
the PSWQ) as potential mediators between YBOCS and MADRS. In this sample, data 
collection for these measures started after the project was already underway, and as such, we 
had data for a smaller sample: RRS n = 34; PWSQ n = 29.

For RSS, at pre-intervention there was no significant mediation effect. The total effect of 
YBOCS and RSS on MADRS was not significant (effect value = .21, p = .42). At post-
intervention however, RSS was a significant mediator. The total effect was significant (effect 
value = 1.14, p = .0001) as was the indirect effect (effect value = .21, LLCI = .0019, ULCI 
= .693).

For PSWQ, at pre-intervention there was no significant mediation. The total effect was 
significant (effect value = .69, p = .04) but the indirect effect was not (effect value = −.007, 
LLCI = −.318, ULCI = .065). At post-intervention there was no significant mediation. 
Similar with pre-intervention, the total effect was significant (effect value = 1.16, p < .0001) 
but the indirect was not (effect value = −.003, LLCI = −.120, ULCI = .076).

Post hoc analyses of pairwise relationship changes from pre- to post-treatment

Due to the observation that the mediation models involving YBOCS, MADRS, and GAS 
changed from pre- to post-treatment, we explored whether the pairwise relationships 
between these variables significantly changed across these time points. We used linear 
mixed models with MADRS as the dependent variable, time point as the repeated measure; 
subject as the random factor; and time point (pre- and post-treatment), GAS, and the 
interaction between time point and GAS as the fixed effects. There was a significant 
interaction between time point and GAS (F1 54.35 = 4.72, p = .034). The strength of the 
relationship between GAS and MADRS was stronger post-treatment than pre-treatment (t = 
2.17, p = .034). We repeated the analysis with YBOCS instead of GAS, but found no 
significant interaction between time point and YBOCS (F1 54.00 = 1.08, p = .30); neither was 
there a significant interaction effect when GAS was the dependent variable and YBOCS the 
predictor (F1 51.83 = 1.71, p = .20).

We conducted similar analyses to examine whether the RRS showed different strengths of 
relationships depending on time point, but found no significant interaction effect for 
MADRS (F1 49.55 = .46, p = .50) or for YBOCS (F1 41.41 = .15, p = .70). Thus, only the 
relationship between GAS and MADRS significantly changed, becoming significantly 
stronger post-treatment compared to pre-treatment.

Medication status

Fourteen of the 44 participants were taking serotonin reuptake inhibitor medications, which 
can influence both OCD and depression symptoms (the medication status and doses were 
required to be the same pre-treatment and post-treatment). We therefore repeated all 
analyses using medication status as a covariate, but found no significant effects of 
medication status (all p’s > .05) and no significant changes in the overall mediation or 
regression models.

Conclusion

Page 8

The effectiveness of ERP in treating OCD in our study was consistent with the literature. 
CBT led to a 41% reduction in YBOCS scores and significant reductions in depressive 
(MADRS) and general anxiety symptoms (HAMA), worrying (PSWQ), and global 
functioning (GAS). MADRS scores fell as well but scores were in the mild range to begin 
with, likely because we deliberately excluded individuals with ADIS-IV depressive 
symptom clinical significance ratings of 6 or higher (indicative of severe depressive 
symptoms). Functioning scores shifted from the moderate to mild range at post-treatment.

In our study, functioning mediated the relationship between OCD symptoms and depression 
both before and after treatment. This suggests that OCD symptoms can both directly impact 
depression and indirectly do so by impairing functioning. The mediating effect of 
functioning held up even after four weeks of five days per week ERP. Thus, functioning 
clearly seems to play a role in affecting depression. Clinicians could use this indirect 
pathway as an additional treatment target –specifically addressing deficits in functioning. 
Behavioral activation is a type of behavior therapy typically carried out in patients with 
unipolar depression; it is a treatment approach that focuses on increased functional activity 
as a strategy to reduce depressive symptoms (Dimidjian et al. 2006).

When we rotated our model so that functioning was the outcome and depression was the 
mediator, we found that depressive symptoms mediated the relationship between OCD 
symptoms and functioning at post-intervention, but not initially at pre-intervention. These 
results suggest that even mild, post-ERP residual depressive symptoms impact level of 
functioning in OCD. Depressive symptoms commonly arise after the onset of OCD 
symptoms (Rasmussen and Tsuang 1986; Ruscio et al. 2010). Prevalence of depressive 
symptoms ranges from 21–50% of OCD patients (Abramowitz 2004) and depressive 
symptoms typically correlate strongly with OCD in the range of Pearson correlations of r = .
60 (Goodman et al. 1989). It seems reasonable for clinicians to focus on applying ERP to 
reduce OCD symptoms with the expectation that depressive symptoms will follow suit. This 
appeared to be the case in our sample; OCD and depressive symptoms and functioning all 
improved. However, the nature of the relationships between functioning and OCD and 
depressive symptoms changed following treatment; the strength of the relationship between 
functioning and depression increased at post-treatment when OCD symptoms were reduced. 
This raises the question of targeting both depression and functioning following ERP-related 
improvements in OCD symptoms. Specifically, this could include behavioral activation to 
boost functionality and depressive symptoms, cognitive approaches targeting depressive 
thought patterns, and emphasizing medication management for depressive symptoms.

Cognitive approaches integrated with ERP have evidence of success in improving distress 
tolerance, reducing OCD symptom-related dysfunctional beliefs, and reducing dropout rates 
(Mckay et al. 2015). Behavioral activation is a viable treatment in depressive disorders 
(Cuijpers et al. 2007) but has not been examined in the context of anxiety disorders. 
Medication management for depression in OCD appears to be an important treatment option, 
but few studies have addressed the effects on depressive symptom improvement in OCD 
with medication management. Those that have, have had small sample sizes (Abramowitz

2004). It is important to note that although about 32% of our sample was taking serotonin 
reuptake inhibitors, which are first-line treatments for both OCD and for depression, 
medication status did not affect the results of the mediation analyses. Thus, although some 
of the individuals on medications could have received partial benefit for OCD and/or 
depressive symptoms prior to the study, this did not appear to affect the inherent 
relationships between OCD, depression, and functioning. Those who had obtained more 
substantial benefits from medications could have been screened out for not meeting the 
inclusion criteria of YBOCS ≥ 16; it is therefore still possible that medications could change 
these relationships in some individuals.

ERP led to significant reductions in two measures of repetitive, problematic thinking styles – 
worry and rumination. For worry, baseline levels of the PSWQ were similar to other studies 
with OCD patients (Brown et al. 1992). Although scores fell by approximately 14%, from 
65 to 56, post intervention scores were still elevated in contrast to published scores for 
normative data (Brown et al. 1992). In contrast, rumination, measured with the RSS, was 
modestly elevated at baseline and fell to levels similar to those found in a normative sample 
(Nolen-Hoeksema et al. 1999).

Exploratory mediation analyses indicated that rumination was a mediator between OCD 
symptoms and depression but only at post-intervention. Worry was not a significant 
mediator of depressive symptoms either before or after the intervention. Our findings on 
rumination suggest that before treatment, when symptom severity is higher across the board, 
functioning is an important mediating variable between OCD symptoms and depression; 
however when individuals are improved following intensive treatment, rumination emerges 
as a mediator linking OCD and depressive symptoms. ERP does not overtly target 
depressive ruminating. In our sample, the tendency to ruminate did improve to levels seen in 
normative samples. These exploratory analyses suggest that when OCD symptoms are lower, 
rumination influences the relationship between OCD and depressive symptoms. If patients 
continue with outpatient (less frequent) therapy after completing intensive ERP, their 
tendency to ruminate may be an important intervention target to help further reduce 
depression. These conclusions should be framed with awareness that our sample was small 
and that only a subsample of participants received the rumination and worry questionnaires.

There are important caveats and limitations to this study. Our aim in this study was to 
identify if functioning, and other cognitive variables, play important contributory roles to the 
relationship between OCD symptoms and depression. Our preliminary findings suggest that 
they do. However, there are a number of caveats to our findings. Our study had a small 
sample size (N=44) and our analyses were post-hoc and were not built into the design of the 
study. Although our study had two time points, our mediation analyses were cross-sectional 
and conclusions regarding causal pathways should include awareness of this limitation. 
Future studies using additional time points, perhaps at mid-intervention, will be useful in 
corroborating our findings. Our intervention did not explicitly test treatment that was 
constructed to address functioning or rumination. In the future, comparing treatment arms 
that include medication management specific for depression, or behavioral activation or 
CBT targeting rumination in combination with ERP would be informative. Future studies

that do so would provide more direct evidence for routing the interplay between these 
variables.

A limitation that potentially affects the generalizability of the results is that we excluded 
individuals if their comorbid depressive disorder was rated severe or higher, or it was the 
primary diagnosis rather than OCD, in order to minimize the impact of severe depression on 
brain function and structure given that all participated in a neuroimaging study. This may 
have affected the composition of our sample with respect to comorbid depression, as eight 
individuals (18.2%) met criteria for MDD, while eleven (25%) met criteria for any 
depressive disorder. This is slightly lower than other studies of current depressive disorder 
comorbidity in OCD, which have found rates of 22.4 to 32% for MDD (Overbeek et al. 
2002) and 37% for any depressive disorder (Perugi et al. 1997). Thus, it is unknown if the 
current relationships found in this study among depression, OCD symptoms, and functioning 
would generalize to samples with a higher percentage of comorbid MDD, and/or more 
severe depressive symptoms. In addition, our study did not assess whether depressive 
symptoms developed prior to, or secondary to, their OCD symptoms. It is possible that 
depression that is secondary to OCD will remit more readily following ERP, but that primary 
depression may not. Few studies exist on this specific question and our findings strongly 
urge us to explore the interplay of OCD and depressive symptoms more thoroughly.

Also limiting generalizability to other treatment settings is the fact that we tested the effects 
of intensive ERP – 5 days per week for 4 weeks – whereas ERP in some clinical settings is 
delivered weekly or twice weekly, over several months. Whether the current findings would 
also be observed with less intensive ERP remains to be studied; however one might predict 
that once or twice weekly treatment that is spread out over a longer total number of weeks 
might allow more time for general functioning to gradually improve, as well as depression, 
and the relationships among these and OCD symptoms potentially could evolve and change. 
Another consideration regarding generalizability is that only 32% of the current sample was 
taking a medication for OCD, which is lower than that found in other clinical samples in the 
U.S. (e.g. 83.5% (Patel et al. 2014) and 93% (Blanco et al. 2006). Again, whether the 
relationships described in the current study would hold for OCD patients in general remains 
to be studied. Because the most commonly prescribed medications for OCD, SRIs, also 
reduce symptoms of depression, it is possible that the relationships between depression, 
OCD symptoms and functioning may be similar to our post-treatment findings.

In conclusion, our findings suggest that the relationship between OCD, functioning and 
depressive symptoms are not static. They clearly change over the course of treatment and as 
such, there may be important key time points that specific interventions that go beyond ERP 
and focus on functioning and depression may be beneficial for OCD patients.

Key Points

The relationships between OCD symptoms, depression and functioning shift from 
pre- to post-treatment.

Functioning mediated the relationship between OCD and depressive symptoms 
both pre- and post-intervention. Post hoc analyses indicated the relationship 
between functioning and depression was stronger at post-intervention.

Depression was a mediator of OCD and functioning, but only at post intervention.

More fully integrating approaches that focus on depression and functioning, 
including medication management for depression, cognitive approaches targeting 
depressive thought patterns, and behavioral activation to boost functionality may 
be important clinical interventions for OCD patients, especially after ERP 
treatment.
