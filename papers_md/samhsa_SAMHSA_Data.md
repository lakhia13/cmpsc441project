Mental Health Client-Level Data (MH-CLD) and the Mental Health Treatment Episode Data Set (MH-TEDS) provide data from state mental health agencies. This includes information on mental health diagnoses and also treatment outcomes, demographics, and substance use characteristics for individuals in mental health treatment services that report to state administrative data systems.

NSDUH measures the use of illegal drugs, prescription drugs, alcohol, tobacco, and misuse of prescription drugs. It also measures substance use disorders and mental health care. Estimates are provided at the national, state, and local level and can be used to follow trends in substance use and mental health..

The Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN) is a nationally representative public health surveillance system that monitors drug-related visits to hospital emergency departments (ED). DAWN is used to monitor trends in substance use and misuse, emerging new substances and combinations, as well as to estimate the impact of substance use on the nation’s healthcare system. Data for ED visits include demographics, substances involved, toxicology confirmation, route of administration, type of case, and disposition of the patient following their visit.

The Treatment Episode Data Set–Admissions (TEDS-A) is a national data system of annual admissions to substance use treatment facilities. Some states report only publicly funded admissions, while other states collect privately funded admissions from facilities that receive public funding. The data include demographics on all available admissions for clients ages 12 and over as well as substance use characteristics such as substances used, age at first use, and route of use.

The Treatment Episode Data Set–Discharges (TEDS-D) reports information on annual discharges from substance use treatment facilities. Some states report only publicly funded admissions, while other states collect privately funded admissions from facilities that receive public funding. The data include demographics on all available admissions for clients ages 12 and over as well as substance use characteristics such as substances used, age at first use, and route of use.

State mental health agencies (SMHAs) use the Uniform Reporting Systems (URS) to compile and report annual data as part of SAMHSA’s Community Mental Health Services Block Grant. URS is part of an effort to use data in decision support and planning in public mental health systems and in supporting program accountability.

The N-SUMHSS provides information about the number and characteristics of public and private substance use and mental health treatment facilities nationwide. The N-SUMHSS replaced the National Survey of Substance Abuse Treatment Services (N-SSATS) and the National Mental Health Services Survey (N-MHSS) in 2021. Questions were combined for substance use and mental health facilities to reduce burden on the facilities, optimize government resources to collect data, and enhance the quality of data collected.
