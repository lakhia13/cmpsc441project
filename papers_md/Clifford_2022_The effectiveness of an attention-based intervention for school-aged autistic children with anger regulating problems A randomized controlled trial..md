Abstract
Anger regulation is a challenge for children with autism spectrum disorders
(ASD). We investigated if attention-based cognitive behavioral treatment, based
on mindfulness cognitive therapy (MBCT) and dialectical behavior therapy
(DBT), reduces aggressive behavior and improves anger coping in school-aged
autistic children (n = 51). Children were randomized to an active-control or a
treatment condition. The treatment included nine weekly sessions attention-based
individual therapy. Parents in both conditions received three weekly psychoeduca-
tion group sessions to heighten awareness of expressed emotion (EE). For aggres-
sive behavior, treatment reduced temper tantrums and arguing. No effect was
found on destroying things and physical violence. For anger coping, treatment
increased adaptive coping strategies of diffusion and social support seeking, but
had no effect on assertion, rumination, and maladaptive coping direct anger out
and avoidance. Treatment did not impact secondary outcome measures concern-
ing children’s quality of life (QoL) and parental stress-levels and psychological
well-being. In conclusion, school-aged autistic children are able to acquire self-
regulation skills reducing temper tantrums and arguing and increasing the use of
adaptive anger coping strategies. The intervention shows potential to improve
behavior and regulation, but little transfer to other domains. Limitations and
future directions involving the child’s social environment, including parents, sib-
lings, and teachers are discussed.

Lay Summary
Children on the autism spectrum often show aggressive behavior. Treatment can
train children to be more aware of their emotions. This study found that this can
help reducing temper tantrums and arguing and increasing some coping skills,
though no impact was found on several other domains of aggression and coping.

INTRODUCTION

Aggressive behavior problems are estimated to occur in
25% to 68% of children and adolescents with autism spec-
(Hill et al., 2014; Kanne &
trum disorders (ASD)
Mazurek, 2011). Treatments for aggression in ASD

commonly include behavioral
interventions. However,
recent evidence suggests that a focus on the awareness of
anger may also be effective. In this study we describe the
effects of treatment for aggression in children with ASD,
based on a combination of dialectical behavior therapy
(DBT); focused on shifting and controlling attention

Aggression in autistic children is typically triggered
by withholding
activities
(Kanne & Mazurek, 2011; Reese et al., 2005; Samson
et al., 2014; Sofronoff et al., 2007), and amplified by
aggressive rumination (Patel et al., 2017), which can co-
occur with hostility, verbal- and physical aggression
(Ibrahim et al., 2019). Tension within the family system
adds
to these typical autistic anger-eliciting factors
(Bader & Barry, 2014). The attitude of family members
toward an individual, referred to as Expressed Emotion,
EE, can be critical, hostile, or overprotective in nature.
The critical and hostile variants of EE, when, for exam-
ple, parents keep telling the child “You never listen!” or
“You are selfish!,” relate to increasingly severe externaliz-
ing problems over time in autistic children (Bader &
Barry, 2014). This can be a heavy burden for family
members: behavior problems and temper tantrums are
linked to high levels of stress in mothers of autistic chil-
dren (McStay et al., 2014).

Historically, anger and aggression treatments in autis-
tic children did not directly target self-regulation, but
relied on reinforcement techniques, and pharmacological
interventions. This was found to improve behavior, but
only in specific contexts. Moreover, medication such as
risperidone and aripiprazole can be effective, but comes
with
(Carr &
Horner, 2007; Fung et al., 2016; Goel et al., 2018; Wong
et al., 2015). Targeting self-regulation may be an efficient
and less intrusive strategy to reduce aggressive behavior.
Self-regulation is an important skill since it helps autistic
children to attain their goals independently from external

et al., 2011). Regulating an emotional state like anger,
compromises a situation (e.g., “My brother sits in my
favorite chair”),—attention (e.g., “I keep watching him
to leave”)—appraisal
and keep telling him he has

chair”)—sequence. A person can influence his or her

emotions
(Gross, 2015). Where classic cognitive-behavioral pro-
grams for autistic children focus strongly on appraisal,
aiming to alter dysfunctional thought patterns (Chalfant
et al., 2007; Roeyers et al., 2011; Sofronoff et al., 2007;
White et al., 2009; White et al., 2010; Wood et al., 2009),
CBT approaches such as MBCT and DBT, focus mainly
on attention, by choosing a new attentional focus within
a difficult situation.

Autism is linked to rigidity and reduced perspective-
taking skills. Children with ASD often show difficulty in
the spontaneous and independent generation of cognitive
reappraisal strategies (Conner et al., 2019; Luiselli, 2014;
Samson et al., 2015). Moreover, when an autistic child is

on the verge of a temper tantrum this calls for simple
tools. These tools might include some of the essential
components of both DBT and MBCT: awareness of
one’s emotional state, moving away from the anger-
provoking situation, shift attention to less aversive stim-
uli and modulate the response by applying self-soothing
methods (Baer, 2014; Linehan, 2014; Segal et al., 2013).
Interventions based on DBT and MBCT seem promising
in reducing emotion dysregulation problems and symp-
toms of depression and anxiety in the adult ASD popula-
tion (Hartmann et al., 2019; Spek et al., 2013) and
improve externalizing problems, attention problems,
emotional well-being, emotion regulation strategies,
depression, and anxiety in children (Conner et al., 2019;
Ridderinkhof et al., 2018; Tanksale et al., 2020). To date,
however, only one small-scaled study (n = 3), using foot
sole-meditation effectively as a way of shifting attention,
was targeted directly at aggression (Singh et al., 2011).

In the current study, we investigated the effectiveness
of an attention-based intervention tailored to aggressive
behavior problems and the use of anger coping strategies
of school-aged autistic children with anger regulation
problems. Using a randomized controlled trial (RCT),
children were allocated to the attention-based treatment
in combination with parental psychoeducation group ses-
sions to heighten awareness of EE (treatment group) or
to the same parental psychoeducation only (active con-
trol group). Expected primary treatment effects were a
reduction of aggressive behavior problems and an
increase in the use of adaptive anger coping strategies as
well as a decreased use of maladaptive anger coping strat-
egies. Expected secondary effects were an improvement
of the child’s emotional, behavioral functioning and qual-
ity of life (QoL), a reduction of parental stress, and an
increase in their psychological well-being. Informants
were children, parents, and teachers.

METHOD

Participants

Fifty-one children aged 8–13 years, were included in this
study during the time of treatment at two centers for
child mental health: De Bascule and Praktijk Wei43, both
based in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. The majority of
them were Dutch and came from middle to high-SES
households (Table 1). All children attended schools that
require average IQ levels. Although the sample showed
some ethnic diversity, children from immigrant families
were underrepresented. This is typical for children receiv-
ing mental health services in the Netherlands (Verhulp
et al., 2013).

All children had a primary diagnosis of ASD and
were not excluded if comorbid attention deficits such as
ADHD were present, unless psychotropic medication
was still being set. ASD was diagnosed by experienced

Procedure

Approximately 270 children are annually referred to the
Bascule’s outpatient clinic for ASD and (cid:1)10 children
with ASD to Praktijk Wei43. All children included were
recruited between January 2011 and October 2018. Chil-
dren were randomly assigned to the intervention or con-
trol condition as consent
forms were returned. An
independent researcher randomized children using a digi-
tal random number generator. The randomization out-
come was shared with the study coordinator, who
informed patients about allocation outcome, see flow-
chart Figure 1.

The intervention group received the individual inter-
vention, “Anger Can Go!” (Gevers & Clifford, 2009),
immediately after the parents finished their three parental
psychoeducation group sessions. The control group
received the intervention after 9 weeks. Their parents,
however, followed the same parental sessions. Therefore,

the children in the control group were measured nine
weeks after the parental sessions were over, as were the
children in the treatment group. The therapists who trea-
ted the children and their parents, were all psychologists
trained to apply the “Anger Can Go!” program by senior
clinical psychologists of
the two treatment centers.
Supervision-sessions were included to ensure treatment
fidelity.

intervention

“Anger Can Go!”

The
(Gevers &
Clifford, 2009) was designed to treat anger regulation
problems in autistic children aged 8 to 13 years old. The
intervention consists of nine sessions of 60 min and is
divided in four phases. Phase 1 (Sessions 1, 2): psychoedu-
cation, affect-education, and measuring anger with an
anger-thermometer. This is a self-report scale presented
as the drawing of a thermometer, that allows the child to
indicate his level of anger, as linked to specific bodily and
behavioral representations on a scale from 0 to 3. Phase
2 (Sessions 3, 4): making a functional behavior assessment
(FBA) and taking a time-out at a low anger level
(between 1 and 2 on the scale 0 to 3) to prevent aggressive
outbursts. Phase 3 (Sessions 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9): taking a time-
out at a low anger level (between 1 and 2 on the scale 0 to
3) to prevent aggressive outbursts, shifting attention away
from aversive stimuli, to cope with the stress of the anger-
provoking situation. Phase 4 (Sessions 8, 9): creating solu-
tions to cope with an anger-provoking situation.

Elements from DBT (attention control, distraction,
and shifting attention away from aversive stimuli) and
MBCT (foot sole/walking meditation, drawing medita-
tion, watching-meditation, listening meditation, and sep-
arating facts from judgements) and shifting attention to
trivializing self-talk (e.g., “It’s no big deal, next time I
could win,” “My brother means no harm, he’s just a tod-
dler”) are trained during Phase 3 and 4 to make shifting
(Baer, 2014;
attention and hence diffusion easier
Dodge & Petit, 2003; Linehan, 2014; Segal et al., 2013).
Anger-thermometer registrations are made on a daily
basis. Importantly, the time-out is not used as a punish-
ment procedure forced upon the child by the parents or
teachers, but is a self-regulation tool. During time-out the
child engages in mindful activities also called concentra-
tion exercises, that elicit positive feelings that calm him
down and may coincide with his preoccupations.

In the intervention, a boy named Bob acts as a pro-
tagonist and role model, he is a child that quickly
becomes angry. The sessions are centered around stories
and pictures about Bobs aggressive behavior. Bob is not
always having anger management problems, but has
“ordinary moments,” when he is happily engaging in his
hobbies. By having the child register its own “ordinary
Bob-moments” throughout
it becomes
aware of its competence and its relaxed moments.

Primary outcome measures

Aggressive behavior problems
QSB: The Questionnaire Social Behavior (QSB), is a par-
ent or teacher questionnaire especially developed for this
study with items focused on behavioral and emotion reg-
ulation problems typical for autistic children. The scale
“Aggressive Behavior Problems” comprises the subscales
Arguing, Temper tantrums, Destroying things, and Phys-
ical violence and was used to identify the frequency,
intensity, and duration of the various aggressive behavior
problems. The internal consistency of the QSB was calcu-
lated for the mother, father, and teacher. For both par-
ents the QSB had excellent reliability (Cronbach’s alpha
parents = 0.91), for the teacher the reliability was rather
questionable (Cronbach’s alpha teacher = 0.68).
CBCL: The Child Behavior Checklist

(CBCL;
Verhulst et al., 1996). The CBCL is a checklist filled out
by parents, to identify emotional and behavioral prob-
lems in children and adolescents. The 2001 revision of the
CBCL/6–18 (original version in English) has good test–
retest reliability and internal consistency and strong
criterion-related validity (Achenbach & Rescorla, 2001).
The CBCL contains eight syndrome scales: anxious/
depressed, depressed, somatic complaints, social prob-
lems,
rule-
thought problems, attention problems,
breaking behavior, and aggression. In this study, the
scale aggression was used as a primary outcome measure
(Achenbach & Rescorla, 2001).

TRF: Teacher rated outcome measures were obtained
by the Teacher Rating Form, a teacher version of the
CBCL (TRF; Achenbach & Rescorla, 2001). The 2001
revision of the TRF (original version in English) has
good test–retest reliability and internal consistency and
strong criterion-related validity. In this study, the scale of
aggression was used as a primary outcome measure
(Achenbach & Rescorla, 2001).

Anger coping strategies
BARQ-C: The behavioral anger response questionnaire
for children, the BARQ-C, (Miers et al., 2007) was used
to establish anger coping strategies. Both the parent and
child version of this measure were used. There are six
BARQ coping strategies. Two of them are considered
maladaptive: Direct anger-out (expressing anger aggres-
sively), avoidance (react passively and/or suppress anger).
Three are adaptive: Assertion (constructively express
one’s anger or create a solution), diffusion (deflecting the
anger to another stimulus or activity), and social support-
seeking (finding support from a friend or relative). The
sixth BARQ strategy, Rumination, taps the tendency to
cope with one’s anger by repeatedly deliberating over its
cause. The BARQ-C, demonstrated good internal consis-
tency
(Miers
and
et al., 2007).

Secondary outcome measures
PEDS QL: Quality of life (QoL) was measured by the
pediatric quality of life inventory (PEDS QL; Varni
et al., 2001). The PEDS QL consists of four scales: physi-
cal functioning, emotional functioning, social function-
ing, school functioning. Internal consistency reliability
for the Total Scale Score and Psychosocial Health Sum-
mary Score were acceptable for group comparisons
(Varni et al., 2001). This questionnaire was filled out by
the children.

SRS: The Social Responsiveness Scale

(SRS;
Constantino & Gruber, 2005) was used to identify the
presence and extent of social impairment due to autism
symptoms in the child (Roeyers et al., 2011). Reliability
nor construct validity are acceptable, and criterion valid-
ity is excellent (Egberink et al., 2012). This questionnaire
was filled out by the parents.

the PSI, Parental Stress

NOSI-K: Parental stress levels related to raising an
ASD child with anger regulation problems, were estab-
lished by The Nijmeegse Ouderlijke Stress Index-K, the
Parent Domain. The NOSI-K is the short, Dutch ver-
sion of
Index (de Brock
et al., 1992). The NOSI-K is designed to identify which
potential sources of stress within parenting situations
actually are experienced as stressful. For the present
study, the internal consistency, as assessed by Cron-
bach’s alpha was 0.93 for the Parent Domain of the
NOSI-K/PSI.

SCL-90: The

Symptom Checklist-90

(SCL-90;
Arrindell & Ettema, 2005), a relatively brief self-report
questionnaire, is designed to evaluate a broad range of
psychological problems and symptoms of psychopathol-
ogy in adults. It was used to look into parental symptoms
of psychopathology and hence, well-being. The reliability
is acceptable/sufficiently, the construct validity is good,
and the criterion validity is good .

Statistical analysis

All analyses were done using IBM SPSS Statistics (ver-
sion 26). Baseline differences in demographic variables
were tested using chi-square tests and analyses of vari-
ance. To test the effectiveness of the intervention, a
multiple linear regression with posttest scores as the
dependent variable was used. First pretest scores were
added as an independent variable and then treatment
group was added to the model. The change in R-
squared after adding the treatment group into the
model was used as the effect size. Primary and second-
ary outcomes were corrected for multiple testing using
the Bonferroni-correction. The new levels of signifi-
cance were 0.05/10 = 0.005 and 0.05/4 = 0.0125
(shown in the result tables) as 10 and 4 scales were
tested.

RESULTS

Preliminary analyses

Chi-square tests and analyses of variance were used to
test baseline differences in demographic variables (age,
sex, and diagnosis). No significant differences between
the intervention and control group on these variables
were found, nor were there significant differences
between intervention and control group in measures con-
cerning ethnicity and SES of the mothers, nor in SES of
the fathers. Between the intervention and control group
was a significant difference in country of birth of the
fathers, but in both groups the majority of fathers were
born in The Netherlands. The descriptive information of
these demographics is shown in Table 1 and Table 2.
Table 7 shows the average baseline scores and standard
deviations for all outcome measures. Table A1 shows the
correlations among the predictor variables (Appendix A).

Primary outcomes

Aggressive behavior problems

Aggressive behavior problems were reported by parents
and teachers using the QSB. The results of the linear
regression to estimate the effectiveness of the intervention
on aggressive behavior problems using pretest scores and
treatment group as predictor variables, are shown in
Table 3. The intervention did not have a significant effect
on the Aggressive Behavior Problems scale as a whole, as
reported by the parent (R 2 = 0.11, p = 0.036). Further

analyses of the Aggressive Behavior Problems subscales
showed a significant reduction in Temper tantrums
(B = (cid:3)2.84, p = 0.004, R 2 = 0.20). The subscale Arguing
was significantly reduced as well (B = (cid:3)1.60, p = 0.026,
R 2 = 0.13). The subscales Destroying things and Physical
violence showed no significant improvement (Table 5).
Temper tantrums showed a significant reduction in fre-
quency (B = (cid:3)0.939, p = 0.015), duration (B = (cid:3)0.857,
p = 0.024) and intensity (B = (cid:3)0.985, p = 0.011). Argu-
ing showed a significant
reduction in frequency
(B = (cid:3)0.693, p = 0.034) and intensity (B = (cid:3)0.612,
p = 0.029), but not in duration (B = (cid:3)0.309, p = 0.213).
There was no treatment effect found in aggression as

measured by the TRF and CBCL (Table 3).

Anger coping strategies

Anger coping strategies were reported by parents and
children using the BARQ-C (see Table 4). The interven-
tion had a significant effect on the use of adaptive anger
coping strategies as reported by the parents (R 2 = 0.17,
p = 0.001). Children who followed the intervention
showed an increase in the use of adaptive anger regula-
tion strategies compared with children who did not fol-
low the intervention. Further analysis on the level of the
individual strategies shows that this effect was due to an
increase in Diffusion (B = 2.834, p = 0.002) and Social
support-seeking (B = 1.516, p = 0.029) (Table 5). Asser-
tion did not improve (B = 0.723, p = 0.06). The use of
maladaptive strategies Direct Anger-out and Avoidance
did not show a reduction, nor did the use of Rumination
(Table 5).

No effect was found for adaptive strategies nor the
use of maladaptive anger coping strategies Direct Anger-
out and Avoidance or Rumination as reported by the
children themselves.

Secondary outcomes

The predicted increase in child or parent well-being in the
intervention group was not found. Children and parents
in the intervention and control group had similar
improvements in quality of life, social impairment, and
parental stress (Table 6).

DISCUSSION

This study investigated whether an attention-based inter-
vention was effective in reducing aggressive behavior and
increasing adaptive anger coping strategies in autistic
children. For aggressive behavior, the treatment showed
a reduction in temper tantrums and arguing, but not in
destroying things and physical violence. Temper tan-
intensity, and duration
trums decreased in frequency,

strategies diffusion and social support-seeking observed
by the parents. However, assertion did not improve and
no effect was found on rumination nor on the maladap-
tive strategies direct anger-out and avoidance. Children
did not report improvements on the use of anger coping
strategies. Secondary outcomes including Quality of Life,
parental
stress, and subjective well-being were not
affected by the treatment.

The reduction of temper tantrums and arguing could
be related to the time-out procedure, which children initi-
ated themselves, and was generally accepted by the chil-
dren as a rule at low anger levels. This quickly led to de-
escalations. Physical violence and destruction were not
affected, but relatively rare in this outpatient population,
so floor effects should be considered as well. Still, if phys-
ical violence and destruction were present, this occurred
at the highest level of anger when children were disturbed
during time-out by siblings. This is in line with findings
that autistic children can show destructive behavior dur-
ing play and often show bad temper and aggression
towards siblings (Dempsey et al., 2012; Mascha &
Boucher, 2006; Shivers et al., 2019). Including sessions
with siblings about the time-out procedure, could be an
important future implication and might have a positive
effect on preventing physical violence, destruction, and
the duration of arguing.

No treatment related reductions in aggression were
found on the CBCL. An explanation may be that the
CBCL aggression scale contains many items referring to

active oppositional and intentional aggression like “cru-
elty, bullying or meanness to others,” “threatens other
people,” or “teases a lot,” Reducing this kind of behavior
was not trained in the intervention, that mainly targeted
reactional aggression. Teachers did not see improvements
in aggressive behavior problems. In the classroom, the
problem may be that teachers seemed quite reluctant to
allow children to practice the time-out as a self-
management coping strategy, since they were used to
apply the time-out as a punishment procedure. Teachers’
commitment could be heightened by offering more ses-
sions at school. These matters were not analysed in the
current study.

like drawing,

Treatment effects were found for the adaptive anger
coping strategies diffusion and social support-seeking as
observed by the parents. Diffusion refers to the ability to
deflect one’s anger to another object or situation. This
was trained intensively, by taking the self-chosen time-
out, shifting attention, and applying self-soothing con-
centration exercises. The intervention allowed preoccupa-
tions,
reading favorite comic books,
building with lego, or using play-doh to coincide with the
self-soothing concentration exercises. Hence, they may
have served as a strong motivation for taking the time-
out and deflecting attention. Social support seeking was
practiced during role play and homework assignments
during the last phase of the intervention when children
had to find solutions for anger eliciting situations. Similar
to the time-out procedure, getting help from one’s par-
ents and teacher was trained and accepted as a rule at
low anger levels. This way, the intervention apparently
used autistic features such as rule-based learning and
indulging in preoccupations in a positive manner. Chil-
dren seemed to be more aware of their anger, but also of
their pleasant emotions and how to attain them.

Anger rumination did not improve. Next to the pro-
vocative influence of siblings, this might have contributed
to the lack of improvement on assertion and the persis-
tence of the maladaptive coping strategy direct anger out.
Assertion means talking to the anger provoking person in
a calm manner. This requires social skills and letting go

of one’s hostility. Persevering in anger rumination, is not
helpful in accomplishing this. This seems consistent with
the results of a longitudinal study that baseline levels of
worry/rumination predicted externalizing problems later
in life for boys with ASD (Bos et al., 2018). Maybe the
use of some of the maladaptive coping strategies is actu-
ally adaptive for children with ASD. Spek et al. (2013)
did not find a relation between reduction in rumination
and a rise in positive affect in ASD after a mindfulness-
based intervention. The authors suggest that rumination
might be an autistic coping strategy to control complex
social situations, which could be the case for the children
in our study. Seen in this way it is interesting that the use
of avoidance did not diminish either. Avoidance may be
adaptive for autistic children, reflecting the skill of con-
sciously taking a time-out to regain calmness that was
practiced during the intervention.

Eventually, there were no improvements on the child
version of the BARQ-C, measuring anger coping strategy
use. Regarding the difference between children and par-
ents, it was found in general that self-reports of children
and parental reports have a low correlation and that
some self-report measures administered to individuals
with ASD provide information about their psychiatric
condition
(Mazefsky
et al., 2010).

The results of our study are in line with other studies
showing mindfulness-based CBT to be effective in
improving emotion regulation in autistic children, due to
the increase of bodily, emotional and cognitive awareness
(Conner et al., 2019; Ridderinkhof et al., 2018; Singh
et al., 2011). Furthermore, the results seem congruent
with the improvement of executive functioning in autistic
children after a CBT program using mindfulness-based
techniques and yoga, resulting in better inhibition, plan-
(Tanksale
ning,
et al., 2020). In our study parents saw significant
improvements in executing adaptive anger coping strate-
gies that have in common moving away from the anger
provoking person or situation.

The treatment did not improve QoL. This could be
because our QoL measure, the PEDS-QL, focuses mainly
on concrete behavioral aspects and has no separate sub-
scale measuring psychological well-being. Parental stress-
levels were not reduced, nor did their feelings of psycho-
logical well-being improve. Again, coping with parental
stress caused by the child’s aggression was not specifically
trained, but the absence of parental stress reduction may
also reflect stress heightening factors, apart from the
child’s externalizing behavior. These include feelings of
loss and grief after the diagnosis (Fern(cid:2)andez-Alc(cid:2)antara
et al., 2016), or maternal fatigue, which is known to influ-
ence the use of ineffective coping strategies, such as wor-
rying, and increase stress in mothers of autistic children
(Seymour et al., 2013; Zaidman-Zaid et al., 2017). These
factors were unexplored in this study. Offering parents a

mindfulness training could be a useful addition to the
“Anger Can Go!” intervention, since practicing mindful-
ness results in less worrying and better coping skills in
autistic adults and parents of children with ASD
(Ridderinkhof et al., 2018; Spek et al., 2013).

The study had several limitations, aside from the rela-
tively small sample. We found no effect of the parental
psychoeducation sessions on our primary outcome mea-
sures: the child’s aggressive behavior and strategy use. It
would be interesting though, to see if there is an effect of
psychoeducation on levels of EE. This could be analysed
in future studies. Furthermore, a teacher version of the
BARQ-C could have given more information about the
use of anger management strategies in school settings.
Measures of the teacher’s adherence to the intervention
could have given information about processes influencing
effects of the “Anger Can Go!” program in the classroom.
The same goes for measuring therapy adherence of par-
ents and siblings. Finally the fact that we constructed the
QSB especially for this study could be considered as a
limitation.

A major strength of this study is that an RCT design
was used. The fact that the sample size was relatively
small and follow-up measures were not taken is a limita-
tion. Furthermore, the demographic homogeneity of the
sample limits the generalization of the findings to ASD
children from different backgrounds, such as ethnic
minorities or low-SES households.

In conclusion, this study has shown that school-aged
autistic children are able to acquire self-regulation skills
reducing some aspects of aggressive behavior problems,
namely temper tantrums and arguing, and improving the
use of adaptive anger coping strategies as diffusion and
social support seeking. The simplicity of the tools might
make the intervention useful for less verbal ASD popula-
tions. Extending the program with more sessions with the
autistic child and adding extra sessions with parents, sib-
lings, and teachers could create a greater response and
give more insight in the dynamics of physical violence, if
it occurs.

“Anger Can Go”

and

parental

B.1.

| Children’s program

The program contains four phases. Phase 1 (Sessions
1, 2), Phase 2 (Sessions 3, 4), Phase 3 (Sessions 4, 5, 6, 7,
8, 9), Phase 4 (Sessions 8, 9). The topics for the nine ses-
sions are:

Session 1
First basic session about emotion dysregulation.
(In the two basic emotion dysregulation sessions both
anger and anxiety are analysed, after that, the choice is
made to continue with one of the modules [Anger Can Go
or Anxiety Can Go]).

Introduction Bob and his emotion dysregulation
problems, introducing ordinary Bob and affect education
using pictures and cartoons. Homework: register ordi-
nary Bob moments on a daily basis, making a collage of
pictures representing anger and anxiety.

Session 2
Second basic session about emotion dysregulation.
Introducing the anger-thermometer and the concept of
building up anger gradually, using pictures in which body
language is analyzed corresponding with a scale 0, 1, 2, 3
(from neutral to a bit angry, angry to raged). Then the child
is asked to show how his own anger thermometer is repre-
sented in his body language. The same is done for anxiety.

Homework: register angry and anxious moments on a
daily basis using the thermometer scale, register ordinary
Bob moments on a daily basis.

Session 3
Teaching how to make an FBA (situation-behavior-
consequence) and combining this with the gradual rise in
anger on the thermometer, creating visible behavioral
sequences from 0, to 3. Furthermore: emphasizing how
anger feels inside the body (but also describing overt,
behavioral signs as shouting, kicking, and hitting). Bodily
signs become personalized (what are your bodily signs?)
by drawing them onto a cartoon of a boy or girl.

Introducing the time-out, which is to be taken when
anger is between 1 and 2. Together with parents a time-out
place is selected at home. This is a nice place where the
child can engage in activities he likes. Of course, preoccupa-
tions and special interests can serve their positive purpose.

Homework: register angry moments on a daily basis
using the thermometer
register ordinary Bob
scale,
moments on a daily basis. Practice taking a time-out
whenever anger is between 1 and 2.

1983

Session 4
Making a list of anger triggers based on registrations.
Learning how to regain calmness in an anger provoking
situation using distraction/shifting attention and concen-
tration
drawing meditation
(or molding modeling clay) as tools. Introducing three
ways to cool down: (1) distract yourself/shifting attention
away (2) use cool downers (trivializations) (3) concentrate
on the activity you were engaged in.

techniques

such

Introducing more concentration techniques to be used
footsole/
to regain calmness and shifting attention:
walking meditation, watching meditation, and watching
without judgment.

Homework: register angry moments on a daily basis
register ordinary Bob
scale,
using the thermometer
moments on a daily basis. Practice taking a time-out
whenever anger is between 1 and 2. Practice concentra-
tion exercises. Therapist visits school, to introduce and
practice time-out with teacher.

Session 5
Idem.

Session 6
Idem.

Session 7
A picture story/fairy tale about Bob is read and ana-
lyzed, in which he learns to ignore his anger triggers,
using the three ways to cool down. Furthermore, this ses-
sion repeats Sessions 5 and 6.

Homework: ignoring as an Anger Can Go! technique
is “finding Bob-solutions” for angry-
is added, as
moments. Furthermore, homework is the same as after
Sessions 4, 5, and 6.

Session 8
Role play is added. Solutions for difficult situations,
containing the child’s anger triggers, have to be made
this session repeats Sessions 4, 5,
up. Furthermore,
6, and 7.

Session 9
Last session: farewell, obtaining one’s BOB-certifi-
cate. On the certificate is described what the child’s anger
triggers are, how he can observe 0,1, 2, 3 in his body (lan-
guage), when the child when has to take his time out, and
what his favorite ordinary Bob moments and his favorite
concentration exercises are.

B.2.

| Parent group sessions

Session 1

Informing parents about parental stress and ASD.

1984

CLIFFORD ET AL.

Explaining the concept of EE, Expressed Emotion,
and how it is related to internalizing and externalizing
problems in children with ASD.

Informing the parents about the child’s training pro-
gram and the principles of self-awareness and teaching
them self-management skills.

eventually how the situation could have ended without
judgments leading to high EE. Parents observe at home
their own difficult situations with high EE, using an emo-
tion regulation form, which is an adaptation of the emo-
tion regulation form used in the DBT skills-training
(Linehan, 2014).

Session 2
Parents analyze a vignette of a father and son with

Session 3
Situations with high EE are presented by the parents

in the group.

Parents are taught to use a DBT-based emotion regu-
lation form to describe the emotions, triggers, physical/
bodily equivalents, the judgments that are made by this
the facts they observe in the vignette, and
father,

Advice is given how EE can be kept at low levels.
Parents are informed about the possibility to take a
time-out when EE is starting to rise to prevent them from
showing acting out behavior themselves.
