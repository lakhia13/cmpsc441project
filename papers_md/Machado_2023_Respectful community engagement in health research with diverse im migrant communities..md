ABSTRACT
Introduction  Global migration and immigration are 
increasing, and migrants and immigrants (im/migrants) 
have specific health needs and healthcare experiences. 
Yet, im/migrant involvement in immigration and 
health research in Canada is inconsistent. Heretofore, 
involvement has primarily been in research planning, data 
collection and analysis, with little community involvement 
during knowledge exchange or through training and 
colearning opportunities. Community engagement 
has been especially uncommon in mixed- method and 
quantitative research in Canada.
Objective  This article describes lessons learnt from the 
Evaluating Inequities in Refugee & Immigrants’ Health 
Access (IRIS) project from 2018 to 2023, an ongoing 
mixed- method, community- based research project in 
British Columbia, Canada. Specifically, we share our core 
community engagement project structures, Commitments 
to Community and our Community Engagement Backbone, 
both collaboratively developed with im/migrant community 
memebers.
Participants  People with varied experiences of im/
migration and connections to multiple, specific im/migrant 
communities participate in the project as participants, 
community researchers, community advisory board 
members, faculty members and students. Core research 
activities are supported in English, Farsi, Spanish and 
Tigrinya. We engage community members throughout 
the research process, from identifying research topics to 
knowledge exchange.
Conclusion  We found that these structures offer 
an accessible visual representation of the project’s 
commitments to community engagement, and the ways 
these commitments are demonstrated through values and 
action. Our training opportunities, colearning activities and 
knowledge exchange efforts also confirmed the accuracy 
of interpretation, prompted additional analysis to clarify 
or add depth to findings, and helped us identify additional 
research topics. We hope these learnings can be used to 
expand engagement with diverse im/migrant communities 
in health and immigration research.

INTRODUCTION
Global  migration  and 
immigration  are 
increasing,  and  migrants  and  immigrants 
(im/migrants)  have 
specific  healthcare 
needs.1–3  We  use  the  term  im/migrants  to 

international 

include immigrants and migrants with perma-
nent and precarious im/migration status, the 
latter  of  which  includes  people  with  tempo-
rary  status  or  who  are  without  immigration 
status.4  Today, 
im/migrants 
make  up  over  272 million  of  the  world’s 
population.5  Canada  remains  a  top  destina-
tion  country  for  im/migrants  globally,6  and 
British  Columbia  (BC)  is  a  top  destination 
province.7 8 The borders of BC were defined 
on the lands of over 200 Indigenous nations 
through resisted historical and ongoing colo-
nial  processes,  including  forced  displace-
ment and internal migration.9 10 The federal 
ministry,  Immigration,  Refugees  and  Citi-
zenship  Canada,  controls  movement  across 
international  borders  by  issuing  travel  docu-
ments  and  screening  potential  permanent 
and temporary residents,10 11 and determines 
whether im/migrants are admitted as tempo-
rary  or  permanent  residents.  BC  is  most 
densely  populated  in  the  Lower  Mainland 
(the  area  surrounding  Vancouver),  which 
is  where  this  project  took  place.  Federal 
immigration  targets  in  Canada  continue  to 
increase;  in  fact,  the  government’s  plans  for 
the  year  2024  include  the  country’s  highest 
targets in im/migration history—an expected 
430 000–450 000  permanent  residents  are  to 
arrive.12 However, people will also arrive with 
other, more precarious im/migration statuses 
and  live  as  temporary  foreign  workers,  visi-
tors, international students, and im/migrants 
without  official  status.  These  groups  will 
also be without the healthcare, mobility and 
employment  rights  associated  with  perma-
nent  residency  and  citizenship.4  13  Accord-
ingly,  we  must  meaningfully  understand  the 
needs of im/migrant communities to appro-
priately address them.

Community- based  research  (CBR)  offers 
approaches 
to  more  accurately  under-
standing  im/migrants’  needs.  CBR  is  an 
approach to research that is participatory and

equitably  involves  community  members,  organisations 
and  researchers  in  all  aspects  of  the  research  process, 
where partners contribute expertise, decision- making and 
take on various responsibilities.4 13 14 Grounded in teach-
ings  from  community  organising,  social  justice,  Indig-
enous  researchers  and  protocols,  and  feminist  theory, 
CBR  principles  prioritise  analyses  built  on  respectful 
relationships, honest conversations and collaboration to 
support nuanced understandings of lived experiences.15 
Community engagement can take place at various levels 
ranging  from  consultations  (obtaining  feedback  on 
analysis  and  decisions)  to  collaboration  (partnering  on 
decision- making  and  generating  recommendations)  to 
empowerment  (placing  final  decisions  in  the  hands  of 
community  members).16  In  previous  research  with  im/
migrants  in  Canada,  CBR  has  particularly  ensured  that 
im/migrant identities, experiences and cultures ground 
and are reflected in research.17 However, there has been 
little use of CBR approaches in quantitative im/migrant 
health  research  or  research  that  draws  on  administra-
tive data in Canada, as well as CBR research in this area 
that  simultaneously  considers  community  engagement, 
researcher accountability, and the integration of findings. 
This is what we aimed to do in this project.

Practicing CBR in institutional settings has challenges, 
including  the  need  for  additional  time  and  financial 
resources;  perceptions  of  CBR  as  less  academically 
rigorous;  and  barriers  to  participation  for  community 
members,  including  time  and  transportation.9  With  a 
lack of time also comes challenges related to inadequate 
training and experience in CBR for both researchers and 
community  members,18  as  well  as  few  opportunities  to 
build  relationships  and  trust—both  of  which  are  essen-
tial  CBR  principles.14  19  20  Research  has  also  discussed 
differences 
language 
in  communication  styles  and 
barriers  as  a  key  challenge  in  conducting  CBR,  given 
the importance of collaboration and partnership in this 
type  of  work,18  20  21  which  is  especially  important  within 
the context of im/migrant health research. Given these 
challenges,  involvement  of  im/migrant  communities  in 
immigration  and  health  research  has  been  inconsistent 
in Canada. In our review of literature, we found that im/
migrant involvement in Canadian research has primarily 
been  in  research  planning  and  qualitative  data  collec-
tion,22  and  sometimes  qualitative  data  analysis.23  Im/
migrant community members were infrequently involved 
during  knowledge  exchange,  that  is  the  exchange  and 
sharing of ideas, evidence and experience, nor in training 
and colearning opportunities or engagement beyond the 
participant role.24

These  conclusions  drawn  from  Canadian  literature 
align well with international findings about engaging with 
im/migrants in CBR. In their review of international CBR 
projects  with  refugees  in  North  America,  Australia  and 
New Zealand, the Middle East, Africa and Europe, Filler 
et al25 found that while all 14 of the studies they reviewed 
involved participants in research planning, fewer studies 
engaged  with  participants  in  data  collection  (57%), 

2

knowledge translation (43%) and data analysis (29%). In 
a larger review of CBR projects with immigrants primarily 
in the USA, Vaughn et al17 assessed studies based on clarity 
of  immigrant  roles  in  research  from  level  1  (immigrant 
involvement unclear or not described) to level 4 (immi-
grant involvement clearly described). Of the 161 studies 
that were reviewed, only 52% were ranked as level 4. Level 
4 studies also assessed im/migrant levels of engagement 
at each research stage. Engagement in data analysis and 
interpretation  was  much  lower  than  in  other  stages  of 
research.17  As  well,  only  43%  of  level  4  studies  engaged 
immigrants in all research stages (study design, choosing 
data collection instruments, recruitment, data collection 
and  data  collection  and  interpretation).  These  reviews 
point to two central challenges in CBR with im/migrants: 
(1) a lack of full spectrum engagement with im/migrants 
in the research process, and (2) limited details about how 
im/migrants are engaged throughout the CBR process.

To our knowledge, few studies in Canada have engaged 
im/migrant  communities  in  all  research  stages  or  in 
quantitative or mixed- method research; however, we iden-
tified  two  promising  examples.  In  their  project  focused 
on  identifying  health  promotion  needs  among  South 
Asian women, Choudhry et al22 consulted with community 
members at the research planning stage who affirmed the 
research  direction  and  relevance.  Researchers  worked 
with  participants  to  assign  research  tasks,  and  held  two 
knowledge exchange events to share findings with partic-
ipants  who  were  invited  to  reflect  on  their  experiences 
working on the project, as well as present findings to key 
stakeholders.  In  another  study  focused  on  examining 
socio- cultural factors influencing tuberculosis prevention 
and treatment in im/migrant and Indigenous communi-
ties,  Gibson  et  al23  hired  community  research  associates 
(CAs)  who  led  interviews  and  interpreted  and  analysed 
interview  data.  CAs  were  hired  from  the  im/migrant 
and  Indigenous  communities  that  the  research  focused 
on. CAs received training and education on the research 
topic and interview strategies, and training materials were 
partially developed by a community advisory council and 
stakeholders.

Notably, there are also strong examples of CBR with im/
migrants that live outside Canada. In research by Light-
foot et al,26 to identify the cultural health assets of Somali 
and  Oromo  communities  in  the  Minneapolis  and  Saint 
Paul  areas,  community  centre  staff,  community  leaders, 
elders  and  healthcare  providers  collaborated  across  the 
study.  Community  members  were  also  hired  as  commu-
nity asset mappers (CAMs); CAMs were fluent in Somali 
or Oromo, plus English. With training, CAMs developed 
skills and knowledge on interviewing, research methods, 
research  ethics  and  data  analysis.  CAMs  were  also 
involved  in  identifying  key  themes  and  coding.  Finally, 
after  analysis  was  complete,  community  member- led 
action  teams  were  formed  with  an  emphasis  on  using 
the  cultural  health  assets  learnt  to  promote  health.  As 
well, Revens et al27 focused on the supporting factors of 
resilience  and  mental  health  among  Latinx  immigrants 

Machado S, et al. BMJ Open 2023;13:e077391. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-2023-077391from Mexico, Central and South America, and the Carib-
bean, leveraging an existing partnership between a local 
university and community centre. The community centre, 
which serves a predominately Latinx community, identi-
fied  the  research  problem.  Community  advisory  board 
members  also  had  a  significant  role  throughout  the 
research process, receiving training to develop and accu-
rately translate recruitment materials, collect and analyse 
data, and translate and exchange knowledge. Despite the 
strength of these studies, however, they mainly used qual-
itative approaches and engaged with one or two language 
groups  at  most.  As  such,  there  appears  to  be  limited 
evidence and understanding of how to engage multiple, 
multilingual communities across the research process or 
through quantitative or mixed- method approaches.

In  this  article,  we  incorporated  learnings  from  chal-
lenges  and  thoughtful  examples  of  CBR  with  im/
migrants in the Evaluating Inequities in Refugee & Immi-
grants’ Health Access (IRIS) project. Below, we describe 
a  community  engagement  framework  and  tools  devel-
oped  within  IRIS,  which  is  a  community- based,  mixed- 
method  study  of  im/migrants’  access  to  health  services 
in  BC,  Canada.  Our  objective  is  to  offer  an  accessible, 
visual  representation  of  our  commitments  to  commu-
nity  engagement,  and  the  ways  these  commitments  are 
demonstrated  through  values  and  action,  so  that  other 
research teams can share our learning and expand CBR 
with different im/migrant communities.

The IRIS project
The  IRIS  project  is  hosted  at  the  Centre  for  Gender 
&  Sexual  Health  Equity  in  Vancouver,  BC  and  is  made 
up  of  a  team  of  researchers,  faculty  members,  students 
and  community  members,  and  health  and  im/migra-
tion partner organisations.28 The project aims to under-
stand  and  generate  recommendations  for  policies  and 
programmes that improve health, well- being, and access 
to health services for im/migrants in BC. The quantitative 
arm analyses confidential, linked health and immigration 
system data to understand health services use. The qual-
itative  arm  involves  initial  and  follow- up  interviews  with 
im/migrants and service providers to understand factors 
shaping health access. The IRIS project, including both 
arms, is guided by a community engagement framework 
that articulates activities and commitments at all research 
stages. IRIS holds ethical approval from the Simon Fraser 
University (SFU) and Providence Health Care/University 
of British Columbia harmonised ethics review boards.

IRIS  began  in  2018  with  building  relationships  and 
consulting with im/migrants and health and social service 
providers about the health service access of im/migrants 
in  Metro  Vancouver.  We  did  this  by  conducting  consul-
tations  from  September  to  November  2018  in  English, 
Farsi,  Spanish  and  Tigrinya,  which  were  the  preferred 
languages  of  the  primary  im/migrant  communities 
served by community partner organisations. Community 
partners include settlement, health and advocacy organi-
sations that primarily serve im/migrant communities and 

Open access

work to improve im/migrant health and well- being and 
access  to  health  and  social  services,  as  well  as  advocate 
for im/migrant rights and justice. While some organisa-
tions  are  funded  to  serve  im/migrants  with  permanent 
residency and fluency in English, others provide services 
to  people  with  more  precarious  im/migration  status, 
including  work  permit  holders,  international  students, 
asylum  seekers  and  people  without  official  im/migra-
tion status, who speak a variety of languages. Building on 
learnings from community consultations and our review 
of  literature,  we  worked  with  partners  to  identify  and 
clarify the focus of IRIS: the healthcare access and expe-
riences of im/migrants in BC. What came with the rela-
tionships we built was the addition of core team members 
with lived im/migration experience. By the end of 2018, 
the IRIS project was established and built on partnerships 
with local im/migrant- serving community organisations, 
and a research team with im/migration experience and 
expertise  in  qualitative,  quantitative  and  health  services 
research.

Community engagement within IRIS
‘Community’  within  the  IRIS  project  includes  im/
migrant  research  participants,  team  members,  commu-
nity  advisory  board  members,  community  partners  and 
the  broader  im/migrant  community.  Community  advi-
sory board members include individuals who wish to meet 
regularly and shape the direction of the IRIS project by 
sharing  ideas,  experiences  and  feedback  on  all  stages 
of  the  research  process.  Interview  participants  include 
im/migrants  who  live  in  the  Lower  Mainland,  BC,  who 
have  entered  Canada  through  an  international  border, 
and who often have experience of precarious im/migra-
tion  status.  Im/migrant  team  members  and  community 
partners  collaborate  on  the  development  of  research 
materials,  data  collection,  participatory  analyses  and 
privacy and confidentiality agreements; the cocreation of 
clear,  accurate  dissemination  products;  and  knowledge 
exchange.  IRIS  uses  a  CBR  design  to  attend  to  cultural 
humility, transparent and respectful partnerships, and a 
collaborative  process  that  involves  im/migrants  leading 
this research.

IRIS  has  community  relations  at  two  levels  with:  (1) 
community partners and (2) community advisory boards 
and  interview  participants.  These  relationships  were 
built over time and are strengthened through respectful 
communication and collaboration. Community partners 
include  im/migrant- serving  organisations  that  we  regu-
larly engage with; however, levels of engagement vary by 
organisation. For example, we prioritise engagement with 
organisations that offer services to people with precarious 
im/migration  status.  Community  advisory  boards  func-
tion in four different languages (English, Farsi, Spanish, 
and  Tigrinya)  that  support  most  languages  spoken  by 
participants.  The  communities  we  work  with  are  also 
represented  on  the  IRIS  team—several  advisory  boards 
are facilitated by team members from the same cultural 
background  or  who  speak  a  shared  language,  but  who

also  recognise  nuances  within  communities.  This  helps 
community  members  feel  comfortable  participating 
in  activities  and  ensures  that  different  perspectives  are 
woven throughout the research.

Important  to  the  IRIS  project  is  honouring  people’s 
lived  experiences  of  im/migration,  as  well  as  compen-
sating and supporting their time and expertise. Commu-
nity advisory board members are paid for their time and 
any childminding or transportation necessary to support 
meeting  attendance,  offered  active  referrals  to  needed 
services, and provided a meal to enjoy when they attend a 
meeting. Where research with marginalised communities 
can sometimes be extractive and harmful, these activities 
demonstrate our respect for each participant’s safety and 
well- being.

IRIS 

Community  engagement  within 

includes 
moving  beyond  informing  community  members  about 
the  research  to  building  a  sense  of  collaboration  and 
empowerment.  This  requires  partnering  with  commu-
nity  members  at  each  stage  of  research  and  inviting 
im/migrants  to  be  decision- makers.  Our  Commitments 
to  Community  and  the  Community  Engagement  Backbone 
are tools that describe our commitments to community 
engagement in practice.

Our Commitments to Community
Our  Commitments  to  Community  (figure  1)  is  a  visual  that 
highlights who we work with, our values and our respon-
sibilities  to  community  members.  Through  an  iterative 
process  with  team  members  and  community  advisories, 
we  identified  and  defined  three  values  that  are  core  to 
IRIS: collaboration, respect and relationship building.

Collaboration
Collaboration within IRIS means that we work to include 
a  range  of  community  perspectives  at  each  stage  of 
research. For example, at analysis and writing stages, we 
organise  meetings  to  foster  discussion  around  interpre-
tation to ensure that a variety of perspectives are shared 
and incorporated into the research. We also acknowledge 
that power differences exist within the team and among 
community  members  and  impact  collaboration.  These 
power differences may be based on factors like race and 
ethnicity,  language  preference,  im/migration  status, 
education  and  research  experience,  and  payment  from 
the  research  project  to  community  members,  as  well  as 
access  to  information  and  control  of  research  funding 
in  the  case  of  principal  investigators.  We  actively  reflect 
on  these  power  differences  and  learn  from  community 
members to try to mitigate harm and balance power. This 
includes  ensuring  that  each  research  manuscript,  for 
example, is not developed by the core research team in 
isolation,  but  collaboratively  with  community  members 
with  diversity  in  im/migration  status,  language  prefer-
ence and education and research experience, all of whom 
are paid for their time and expertise.

Respect
We  deeply  respect  community  members’  identities  and 
lived experiences with im/migration and prioritise oppor-
tunities  for  community  members  to  share  their  knowl-
edge throughout the research process. Through research 
built  on  community  engagement,  we  aim  to  provide 
community  members  with  formalised  research  findings 
that  reflect  their  experiences  and  inform  community 
advocacy.  For  example,  in  developing  research  manu-
scripts  and  sharing  findings  with  partner  organisations, 
we  work  closely  with  community  members  to  ensure 
that  the  interpretation  of  data  and  key  messages  of  the 
research  accurately  reflect  the  lived  experiences  of  im/
migrant communities. Our goal is to ensure that the main 
research messages respectfully reflect im/migrant experi-
ences and expertise.

Relationship building
We  focus  on  building  reciprocal  relationships  with 
community  members  and  partners  throughout  the 
research process. While some community advisory board 
members  and  participants  choose  to  use  and  develop 
skills  they  already  have  (eg,  sharing  findings  through 
social media, creating posters, etc), we also offer training 
to  support  new  skills.  This  includes  formal  training  in 
qualitative  data  analysis,  manual  coding  and  research 
writing.  Part  of  respect  and  relationship  building  is 
reciprocity,  or  giving  back  to  people  and  communities 
we  work  with  within  and  beyond  the  scope  of  IRIS.  We 
realise  this  by  offering  people  tangible  support  outside 
the project when we can, including immigration applica-
tion support, recommendation letters for university appli-
cations, career references, or referrals to legal, health and 
social services.

Our responsibilities
We  identified  our  responsibilities  to  community  at  the 
beginning of the IRIS project with the aim of addressing 
challenges to CBR identified in the existing literature and 
creating robust, respectful engagement with diverse im/
migrant  communities.  Engaging  in  reflective  conversa-
tions  with  participants  and  community  members  led  to 
suggestions around our team’s responsibilities, ideas for 
providing  support  beyond  the  research,  and  the  need 
to  address  power  dynamics  through  care  and  capacity 
building. Therefore, our responsibilities include:
 ► Regularly  checking  in  about  capacity,  time,  and 

interest in research participation.

 ► Dividing  roles  and  responsibilities  fairly  and  with 

mutual agreement.

 ► Offering 

training 

opportunities 

to 

support 

engagement.

 ► Providing  honoraria,  childminding,  and  transporta-
tion  for  interview  participants  and  community  advi-
sory board members.

 ► Providing a meal for each community advisory board 

meeting (typically 2–3 hours).

 ► Inviting  participation  on  all  stages  of  research, 
including  providing  feedback  on  findings  before 
publication and offering the opportunity  for partici-
pants to review interview quotes before they are made 
public.

IRIS Community Engagement Backbone
The Community Engagement Backbone (figure 2) is collabo-
ratively designed by community advisory board members 
and IRIS team members to visually represent the project’s 
commitment  to  community  engagement  at  each  stage 
of  research.  It  also  includes  activities  that  community 

members may participate in and can be applied to indi-
vidual analyses to maintain the integrity of engagement. 
The backbone is a living diagram that evolves alongside 
community and team needs.

We primarily drew from Israel’s principles of CBR19 in 
codeveloping  the  IRIS  Community  Engagement  Back-
bone.  This  means  that  we  recognised  the  im/migrant 
community as a unity of identity; built on strengths within 
the  community,  including  knowledge  and  experiences 
related  to  the  research  areas;  facilitated  collaboration 
and  partnership  throughout  research  stages;  attended

to  power  dynamics;  fostered  colearning  and  capacity 
building  through  research  training  and  collaborative 
analyses;  supported  reciprocity  in  knowledge  exchange; 
focused  on  issues  that  were  relevant  to  community  and 
that attended to multiple determinants of health; worked 
with  community  members  and  partners  on  knowledge 
exchange efforts; and supported community engagement 
through various years of relationship building.19 We drew 
on these principles while focusing on our core values of 
collaboration,  respect  and  relationship  building  when 
developing the IRIS Community Engagement Backbone. 
This is evident through our efforts on capacity building 
through  research,  reciprocity  in  knowledge  exchange, 
as  well  as  priority  of  im/migrants’  lived  experiences 
throughout the research process described below.

Community  engagement  is  a  point  of  integration  for 
qualitative and quantitative methods at different stages of 
the research process.29 Regardless of whether a research 
product  is  in  its  initial  stages,  in- progress,  or  close  to 
being finalised, community engagement is prioritised and 
adapted based on team capacity. Below we expand on the 
backbone with examples of how we commit to and work 
with community members at each stage of IRIS research.

We will listen and work with you to identify research areas 
that are important and relevant to your experiences
 ► We  host  small  group  conversations  in  multiple 
languages, as well as large multilingual group discus-
sions  with  community  advisory  board  members  and 
interested  research  participants  to  talk  about  poten-
tial research areas, brainstorm research questions and 

understand community perspectives on the relevance 
of  the  proposed  topics.  Decisions  on  the  research 
topic,  questions,  and  focus  are  shaped  by  these 
conversations.

We will learn about community experiences by interviewing 
people, looking at health system information and prioritising 
community knowledge
 ► We work with community members to create recruit-
ment  materials,  review  data  and  identify  themes 
in  qualitative  data.  Similarly,  we  include  people 
with im/migration experiences in preparing quan-
titative  data,  including  making  decisions  about 
what  information  is  important  to  examine  and 
how  people  are  grouped  in  analysis,  particularly 
with  respect  to  im/migration  (eg,  status  currently 
held,  im/migration  class,  time  in  Canada).  We 
do  this  by  meeting  regularly  throughout  research 
planning  and  analysis  and  prioritising  perspec-
tives on approaches to research informed by lived 
experiences.

We will work with you to understand research findings
 ► We invite community members to provide feedback 
on the interpretation of quantitative and qualitative 
results,  as  well  as  cowrite  and/or  review  research 
products  to  reflect  community  perspectives.  We 
cowrite and review research through regular meet-
ings  dedicated  to  writing  together  to  allow  for 
group learning and support. We also divide writing

interest and capacity, regularly checking in on how 
these factors change over time.

We will work together to present research findings in various 
formats
 ► We  incorporate  community  advice  when  translating 
research findings into accessible knowledge exchange 
materials  (eg,  manuscripts,  reports,  policy  briefs, 
videos). We also invite community members to write, 
develop  and  review  these  products.  For  example, 
we  regularly  meet  with  community  advisory  board 
members  to  plan  for  and  create  infographics  that 
accurately  summarise  research  findings  and  partic-
ipant  experiences.  During  these  meetings,  we  also 
work together to share ideas on how to use findings 
to advocate for improved healthcare access.14 We also 
offer relevant training to support community partici-
pation in writing.

We will share research findings in a way that is accessible 
and easy to understand
 ► We share research findings on platforms that commu-
nity  members  already  use,  like  WhatsApp,  as  well  as 
codetermine how and with whom findings should be 
shared.  For  example,  through  meetings  and  online 
surveys, we ask community members where and with 
whom  they  would  like  to  see  the  research  findings 
shared.

Challenges and considerations
Like other CBR projects, community engagement within 
IRIS  has  encountered  challenges,  many  of  which  have 
been discussed in previous research that attend to Israel14 
and  Wallerstein’s20  principles  of  CBR.  Some  key  consid-
erations that we attended to during the project include:
 ► Funding:  adequately  resourcing  the  IRIS  project 
required  multiple  grants,  including  pilot  funds  for 
initial community engagement (SFU internal award), 
ongoing  direct  support  for  community  engagement 
(Vancouver  Foundation),  and  traditional  federal 
funding  (Canadian  Institute  for  Health  Research). 
Respectful  partnerships  require  time  and  resources 
for  colearning,  capacity  building  and  relationship 
building.  This  consideration  has  been  recognised  in 
other CBR projects,14 18 21 30 and has sometimes been a 
challenge within IRIS.

 ► Relationships:  as  the  team  navigates  how  to  appro-
priately finish the project, we are carefully attending 
to the relationships we have developed over the past 
6 years  by  transparently  communicating  next  steps, 
offering  letters  of  recommendation  to  commu-
nity  participants,  and  collaborating  on  plans  for 
research dissemination. Collaboration is a key facet 
of  CBR,  and  strengthening  relationships  is  impor-
tant  to  foster  this.  As  a  lack  of  trust  and  respect 
has  been  identified  as  a  challenge  in  CBR,14  21  we 
attempted  to  minimise  power  imbalances  between 

Open access

institutions  and  community  by  offering  tangible 
forms of support.

 ► Specificity:  throughout  the  project,  we  have  priori-
tised  close  engagement  with  multiple,  specific  im/
migrant  communities,  clearly  communicating  that 
representing  all  im/migrant  communities  was  not 
a  goal  of  IRIS.  This  specificity  was  essential  for  us 
to  determine  in  collaboration  with  community,  and 
required  ongoing  community  participation  and 
collaboration.  Researchers  have  often  engaged  one 
community, given challenges associated with language 
differences and communication identified in previous 
literature.18  However,  the  multilingual  nature  of  the 
IRIS project is unique, important, and allowed us to 
strengthen  CBR  principles  of  equitable  partnerships 
and engagement.14 19 20

 ► Counselling: as most team members have lived expe-
rience of im/migration, we meet monthly with a clin-
ical  counsellor  who  helps  us  navigate  challenging 
feelings  that  arise  during  this  work.  These  include 
triggering feelings or experiences of retraumatisation 
for im/migrant team members who are reading and 
analysing  painful  participant  experiences  that  may 
be similar to their own. They also help us function in 
a  culturally  diverse  team  that  exists  within  an  immi-
gration  system  that  is  often  harmful  for  people  with 
precarious  im/migration  status,  where  loss  of  status 
could bring loss of employment, income, health insur-
ance  and  security.  Counselling  was  not  planned  at 
study  outset  but  incorporated  in  response  to  arising 
needs  and  challenges.18  31  This  was  especially  impor-
tant as immigration- related challenges emerged in the 
context of the COVID- 19 pandemic, including border 
closures,  prolonged  family  separation,  immigration 
processing delays and isolation associated with public 
health measures that impacted both participants and 
team members.

Conclusion
Through  our  experience  on  the  IRIS  project,  we  have 
learnt deeply about community engagement and its feasi-
bility  and  importance  within  im/migration  and  health 
research. We have learnt that it requires financial resources 
and  time  to  support  a  strong  research  team  with  varied 
expertise and lived experiences, as well as clarity around 
community  engagement  activities.  We  have  also  learnt 
how  to  engage  community  members  in  mixed- method 
research,  integrating  both  qualitative  and  quantitative 
study  arms,  which  has  not  previously  been  documented 
in research to our knowledge. Finally, community engage-
ment requires commitment and accountability from the 
research team.

Community  engagement  within  IRIS  is  unique  in 
that  we  engage  community  members  throughout  the 
research  process,  from  research  planning  to  dissem-
ination,  including  as  part  of  the  research  team.  To  our 
knowledge,  IRIS  is  one  of  the  only  research  projects  in 
Canada  that  has  conducted  research  with  multiple  im/

migrant  communities  in  this  way;  this  is  attributable  to 
the  establishment  of  community  advisory  board  struc-
tures that facilitated confirmation of research directions, 
accuracy  in  research  interpretation  and  participation  in 
knowledge exchange across language groups. This deep-
ened the rigour and quality of our research and required 
commitment to attending to the challenges and consid-
erations  outlined  above.  By  sharing  Our  Commitments 
to  Community,  the  Community  Engagement  Backbone,  and 
examples of community engagement across the research 
process,  we  hope  that  researchers  interested  in  doing 
similar work can build on our learnings and continue to 
expand research that engages im/migrant communities.
