Efficacy of mindfulness- and
acceptance-based
cognitive-behavioral therapies for
bodily distress in adults: a
meta-analysis

Objective: Bodily distress, i.e., somatoform disorders and associated functional
somatic syndromes,
is highly prevalent, often persistent and highly disabling.
It has been proposed that “third wave” therapies may be beneﬁcial variants
of cognitive behavioral treatments. However, evidence on their efficacy is
scarce. This meta-analysis examines the efficacy of “third wave” psychotherapies
(mindfulness-based cognitive therapy
[MBCT], mindfulness-based stress
reduction [MBSR], and acceptance and commitment therapy [ACT]) in adults with
bodily distress.

Method: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) treating adults with
bodily distress using MBCT, MBSR, and ACT compared to inactive and non-speciﬁc
control groups. A random effects model was used. The primary outcome was
somatic symptom severity. Secondary outcomes were degrees of depression and
of anxiety, health anxiety, perceived health status, mindfulness, psychological
inﬂexibility, and pain acceptance.

Results: Sixteen RCTs with 1,288 participants were included in the analysis
(k = 4 MBCT, k = 7 MBSR, k = 5 ACT; k = 7 ﬁbromyalgia, k = 5 irritable bowel
syndrome, k = 1 chronic fatigue syndrome, k = 2 bodily distress, k = 1 medically
unexplained symptoms). However, not all studies provided data for each of the
relevant outcomes. The analyses revealed that “third wave“ therapies were more
effective than control conditions in reducing somatic symptom severity (k = 15, n
= 1,100, g = −0.51, 95%CI −0.69; −0.32). Heterogeneity was moderate (I² = 52.8%,
95%CI 15.1 to 73.8). Effects for secondary outcomes were small to moderate
with varying degrees of heterogeneity. We did not ﬁnd differences between
the different therapy approaches (mindfulness- vs. acceptance-based therapies);
neither therapy dosis (i.e., total duration of therapy sessions) nor number of
sessions were signiﬁcant moderators of efficacy.

Conclusions: The therapies addressing mindfulness and acceptance proved to
be more effective than control conditions. Hence, they are promising treatment
approaches for bodily distress. However, there is still need for research on which
patient groups may beneﬁt from these psychological approaches.

1. Introduction

Incapacitating, persistent physical symptoms, i.e., functional
and somatoform bodily complaints, are highly prevalent. Due to an
increased use of healthcare services and frequent work absenteeism
these complaints are often associated with increased costs for
the health care system (1). Several psychological therapies are
considered well-established in the treatment of persistent physical
symptoms; with the largest body of evidence available for cognitive
behavioral therapy [CBT, (2)]. However, symptoms are at best
moderately improved by psychotherapy (1). Hence, there is need
for more eﬀective treatments (3). So-called “third wave“ therapies
may represent promising new approaches in this context. They
may hold the potential to improve management of bodily distress
emphasizing mindfulness and acceptance as important change
mechanisms (4). The most prominent “third wave“ therapies
are mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT), mindfulness-
based stress reduction (MBSR), and acceptance and commitment
therapy (ACT).

MBCT combines CBT techniques with mindfulness practices.
it helps individuals to observe their experiences
Therefore,
including thoughts, physical sensations and emotions in a non-
judgmental way, leading to greater acceptance of inner experiences
(5). In its mindfulness practices, it is based on MBSR. MBSR
combines mindfulness practices with yoga and body awareness
techniques to help individuals manage stress, pain, and illness. The
goal of MBSR is to help individuals enhance their self-awareness
(6). Mindfulness, as a supposed key mechanism of MBCT and
MBSR, may help patients to interrupt rumination processes, and
as a consequence interpret bodily symptoms less negatively by
shifting their attentional focus away from the negative appraisal
of their symptoms. Consequently, mindfulness could indirectly
lead to a more accepting attitude toward bodily sensations. ACT
focuses on accepting diﬃcult thoughts and emotions while working
toward one’s values and goals. The goal
in ACT is to help
individuals develop psychological ﬂexibility and become more
eﬀective in their actions and relationships. To that eﬀect, ACT
rather aims at reducing avoidance behaviors and uses a more direct
approach on acceptance of inner experiences including somatic
symptoms, emphasizing mindfulness and values clariﬁcation as
key components for psychological ﬂexibility and well-being (7).
Hence, all of these three “third wave” therapies could have a positive
impact on emotion regulation processes and interrupt patients’
reinforcement processes related to their symptoms (8), thus also
reducing comorbid depression and anxiety (4). Eﬃcacy of these
therapies has already been shown for some speciﬁc functional
somatic syndromes or symptoms [e.g., (9, 10)]. However, no meta-
analysis in the ﬁeld provides suﬃcient evidence for “third wave“
therapies taking into account recent changes in classiﬁcation.
Due to these changes, the focus in deﬁning bodily distress is
no longer primarily on the strict distinction between medically
unexplained symptoms and medically explained symptoms, but on
considering excessive psychobehavioral characteristics in relation
to the physical symptoms. Hence, several diﬀerent diagnoses can
now be subsumed under the concept of bodily distress, such as
medically unexplained symptoms, somatoform disorders, Bodily
Distress Disorder, Somatic Symptom Disorder (and its predecessors
in previous editions of the DSM). Functional somatic syndromes,

such as irritable bowel syndrome, chronic fatigue syndrome, and
ﬁbromyalgia are also included here (3).

The research base for “third wave“ therapies has improved in
recent years (11). Two recent reviews, one systematic review on
mindfulness-based therapies in medically unexplained symptoms
(9) and one narrative review on “third wave“ therapies in bodily
distress and health anxiety (4), yield promising results. However,
eﬀect sizes were not statistically aggregated.

them quasi-randomized. Eﬀects were small

The last meta-analysis focussing on the eﬃcacy of mindfulness-
including MBCT, MBSR, and unspeciﬁed
based therapies,
incorporated 13
mindfulness training for bodily distress (12),
trials; one of
to
moderate on pain, symptom severity, quality of life, depression,
and anxiety, favoring the mindfulness-based therapies. However,
this meta-analytic aggregation needs to be updated due to the
growing body of literature in this ﬁeld in recent years. Whereas the
research base for “third wave” therapies in ﬁbromyalgia has been
recently meta-analytically examined (10) based on 8 RCTs and one
quasi-randomized controlled trial. Again, the eﬀects were small to
moderate, e.g., for pain, health-related quality of life, depression,
and anxiety. However, the meta-analysis was limited to a single
functional somatic syndrome.

As there is no current quantitative integration of ﬁndings for
the eﬃcacy of MBCT, MBSR, and ACT for the full scope of bodily
distress, the aim of this meta-analysis is to examine the eﬃcacy
of these “third wave“ therapies in adults with bodily distress.
Hence, we examine the immediate eﬃcacy and maintenance after
completion of these treatments in comparison to inactive and
non-speciﬁc control groups. The primary outcome is somatic
symptom severity. However, a comprehensive evaluation should
not be limited to somatic symptoms alone (13). Therefore, we
also examine the eﬀects on perceived health status, comorbid
psychopathologies as well as mechanisms that are considered
central to the “third wave” therapies.

votes for these studies, and there are no ethical requirements that
this meta-analysis would violate.

2.2. Eligibility criteria

Study participants needed to be adults (≥18 years old) and
fulﬁll the criteria for bodily distress (a complete list of included
diagnoses can be found in the Supplementary material). Although
there is a considerable overlap between hypochondriasis/illness
anxiety and bodily distress, studies solely focussing on these

diagnoses will be excluded as well as studies on body dysmorphic
disorder. The assessment of bodily distress should either be based
on a diagnostic interview, or scores above a certain threshold
on a validated symptom scale. Eligible therapies were MBCT,
MBSR, and ACT, while studies examining conventional CBT were
not included. Any of these “third wave“ therapies had to be
compared to an inactive control arm or unspeciﬁc treatment
within the study, i.e., no treatment, wait-list (WL), treatment-
as-usual (TAU), enhanced care (EC, e.g., TAU with additional
psychoeducation or counseling) or attention/psychological/pill
placebo. Furthermore, only RCTs and (results of the ﬁrst part of)
cross-over trials were selected if they entailed n ≥ 10 participants
per arm (16). Additionally, reports had to be published in English
or German.

2.3. Search strategies and study selection

PubMed, PsycInfo, Psyndex, Cochrane Central Register of
Controlled Trials
(CENTRAL), and Cochrane Database for
Systematic Reviews (CDSR) were last searched on 01st of October
2021. The complete search algorithms can be found in the
Supplementary Material.

For study selection, abstracts were scanned for eligibility
after the removal of duplicates. Subsets of the reports were
each selected by two independent researchers and disagreements
were resolved by discussion. Afterwards, the full articles of the
reports that had not been excluded in the screening process
were assessed for eligibility. During an additional backwards
search, the references of meta-analyses and systematic reviews
found during the ﬁrst phase were searched for further eligible
reports. None of the independent researchers (FMgB and LH)
were blinded to any aspects of the studies at any time during
the process.

2.4. Data extraction

For each report,

two researchers (FMgB and LH; FMgB
and a research assistant for the studies identiﬁed in the ﬁnal
search update) extracted data independently using a previously
prepared Microsoft Excel-sheet (17) (see Supplementary material
for a complete list of extracted variables). If reported, results

If multiple measures
were used for the assessment of similar outcomes, validated

which measure was more suitable. AM supervised these decisions
while being blinded to the results. The decision-making process
was documented (see Supplementary material).

The risk of bias

(RoB) was assessed with the revised
Cochrane risk of bias tool
for randomized trials (RoB 2.0)
(18) by two independent researchers (in the same constellations
mentioned above).

2.6. Outcome measures

Outcomes were examined for post-treatment assessment as
well as for short-term (up to 3 months) and long-term follow-up
assessments (>3 months) (19). If multiple follow-up assessments
were provided all of which fell
into either the short-term or
the long-term category, the longest of these follow-up periods
was included.

somatic

The primary outcome was

symptom severity.
Secondary outcomes were perceived health status
(PHS),
depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and health anxiety; PHS
included quality of life, and health-related quality of life measures
as well as impairment due to illness (20). Additionally, some
exploratory analyses were performed for relevant constructs in
the included treatments: mindfulness, psychological inﬂexibility,
and pain acceptance. On the one hand, mindfulness is considered
a core mechanism of MBCT as well as MBSR and is also used in
ACT. On the other hand, tackling psychological inﬂexibility is
the main focus in ACT (7). To achieve an increased psychological
ﬂexibility, ACT aims at pain acceptance,
i.e., acceptance of
symptoms, in patients with bodily distress to reduce avoidance
behaviors (4).

2.7. Data analyses

throughout

Since diﬀerent scales were used to assess the outcomes of
interest
the included studies, standardized mean
diﬀerence (SMD) was chosen as summary statistic for all outcomes.
More precisely, Hedges’ g was calculated. Especially, as the
number of participants was expected to be small in some groups,
Hedges’ g holds the beneﬁt that it is adjusted for small sample
bias (21). If no total score but scores from several subscales
were available for an outcome, we combined the subscales
into one total score using a method for integrating dependent
eﬀect sizes (22),
if applicable (see Supplementary material for
formulas). The values extracted for PHS scales on which
higher scores indicate higher impairment were multiplied by
(−1) to ensure all scales pointed in the same direction (23).
Consequently, for PHS and mindfulness positive eﬀects indicate
an improvement favoring the treatment condition. For all other
outcomes negative eﬀects indicate a reduction of symptoms
favoring the treatment condition.

A random eﬀects model was used in this analysis as the aim
of this analysis is to draw statistical inferences on the underlying
universe based on the study results (24). The recommendation to
use the restricted maximum likelihood (REML) estimator for τ ² for
continuous data was followed (25). The I²-statistic was calculated
to quantify heterogeneity (23).

2.8. Moderator analyses

Several subgroup analyses were conducted using a mixed-
eﬀects model, presuming each subgroup containing an individual
true overall eﬀect and random eﬀects within subgroups (26). In
order to compute the analyses with dichotomized categories, we
dummy coded the groups. We only calculated subgroup analyses
for subgroups with k ≥ 3. For the meta-regressions we used a
mixed-eﬀects model as well.

First, despite their parallels, the diﬀerent therapies diﬀer in their
foci which could inﬂuence outcome. Thus, we examined whether
the mindfulness-based (MBCT/MBSR) and the acceptance-based
(ACT) approaches diﬀer in their eﬃcacy. Additionally, we
planned to compare therapies that were delivered in a face-to-
face setting to internet-based interventions. Since the choice of
control group typically inﬂuences the eﬀect size (27), another
subgroup analysis was computed to investigate the impact of
control group conditions. We dichotomized the control groups
into non-speciﬁc and inactive control groups. While we considered
WL inactive comparisons, we classiﬁed psychological or attention
placebos, TAU, and enhanced care (e.g., TAU combined with
regular counseling or psychoeducation) as non-speciﬁc control
groups. Besides, we conducted subgroup analyses for the diﬀerent
diagnoses (i.e., disorders) included as recommended by Lakhan
and Shoﬁeld (12). Additionally, we examined the inﬂuence of
intensity as low-intensity treatments usually result
treatment
in smaller eﬀects [e.g., (2)]. Hence, a subgroup analysis was
performed comparing low- and high-intensity psychotherapy (28),
i.e., manuals with less than eight sessions vs. manuals with eight or
more sessions. In line with this, we performed an explorative meta-
regression on number of sessions. Another meta-regression was
conducted on therapy dosis, i.e., total time of therapy sessions in
minutes. We deviated from the registered moderator analyses: We
dichotomized some moderators to be able to form larger subgroups.
Further, no analyses on type of assessment were conducted.
Lastly, we were not able to conduct useful analyses on baseline
scores, neither on somatic symptom severity nor on comorbidities
(see Supplementary material for details on these deviations from
registered protocol).

2.9. Sensitivity analyses

A sensitivity analysis was performed to evaluate the use of the
random eﬀects model, comparing results in the meta-analyses using
ﬁxed eﬀect and random eﬀects models. In addition, based on outlier
analyses, we computed inﬂuence analyses (leave one out-method)
as well as Graphic Displays of Heterogeneity (GOSH plots)
to display study heterogeneity graphically (29). Lastly, another
sensitivity analysis was conducted to examine whether the selection
of scales in PHS due to our prioritization inﬂuenced results.

3. Results

3.1. Study selection

For study selection 1,242 reports were retrieved from the
databases. After deduplication 1,059 reports were screened. During
screening, 921 reports were excluded. Therefore, 138 full-texts
were retrieved and assessed for eligibility; 119 of which were
excluded after full-text assessment, e.g., 30 reports were excluded
as they were based on the same sample as another and did
not provide additional relevant data for this project. Finally,
we included k = 16 studies (with information gathered from
19 reports) including n = 1,288 participants randomized (see
Figure 1). We gathered additional data from Weissbecker et al.
(32), and Cash et al. (33) for the study by Sephton et al.
(34), and from Wicksell et al. (35) for Jensen et al. (36).
Interrater agreement for study selection was κ = 0.85, i.e., almost
perfect (37).

3.2. Study characteristics

All included studies focused on adults, one of which explicitly
focused on a student population (38). While ﬁve studies solely
examined women, participants were predominantly female in
all other studies. Of the included studies, seven focused on
ﬁbromyalgia (34, 36, 39–43), ﬁve on irritable bowel syndrome
(38, 44–47), one on chronic fatigue syndrome (48), two on
syndrome (49, 50), and one on medically
bodily distress
(51). Four of
unexplained symptoms
the included studies
implemented MBCT, seven studies MBSR, and ﬁve studies ACT.
Only two of the included studies combined either MBCT (51)
or MBSR (50) with methods from conventional CBT. Most
studies implemented the therapies in a group setting; only one
study (43) was internet-based and therefore patients participated
in an individual setting; another study (38) consisted of a
self-help approach following a group workshop. One study
(49) consisted of more than two potentially relevant arms:
extended ACT, brief ACT, and EC. We decided to include
the extended ACT arm as well as the EC condition and
excluded the brief ACT approach from the analyses. Control
involved WL (k = 7), TAU (k = 5), EC (k =
groups
3), and psychological placebo (a social support group, k =
1). TAU conditions were deﬁned as continuation of current
(40, 43, 47), continued medication (41, 45). All

3.3. Risk of bias

Overall RoB was high across all studies; details on the ratings of
individual studies are provided in the supplement. Three domains
were predominantly responsible for the high ratings: In the domain
“RoB in measurement of the outcome”, we rated the risk of bias as
high for all studies except for one. As blinding is rather diﬃcult
in psychotherapy trials, and almost impossible in the included
designs (e.g., WL vs. psychotherapy), we assumed that the assessors
for self-report measures (i.e., the participants themselves) were
probably aware of the therapy they received. Only in Gaylord et al.
(44) we rated RoB as low as participants perceived the support
group as credible as the intervention group. The evaluation of
“RoB in selection of reported results” required the availability
of a study protocol. Although nine studies provided a protocol,
these did not entail
information on the planned analyses. In
accordance with the RoB tool 2.0, for the domain “RoB due to
missing outcome data”, we rated all intention-to-treat methods as
adequate that allowed inclusion of all participants for whom data
were available.

Due to the initially low interrater reliability (κ = 0.59 for the
ﬁve domains; κ = 1 for overall RoB judgement) between FMgB and
LH, an additional research assistant independently rated all studies
with disagreement between the raters and studies identiﬁed in the
ﬁnal search update. This improved interrater reliability for these
studies (κ = 0.76; κ = 1 for overall RoB judgement).

3.4. Treatment effects—post-treatment

For the primary outcome, somatic symptom severity, 15 studies
provided data at post-treatment (n = 1,100). Results showed a
signiﬁcant eﬀect in favor of the “third wave“ therapies compared
to inactive and non-speciﬁc control conditions (g = −0.51, 95%CI
−0.69 to −0.32; see Figure 2 for a forest plot and Table 1 for more
detailed results on all outcomes). Heterogeneity was 52.8% (95%CI
15.1 to 73.8). All studies reported a measure of PHS (n = 1,221).
The aggregated eﬀect size was g = 0.41 (95%CI 0.11 to 0.72; forest
plots for all secondary outcomes are provided in the supplement).
Heterogeneity was considerable (83.7%, 95%CI 74.8 to 89.4). For
the comorbid psychopathologies the symptoms scores were also
reduced in the treatment groups compared to the control groups at
post-treatment. Results on depression of 13 studies, based on n =
980 participants, were aggregated to an eﬀect of g = −0.52 (95%CI
−0.82 to −0.23). Anxiety scores were provided in nine studies
(n = 687) at post–treatment, leading to an eﬀect of g = −0.38
(95%CI −0.65 to −0.11). For both comorbid psychopathologies,
heterogeneity was substantial (depression: 79.8%, anxiety: 67.4%).
The outcomes measures focussing on mechanisms in the “third
wave” therapies, i.e., mindfulness (k = 8, n = 603, g = 0.49,
95%CI 0.33 to 0.65), and psychological inﬂexibility (k = 3, n =
216, g = −0.47, 95%CI, −0.93 to −0.02) improved signiﬁcantly.
While the mean heterogeneity indicated that it might not be of
importance or only moderate, the respective 95%CIs were very
wide (see Table 1). For health anxiety and pain acceptance, the
eﬀects were not aggregated as only two studies reported measures
of each construct.

3.5. Treatment effects—short-term
follow-up

For the short-term follow-up period (up to 3 months post
treatment), somatic symptom severity was signiﬁcantly reduced
compared to the control conditions (k = 9, n = 500). The “third
wave“ therapies reduced somatic symptom severity in participants
(g = −0.45, 95%CI −0.72 to −0.19). PHS was again reported in all
studies that entailed a short–term follow–up (k = 10, n = 554). PHS
improved signiﬁcantly in the therapy arms compared to the control
conditions (g = 0.40, 95%CI 0.09 to 0.71). The improvements in
depression (k = 9, n = 508, g = −0.40, 95%CI −0.59 to −0.21),
and anxiety (k = 6, n = 326, g = −0.27, 95%CI −0.49 to −0.05)
were maintained at short–term follow–up. The additional outcome
mindfulness was reported in k = 6 studies (n = 333); the aggregated
eﬀect was g = 0.32 (95%CI 0.10 to 0.54) at short-term follow-up.
The estimates on quantiﬁed heterogeneity had rather wide 95%CIs
for all outcomes (see Table 1). Health anxiety was not reported
in any study at short-term follow-up; psychological inﬂexibility
(k = 2) and pain acceptance (k = 1) were too rarely reported at
short-term follow-up to be aggregated.

3.6. Treatment effects—long-term
follow-up

Only six (n = 591) studies reported the primary outcome,
somatic symptom severity, at follow-up periods longer than 3
months (mean follow–up period was ∼9.57 months, SD = 3.55).
Nonetheless, for these studies the aggregated eﬀect was signiﬁcant
(g = −0.40, 95%CI −0.79 to −0.002). However, we could not ﬁnd
a signiﬁcant eﬀect at long–term follow–up for PHS (k = 6, n =
635; g = 0.44, 95%CI −0.19 to 1.08). While we found a signiﬁcant
eﬀect for anxiety (k = 3, n = 346, g = −0.62, 95%CI −1.12 to
−0.11), the eﬀect on depression (k = 4, n = 453, g = −0.47,
95%CI −1.08 to 0.14) was not signiﬁcant at long–term follow–
up anymore. For the exploratory outcome mindfulness, only three
studies (n = 309) reported results at follow–ups longer than 3
months after end of treatment. These ﬁndings did not result in a
signiﬁcant aggregated eﬀect (g = 0.37, 95%CI −0.06 to 0.81). For all
outcomes, heterogeneity was substantial to considerable. Only two
studies reported health anxiety and only one study each reported
psychological inﬂexibility and pain acceptance at follow-up. Hence,
eﬀects were not aggregated for these outcomes.

3.7. Moderator analyses

When comparing acceptance-based therapies (ACT) with the
mindfulness-based therapies (MBCT and MBSR) we did not ﬁnd a
signiﬁcant group diﬀerence for somatic symptom severity (psubgroup
= 0.658). For the acceptance–based therapies (k = 5) the eﬀect
was g = −0.59 (95%CI −1.07 to −0.10) and for mindfulness–
based therapies (k = 10) it was g = −0.47 (95%CI −0.62 to
−0.33). However, heterogeneity was larger in acceptance–based
therapies (I² = 81.8%) than in mindfulness–based therapies (I² =
0.00%). We did not ﬁnd a signiﬁcant eﬀect of type of treatment in

any other outcome, either (more detailed results on all moderator
analyses can be found in the Supplementary material). As we
only identiﬁed one study that implemented an internet-based
intervention, we did not perform a subgroup analysis for modus
of treatment (face-to-face vs. internet-based). When dichotomising
control groups into inactive and non-speciﬁc control conditions,
we did not ﬁnd signiﬁcant subgroup diﬀerences for any outcome,
either. Regarding subgroup analyses for the diﬀerent diagnoses (i.e.,
disorders) included, we could only examine diﬀerences between
the subgroups of irritable bowel syndrome and ﬁbromyalgia as all
other subgroups did not hold enough studies (k < 3). Here, we did
not ﬁnd signiﬁcant subgroup diﬀerences for any outcome. Therapy
dosis (i.e., total duration of therapy sessions) was not a signiﬁcant
moderator for any outcome, neither was the number of sessions.
We did not ﬁnd signiﬁcant subgroup diﬀerences between low- and
high-intensity treatments for any outcome. We did not examine
moderators for follow-up periods as we only found little studies for
these intervals.

3.8. Sensitivity analyses

The sensitivity analysis comparing use of the random eﬀects
model to the ﬁxed eﬀect model did not reveal major diﬀerences.
As expected, the 95%CIs were larger in the meta-analyses based
on the random eﬀects model. The sensitivity analyses concerning
the choice of PHS scales did not result in meaningful diﬀerences.

In the outlier analyses, we identiﬁed two outliers for somatic
symptom severity (39, 49), as well as for PHS (39, 51), and one
outlier for depression (39) at post-treatment. After excluding the
outliers, the eﬀect sizes decreased for all three outcomes. That is,
the lower end of the 95%CIs of all outliers was above the upper
end of the 95%CI for the respective pooled eﬀect. Furthermore, the
mean I² values decreased when the outliers were excluded from
the analyses. However, the 95%CIs for the heterogeneity in the
analyses with outliers and without outliers still overlapped. We
did not identify any outliers for anxiety or mindfulness at post-
treatment. Details on the sensitivity analyses can be found in the
Supplementary material.

3.9. Publication Bias

Eggers’ test did not indicate the presence of funnel plot
asymmetry for any outcome at post-treatment (see Figure 3 for
the contour-enhanced funnel plot for somatic symptom severity
at post-treatment; details and funnel plots for all other outcomes
are provided in the supplement). However, for anxiety as well as
for mindfulness, power might not have been adequate to detect
a potential bias. Furthermore, for health anxiety, psychological
inﬂexibility, and pain acceptance we did not analyse publication
bias due to the small number of studies. In the p-curve analyses,
we found that evidential value was present for all outcomes at
post-treatment as far as it was possible to determine (p-curves

size restrictions.

depression. The latter was straightforwardly operationalised in the
included studies by using established self-report depression scales
for assessment.

4. Discussion

For adults with bodily distress, the eﬀects of the included
“third wave” therapies (ACT, MBCT, and MBSR) at post-treatment
indicate a reduction in somatic symptom severity, and of comorbid
symptoms of depression and anxiety. Further, results suggest an
improvement related to PHS, reﬂected by an increased (health-
related) quality of life and a reduction of impairments due to
illness. The eﬀects at short-term follow-up (up to 3 months) suggest
maintenance of the eﬀects in somatic symptom severity. The
eﬀects on PHS, depression, and anxiety were maintained as well.
However, the eﬀects at long-term follow-up on somatic symptom
severity and anxiety were small; the eﬀects on PHS and depression
were insigniﬁcant.

At post-treatment and short-term follow-up, we found small to
medium eﬀect sizes. On the long run, eﬀects on somatic symptom
severity and anxiety were small. That is, the mindfulness- and
acceptance based therapies are more eﬀective than inactive and
non-speciﬁc control conditions. However, there was a signiﬁcant
amount of heterogeneity. While one might deem the broad
deﬁnition in PHS accountable for the amount of the substantial
heterogeneity in the eﬀects on this measure, we want to point
that we also found a large amount of heterogeneity in
out

All in all, the eﬀects are in line with previous research. In
comparison to former meta-analyses in the ﬁeld, the data base for
this meta-analysis was considerably improved. A certain overlap
(k = 6) with Lakhan and Schoﬁeld’s (12) meta-analysis was given.
That is, half of their included trials were incorporated in our
analyses, too. Six of the nine total studies included in the latest
meta-analysis on “third wave” therapies in ﬁbromyalgia (10) were
also identiﬁed in the present meta-analysis. However, these former
projects included not only a quasi-randomized controlled trial (52),
but also trials that did not solely rely on established “third wave”
therapy manuals. Findings here included short-term maintenance
of treatment eﬀects and,
in some outcomes, over the longer
follow-up. In a previous work (12) the reported outcomes were
descriptively smaller. Still, the 95%CIs overlapped. The overlap
of conﬁdence intervals does not necessarily imply that the results
are comparable, however, it can be an indicator that they are. In
Haugmark et al. (10), the eﬀect on health-related quality of life
was larger than our eﬀect on PHS which might be attributed to
diﬀerences in operationalisation decisions. However, the 95%CIs
overlapped here as well. Lakhan and Schoﬁeld (12) did not
aggregate follow-up eﬀects meta-analytically.
Although the eﬀects are only small

to moderate, ACT,
MBCT, and MBSR may be clinically useful, as the main goal in
psychotherapy approaches for bodily distress is not a full remission,
but to enable patients to adaptively cope with their symptoms

Frontiers in Psychiatry

(53). While the “third wave“ therapies and conventional CBT were
not directly compared, the eﬀect sizes we found are comparable
to those of conventional CBT (1). This means that mindfulness-
and acceptance-based therapies could possibly pose an eﬀective
treatment alternative for patients suﬀering from bodily distress.

While some patients might beneﬁt more from these “third
wave” therapies than from CBT, speciﬁc predictors still have to
be identiﬁed. Hence, we included measures of potential change
mechanisms as exploratory outcomes. Mindfulness, central to
MBCT and MBSR, improved signiﬁcantly at post-treatment, and
this eﬀect was maintained at short-term follow-up. However,
at
long-term follow-up the eﬀect was no longer signiﬁcant.
Psychological inﬂexibility was lower at post-treatment in the groups
that received “third wave” therapies, indicating that ACT in fact
tackles psychological inﬂexibility. Overall, the number of follow-
up studies on mechanism variables is very small, and no data could
be integrated for psychological inﬂexibility or pain acceptance due
to lack of studies. It also remains unclear whether these eﬀects
are associated with the changes in clinical outcomes, as it was not
possible to examine this relationship in this meta-analysis.

The moderator analyses did not identify relevant sources of
heterogeneity. That is, e.g., the eﬀect on somatic symptom severity
seems to be independent of the speciﬁc type of treatment and
treatment intensity or dosis. However, subgroup and moderator
analyses usually lack power (54). Consequently, non-signiﬁcant
results do not necessarily indicate that there is no eﬀect. Generally,
for the outcomes that were seldomly reported, the 95%CIs were
larger due to limited accuracy. As the number of studies decreased
for the follow-up periods, the conﬁdence intervals grew larger
for the other outcomes, too. Same goes for the accuracy of the
heterogeneity measure. Therefore, we advise researchers to comply
to the core domains of bodily distress recommended by the
EURONET-SOMA group (13), as conclusions could not be drawn
for all of them.

Furthermore, almost all studies evaluated treatments in a group
setting,
including the studies on ACT—which is not a group
program per se. Thus, the eﬃcacy of ACT, MBCT, and MBSR as
individual therapy cannot be assessed (we also did not ﬁnd evidence
that the study implementing ACT in an individual (internet-based)
setting (43) had a substantial impact on the results). Individual
therapy may have the advantage of being better tailored to the
individual problem and treatment goal (4). However, treatments
with group format could have the advantage of being more cost-
eﬃcient. Nonetheless, except for the social support group condition
in one trial (44), all control groups in the included studies were
individual-focused rather than group therapy-focused. Therefore,
we cannot determine whether the eﬀects of the included “third
wave” therapies may have been inﬂuenced by the group component.
It is possible, for example, that certain desirable eﬀects result from
the social support in groups alone (55).

A factor limiting generalization of results to the wide scope of
bodily distress is that most included studies were on functional
somatic syndromes and only three on other conditions within
the category of somatoform disorders. It is noteworthy that so
far there is no study that investigated the eﬃcacy of “third wave”
therapies in Somatic Symptom Disorder or bodily distress disorder,
i.e., recently introduced classiﬁcation approaches predominantly
focussing on the excessive psychobehavioral components of

bodily distress. Mindfulness-based or acceptance and commitment
therapy might be especially useful for these disorders as they could
help in reducing excessive psychobehavioral symptoms such as
excessive symptom related preoccupation and worries as well as
experiential avoidance.

The results need to be interpreted in the light of potential
biases. RoB ratings were rather high for the included studies. Some
domains lead to high RoB ratings when studies were designed
according to conventions in psychotherapy trials in bodily distress.
For example, all outcome scores relied on self-reports increasing
RoB scores in the domain “RoB in measurement of the outcome”.
That is, we considered the patients as outcome assessors which were
probably not blinded due to a lack of convincing (placebo-)control
groups (56). In the “RoB in the selection of reported results”
most studies were rated high for the majority of outcomes.
However, selective reporting of analyses could not be examined in
most registrations (e.g., on clinicaltrials.gov) as the templates lack
options to provide information on analysis plans.

Our analysis had several strengths. We complied with current
guidelines on conducting, analyzing, and reporting meta-analytic
results. Based on a preregistered rational, we examined eﬃcacy
on various manifestations of bodily distress. Furthermore, we
integrated follow-up eﬀects of the included “third wave” therapies,
for which aggregated data for the entire ﬁeld of bodily distress was
previously lacking [e.g., (12)].

However, there were some conceptual limitations to this study.
First and foremost, the deﬁnition for “third wave” therapies that
was used in this study solely entailed MBCT, MBSR, and ACT.
Subsequently, this project allows statements regarding the eﬃcacy
of these three therapies, which have now been the subject of
a number of studies in bodily distress. However, an assessment
regarding the eﬃcacy of other “third wave” approaches (like meta-
cognitive therapy) is currently not possible, yet. Apart from that,
only inactive and non-speciﬁc control groups were taken into
account which could result in an overestimation of the eﬀect sizes
(27). No conclusions can be drawn regarding the eﬃcacy of “third
wave” therapies in comparison to other active treatments, especially
evidence-based treatments.

Lastly, we did not include gray literature, i.e., unpublished

reports. Nonetheless, there was no indication of publication bias.

4.1. Prospects

Future updates of this meta-analysis would be a useful tool to
include new ﬁndings in the ﬁeld of psychotherapy in adults with
bodily distress; ideally incorporating all core outcome domains in
bodily distress as well as more long-term follow-ups. Moreover,
it might be useful to collect individual patient data, i.e., primary
data from RCTs, and combine them into one dataset to enable
researchers to identify mediators and moderators of eﬀects in “third
wave” therapies. Nonetheless, larger trials are needed, preferably
RCTs that help to identify mechanisms in symptom reduction.
Future RCTs should also implement control groups that control
for unspeciﬁc eﬀects in the intervention examined, e.g., peer-
support as a group component in group therapy. Considering
the distribution of diagnoses within our sample, more studies on

4.2. Conclusions and implications

The results of this meta-analysis suggest that ACT, MBCT, and
MBSR can be beneﬁcial treatment approaches for bodily distress
in adults, showing improvements in somatic symptom severity,
comorbid psychopathology, and perceived health status. This meta-
analysis provides a good summary of the current state of research of
the included “third wave” therapies’ eﬃcacy in bodily distress using
an enlarged data base due to the focus on bodily distress and not
solely focussing on a single syndrome or symptom. All in all, these
results could form the basis for these “third wave” therapies to be
included in treatment guidelines, while acknowledging that more
research is needed to reliably draw conclusions on the eﬃcacy in all
relevant domains of bodily distress—especially in the long run.
