Abstract: Perinatal death is the death of a baby that occurs between the 22nd week of pregnancy (or
when the baby weighs more than 500 g) and 7 days after birth. After perinatal death, parents experi-
ence the process of perinatal grief. Midwives and nurses can develop interventions to improve the
perinatal grief process. The aim of this review was to determine the efﬁcacy of nursing interventions
to facilitate the process of grief as a result of perinatal death. A systematic review of the literature was
carried out. Studies that met the selection criteria underwent a quality assessment using the Joanna
Briggs Institute critical appraisal tool. Four articles were selected out of the 640 found. Two are
quasi-experimental studies, and two are randomized controlled clinical studies. The interventions
that were analyzed positively improve psychological self-concept and role functions, as well as
mutual commitment, depression, post-traumatic stress and symptoms of grief. These interventions
are effective if they are carried out both before perinatal loss and after it has occurred. The support
of health professionals for affected parents, their participation in the loss, expressing feelings and
emotions, using distraction methods, group sessions, social support, physical activity, and family
education are some of the effective interventions.

Keywords: perinatal death; perinatal loss; perinatal grief; nursing; midwifery

1. Introduction

Perinatal death (PD) is the death of a baby that occurs between the 22nd week of
pregnancy (or more than 500 g of weight) and seven days after birth [1]. PD is a global
health problem, and although it has been reduced, 2.6 million perinatal deaths occurred
in the world in 2017 [2]. In Europe, there were between 4 and 6 deaths per 1000 births [3].
In Spain, perinatal deaths have decreased from 20 deaths per 1000 births in 1975 to 4.37
deaths per 1000 births in 2019 [4]. PD can occur as a result of maternal conditions [5]
such as high blood pressure [6], anemia [7], diabetes, bacterial infections; fetal conditions
such as congenital anomalies, intrauterine growth retardation, or multiple pregnancy;
placental conditions such as premature detachment of the placenta or bleeding; uterine
conditions such as uterine malformation; delivery conditions such as asphyxia during
delivery hypoxia [8], umbilical cord prolapse [9], or complications of caesarean section [10]
and other unclassiﬁable or unclear conditions [11,12].

After PD, parents experience the perinatal grief process [13], which affects them
on biopsychosocial and spiritual levels [14]. Thus, parents may experience depression,

anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder [13], eating and sleeping disorders [15], isolation
and loss of faith [16], among other symptoms. The incidence of PD, as well as its important
consequences, suggests the need to train nurses in this area [17]. Such training is essential in
order to offer the highest possible quality of care based on the needs of the affected fathers
and mothers [18]. Furthermore, good professional care based on empathy and emotional
support has been shown to help families in the grieving process [19]. Professionals can
also suggest practical measures to help the bereaved to cope with and overcome grief, such
as holding the baby, and taking a photograph of the moment. Support groups are also
effective in dealing with a loss of this type [20].

Nurses and midwives often perform interventions to help parents who have suffered
a perinatal death, in fact, nurses are one of the main sources of support. However, the im-
portant work of nurses in these situations is hampered by the lack of recognized strategies
that can be implemented to assist parents and family members in the grieving process [21].
Additionally, are these interventions effective in helping fathers and mothers who have
suffered a perinatal loss to deal with or resolve grief? Although there was a recent review of
the literature on the efﬁcacy of interventions on grief after an abortion [22], perinatal grief
(between 22 weeks and one week of life) has not been well studied. A speciﬁc review on
this topic (PD) published in 2013 did not ﬁnd studies of interventions speciﬁcally focused
on perinatal bereavement [23]. Therefore, eight years later, a systematic review can be
justiﬁed; the aim of this review was to analyze the available evidence on the efﬁcacy of
nursing interventions to facilitate the process of grief as a result of perinatal death.

2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Design

We conducted a systematic review of studies of interventions by following the
Cochrane Handbooks [24] and the recommendations of the Preferred Reporting Items
for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guideline, [25].

2.2. Search Methods

A literature search was conducted using four electronic data bases (PubMed, Scopus,
Web of Science and Cochrane Library) between January and June 2020. The PICO question
was used as a search strategy to identify possible studies, using a combination of natural
and structured language, and Medical Subject Headings (MeSH).

The keywords were systematically combined in order to conduct the literature search:
“perinatal bereavement” AND “nursing care”; “perinatal death” AND “nursing”; “perina-
tal loss” AND “nurse”; “perinatal grief” AND “nurse”. The databases were queried using
titles, abstracts, and the keywords.

In addition to searching the cited databases for studies, speciﬁc searches were made in
a number of specialized journals such as Advanced Neonatal Care, and BMC Pregnancy and
Childbirth. The reference lists of included articles were also reviewed for additional sources.
The document selection was carried out independently by two researchers, and
disagreements between them were settled by consensus. First, previously unidentiﬁed
duplicates were eliminated. Then the titles and abstracts of the remaining articles were
screened to identify eligible papers reviewed in full text.

2.3. Selection Criteria

The criteria for inclusion of studies in this review were: (1) studies published in the
last 5 years; (2) studies published in English or Spanish; (3) quasi-experimental studies or
randomized clinical trials (RCTs).

The criteria for exclusion were: (1) studies on interventions in women who are less
than 14 weeks pregnant; (2) studies that do not describe speciﬁc interventions in a group
of women.

2.4. Search Outcomes

In the identiﬁcation phase, the search of the data bases yielded 590 articles and
50 articles from other previously mentioned sources, for a total of 640 articles. We checked
how many of them were duplicates (270), which resulted in a total of 370 articles.

In the screening phase, after reading the title, 329 studies were discarded, with 41 arti-
cles remaining after the eligibility phase. After reading the abstract, 31 were eliminated,
and another 6 were discarded for other reasons as shown in Figure 1. There were 4 articles
left in the inclusion phase (Figure 1).

2.5. Quality Appraisal

The methodological quality of the studies was assessed using the Joanna Briggs
Institute (JBI) critical appraisal tool [26]. There were 9 questions to guide the evaluation
of quasi-experimental studies and 13 for the evaluation of RCTs. The questions were
quantiﬁed using scores from 0 to 1. One point is given if the answer is “YES” and zero
points if the answer is “NO”, “not clear” or “not applicable.” (Tables 1 and 2).

2.6. Risk of Bias

We applied the Cochrane Collaboration tool [24] to assess the risk of bias in the studies,
rating each criterion as having a high, unclear, or low risk of bias (Figure 2). All four studies
were low risk in relation to random sequence generation. One study reported low risk
for allocation concealment bias, and the rest were high risk. Two of the studies provided
sufﬁcient information on the blinding of the participants, and their risk of performance
bias was rated as low, while the other two studies did not provide sufﬁcient information
and were therefore classiﬁed as high risk. All four studies had a high risk of detection bias,
as they did not clearly describe the methods used to blindly assess the outcome measures.
A high risk of attrition bias was observed in one of the studies, with the rest of the studies
presenting a low risk. Regarding selective reporting bias, two of the studies had borderline

risk and the other two had low risk. Finally, one study showed an unlikely risk of conﬂict
of interest.

bias): 4: Blinding of outcome assessment (detection bias); 5: Incomplete outcome data (attrition bias);
6: Selective reporting of results (reporting bias); 7: Other bias (conﬂict of interests).

2.7. Data Abstraction and Synthesis

Two independent reviewers (A.F.-F., M.I.V.-M.) independently selected and extracted
information from the four studies included in this review. Following the Cochrane Hand-
book, we created a template with the following titles for reviewers to independently extract
the information: ﬁrst author’s name, year of publication, study location, study design,
sample size, duration of intervention, characteristics of the participants (gestational age
and age of women), characteristics of the intervention, outcome measures, and main ﬁnd-
ings. The reviewers used this template to extract data from all four studies. Then a third
experienced reviewer, M.M.R.-M., veriﬁed the extracted data. A summary of the extracted
data can be seen in Table 3. We carried out a narrative synthesis of the ﬁndings based on
the characteristics of the interventions, the variables studied, and the reported ﬁndings.

3. Results
3.1. Narrative Summary

This systematic review included four studies out of a total of 640. Of the four studies
chosen, two of them were randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs), and two were quasi-
experimental intervention studies. The two RCTs studied women who were pregnant and
required termination of pregnancy. The two quasi-experimental studies examined women
who had experienced perinatal or fetal death prior to the intervention. Table 3 shows the
main characteristics of the included studies.

Navidian et al. [27] determined the effect of behavior-based cognitive counselling on
the severity of bereavement symptoms in mothers after fetal death. They conducted a
quasi-experimental study with a sample of 100 pregnant women.

In addition, Navidian et al. [28] determined the effect of grief counselling on the
severity of symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder in mothers after fetal death in a
quasi-experimental study with a sample of 100 pregnant women.

Sun et al. [29] analyzed whether a family support program could improve family
support and alleviate depression and post-traumatic stress symptoms in pregnant women
with fetal abnormalities. To do this, they performed a randomized controlled trial with a
sample of 124 pregnant women.

Kaydiraket al. [30] evaluated the effectiveness of a nursing support program for the
medical termination of pregnancy, according to the Roy adaptation model (physiological
adaptation, self-concept, function, and mutual dependence). In order to do this, they
conducted a randomized controlled trial with a sample of 77 pregnant women.

3.2. Intervention Details

The duration and frequency of the interventions in the studies varied with regard to
the interviews conducted with the experimental group and the control group. This is the
case of one of the studies that conducted ﬁve interviews with the experimental group and
two with the control group [30]. Another study carried out the intervention over a 6-week
period and then did follow ups for 15 to 20 min by telephone or WeChat (platform created)
2 weeks after the birth [29], and the other two studies reviewed carried out the intervention
in 60 min sessions over two weeks [27,28].

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 5587

All of the studies performed the interventions at an individual level except one, which
did so at a group level [29]. The interventions were carried out by nurses in one of the
studies [30], and in another, by a multidisciplinary team (a psychologist, two obstetric
doctors, a researcher and two nurses) [29]. The other two remaining studies did not specify
who performed the interventions [27,28].

3.3. Characteristics of Participants

The participants were pregnant women with a gestational age of more than 20 weeks [30],
women who had experienced still birth (at least 7–10 days after loss) and a gestational age
of more than 22 weeks [27,28], and women with a history of fetal death (1 to 3 perinatal
losses) with a gestational age between 28–29 weeks and full term (28), and were at least
18 years old [27–30].

3.4. Intervention Outcomes

The interventions analyzed are used to improve the level of anxiety, post-traumatic
stress, depression, and the symptoms of grief. These interventions are effective if they
are performed both before perinatal loss and after it has occurred. In all four studies, the
results were signiﬁcantly more positive in the intervention group; however, in one, the
psychological, self-concept and role functions, as well as mutual commitment improved
signiﬁcantly in the experimental group except in terms of anxiety and nausea and vomit-
ing [30]. In two of the studies, counselling given to mothers reduced grief symptoms [27,28].
In another study, family APGAR scores and depression and post-traumatic stress scores
were signiﬁcantly better in the intervention group [29].

4. Discussion

In this review, we systematically examined the efﬁcacy of interventions to help griev-
ing as a result of perinatal death. Four studies met the selection criteria and were subjected
to a critical quality analysis. Two of them report interventions performed before perinatal
death [29,30], and two studies examine interventions performed after perinatal death had
occurred [27,28]. The interventions were found to vary in duration, frequency, and content,
making comparison between studies difﬁcult [24].

Interventions performed prior to perinatal death show that support based on Roy’s
adaptation model (the process and outcome by which people with thoughts and feelings,
individually or in groups, use conscious awareness and choose to create human and
environmental integration) and social support both help with coping and reduce anxiety in
women [30]. The information that parents receive about what they are going to experience
is important [31]. Parents must be prepared and informed about the process [29].

In the interventions carried out after perinatal loss, it was concluded that psychoe-
ducation, psychotherapies, physical activity, and group sessions improved depression
and sleep [27,28]. This is consistent with the studies by Beddoe et al. [32], which show
that physical activity reduces stress and anxiety, and Nikˇcevi´c et al. [33], who found that
psychological support improved stress and depression symptoms. Similarly, Shaohua and
Shorey concluded that psychosocial interventions are effective in improving depression,
anxiety, and grief amongst parents with perinatal loss [34], and a study by Fuentetaja
and Villaverde suggests that group sessions potentialize the individual capacities of each
person [35].

Not all the studies analyzed involved the family or the spouse in the interventions.
Other studies suggest that some relatives have insufﬁcient knowledge or skills and resort
to avoidance of the topic, which leads to increased anxiety [36]. Educating women, spouses
and extended family about PD and grief is a good way to improve the grieving process [37].
Health education could be useful in places where the education level of the population
is lower [38]. In other, more technologically advanced contexts, where this knowledge can
be accessed more easily, technological tools such as online yoga [39] could be used. Kaydi-
rak and Aslan used telephone calls to contact women and provide follow up [30]. However,

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 5587

8 of 11

Navidian and Saravanide showed that face-to-face (patient–therapist) psychotherapy inter-
ventions are more effective for grief symptoms [27].

Other studies mention the importance of the physical conditions of hospital rooms [18]
and of women having a voice in decision-making (some women are afraid of not being
able to do so) [40].

Despite the number of interventions that demonstrate an improvement in the grieving
process, none of the studies that we analyzed mention other ways to facilitate grief, for
example, photographing the baby, keeping a memory box or holding the baby after delivery.
However, there are other types of qualitative research studies that address these issues.
There are different opinions regarding these coping measures, some parents state that
seeing the dead baby is an opportunity to say “goodbye” and ﬁx it in their memory [41].
These parents suffer less post-traumatic stress than those who have not seen their baby [42].
On the other hand, the shock that this causes and the decision not to see the baby in
order to cut the attachment may avoid greater suffering [41] as this can cause considerable
anxiety [43]. However, no study has been found that has conducted experimental research
to ﬁnd the efﬁcacy of these coping measures, so we can only be guided by the opinions of
parents through interviews.

Inevitably, this analysis raises many questions such as: What do mothers and parents
need? How do they prefer to cope with their loss? Do they want to hold the baby? How
much privacy should they be given? Do we care for them on the postnatal ward with other
mothers and healthy babies?

These are questions that any professional would ask, and they are difﬁcult to answer
without input from parents. It is essential to create a link with parents and facilitate com-
munication between health professionals and the patient in order to know their needs [44].
For health professionals, this is not so simple; nurses and midwives report not knowing
how to create memories of the baby for the parents or not having sufﬁcient skills in grief
counselling [45]. The coping strategies mentioned above are rarely used in hospitals; in
one study, 20% of participating midwives had never offered mementos of the baby, and
only 20% of them had suggested taking a photo of the baby [46]. Studies have highlighted
the importance of nurses and midwives being prepared [47] and trained [48] to implement
interventions for perinatal grief [49] since this group is best positioned to be “constant
caregivers” [50].

Limitations

Study limitations include the intervention by Navidian and Saravani [27], which was
performed within the ﬁrst weeks after the loss of the baby (7–10 days had passed since the
baby’s death). This hinders the accuracy of the data since symptoms are stronger initially
and may improve not only with the intervention but also with the passage of time and
the assimilation of loss [51]. The two interventions by Navidian [27,28] are two different
studies that use the same participants and the same interventions, but each one uses a
different outcome assessment tool, the grief scale [27] and post-traumatic stress [28].

This systematic review has several limitations. Firstly, given the scarcity of interven-
tion studies, including a wider variety of quantitative and qualitative designs would have
provided more information, and more global, but less precise, conclusions could have
been drawn.

Secondly, only studies in Spanish and English were recovered. Including other lan-

guages (Chinese, French, Portuguese) could have provided additional studies.

Finally, we found studies in which women with a wide range of gestational ages were
subject to interventions. Some women met the criterion of at least 14 weeks, others lost
their baby at a higher gestational age, and others did so earlier. However, this wide range
was considered too broad, with the interventions and levels of anxiety and grief varying
greatly from week to week. Including these studies could have resulted in a higher number
of articles and different viewpoints.

5. Conclusions

The interventions that were helpful to parents after PD were the support of health
professionals for those affected, health education to understand the process and allow them
to take part in the loss, the expression of feelings and emotions, distraction methods, group
sessions, social support, physical activity and family education. These activities improve
anxiety, feelings of grief, sleep, and self-conﬁdence.

These support interventions for families experiencing perinatal loss are effective if

they are carried out both before (if foreseeable) and after the death of the baby.

The interventions are mainly focused on the woman whereas the fathers remain in the
background, even though they also feel the loss. Studies are needed that include fathers in
nursing activities and interventions.

To address perinatal death in the right way, health professionals must feel safe and
well trained. It is necessary to train nurses to face these circumstances with conﬁdence,
compassion and conﬁdence.
