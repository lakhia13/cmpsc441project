Attention-deficit Hyperactivity 
Disorder and Autism Spectrum 
Disorder: Towards Better 
Diagnosis and Management 

Kholoud Al Ghamdi1, Jawaher AlMusailhi2

ABSTRACT
Background: Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHA) is one of the most common 

comorbid disorders of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) that can accompany autism, trig-

gered by it, or be a consequence of it. Objective: This review explored the prevalence of the 

comorbidity of both disorders, neurobiological background, symptoms, latest assessment 

methods, and therapeutic approaches. Results and Discussion: It concluded that effective 

assessment, diagnosis and management of ADHD in ASD children and adults is essential 

for this group of patients to thrive and live a good quality of life. Further research is recom-

mended to explore the most effective intervention for such important members of our soci-

ety. Conclusion: More studies are needed to understand the mechanisms underlying these 

comorbidities, and to prevent the misdiagnosis and mismanagement of these disorders. 

Also, to develop up to date personalized therapeutic plans for such children.

Keywords: AdHd, ASd, Comorbidity, Assessment, Management.

1.  BACKGROUNd

Autism is a spectrum disorder affecting the neurodevelopment of children 
worldwide.  The  American  psychiatric  association,  in  their  latest  edition  of 
the  diagnostic  and  statistical  manual  of  mental  disorders  (DSM5),  defines 
autism  spectral  disorder  (ASD)  as  a  neurodevelopmental  disorder  charac-
terized by deficits in social communications, where individuals understand 
social  interactions  and  communications  differently  compared  to  others,  as 
well as repetitive behavior and restricted interest (1). 

ASD is a spectrum of neurodevelopmental disorders that ranges between 
autism,  Asperger’s  syndrome,  and  pervasive  developmental  disorder-not 
otherwise  specified.  It  has  been  estimated  lately  that  1  in  36  children  may 
suffer  from  ASD,  indicating  the  importance  of  understanding  the  mecha-
nism of ASD and developing therapeutic regimens to tackle the spread of this 
disorder effectively (2). Also, approximately 75% of patients with ASD suffer 
from  comorbid  psychiatric  illnesses  such  as  attention-deficit  hyperactivity 
disorder (ADHD), obsessive-compulsive disorder, anxiety, bipolar disorder, 
depression, and Tic disorders including Tourette syndrome (3). 

ASD children rarely interact and communicate with others and may dis-
play unique motor or verbal behaviors in comparison to children with ADHD 
who  are  usually  distracted,  pay  little  attention  in  class,  and  have  difficulty 
sustaining mental efforts. ASD has many similarities to ADHD, but there are 
also  differences  between  the  two.  Both  disorders  are  considered  neurode-
velopment disorders, however, their diagnosis can be at different ages. ASD 
for example is usually diagnosed at earlier ages before even the child is three 
years  old,  while  ADHD  diagnosis  is  not  confirmed  until  the  child  is  older. 
ASD and ADHD are neurobiological disorders that manifest neuropsycho-
logical deficits similarly. These two disorders have also been linked geneti-
cally (4) and environmentally (5) such as preterm delivery.

2.  PREVALENCE OF AdHd IN ASd

The  prevalence  of  ASD  is  increasing  steadily  with  year  (6).  This  may  be 
attributed to the presence of more accurate screening methods and/or the 
availability of highly trained clinicians and more aware caregivers who can 
identify the signs of the disorder at early stages. ASD is a neurodevelopmental

spectrum disorder with symptoms that can be attributed 
to either hyper- and/or hypo-reactivity to sensory stim-
uli. Its manifestation varies between individuals. ADHD 
is  characterized  by  an  ongoing  pattern  of  inattention 
and/or  hyperactivity-impulsivity  that  affects  the  indi-
vidual’s  daily  functions  and  productivity.  Even  though 
both ASD and ADHD are common neurodevelopmental 
disorders, the prevalence of ADHD is approximately 5% 
(7), compared to around 1% for ASD (8). 

The  prevalence  of  ADHD  in  individuals  with  ASD 
according  to  a  recent  meta-analysis  ranged  from  50  to 
70% (9). Also, a recent study showed that approximately 
13% of children who were diagnosed with ADHD were 
also diagnosed with ASD. This co-occurrence was higher 
among  younger  children  (ages  4-11)  in  comparison  to 
older  children  (ages  12-17)  (10).  Also,  there  is  genetic 
evidence  for  overlapping  autistic  traits  and  ADHD 
behaviors among twins, suggesting that ASD individuals 
are more susceptible to having ADHD than the general 
population (11).

3.  NEUROBIOLOGICAL ASPECTS OF AdHd IN ASd
Considering  the  high  prevalence  of  ADHD  in  ASD 
children,  understanding  the  pathophysiology  and  the 
neurobiological aspects of the comorbidity of those two 
disorders is of great importance. ENIGMA‐ADHD and 
ENIGMA‐ASD  consists  of  research  groups  in  imaging 
genomics,  neurology,  and  psychiatry,  that  were  estab-
lished  to  understand  functional  anatomy  of  the  brain, 
based on Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), Diffusion 
tensor imaging (DTI), functional MARI (fMRI), genetic 
data  of  certain  diseases  (12).  Regarding  the  subcorti-
cal  volume  analysis,  both  disorders  showed  compara-
ble  volume  decreases  of  certain  basal  ganglia  neurons 
in the brain such as the putamen as well as other deep 
brain  structures  including  the  amygdala,  and  nucleus 
accumbens when compared to controls. Also, the thick-
ness  of  the  temporal  lobes  in  both  disorders  was  low, 
while the frontal lobes of ASD individuals only showed 
increased cortical thickness in comparison to controls. 
The difference between the two disorders was also man-
ifested in the surface area of the brain. The overall sur-
face area of ADHD individuals was significantly smaller 
compared  to  controls,  while  ASD  patients  showed  no 
difference  in  their  surface  area  compared  to  controls. 
Additionally,  the  average  intracranial  volume  (ICV)  of 
children  with  ASD  was  higher  compared  both  to  con-
trols and cases with ADHD. Also, the cortical thickness 
of certain brain regions such as the orbitofrontal, infe-
rior  frontal  and  cingulate  areas  was  low  in  adults  with 
ADHD compared with ASD cases and healthy controls 
(13). 

In addition to changes in the grey matter of the brain, 
the  white  matter  was  also  affected  in  such  diseases. 
Diffusion  tensor  imaging  (DTI)  studies  showed  atypi-
cal white matter patterns in both ASD and ADHD. The 
white matter transfers and integrates substantial infor-
mation  between  gray  matter  regions.  Abnormalities  in 
white matter may indicate the reason behind many psy-
chiatric disorders. The two most used diffusion metrics 

in DTI studies are fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean 
diffusivity  (MD).  FA  correlates  with  coherence  and 
integrity  of  white  matter  fibres  while  MD  is  indicative 
of cell density (14). It was reported that FA was reduced 
in the splenium of the corpus callosum in both ADHD 
and ASD individuals, and in the genu of corpus callosum 
of ASD individuals only. Also, MD was increased in the 
posterior thalamic radiation in ASD (15). 

Moreover,  studies  of  event-related  potentials  (ERPs) 
have shown that there is a distinct structural profile for 
ASD the differed from that of ADHD. ADHD symptoms 
were more linked to impaired inhibition, the pathophys-
iological  essence  of  ADHD  (16).  Also,  electroenceph-
alogram  (EEG)  studies  showed  that  ADHD  presented 
usually with atypical profiles concerning theta and beta 
frequency bands (17) whereas ASD EEG findings were 
mainly  related  to  alpha,  beta,  and  gamma  frequency 
bands (18). Also, in ASD children with cerebellar hypo-
plasia,  it  was  reported  that  the  more  severe  the  hypo-
plasia  was,  as  seen  by  MRI,  the  slower  ASD  children 
reacted  when  asked  to  orient  their  attention  to  visual 
stimuli, suggesting a unique role of the cerebellum in the 
pathophysiology of ASD (19).

4.  PRESENTATION OF AdHd IN ASd

Individuals with ADHD rarely present with symptoms 
that  are  specific  to  ASD.  However,  autistic  children 
commonly  show  symptoms  that  are  related  to  ADHD. 
ASD affects social communication, behavior, and imag-
ination.  ADHD  symptoms  are  divided  into  attention 
related symptoms and hyperactivity related symptoms. 
The attention deficit domain may be manifested as dif-
ficulty  in  sustaining  attention,  forgetfulness,  and/or 
distractibility,  while  hyperactivity  may  be  observed  as 
excessive  talking,  restlessness,  and  frequent  interrup-
tion of others. The DSM5 criteria for diagnosing ADHD 
include that the age of onset is no later than 7 years and 
that the child malfunctions in at least two settings (for 
example school and home) for a duration not less than 
6 months. ADHD is divided into 3 subtypes as follows: 
1. Predominantly inattentive. 2. Predominantly hyperac-
tive-impulsive. 3. The combined type, which is the most 
common and more severe (1, 20). 

Attention  is  part  of  the  executive  functions  of  the 
brain  and  can  be  divided  into  six  categories  as  follow: 
sustained  attention,  focused  attention,  visual  search, 
voluntary  or  reflexive  orienting  and  disengagement, 
attention  filtering,  and  expectation  (21).  In  ASD  indi-
viduals,  sustained,  focused  and  visual  search  attention 
is  stronger  compared  to  normal  individuals.  Whereas 
ASD  individuals  are  deficient  in  both  orienting  their 
attention toward non-social stimuli and in voluntary or 
reflexive disengagement. ASD individuals with no intel-
lectual disability have normal attention filtering (22). 

It has also been reported that ASD-ADHD diagnosed 
individuals have significantly more severe autistic symp-
toms  (especially  those  related  to  social  interaction) 
compared to those with ASD only (23). Additionally, the 
presence  of  psychomotor  agitation  in  ASD  individuals 
can be attributed to the disruptive mood dysregulation 

160

disorder that is highly prevalent in ASD rather than to 
the  presence  of  comorbid  ADHD  (24).  A  study  com-
pared the presence of selective attention in children with 
ASD and ADHD (both the inattentive type and the com-
bined type). It reported that selective attention is signifi-
cantly more common among autistic children compared 
to those with ADHD (25).

5.  CHALLENGES WITH ASSESSMENT OF AdHd 

IN ASd

The  co-occurrence  of  ADHD  in  ASD  individuals 
should  not  be  overlooked  and  must  be  assessed  care-
fully. A study suggested that that the attentional deficits 
in ASD children such as “not listening” and “difficulty in 
shifting focus” may be inherent to ASD itself rather than 
to the comorbidity with ADHD. This makes distinguish-
ing between the two disorders very challenging (9). 

Tests  that  revealed  significant  differences  between 
ASD  and  ADHD  are  of  great  use  to  assess  individuals 
with symptoms of both disorders. It has been reported 
that “the rapid letter naming task” did show significant 
differences between the two disorders as ASD children 
spent more time in the task but were performing better 
compared to ADHD children (26). 

Many neuropsychological tests were used to evaluate 
higher cognitive functions such as attention and work-
ing  memory  in  both  ASD  and  ADHD  children.  How-
ever, they failed to distinguish between the performance 
of children with normal intelligence ASD and those with 
ADHD  both  the  inattentive  and  the  combined  types 
(25).  Also,  neuropsychological  evaluations  of  execu-
tive  brain  functions  detected  deficits  that  were  shared 
by  both  ASD  and  ADHD  (27),  emphasizing  the  limits 
of higher cognitive functions tests to discriminate ASD 
from ADHD and suggesting the need of developing var-
ious  tools  to  explore  additional  brain  functions  since 
treatment  measures  relies  heavily  on  accurate  assess-
ments of the co-occurrence of ADHD in ASD.

6.  CURRENT APPROACHES TO MANAGEMENT

While treating ASD individuals with ADHD might be 
challenging  and  time  consuming,  it  has  been  reported 
that with effective interventions, these individuals may 
have  a  better  quality  of  life.  Despite  similar  symptoms 
between ASD and ADHD, treatment may differ between 
the two disorders. A recent study showed that compared 
to  autism,  children  with  ADHD-Combined  were  more 
likely to be prescribed ADHD medication, mostly stim-
ulants.  However,  autistic  children  were  most  likely  to 
be  prescribed  antipsychotics  and  selective  serotonin 
reuptake  inhibitors  (SSRIs)  compared  to  children  with 
ADHD-Combined.  The  least  likely  medicated  children 
were those with ADHD of the Inattentive type since thy 
showed  minimal  impairment  (28).  In  individuals  with 
both  ADHD  and  ASD,  it  is  generally  preferable  to  use 
psychopharmacological  treatments  to  mainly  reduce 
ADHD  symptoms  that  lead  to  daily  impairment.  For 
example,  if  the  ADHD  symptoms  were  controlled  in 
such patients, their therapists can focus on interventions 

that target social and communication deficits. Both ASD 
and ADHD have great treatment needs. These treatment 
needs can be either in school and/or out-of-school ser-
vices. This can be attributed to the finding that standard 
ADHD treatments, such as stimulants, are less effective 
in children with ASD when compared to children with 
ADHD  only,  suggesting  the  urgent  need  for  additional 
treatments (29).

If ASD symptoms were not managed in ASD-ADHD 
children, this will lead to their deterioration in all aspects 
(social, emotional, physical, and educational) (30). Also, 
unfortunately, ADHD medication failed to provide addi-
tional benefit for children with ASD beyond managing 
the symptoms of ADHD (31). Hence, the need for effec-
tive psychosocial treatment such as behavioral therapies, 
parent training, and social skills training is of immense 
importance.  However,  current  behavioral  treatments 
for  ASD  are  not  effective  in  targeting  the  impairment 
related  to  ADHD  symptoms.  Alternatively,  combining 
pharmacological  and  psychosocial  treatments  may  be 
beneficial for children with both ADHD and ASD symp-
toms (32). Limited studies have realized the importance 
of  addressing  effective  psychosocial  interventions  for 
children with both ASD and ADHD (33). Hence, more 
studies  are  needed  to  recommend  effective  interven-
tions  that  reduce  ADHD  symptoms  in  children  with 
ASD and improve their social and communication skills. 
In addition, extended psychoeducation of caregivers on 
the differences between ASD and ADHD behaviors is of 
great importance for the effective management of ASD 
children with ADHD.

7.  CONCLUSION

Children with both ASD and ADHD require extreme 
including 
attention  from  all  members  of  society 
researchers  to  figure  out  the  most  accurate  diagnostic 
methods  and  the  best  therapeutic  approaches.  Thera-
peutic  approaches  for  reducing  ADHD  symptoms  in 
ASD  individuals  require  modified  psychosocial  inter-
ventions  tailored  to  the  individuals’  needs,  as  well  as 
excellent  psychoeducation  to  caregivers.  Further  stud-
ies  are  required  to  understand  the  co-occurrence  of 
both  disorders  and  to  develop  therapeutic  approaches 
after  accurate  assessment.    As  seen  by  previous  stud-
ies, if these children are left without intervention, they 
may  deteriorate  in  all  aspects,  and  their  quality  of  life 
will drop tremendously. Hence it is recommended that 
all  members  of  society,  including  those  who  can  fund 
future research, work together to support such import-
ant members of our society.
