Introduction

15 years after the foundation of the GMA Committee for
Communicative and Social Competences (KusK) and the
Basel Consensus Statement [3], a special issue is now
available to assess the current situation: How is the
landscape of (longitudinal) curricula and courses or ex-
aminations of communicative and social competences
in the health professions at different locations? After the
call for articles, we received a variety of papers that shed
light on very different aspects of the training of commu-
nicative and social competences. It is particularly pleasing
that, in addition to papers from different health profes-
sions, articles on different aspects of teaching can also
be presented by international teams and thus, in the best
case, a broader view may be achieved.
A total of 23 articles are published with this issue. Six of
them are research papers, 13 are project reports, one is
a short project, two are reviews and one is a commentary.
The training and study programs described are pleasingly
diverse; they concern students and trainees of midwifery,
nursing, physiotherapy and occupational therapy, health
promotion and prevention, speech therapy, pharmacy,
interpreting students as well as students of human,
dental and veterinary medicine. The special issue thus
represents a contribution to evidence-based education
in the health professions.
The 23 publications submitted have been assigned to six
headline topics. For example, some sites report on the
challenges of jointly developing and implementing new
communication curricula. Two articles in which the au-
thors test methods for teaching communicative compet-
ences in order to decide on their permanent implement-
ation in the curriculum conclude the topic of the imple-
mentation phase. Four longitudinal curricula anchored
in faculties are presented, as well as concrete procedures
in individual courses. The topics of interprofessional and
online-based communication are also examined in more
detail. Last but not least, the topic of assessing commu-
nicative competences is addressed.
The articles that present a curriculum or a course are
accompanied by a profile of the status of communicative
curricula at the respective faculty, so that one can get a
brief and concise overview of the very colorful and diverse
landscape of communicative curricula at the various
faculties.

This special issue opens with a commentary by Fabry and
Kiessling on the question of what communicative compet-
ence is and how it can be taught. The commentary aims
to be a pragmatic guide for teachers.

Curriculum development and
implementation

Pruskil et al. [4] pointed out the importance of methods
of organizational and personal development in the imple-
mentation of curricula of social and communicative
competences. According to the motto “alone you go fast,
together you go far”, Kleinsorgen and colleagues show
for veterinary medicine in the SOFTVETS project how de-
velopment in an international team (Germany, Croatia,
Austria, Slovenia, Hungary) can succeed.
Three further articles are dedicated to the conditions at
faculties in the implementation of communicative cur-
ricula. Hollinderbäumer and colleagues describe facilitat-
ing and hindering factors at the Mainz location and use,
for example, a SWOT analysis, while Hinding and col-
leagues use a case analysis to highlight on the implement-
ation of a standardized communication curriculum at four
faculties (Hamburg, Heidelberg, Mainz, and Magdeburg).
Pohl and colleagues present an inventory of the commu-
nicative skills that are imparted in veterinary medicine
at five faculties (Berlin, Hanover, Leipzig, Giessen, Mu-
nich).

Implementation studies

In order to examine the evidence of communication
training, two exciting studies on different teaching meth-
ods were conducted. Herchenröther and colleagues from
Würzburg piloted a randomised controlled study to argue
for the differentiation of didactic methods depending on
when they are used during the course of studies, while
Pless and colleagues from Bern conducted an implement-
ation study to draw attention to the benefits of video an-
notations in self-reflective or peer feedback.

Communication curricula and
specific courses

The establishment of longitudinal communication cur-
ricula has already been successfully implemented at
some locations for several years. Initial routines have
been adjusted, challenges have already been analyzed
and the solutions integrated. Four locations present their
curricula – some of which have already been revised. At
three of these locations, teaching has already been es-
tablished in at least 7 out of 10 semesters.
In Berlin at the Charité, communication has been taught
comprehensively since 1999. Freytag, Kienle and col-
leagues report on planning, integration, teaching and
assessment. The challenges involved are also outlined,
including the transition from a reformed curriculum in
parallel to a regular curriculum to an integrated model
program. From Witten/Herdecke, Kiessling and colleagues
report on the introduction of a reformed program for
medical education called model program medicine
2018+. Since 2018, new thematic focuses have been
established, and the longitudinal teaching of communic-
ative competences has been integrated into the focus on
“professional and personal development”. In Leipzig, the
longitudinal curriculum for communicative competences
has become an integral part of the (human) medical
curriculum since 2016/17. Zimmermann and colleagues
present the origins, the overall concept, the contents and
the planned goals for the near future.
The catalogue of competence levels in Austria clearly
states the importance of teaching and training to promote
effective communication. Exenberger and colleagues
provide an overview of the longitudinal communication
curriculum at the Medical University of Innsbruck. The
presentation of three courses and the presentation of
curricular mapping as well as evaluations by lecturers
about the importance of communicative competences
provide an interesting insight into the development of the
curriculum.
Building a longitudinal communication curriculum requires
enormous resources, as requirements have to be met on
several levels. Regular quality assurance measures and
time are crucial factors in order to be able to maintain a
consistent level of the outcome. In addition, a gradual
approach to implementation is advisable. Aspects such
as quantity, voluntariness and implementation of courses
are vividly illustrated by Roller and Eberhard from dentistry
in Heidelberg.
Professional communication in the field of veterinary
medicine is subject to high complexity in everyday profes-
sional life. A teaching project at the University of Hanover
is presented by Trittmacher and colleagues, in which an-
imal and environmental observation and the subsequent
communication in farm animal husbandry are addressed.
The focus of the teaching unit is on identifying and solving
difficult discussion situations as well as a concluding re-
flection statement.

Distance learning

Face-to-face communication trainings are effective and
can convey essential effective elements of health profes-
sional communication [2]. In contrast, there is little evid-
ence for communication or communication training via
electronic media. The COVID-19 pandemic called for a
rapid rethinking and will potentially have far-reaching
implications for the teaching and learning of communic-
ation elements as well. Even before the pandemic, Ertl,
Steinmair and Löffler-Stastka developed a case-based
teaching format in Vienna. The aim of the approach was
to train interdisciplinary communication, e.g. consultation
work and ordering of findings, as well as to consolidate
diagnostically relevant “clinical reasoning” processes for
good clinical decision-making, in a pure distance mode.
Another form of distance learning was evaluated in Bern
by Brem and colleagues using an instruction format for
telephone emergency communication, which prepares
5th year students for the treatment of medical emergen-
cies. The review based on the student debriefing shows
interesting opportunities for improving communication
skills.

Interprofessional communication

Increasingly complex health care needs require more
cooperation and communication between the professional
groups involved [5]. Different qualification paths, which
are often characterized as silo-like, make it difficult to
acquire interprofessional competences during training
or during studies [1].
Four articles provide examples of how these difficulties
can be overcome and how students from different profes-
sional groups can learn interprofessionally,
i.e. from,
about and with each other, during their training or studies:
Spiegel-Steinmann and colleagues present the Winterthur
conceptional design and implementation of an interpro-
fessional training concept (WIPAKO), which covers five
degree programs. The contribution on the topic by
Posenau and Handgraaf presents a framework for inter-
professional case conferences developed at the University
of Applied Sciences in Bochum. This framework is suitable
for learning communicative competences in the context
of interprofessional case conferences as well as for test-
ing them. Two further articles are dedicated to the con-
nections between specific, interprofessionally conducted
courses and changes in certain competencies or atti-
tudes: For example, Mette and Hänze examined the ef-
fects of interprofessional peer tutorials on changes in
professional stereotypes at the University Medical Centre
Mannheim; Strelow and colleagues describe changes in
intercultural competence in the context of the PinKo
course in Mainz.

Assessment methods

In addition to interpersonal
feedback, self-reflective
learning is used as another method for learning and
teaching assessment. Gärtner, Prediger and Harendza
present the self-assessment method ComCare for com-
munication and interpersonal skills and compared self-
reflection with the assessment of simulation patients in
Hamburg. In Marburg, Urff and colleagues investigated
the validity of an assessment instrument to measure the
skill of empathy and aimed to further develop question-
naires along the lines of the Calgary-Cambridge Guide to
enable a reliable and objective assessment of communic-
ative skills. Ludwig and colleagues question whether the
OSCE format is the supreme discipline among assessment
methods for communicative skills. They present the de-
velopment and validation of a video-based communica-
tion-related e-examination in Mainz, which could make
resource-saving testing possible. Another innovative as-
sessment method by Selgert and colleagues from
Heidelberg aims at the ability to communicate in a patient-
friendly way. Here, the written communication of the ad-
vanced student with the patient is evaluated.

Conclusion

The overwhelming amount of diverse work available with
this thematic issue shows – 15 years after the first KusK
workshop in Basel – the gratifyingly growing community
in this field. Communicative and social competencies
have arrived and are anchored in the curricula of the
medical faculties. They serve to sharpen the profile of
the faculties, which in the meantime are not only following
a given mandate, but are self-confidently setting priorities.
Communicative and social competences are not only
taught, but the assessment of social and communicative
competencies is met as a challenge. Different formats,
various media as well as simulations are used here in a
target-oriented way.
Beyond human medicine, colleagues from dentistry,
veterinary medicine and the health sciences are also
working on the topic, which is also a pleasing develop-
ment in the last 15 years. Interprofessional approaches
also promise new developments that will gain momentum
in the coming years. It is now impossible to imagine health
profession education without integrated social and com-
munication skills training. The development of digital
formats, which has received a significant boost under the
current COVID-19 pandemic, should be monitored and
carefully examined: Where can digital formats be retained,
where can they be used additively? How do they perhaps
even more realistically represent the future communica-
tion formats in healthcare? Where is nevertheless a lack
of relevant elements and how can these be compensated
even better for teaching in the future? How helpful are
they for learning social and communicative skills in a
constantly changing environment?

The present work provides an exemplary insight into
various working methods that can be the basis and source
of ideas on how the curricular anchoring of social and
communicative competencies can succeed, which build-
ing blocks appear to be promising, which aspects should
be considered when testing and under which conditions
new things can be developed. In this special issue, a
broad variety of faculties and institutions present their
own ideas and approaches from their respective perspect-
ives. These can thus serve as inspiration or reflection on
their own work for other contributors to good communic-
ation and social skills. We look forward to future academic
exchange on this!

Einleitung

15 Jahre nach der Gründung des GMA Ausschusses für
kommunikative und soziale Kompetenzen (KusK) und
dem Baseler Consensus Statement [3] liegt ein Themen-
heft zur Standortbestimmung vor: Wie zeigt sich die
Landschaft (longitudinaler) Curricula und Veranstaltungen
bzw. Prüfungen kommunikativer und sozialer Kompeten-
zen in den Gesundheitsberufen an den verschiedenen
Standorten? Nach dem Aufruf zum Einsenden von Artikeln
erreichte uns eine Vielfalt von Arbeiten, die ganz verschie-
dene Aspekte kommunikativer und sozialer Kompetenzen
in der Lehre beleuchten. Besonders erfreulich ist, dass
neben Arbeiten aus verschiedenen Gesundheitsprofes-
sionen auch Artikel zu verschiedenen Aspekten der Lehre
sozialer und kommunikativer Kompetenzen von interna-
tionalen Teams vorgestellt werden können und so im
besten Fall der Blick über den Tellerrand gelingen kann.
Insgesamt können mit diesem Heft 23 Artikel veröffent-
licht werden. Sechs sind davon Forschungsarbeiten, 13
Projektberichte, ein Kurz-Projekt, zwei Übersichtsarbeiten
sowie ein Kommentar. Die beschriebenen Ausbildungs-
und Studiengänge sind erfreulich divers, sie betreffen
Studierende und Auszubildende der Hebammenwissen-
schaft, Pflege, Physio- und Ergotherapie, Gesundheitsför-
derung und Prävention, Logopädie, Pharmazie, Dolmetsch-
studierende sowie Studierende der Human-, Zahn- und
Veterinärmedizin. Das Themenheft stellt damit einen
Beitrag zu einer evidenzbasierten Ausbildung der Gesund-
heitsberufe dar.
Die eingereichten 23 Publikationen sind sechs Oberthe-
men zugeordnet. So berichten einige Standorte über die
Herausforderungen bei der gemeinsamen Entwicklung
und Implementierung von neuen Kommunikations-Curri-
cula. Zwei Artikel, in denen die Autor*innen Methoden
zur Vermittlung kommunikativer Kompetenzen testen,
um über deren dauerhafte Implementierung ins Curricu-
lum zu entscheiden, schließen das Thema Implementie-
rungsphase ab. Es werden vier an Fakultäten verankerte
longitudinale Curricula dargestellt sowie konkrete Vorge-
hensweisen in einzelnen Lehrveranstaltungen. Auch die
Themen interprofessionelle und online-basierte Kommu-
nikation werden genauer betrachtet. Zu guter Letzt be-
schäftigt uns das Thema der Prüfung von kommunikativen
Kompetenzen.
Den Artikeln, die ein Curriculum oder eine Lehrveranstal-
tung vorstellen, ist ein Steckbrief zum Stand kommunika-
tiver Curricula an der eigenen Fakultät beigefügt, so dass

man lesend einen kurzen und prägnanten Überblick über
die sehr bunte und vielfältige Landschaft kommunikativer
Curricula an den verschiedenen Fakultäten erhält.
Den Auftakt zum Themenheft macht ein Kommentar von
Fabry und Kiessling zur Fragestellung, was kommunikative
Kompetenz ist und wie sie vermittelt werden kann. Der
Kommentar verfolgt das Ziel, eine pragmatische Handrei-
chung für Lehrende zu sein.

Entwicklung und Implementierung
von Curricula

Pruskil et al. [4] wiesen auf die Bedeutung von Methoden
der Organisations- und Personalentwicklung bei der Im-
plementierung von Curricula sozialer und kommunikativer
Kompetenzen hin. Nach dem Motto „alleine ist man
schnell, gemeinsam kommt man weit“ zeigen Kleinsorgen
und Kolleg*innen für die Veterinärmedizin im Projekt
SOFTVETS wie eine Entwicklung in einem internationalen
Team (Deutschland, Kroatien, Österreich, Slowenien,
Ungarn) gelingen kann.
Drei weitere Artikel widmen sich den Rahmenbedingungen
an Fakultäten bei der Implementierung von kommunika-
tiven Curricula. Hollinderbäumer und Kolleginnen beschrei-
ben förderliche und hinderliche Faktoren am Standort
Mainz und nutzen dazu z.B. eine SWOT Analyse, während
Hinding und Kolleg*innen mittels einer Fallanalyse die
Implementierung eines einheitlichen Kommunikations-
curriculums an vier Fakultäten (Hamburg, Heidelberg,
Mainz, Magdeburg) beleuchten. Eine Bestandsaufnahme
der kommunikativen Kompetenzen, die an fünf Stand-
orten (Berlin, Hannover, Leipzig, Gießen, München) in der
Veterinärmedizin vermittelt werden, präsentieren Pohl
und Kolleg*innen.

Implementierungsstudien

Um die Evidenz des Kommunikationstrainings zu überprü-
fen, wurden zwei spannende Studien zu verschiedenen
Unterrichtsmethoden durchgeführt. Herchenröther und
Kolleg*innen vom Standort Würzburg plädieren anhand
einer randomisierten kontrollierten Studie für die Ausdif-
ferenzierung der didaktischen Methoden je nach Einsatz-
zeitpunkt im Verlauf des Studiums, Pless und Kolleg*in-
nen aus Bern machen mit einer Implementierungsstudie
auf den Nutzen von Video-Annotationen im selbstreflexi-
ven bzw. Peer-Feedback aufmerksam.

Kommunikationscurricula und
einzelne Lehrveranstaltungen

Die Etablierung von longitudinalen Kommunikationscur-
ricula wird an einigen Standorten bereits seit mehreren
Jahren erfolgreich umgesetzt. Erste Routinen haben sich
eingestellt und Herausforderungen konnten bereits ana-
lysiert und Lösungen integriert werden. Vier Standorte
stellen ihre – teilweise bereits überarbeiteten – Curricula
dar. An drei dieser Orte ist bereits in mindestens 7 von
10 Semestern die Lehre etabliert.
In Berlin an der Charité wird seit 1999 umfassend Kom-
munikation gelehrt. Kienle, Freytag und Kolleg*innen
berichten über Planung, Integration, Lehren und Prüfen.
Auch die damit verbundenen Herausforderungen werden
aufgezeigt, unter anderem wird der Übergang vom Refor-
mierten zum Modellstudiengang nachskizziert. Aus Wit-
ten/Herdecke berichten Kiessling und Kolleg*innen von
der Einführung des Modellstudiengangs 2018+. Seit
2018 werden neue Themenschwerpunkte etabliert, die
longitudinale Lehre der kommunikativen Kompetenzen
wird in den Schwerpunkt „Berufliche Persönlichkeitsent-
wicklung“ integriert. In Leipzig ist das longitudinale Curri-
culum für kommunikative Kompetenzen seit 2016/17
fester Bestandteil des Humanmedizinstudiums. Vorge-
stellt wird von Zimmermann und Kolleg*innen Entste-
hung, Gesamtkonzept, Inhalte sowie die avisierten Ziele
in nächster Zukunft.
Der Kompetenzlevelkatalog in Österreich benennt klar
die Bedeutung der Lehre und Trainings zur Förderung der
kommunikativen Kompetenzen. Über das longitudinale
Kommunikationscurriculum an der medizinischen Univer-
sität Innsbruck geben Exenberger und Kolleg*innen einen
Überblick. Durch die Darstellung von drei Veranstaltungen
und die Präsentation von curricularem Mapping sowie
Selbstauskünfte von Dozierenden über den Stellenwert
kommunikativer Kompetenzen entsteht ein interessanter
Einblick in die Entwicklung des Curriculums.
Ein longitudinales Kommunikationscurriculum aufzubau-
en fordert enorme Ressourcen, da Anforderungen auf
mehreren Ebenen erfüllt sein müssen. Regelmäßige
Qualitätssicherungsmaßnahmen und Zeit sind maßgebli-
che Faktoren, um das Niveau des Outcomes gleichblei-
bend halten zu können. Zudem ist ein sukzessives Vorge-
hen bei der
Implementierung ratsam. Aspekte wie
Quantität, Freiwilligkeit und Implementierung von Lehr-
veranstaltungen werden von Roller und Eberhard aus der
Zahnmedizin in Heidelberg anschaulich illustriert.
Die professionelle Kommunikation im Fachbereich Vete-
rinärmedizin unterliegt im Berufsalltag hoher Komplexität.
Ein Lehrprojekt der Uni Hannover wird von Trittmacher
und Kolleg*innen vorgestellt, in der Tier- und Umgebungs-
beobachtung und die daran anschließende Kommunika-
tion in der Nutztierhaltung thematisiert werden. Den
Schwerpunkt der Lehreinheit bilden die Identifikation und
Lösung schwieriger Gesprächssituationen sowie eine
abschließende Reflexion.

Distanzlernen

Kommunikationsunterricht im Präsenzmodus ist effektiv
und kann wesentliche wirksame Elemente der Kommuni-
kation von Gesundheitsberufen vermitteln [2]. Wenig
Evidenz dagegen gibt es für Kommunikation und Kommu-
nikationsunterricht via elektronischer Medien. Die COVID-
19-Pandemie forderte hier ein schnelles Umdenken und
wird möglicherweise auch auf das Lehren und Lernen
kommunikativer Elementen weitreichende Auswirkungen
haben. Bereits vor der Pandemie entwickelten Ertl,
Steinmair und Löffler-Stastka ein fallorientiertes Lehrfor-
mat in Wien. Ziel des Formats war, im reinen Distanz-
Modus, interdisziplinäre Kommunikation, z.B. Konsiliar-
arbeit und Befundanordnung, zu trainieren sowie diagno-
stisch relevante „clinical reasoning“ Prozesse für eine
gute klinische Entscheidungsfindung zu festigen. Eine
weitere Form des Distanzlernens evaluierten in Bern Brem
und Kolleg*innen anhand eines Lehrformats für die tele-
fonische Notfallkommunikation, das Studierende des 5.
Studienjahres für die Behandlung von medizinischen
Notfällen vorbereitet. Die Überprüfung anhand des Stu-
dierenden-Debriefings zeigt interessante Verbesserungs-
möglichkeiten der kommunikativen Fertigkeiten.

Interprofessionelle Kommunikation

Zunehmend komplexer werdende Versorgungsbedarfe
erfordern mehr Kooperation und Kommunikation zwi-
schen den an der Gesundheitsversorgung beteiligten
Berufsgruppen [5]. Unterschiedliche Qualifizierungspfade,
die oftmals als siloartig charakterisiert werden, erschwe-
ren den Erwerb interprofessioneller Kompetenzen wäh-
rend der Ausbildung bzw. während des Studiums [1].
Anhand von vier Beiträgen wird exemplarisch gezeigt, wie
diese Schwierigkeiten überwunden werden können und
Studierende der unterschiedlichen Berufsgruppen bereits
während der Ausbildung bzw. während des Studiums in-
terprofessionell d.h. voneinander, übereinander und
miteinander lernen: Spiegel-Steinmann und Kolleg*innen
stellen die Winterthurer Konzeption und Implementierung
eines interprofessionellen Ausbildungskonzepts (WIPAKO)
dar, das sich über fünf Studiengänge erstreckt. Der Bei-
trag zum Thema von Posenau und Handgraaf stellt ein
Framework für interprofessionelle Fallkonferenzen vor,
das an der Hochschule für Gesundheit in Bochum entwi-
ckelt wurde. Dieses Framework ist sowohl für das Erlernen
kommunikativer Kompetenzen im Rahmen von interpro-
fessionellen Fallkonferenzen geeignet, als auch für die
Überprüfung derselben. Zwei weitere Artikel widmen sich
den Zusammenhängen zwischen einzelnen, interprofes-
sionell durchgeführten Lehrveranstaltungen und Verän-
derungen bestimmter Kompetenzen oder Einstellungen:
So überprüften Mette und Hänze Effekte von interprofes-
sionellen Peer-Tutorien auf die Veränderung von Berufs-
stereotypen an der Universitätsmedizin Mannheim; Stre-
low und Kolleg*innen beschreiben in Mainz Veränderun-

Lehrveranstaltung PinKo.

Assessment Methoden

Neben interpersonalem Feedback wird selbstreflexives
Lernen als weitere Methode zur Lern- und Lehrüberprü-
fung genutzt. Gärtner, Prediger und Harendza stellen die
self-assessment Methode ComCare für die Selbsteinschät-
zung der Kommunikations- und interpersonellen Fertig-
keiten vor und verglichen in Hamburg die Selbstreflexion
mit der Einschätzung der Simulationspatient*innen. Urff
und Kolleg*innen untersuchten in Marburg die Validität
eines Assessment Instruments zur Erfassung der Fertig-
keit empathisches Verhalten zu zeigen und hatten die
Weiterentwicklung von Fragebögen entlang des Calgary-
Cambridge Guides zum Ziel, um ein reliables und objek-
tives Assessment kommunikativer Fertigkeiten zu ermög-
lichen. Ob das OSCE-Format die Königsdisziplin unter den
Assessment Methoden für kommunikative Kompetenzen
darstellt, hinterfragen Ludwig und Kolleg*innen. Sie
stellen die Entwicklung und Validierung einer videobasier-
ten kommunikationsbezogenen E-Prüfung in Mainz vor,
die ressourcenschonenderes Prüfen möglich machen
könnte. Eine weitere innovative Assessment Methode
von Selgert und Kolleg*innen aus Heidelberg zielt auf
die Fertigkeit, patient*innengerecht kommunizieren zu
können. Dabei wird die schriftliche Kommunikation des
fortgeschrittenen Studierenden mit dem/r Patient*in
geprüft.

Fazit

Die überwältigende Menge an unterschiedlichsten Arbei-
ten, die mit diesem Themenheft vorliegen, zeigt 15 Jahre
nach Basel die erfreulich wachsende Community in die-
sem Bereich. Kommunikative und soziale Kompetenzen
sind in den Curricula der medizinischen Fakultäten ange-
kommen und verankert. Sie dienen als Profilschärfung
der Fakultäten, die hier mittlerweile nicht nur einem vor-
gegebenen Auftrag folgen, sondern selbstbewusst
Schwerpunkte setzen. Kommunikative und soziale Kom-
petenzen werden nicht nur gelehrt, sondern dem Prüfen
sozialer und kommunikativer Kompetenzen wird als
Herausforderung begegnet, unterschiedliche Formate
werden dabei genutzt und diverse Medien sowie Simula-
tionen werden hier zielführend eingesetzt.
Über die Humanmedizin hinaus arbeiten Kolleg*innen
aus der Zahn-, der Veterinärmedizin sowie den Gesund-
heitswissenschaften ebenfalls zum Thema, was gleicher-
maßen eine erfreuliche Entwicklung in den letzten 15
Jahren darstellt. Auch interprofessionelle Ansätze verspre-
chen neue Entwicklungen, die in den kommenden Jahren
noch an Dynamik zunehmen werden. Das Vermitteln so-
zialer und kommunikativer Kompetenzen ist aus den
Gesundheitsberufen mittlerweile nicht mehr wegzuden-
ken. Die Entwicklung digitaler Formate, die unter der ak-

tuellen COVID-19-Pandemie einen deutlichen Anschub
bekommen hat, sollte beobachtet und sorgfältig geprüft
werden: Wo können digitale Formate beibehalten, wo
additiv eingesetzt werden? Wie bilden sie vielleicht sogar
realistischer die zukünftigen Kommunikationsformate im
Gesundheitswesen ab? Wo zeigt sich dennoch Mangel
an relevanten Elementen und wie können diese künftig
für die Lehre noch besser ausgeglichen werden? Wie
hilfreich sind diese für das Erlernen sozialer und kommu-
nikativer Kompetenzen in einem sich stetig wandelnden
Umfeld?
Die vorliegenden Arbeiten geben beispielhaft einen Ein-
blick in verschiedene Arbeitsweisen, die Grundlage und
Ideengeber*innen sein können, wie die curriculare Ver-
ankerung sozialer und kommunikativer Kompetenzen
gelingen kann, welche Bausteine erfolgversprechend er-
scheinen, welche Aspekte beim Prüfen bedacht werden
sollten und unter welchen Bedingungen Neues entwickelt
werden kann. Die einzelnen Standorte und Institutionen
stellen in diesem Sonderheft ihre eigenen Ideen und Lö-
sungsansätze aus ihren jeweiligen Blickwinkeln vor. Diese
können damit anderen Mitstreitenden für gute kommuni-
kative und soziale Kompetenzen zur Inspiration oder
Reflexion der eigenen Arbeit dienen. Wir freuen uns über
den zukünftigen akademischen Austausch darüber!
