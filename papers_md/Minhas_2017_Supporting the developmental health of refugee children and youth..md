Abstract

The Canadian Government has announced that over 50,000 refugees from the Middle East will be resettled in Canada by 
2018. More than one-third of these refugees are expected to be children. The Canadian Paediatric Society has called for the 
Canadian government to prepare for the influx of these children. This should include addressing developmental, behavioural, 
and mental health needs. The focus of this paper is the role of paediatricians and family physicians in caring for the develop-
mental health of refugee children, as a means of supporting their developmental and learning potential. The authors suggest 
the use of EMPOWER (Education, Migration, Parents and Family, Outlook, Words, Experience of Trauma and Resources), 
a mnemonic checklist they developed for assessing developmental risk factors in refugee children. EMPOWER can be used 
along with online web resources such as Caring For Kids New to Canada in providing evidence-informed care to these children.

Globally,  the  United  Nations  High  Commission  for  Refugees  (UNHCR) 
estimated  that  50  million  individuals  were  forcibly  relocated  from  their 
homes in 2013, of whom 16 million were children, and 25,000 were unac-
companied  minors  (1).  In  November  2015,  the  government  of  Canada 
made  a  commitment  to  expedite  the  resettlement  of  25,000  refugees  from 
Syria by September 2016, and 5000 refugees in Turkey (other nationalities) 
by 2018. This is in addition to a previous commitment to the resettlement 
of  23,000  Iraqi  refugees  (www.cic.gc.ca/english/refugees/crisis/canada- 
response.asp).

The  Canadian  Paediatric  Society  has  called  the  Canadian  government  to 
action (www.cps.ca/en/media/release-communique/speed-up-process-for-re-
settling-refugee-children-urge-paediatricians),  indicating  more  than  one-third 
of  refugees  are  expected  to  be  children.  Canadian  paediatricians  and  family 
physicians should be prepared to provide comprehensive medical care includ-
ing  assessments  and  management  of  developmental,  behavioural  and  mental 
health concerns to these children, as they transition into new communities and 
schools.

PRACTITIONER’S ROLE

Refugee children have unique health needs, including immunization catch-up, 
screening for infectious disease and nutritional deficiencies, and mental health 
and  trauma  support  (2).  Refugee  children  also  have  unique  developmental 
and learning needs (3). Furthermore, specific infections (e.g., cerebral malaria, 
intestinal  worms),  nutritional  deficits  (e.g.,  iron  deficiency),  and  traumatic 
experiences early in life significantly impact a child’s development. As such, the 
assessment of developmental and learning needs should be an integral part of 
routine refugee health service provision.

About  28%  and  70%  of  paediatric  visits  to  family  physicians  and  pae-
diatricians  respectively  are  behavioural  and  developmental  in  origin  (4). 
Family  physicians  are  typically  the  primary  point  of  contact  for  refugee 
families.  Approximately  70%  of  all  children  are  referred  to  a  paediatrician 
or  developmental  paediatrician  for  further  investigation  including  devel-
opmental  and  behavioural  concerns  (5).  As  such,  Canadian  paediatricians 
and family physicians are well-positioned to respond to the developmental 
and  learning  needs  of  refugee  children  and  their  families  (4).  Each  child’s

unique developmental and behavioural profile is influenced by the dynamic 
context of his/her genetic endowment, experiences at home, school, and the 
broader  community  and  policy  environments.  Given  that  refugee  children 
may  have  experienced  traumatic  events  both  pre-  and  post-migration,  par-
ents  may  have  concerns  about  their  child’s  behaviour  and  development  as 
well.  Canadian  doctors  should  be  cognizant  of  unique  developmental  and 
learning issues in refugee children, since many of them will be involved in 
providing care for these children.

Learning and development in refugee children
Refugee  children  with  learning  and  developmental  issues  often  present  late 
without  the  benefits  of  early  intervention  or  school  and  social  supports  that 
would  typically  be  available  in  Canada.  Practitioners  should  identify  and 
support those at highest risk of difficulty. A recent systematic scoping review 
identified  various  protective  and  risk  factors  for  educational  achievement  of 
refugee children (3). Risk factors were (1) a history of trauma (pre- or post-mi-
gration);  (2)  interrupted  education;  (3)  educators’  low  expectations  of  aca-
demic achievement; and (4) household financial stress. Important factors that 
supported learning success were: (1) proficiency in the academic language of 
their new country; (2) appropriate recognition of their educational experience 
by their school team; (3) appropriate grade placement and expectations; (4) 
parental  support  for  educational  engagement;  and  (5)  high  parental  educa-
tional levels (3).

Pre- and post-migration considerations
The developmental process is further complicated in refugee children who may 
have a pre-migration history of multiple relocations, disrupted education, and 
inconsistent health care. This includes trauma and violence, either personally, 
or  vicariously  through  a  family  member  (6).  This  can  lead  to  a  risk  of  bully-
ing, compromised safety, and violence in children (7). Post-migration factors 
include the challenge of adjustment to a new language, education system, and 
new social-cultural norms (8). Success of refugee children depends on family 
resources and supports, the family’s capacity to translate traumatic experiences 
into  motivational  narratives,  school  approaches  to  inclusivity  and  cultural 
appropriateness, and broader social supports and community attitudes. Further, 
having safe and secure attachment, family, friends, and supportive teachers can 
help foster adaptation and ultimately resilience (9).

Parental mental health
Parents’  histories  of  trauma,  anxiety,  depression,  and  the  stresses  of  seeking 
employment and managing a household with fragmented social networks can 
impact their capabilities as responsive caregivers. This can manifest in aberra-
tions in attachment-bonding relationships in younger children, and in strained 
relationships with adolescent children (7). Children may have difficulty in feel-
ing secure with their parents, whose role is inherently to protect and support 
their child. Refugee families may have had this security compromised in a pro-
longed, tenuous migration process, or in conflict with various authority figures, 
resulting in the diminishment of the child’s perception of the caregiver’s ability 
to maintain safety. Children and older siblings may take on the responsibility of 
navigating the community, educational and health care encounters of their fam-
ily as a result of greater communication skills than their parents. This can lead to 
children’s and caregivers’ compromised perception of the caregivers’ ability to 
parent, and difficulty in managing children’s behaviour.

Developmental, community resources and  
developmental care plan
Factors involving the family and the child’s medical, developmental, socio-cul-
tural and economic background should be considered when assessing develop-
ment in refugee children. Physicians should assess each child’s risk and resource 

factors as they relate to education and learning outcomes, including their for-
mal  and  informal  pre-migration  educational  experiences.  Medical  teams  can 
work with school teams to provide comprehensive reports and recommenda-
tions and advocate for these children’s needs in school settings to ensure the 
appropriate educational supports are put in place to facilitate their learning and 
safety.  Refugee  children  are  often  placed  in  inappropriate  classrooms  due  to 
expectations that are too high, or too low, often overlooking prior educational 
experience  and  possible  interruptions  in  learning  during  migration  (10,11). 
Furthermore,  behaviours  related  to  a  child’s  cultural  background  can  result 
in a teacher’s misunderstanding about a child’s educational level and abilities, 
resulting  in  inappropriate  remediation  efforts  (12).  Expectations  for  typical 
eye contact, social interactions with peers and adults, use of figurative speech, 
behaviour,  attention,  and  other  concepts  can  vary  greatly  between  cultural 
and language backgrounds. Physicians may act as a liaison between education 
teams and families by providing evidence of a child’s learning, educational and 
behavioural experience to facilitate the appropriate placement and support of 
children in schools. This can be obtained through a systematic clinical encoun-
ter. Physicians can also screen for, and raise awareness around concerns for bul-
lying, particularly for children for whom trauma has been a pervasive influence 
on childhood.

Current developmental assessments
With  these  diverse  factors  impacting  refugee  children’s  development,  tradi-
tional developmental instruments for screening and assessment may lose valid-
ity,  and  the  risk  of  missed  or  incorrect  diagnosis  increases  (13,14).  Many  of 
these  instruments  were  normed  for  children  in  mainstream  North  American 
or European contexts. Although  many developmental  skills  are robust  across 
contexts, the experiences and resources available to refugee children may vary, 
as may their opportunities to develop certain skills. Therefore, caution should 
be exercised when administering and interpreting these developmental assess-
ments with refugee children.

RESOURCES

Caring for Kids New to Canada has developed resources for paediatricians to 
obtain and learn more about culturally-appropriate assessments (www.kidsnew-
tocanada.ca/screening). In addition, to assist with screening refugee children for 
learning  and  developmental  challenges,  the  mnemonic  checklist  EMPOWER 
could be helpful (Table 1). This tool was developed by two of the authors (RM 
and HG). It is a 5-minute guideline of questions and assessments that should be 
taken into consideration when seeing a refugee child and can be used to struc-
ture a comprehensive medical assessment with existing tools (Table 2). Current 
developmental assessments should be adapted to the results of EMPOWER to 
reflect  the  child’s  experience.  EMPOWER  should  also  be  used  to  assess  what 
additional  support  the  parent/caregiver  might  require  in  order  to  meet  the 
demands  of  caring  for  their  children.  Results  can  be  used  to  provide  referrals 
to adult health care team members (family physicians, psychologists and social 
workers). Letters provided to schools and developmental agencies can be struc-
tured using EMPOWER format.

Finally,  paediatricians  can  assist  adult  caregivers/parents  in  access-
ing  appropriate  health  care  services  to  ensure  their  health  needs  are  also 
met.  When  caregivers  experience  mental  health  problems  (from  poverty, 
trauma, violence), children are more likely to face the same problems (15). 
Interventions  to  improve  caregivers’  mental  health  have  been  shown  to 
improve  children’s  development  and  learning.  Since  refugee  parents  are  at 
higher  risk,  health  care  providers  should  actively  advocate  and  assess  care-
giver mental health and collaborate with team members when they suspect 
reason for concern.

CONCLUSIONS

In  order  to  adequately  provide  care  to  refugee  children,  integrated  health 
models of care ought to be explored. This could include close collaboration 
between  family  physicians,  general  paediatricians,  developmental  paediatri-
cians, and school board personnel. Multidisciplinary models with expertise 
in paediatric infectious disease, nutrition, and child development could aim 
to provide comprehensive care and surveillance through a dedicated refugee/
immigrant health clinic. Finally, migrant communities and their leaders have 
a critically important role in identifying and appropriately responding to chil-
dren’s health and developmental needs, and much could be done to increase 

communication between refugee health services and the communities  they 
seek to serve.
