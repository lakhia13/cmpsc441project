The current article reports on the ﬁndings from a pilot treatment study on panic disorder
(PD) with or without agoraphobia. Consecutively referred patients were included and
treated with the Bergen 4-day treatment format. Twenty-nine patients were included,
primarily from unsuccessful treatment courses in the Norwegian specialist mental health
care system, either ongoing or previously. Prior to treatment, only 34% were able to work
but at 3-month follow-up 93% were able to do so. The proportion achieving reliable
change on the panic severity measure was 76% post-treatment and 90% at follow-up.
The remission rate was 72% at both assessments. These effects are signiﬁcantly higher
than those reported for six standard CBT studies in the literature using the same primary
outcome measure (Panic Disorder Severity Scale). It is concluded that the Bergen 4-day
treatment is a promising treatment approach for PD, and a randomized controlled trial
is warranted.

INTRODUCTION

In outpatient specialist mental health care (SMHC) patients with anxiety and depression represent
the largest group and have the longest treatment courses (Whiteford et al., 2013). This rather
grim reality exists even though there are evidence-based treatments for all these disorders. The
personal and socio-economical gains for each patient that can be helped could be immense given
that around 75% of the patients with an anxiety disorder develop the disorder before their mid-20s
(Kessler et al., 2005), and that the disorders are typically associated with poor quality of life and
daily functioning (Whiteford et al., 2013).

The OCD-Team at Haukeland University Hospital has developed a concentrated exposure
treatment (The Bergen 4-day treatment) for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). The treatment
is delivered during four consecutive days in groups of 3–6 patients with the same number of
therapists. The results show that 83% of the patients are reliably improved and 68% remitted at
6-month follow-up, with very low declining rate and practically no dropout (Havnen et al., 2014,
2017). A recent 4-year follow-up found that 69% of the patients were recovered 4 years after
treatment (Hansen et al., 2018).

The 4-day format is planned to be tested in randomized controlled trials for patients with
the most common anxiety disorders, namely panic disorder (PD), social anxiety disorder (SAD),
generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), depression, and body dysmorphic disorder (BDD). However,
the RCTs will only be initiated if diagnosis-speciﬁc pilot studies indicate that the clinical eﬀects

4-Day Treatment for Panic Disorder

from the 4-day format are as good as (non-inferior to) the eﬀects
of previously published eﬀectiveness studies on evidence-based
treatments for the disorder in question (Chambless and Hollon,
1998). Analogous to the approach for OCD, these pilot studies
will be conducted as part of the outpatient psychiatric service.

The Bergen 4-day treatment is based on a cognitive behavior
therapy approach with a special focus on individually tailored
and therapist-assisted exposures. It can best be described as
individual treatment in a group setting because it is delivered
in groups where the therapist-patient ratio is 1:1. The ﬁrst
of the 4 days is dedicated to explaining the treatment and
planning of exposures, and the last to summarizing “lessons
learnt” and planning how to ensure that changes becomes
life (3 h). The two middle
an integrated part of normal
days are spent on therapist-assisted exposures interspaced
with brief meetings with the group. In these meetings each
patient share their experiences of the exposure training and
gets feedback on how to deal with challenges. During the
2 days with exposures, patients are taught how to actively
approach whatever elicits relevant anxiety or discomfort without
simultaneously employing subtle avoidance strategies but rather
“lean into the anxiety” (labeled the LET-technique). During
these two middle days the patients spend approximately 8 h
with the group/therapist and then practice on their own in the
evening.

The present pilot study on PD describes clinical changes at
post-treatment and 3-months follow-up and patient satisfaction
with the treatment, and the results presented are part of the
quality assessment procedure, which is an integrated part of the
4-day treatment. The results are also compared with previously
published studies of CBT that have used the Panic Disorder
Severity Scale (PDSS) as the primary outcome measure. The
main aims of the present study were to investigate the feasibility,
acceptability, and treatment outcome of the 4-day treatment for
PD. Based on our experience of the 4-day treatment for OCD as
described above, we expect that this treatment will be as eﬀective
as standard CBT using weekly sessions.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Patients
Referral Procedures and Diagnostics
The patients were referred to the specialist health care by
their individual general practitioner, and if their symptoms
were severe enough they were oﬀered treatment as a part
of public health care. In the period October 2016 to April
2017, patients at Kronstad psychiatric clinic (Bergen, Norway)
who fulﬁlled the diagnostic criteria of PD with or without
agoraphobia were oﬀered participation in the 4-day treatment.
Time-slots for 4-day groups were decided in advance. Clinicians
at Kronstad were informed about the 4-day treatment and were
encouraged to refer patients with ongoing but unsuccessful
treatments. This means that patients were oﬀered participation
successively upon availability in groups. Group treatment would
not be oﬀered if the patient was suicidal, psychotic, actively
abusing alcohol or narcotics, bipolar in an active phase, or

did not speak Norwegian. Twenty-nine patients were given
a diagnosis of PD according to Diagnostic and statistical
manual for mental disorders, 5th ed. (DSM-5) criteria (American
Psychiatric Association, 2013). Of
these 29 participants 21
had agoraphobia with PD, whereas eight had PD without
agoraphobia.

Background Information
Table 1 displays a summary of background data for the sample.
There was a majority of female patients (69%) and the mean age
of the patients was 31.9 years (range: 18–53) with a self-reported
duration of PD being 5.9 years.

At the time of inclusion 18 (62.1%) of the patients were
in active treatment courses without successful results, with an
average duration of 11.7 months (range: 2–30). In total, 23
(79.3%) of the patients had previous treatment courses for the
PD; 14 patients (48.3%) had obtained one treatment course,
six patients (20.7%) had two, one patient (3.4%) had three,
and two patients (6.9%) had received ﬁve treatment courses. Of
these, three reported earlier exposure treatment, three reported
Internet-based cognitive behavior therapy, and 17 had received
what was described as psychotherapy, medications, or other
forms of therapy. The mean scores on PDSS for patients with or

With respect to marital status, 14 (48.3%) of the patients were
in a relationship, ﬁve (17.2%) were married, nine (31.0%) were
single, and one unknown. Regarding education, ﬁve (17.2%) had
ﬁnished junior high school, 15 (51.7%) had ﬁnished high school,
seven (24.1%) had a higher education (university or similar), and
two were unknown.

Before treatment, 19 (65.5%) of the patients were unable to
work due to their PD. For these patients the average time out of
the job market was 13.9 months.

Comorbidity

included major depressive disorder

(5)
hypochondriasis/health anxiety (2), generalized anxiety disorder
(4), social phobia (1), insomnia (1), post-traumatic stress disorder
(1), atypical anorexia (1). Twelve of the included patients had no
current comorbidity. The mean PDSS scores before treatment
for patients without comorbidity was not signiﬁcantly diﬀerent
from patients with comorbidity, t(27) = 0.62, p = 0.54.

A total of 13 patients

reported use of psychotropic
medications. Eight patients had been on stable doses of Selective
Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRI; ﬁve on Sertraline, three on
Escitalopram) prior to treatment, and three patients were on
stable doses of sleeping medicine (two on Zopiclone and one
Alimemazine). Four patients were on antipsychotic medication
(three with Quetiapine and one on Levomepromazin). Six
patients had prescriptions of benzodiazepines to be taken when
needed. No changes were enforced with respect to medication,
but the patients were informed that the use of anxiety reducing
medication (benzodiazepines) was prohibited during the 4-day
treatment.

Assessment
Patients
answered standardized self-report questionnaires

questionnaires according to a pre-set time limit, an automatic
text message was sent to their phones. An independent assessor
conducted a standardized phone interview using the PDSS (see
below) at pre- and post-treatment and follow-up.

Diagnostic Interview
Before treatment started, the patients went through a diagnostic
interview by a trained psychologist using the Structured Clinical
Interview for DSM-5 (First et al., 2015). Comorbid disorders
were evaluated using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric
Interview (MINI; Sheehan et al., 1998) by an experienced
therapist. MINI is a short structured diagnostic interview which
screens axis-1 DSM-IV disorders, and the Norwegian version has
good psychometric properties (Mordal et al., 2010).

Panic Disorder Severity
The PDSS (Shear et al., 1997) which consists of seven items,
is a validated interview for assessing PD severity. The PDSS
was administered via a standardized phone interview by a
clinician trained in the interview. Internal consistency was good

to excellent in the present study with Cronbach’s α of 0.76 at pre-
treatment, 0.88 at post-treatment and 0.89 at follow-up. PDSS
has been shown to be sensitive to change in PD severity (Shear
et al., 1997). Along with the diagnostic interview and PDDS,
the assessor rated patients on the Clinical Global Impressions
Scale (Severity and Improvement) (CGI; Guy, 1976). The CGI
provides an overall summary scored on a 1–7 scale which takes
into account all available patient information.

Depressive Symptoms
Symptoms were measured with the Patient Health Questionnaire
9 (PHQ-9; Kroenke et al., 2010). PHQ-9 is a nine item
questionnaire for measuring severity of depressive symptoms,
and total scores range from 0 to 27.

Symptoms of Generalized Anxiety
It was measured with the Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7;
Spitzer et al., 2006). GAD-7 is a seven item questionnaire which
has been proven to be a good measure of generalized anxiety,
with excellent psychometric properties. Total scores range from
0 to 21.

Treatment Satisfaction
In order to obtain a measure of
the patients’ degree of
satisfaction with the 4-day treatment the Client Satisfaction
Questionnaire (CSQ-8; Larsen et al., 1979) was applied at post-
treatment assessment. This is an eight-item questionnaire that
measures patient satisfaction with health services, where the
items are rated from 1 (very low satisfaction) to 4 (very high
satisfaction). The total score ranges from 8 to 32, with higher
scores indicating higher degree of satisfaction. The CSQ-8 has
good psychometric properties, with high internal consistency
(Cronbach’s α = 0.93), and high inter-item correlation (Larsen
et al., 1979).

Work Status and Ability to Work After Treatment
To measure patients’ ability to work, they were asked by the
assessment team about work status at post-treatment and at 3-
month follow-up. The patients were also asked about whether
their anxiety symptom hinders their ability to work. This
information was combined to form a dichotomous variable
consisting of participants that were able to work vs. unable to
work.

Procedure
Before treatment was initiated a diagnostic screening that
combines information from patient’s self-report questionnaires
with diagnostic interviews was conducted.

fulﬁlled the diagnostic criteria for PD and there was group

and subsequently the therapist elaborated and answered any
questions the patient may have. The video underscored that
in order for the treatment to be helpful the patient had to
make an active decision to get rid of the disorder and to
fully engage in the treatment. At the end of the screening

4-Day Treatment for Panic Disorder

an adapted version of the Borkovec and Nau (1972) Reaction
to treatment scale was used to assess treatment expectations
of outcome and treatment credibility. The patient was asked
to evaluate four aspects of expectancy and credibility on a
0–100% scale, and if a number below 70% was reported, it
served as an opportunity to clear up misunderstandings. If the
patient wanted to initiate treatment, he/she would be granted
place in a treatment group, and would watch a second video2
which elaborated the content of the treatment, the structure,
and the focus of the 4 days. It was underscored that these
4 days will be fully dedicated to the treatment, and that the
patients were required to have no other appointments. This
also applied to the evenings of days 2 and 3. Patients also
received written information about the group, and were informed
that they should come up with exposure tasks to be used
during the treatment. One week prior to treatment, the leader
of the group would call each patient to make sure they had
received all necessary information and were ready to begin
treatment.

Treatment
The patients were given the 4-day treatment based upon a
manual for PD originally developed for the treatment of OCD
and adapted for treatment of PD. The treatment was delivered
during four consecutive days, and also included a session (with no
exposure) 3 months after treatment. The treatment was delivered
in groups of 3–6 patients, with a therapist-patient ratio of 1:1.
There was also a psycho-educative meeting for relatives or close
friends on the third day.

The main focus of the 4-day treatment is the ”LEaning
in Technique” (LET), which emphasizes a shift from avoiding
unpleasant symptoms, thoughts and emotions, to instead actively
approach whatever elicits relevant anxiety/discomfort and “lean
into the anxiety.”

The ﬁrst day, all patients and therapists met for 3–4 h.
A thorough psychoeducation covering core characteristics of
PD, maintaining factors, treatment principles and exposure
technique were presented. All patients also prepared individual
exposure tasks for days 2 and 3. The second and third days
(each approximately 8 h) were allocated to individually tailored
and therapist-assisted exposure in as many relevant settings as
possible, interspaced with brief meetings for all patients and
therapists. Examples of subtle avoidance were demonstrated,
and each patient was assisted to practice the LET technique on
their most relevant exposure tasks. During the two exposure
days, all patients together with their therapist approached
numerous anxiety-provoking situations, as they practiced the
LET-technique. They were encouraged to practice in as many
relevant situations as possible, as each situation is considered
an opportunity to create change. In the case of exposure for
a PD, leaning into the anxiety may involve physical exercises
and hyperventilation to increase physical arousal, in addition
to a mental attempt to overload your heart and “cause a
heart attack,” instead of avoidance and down-regulation of
anxiety.

Also the patients practiced to identify exactly when they were
tempted to initiate subtle avoidance, and the patients were taught
that these are the moments with the largest potential for change,
since this is where they actively can choose to do something
incompatible (“leaning in”) with having the disorder. If they
had diﬃculties doing this, it was suggested to “fake it until you
make it.”

Typically, in a group of 3–6 patients, not all “get the essence”
of the LET-technique at the same time, and the group meetings in
the morning, lunch, and late afternoon at the 2 days of exposure
training served to help the ones lagging behind to dare to “hunt
for anxiety without holding back.” At these meetings each patient
reported on their progression, and at the end of each report,
the patients rated their own performance on a scale from 1 to
6, where 6 indicated that they did “not hold back” during the
exposures. Since the score referred to behavior that they were
able to control (“Leaning in” or “doing something incompatible
with having the disorder” vs. “holding back”) it was within reach
for everyone to obtain a score of 6. The group leader asked
each patient focused questions of whether they were able to ﬁnd
anxiety (“was the task relevant for eliciting anxiety”) and whether
they were (“holding back,” “leaning in,” or “doing something
incompatible with the disorder”). If they were holding back, this
was typically followed by questions about how to manage to
“lean in” on the next exposure tasks. At some point in time
the exposure tasks that used to elicit anxiety might no longer
be potent, which might be seen as one of the main goals of the
treatment. But even in these situations, the reduction of anxiety
was not given much attention. Rather the focus was on whether
there is any “gold (anxiety eliciting situations or thoughts) to be
found elsewhere – “we do not want to leave any behind,” and on
the LET-technique. By using this approach all patients were able
to rate their own LET-performance with a rating of 6 at the end
of the second day of exposure therapy.

Exposure plans for each evening were made, and each
patient reported back to the therapist by text messages to
inform whether the agreed upon exposure tasks were completed.
On the last day each patient made an individual exposure
plan for the next 3 weeks in order to take responsibility
for their own recovery and make the changes an integrated
part of
their lives, without assistance from the clinic. On
the last day the principles of change and how to conduct
exposures were repeated and important principles to maintain
robust and enduring change were discussed. The patients
reported their use of the LET technique daily on-line the ﬁrst
3 weeks following treatment, but with no feedback from the
therapists.

Therapists
All treatment groups were led by 4-day experts, with extensive
experience with the protocol (treatment format and rationale)
and treatment of anxiety disorders. Certiﬁcation of a group leader
involves participation of a minimum of six groups. In order to
be certiﬁed as a 4-day therapist one must have earlier experience
in exposure-based treatment of anxiety disorders, and participate
in a minimum of two treatment groups. All therapists involved
in the present groups were licensed clinical psychologists,

psychiatrists or last-year clinical psychology students, who were
certiﬁed 4-day treatment therapists.

Data Completion
A total of 29 patients are included in the dataset. Of the 29
study participants, 28 were available for PDSS-interview post-
treatment, and 27 (93.1) at 3-month follow-up. A total of 25
(86.2%) patients completed self-report questionnaires at post-
assessment.

Deﬁnition of Response and Remission
Because there are no international consensus criteria for PD,
as there are for OCD (Mataix-Cols et al., 2016), we decided to
use three diﬀerent criteria that have been applied previously in
evaluating the clinical outcome for anxiety disorders.

The Jacobson and Truax (1991) Criteria
First, the patient’s change score from pre-treatment to post-
treatment (or follow-up) on the PDSS must be statistically
reliable (larger than the scale’s measurement error) at
the
0.05-level [Reliable Change Index (RCI)]. Second, the post-
treatment (follow-up) score should more probably belong to the
distribution of the normal population than that of the patient
population. RCI was calculated using the present sample’s pre-
treatment SD and the internal consistency reported by the scale
constructors (Shear et al., 1997) yielding a RCI of seven points.
The cut-oﬀ score was calculated as the patient sample’s pre-
treatment mean minus 2∗SD; 15.79–2(3.79) = 7.85, i.e., a score of
7. Thus, using the Jacobson and Truax criteria treatment response
is deﬁned as a change of at least seven points. Remission was
deﬁned as a post-treatment score of seven or less and a change
of at least seven points.

The Furukawa et al. (2009) Criteria
Response was deﬁned as a reduction of the pre-treatment PDSS
score of at least 40%. A patient was considered remitted if the
post-treatment score fell in the “borderline ill” category or better,
which is 5 for PD and 7 for PD with agoraphobia.

The Otto et al. (2016) Criteria
The Clinical Global Impressions-Severity Scale (CGI-S) was
employed to determine remission status. The remission criterion
was fulﬁlled if the patient had a post-treatment score on CGI-S of
1 (normal) or 2 (borderline mentally ill) and had no panic attacks.
In this study we used item 1 from PDSS to evaluate the presence
of panic attacks. If a patient had 0 or 1 on this item this part of the
criterion was considered fulﬁlled.

Statistical Analyses
There were few incidents of missing data. Only 3.5% of data were
missing on the PDSS across the three assessment times (one at
post-treatment and two at follow-up). Missing data were replaced
using the expectation-maximization method of SPSS, version
24. This method was chosen to allow for repeated measures
ANOVA. Statistical analyses were conducted with all 29 patients
included. Repeated measures ANOVA for PDSS, GAD-7, and
PHQ-9 were conducted using Greenhouse–Geisser corrections

when Mauchly’s test of sphericity was signiﬁcant. To calculate
eﬀect sizes of change over time Cohen’s d was used, deﬁned as
(M pre-treatment – M post-treatment)/SD pre-treatment (Morris
and DeShon, 2002). Comparison of the present results with those
of studies evaluating standard CBT for PD using the PDSS as
primary outcome measure was done with independent t-test
for continuous variables and Fisher’s exact probability test for
categorical variables.

RESULTS

Clinical Outcome
As expected the patients showed a signiﬁcant and large reduction
in PD symptoms (measured with PDSS) from pre- to post-
treatment, and the change remained stable 3 months after
treatment (see Table 2). Mauchly’s test was signiﬁcant (p = 0.044),
therefore Greenhouse–Geisser correction was applied. The
repeated measures ANOVA indicated signiﬁcant change in PD
symptoms, (1.657) = 89.89, p < 0.001, η2
p = 0.762. There was
a signiﬁcant change in severity from pre- to post-treatment
(p < 0.001), but no signiﬁcant change from post-treatment to
follow-up (p = 0.50). For CGI-S there were also signiﬁcant
and large reductions in PD symptoms, Wilk’s Lambda = 0.058,
F(2,27) = 217.87, p < 0.001, η2
p = 0.942. As with PDSS, there
was a signiﬁcant change in CGI-S severity from pre- to post-
treatment (p < 0.001), and no change from post-treatment to
follow-up (p = 0.64). There was also a signiﬁcant reduction in
depressive symptoms, Wilk’s Lambda = 0.568, F(1,28) = 21.29,
p < 0.001, η2
p = 0.432, and for symptoms of generalized anxiety,
Wilk’s Lambda = 0.296, F(1,28) = 66.476, p < 0.001, η2
p = 0.704
from pre- to post-treatment.

Response and Remission
Table 3 displays the treatment response and remission rates based
on three diﬀerent criteria. For the Jacobson and the Furukawa
criteria PDSS was used whereas CGI-S was utilized for the Otto
criteria. All three criteria yielded very high response proportions;
76–97% at post and 82–97% at follow-up. The Jacobson RCI
on the other hand requires at least a seven-point reduction
irrespective of the pre-treatment PDSS score. It is surprising
that the stringent CGI-S criterion (≥50% reduction) yielded the
highest proportion of responders, which might be due to the
construction of this single item measure. The remission rates

were also high but varied less than the response rates; 72–79%
post-treatment and 72–83% at follow-up.

Table 4 displays the clinical improvement at post-treatment
and follow-up using the Jacobson and Truax (1991) criteria since
they were the most conservative of those in Table 3. None of
the patients had signiﬁcantly deteriorated at post-treatment or
at follow-up. Both at post-treatment and follow-up, 21 of the 29
patients (72.4%) were remitted. Looking at the post-treatment
remitters, 16 of the 21 (76%) patients retained their status at
follow-up, while ﬁve (24%) showed some worsening and fell
in the responder category. The single patient with treatment
response status post was remitted at follow-up, whereas four
of the seven unchanged (57%) patients had remitted, and the
remaining three were still unchanged at follow-up.

Work Ability
There was an increase in the patients’ ability to work from
pre-treatment to follow-up. Before treatment, 19 (65.5%) of the
patients were too impaired by their PD to be working (on sick
leave), and 9 (32.1%) patients were able to work. Three months
after treatment 25 of 27 patients (92.5%) were able to work, while
two (7.5%) were not. This change was signiﬁcant as tested with
McNemar’s test (p < 0.001).

Treatment Satisfaction
All patients reported high satisfaction with the 4-day treatment.
Patients said that the treatment had helped them deal more
eﬀectively with their problems, and 93.1% described that the

Benchmarking: Comparison With
Standard CBT
In order to obtain a perspective on the outcome of this pilot
study we searched the PsycINFO database for CBT studies of
PD with or without agoraphobia, which had used PDSS as
the primary outcome measure. We found nine such studies
(Barlow et al., 2000; Nakano et al., 2008; Bergström et al., 2010;
Nordin et al., 2010; Wims et al., 2010; Nations et al., 2012;
Beutel et al., 2013; Meyerbroeker et al., 2013; Otto et al., 2016)
with 517 patients in total. There were six on standard face-
to-face CBT with weekly sessions and three on Internet-based
CBT with weekly modules. The average treatment period in
the face-to-face treatments was 10 weeks (range: 5–13) with
a total treatment time of 14.4 h (range: 6.5–24), and a mean
intensity (hours of therapy per week) of 1.5 (range: 0.8–2.0). The
corresponding ﬁgures for our pilot study are 4 days and 23 h.
Comparisons on background variables showed that there was no
signiﬁcant diﬀerence regarding mean age; pilot group 31.9 years

and standard CBT 35.0 years, t(517) = 1.53, p = 0.17, or mean
duration; 5.9 and 7.6 years respectively, t(381) = 1.02, p = 0.31.
Proportion of female patients (69 vs. 64%) and proportion taking
prescribed psychotropic medication (48.3 vs. 51.6%) for the pilot
group and standard CBT did not diﬀer signiﬁcantly. Proportion
of patients diagnosed with agoraphobia did not diﬀer between the
pilot group (75.9%) and standard CBT (87.3%), but regarding
comorbidity the pilot group (55.2%) had a signiﬁcantly higher
proportion (Fisher’s exact probability test, two-tailed, p = 0.013),
than standard CBT (31.1%). However, the 4-day treatment had
zero percent attrition whereas the standard CBT conditions had
18%, a signiﬁcant diﬀerence (Fisher’s test, two-tailed, p = 0.009).
The follow-up assessment was performed after 3 months in the
4-day treatment and on average after 4.1 months (range: 1–6) in
standard CBT.

Table 6 presents the comparison on PDSS and at pre-
treatment the pilot group had a signiﬁcantly higher mean than the
combined standard CBT from the literature. However, at post-
treatment the pilot group had a signiﬁcantly lower mean, whereas
there was no diﬀerence at follow-up. The mean pre–post change
scores were 10.45 versus 7.36, and pre-follow-up 10.97 versus
9.51, for the pilot group and standard CBT, respectively, but
these diﬀerences cannot be tested without the individual patients’
values.

Table 7 displays the comparisons on remission rate using
the three sets of criteria described earlier. These showed that
the 4-day treatment yielded signiﬁcantly higher remission rates
than standard CBT, irrespective of which criterion used. At post-
treatment 72–79% of patients in the 4-day format were remitted

Data for Standard CBT were taken from the published studies using the PDSS
as the primary outcome measure: standard CBT used four different criteria of
remission: (1) free from PD-diagnosis, (2) CGI-Severity rating of 1 or 2, (3) CGI-
Improvement rating of ≤2, and (4) PDSS score of ≤5 for PD, ≤7 for PDA.

versus 51% for standard CBT, and at follow-up the numbers
were 72–83% for intensive treatment versus 52% for standard
treatment.

DISCUSSION

This is the ﬁrst pilot study where the Bergen 4-day treatment
is given to patients with PD. Nearly 80% of the patients in
the current pilot study had previous unsuccessful treatment
courses, while at
the time of referral 62% was receiving
ongoing unsuccessful treatment courses with an average length
of 12 months in the specialist health care, and were referred by
their therapists due to lack of improvement. The aim of this
pilot study was to test the feasibility, acceptability, and clinical
outcome of the Bergen 4-day treatment for PD with or without
agoraphobia.

The clinical outcome was also very good with a change score
on the PDSS equivalent to an eﬀect size of 2.63 at post and 2.76
at 3-month follow-up. On the CGI-Severity scale the within-
group eﬀect size was extremely large; 7.12 at post and 6.95
at follow-up. Finally, using the most conservative criteria, the
proportion of responders was 75% post-treatment and 90% at
follow-up, whereas the proportion in remission was 72% both at
post-treatment and follow-up assessment.

In the group of patients 66% were unable to work due to their
PD and they had been out of the job market for 14 months on
average. After the treatment 93% reported that they were working
or able to work. This dramatic change in ability to work after only
4 days of treatment could represent an immense gain in quality of
life, personal, and socio-economical functioning.

Furthermore,

the patients’ satisfaction with the received
treatment was very high with a mean post-treatment CSQ-8
score of 30.2 when the maximum is 32. The patients were highly
satisﬁed with the 4-day treatment, regarding amount, quality,
and relevance of the treatment. Furthermore, all patients would
recommend the treatment to a friend who might need treatment
for PD, and all patients said that would return to the clinic if they
needed.

Moreover, 55% had various comorbid disorders and 48% were
taking psychotropic drugs for their PD. When comparing this
pilot sample with the combined patient sample from nine studies
of standard CBT there were no signiﬁcant diﬀerences regarding
mean age, duration of PD, proportion of females, proportion
with agoraphobia, or proportion on prescribed psychotropic
drugs. However, the pilot group had a signiﬁcantly higher
proportion with comorbid disorders. Thus, it can be concluded
that the present sample was at least as severe, if not more
so, as the combined standard CBT sample from published
studies.

When comparing the treatment eﬀect on PDSS we found
that the pilot group had a signiﬁcantly higher pre-treatment
and a signiﬁcantly lower post-treatment score than the mean of
six standard CBT-studies, whereas the follow-up diﬀerence was
non-signiﬁcant. Also, the proportion achieving remission was
signiﬁcantly higher for the pilot group both at post-treatment and
at follow-up. Signiﬁcant changes were also seen in measures of

depression and generalized anxiety. A tentative conclusion is that
the 4-day treatment yielded at least as good treatment eﬀects as
standard CBT carried out over 10 weeks. However, it should be
emphasized that these kinds of statistical comparisons are open
to questioning since the samples may diﬀer on some variables
which have been found to predict outcome, but which have not
been described in the published studies, which were published
2010 to 2016. Based on these results, the initiation of a RCT to
test the eﬀectiveness for the Bergen 4-day treatment of PD is
recommended.
