The overarching aim of this paper is to review research on relationship education programs and
approaches that have been published or accepted for publication since the last review article in
2002. This paper provides a critical overview of the relationship education field and sets an agenda
for research and practice for the next decade. A theme weaved throughout the paper are the ways
in which relationship education is similar and different from couples therapy and we conclude that
there can be a synergistic, healthy marriage between the two. We then provide recommendations
for future directions for research in the relationship education field. Finally, the co-authors
comment on our experiences in both the relationship education field and couples therapy field as
both researchers and interventionists.

The overarching aim of this paper is to review research on relationship education programs
and approaches that have been published or accepted for publication since the last review
article (Halford, Markman, Kline, & Stanley, 2003). We include research published from
2002 and beyond. Our overarching aim is to provide a critical overview of the relationship
education field and set an agenda for research and practice for the next decade.

We start by discussing why we decided to use the term “relationship education” as
compared to other terms such as marriage education, couples/marriage enrichment, couples/
marriage enhancement, couples communication, and prevention of marital distress and
divorce. We also provide an overview of the ways in which relationship education differs
from couples therapy. Next, we briefly discuss the rationale for relationship education in
terms of theory, research, and changing demographics. We then provide a review of the
outcome research on relationship education during the past decade and highlight the key
issues in the field based on this review. We highlight training issues for relationship
education researchers (current and future) and provide recommendations for future research
in the relationship education field. Finally, at the end of the paper each of us (the co-
authors), comment on our experiences in marrying the relationship education and couples
therapy fields.

Defining Relationship Education

For the purposes of the paper, we broadly define relationship education as efforts or
programs that provide education, skills, and principles that help individuals (a person not in
a relationship or a person without his or her partner) and couples (both partners
participating) increase their chances of having healthy and stable relationships. Extensive
overlap exists between relationship education and couples enrichment, communication,
enhancement, and prevention programs. Enrichment and enhancement programs are
examples of marital health promotion interventions (Van Widenfelt, Hosman, Schaap, &

van der Staak, 1996) and are typically designed to help couples who wish to increase their
level of relationship satisfaction (e.g., Silliman & Schumm, 2000). Communication
programs, as their name suggests, are designed to teach couples effective communication
skills. We divide prevention programs into three types based on principles of prevention
science applied to couples (Markman, Stanley, & Kline, 2003). Universal prevention
programs typically start with young couples who are happy and share the goal of keeping
happy couples happy (Markman & Floyd, 1980). Selected intervention programs focus on
couples at risk for distress or divorce. Finally, indicated programs target couples in the early
stages of distress. We decided to use the term relationship education to cover all of these
areas because most enrichment, enhancement, communication, and prevention programs
include relationship education (and skill training) as a key component. While other authors
may prefer the term couples relationship education (Halford, Markman, & Stanley, 2008;
Hawkins, Blanchard, Baldwin, & Fawcett, 2008), we decided to omit the “couples” to
include relationship education interventions delivered to individuals.

In the last comprehensive review paper, Halford, Markman, Kline, and Stanley (2003)
defined best practices in relationship education as having seven key features: 1) assessment
and measurement of variables associated with risk for distress or divorce (e.g., having
divorced parents, negative communication), 2) encouragement of high-risk couples to
participate, 3) assessment and education about relationship aggression, 4) the provision of
relationship education at transition points (e.g., around the time of the birth of the first
baby), 5) the provision of relationship education to “mildly distressed” couples early in the
progression towards distress, 6) adaptation of programs for couples with diverse
populations, and 7) increased accessibility of evidence-based relationship education. As we
proceed, in our review of the recent literature we will examine the progress toward these
goals that Halford et al. (2003) set forth for the relationship education field.

Relationship Education and Couples Therapy

Research and practice clearly indicate that couples who participate in relationship education
programs sometimes report distress and may require therapy (Hawkins et al., 2008). As
noted by Ooms (2010), there is substantial confusion amongst couples, service providers,
and social policy makers concerning relationship education and couples therapy. For a
comprehensive review of couples therapy programs and research see Lebow (2010). For a
fuller discussion of the differences and similarities between couples therapy and relationship
education, please see Ooms (2010). Here, we focus on the area where the boundaries are
somewhat blurred, with the goal of elucidating the similarities and differences between the
two fields.

We define therapy as interventions delivered to distressed couples with the goal of helping
them become less distressed and increasing the health of their relationships. Usually,
couples therapy involves one therapist and one couple. However, couples therapy can be
offered to individuals with the goal of helping the couple (see more about this below in
terms of individual interventions that are designed to impact a couple). Thus, one of the key
distinctions between relationship education and couples therapy is that relationship
education is typically delivered in workshop settings to a variety of couples, whereas
couples therapy is typically delivered to distressed couples, one couple at a time. Another
important distinction is that relationship education is typically manualized, whereas therapy,
as delivered in the community, is typically not manualized. Without a manual, practitioners
are prone to following their own experiences and instincts (Dimond, Havens, & Jones,
1978), which may reduce the effectiveness of interventions. Relationship education’s
manualized approach may make delivering research-based interventions more accessible to
practitioners (especially those with little prior experience with couples.)

Nonetheless, as noted earlier, the distinctions between relationship education and couples
therapy do blur at times. For example, relationship education can be part of therapeutic
approaches (e.g., Birchler, Fals-Stewart & O’Farrell, 2008) and most research-based
therapies combine education with counseling. For example, Cognitive-Behavioral Couples
Therapy has skill training at its core, due to its origins in the late 1970’s with the work of
Stuart (1969) and Weiss (e.g., Birchler, Weiss, & Vincent, 1975; Weiss & Heyman, 1997),
followed up by the work of others such as Gottman, Notarius, Markman, Jacobson,
Margolin, Baucom, Epstein, Christensen, Halford, Hahlweg, Snyder, and Stanley. In our
own research-based couples therapy practices, we often teach the Speaker-Listener
Technique, which involves relationship education and skills training (Markman, Stanley, &
Blumberg, 2010). Similarly, the empirically-supported Integrative Behavioral Couple
Therapy approach includes some communication skills training (Jacobson, Christensen,
Prince, Cordova, & Eldridge, 2000).

One important difference between therapy and education is the approach to couples’
discussions. Therapists often interrupt an interaction between two partners in therapy to
make their own interpretations and comments about the content of the discussion. This kind
of direct intervention with a couple regarding the content of their interaction is much less
common in relationship education. Relationship education tends to focus on teaching
couples the skills needed to work out issues in general. In contrast, practitioners in couple
therapy tend to help partners work on specific issues while using communication skills in
the process. Thus, one way to illuminate differences between relationship education and
couples therapy is to clearly indicate to relationship education participants that they will be
receiving education and skill training. Participants in relationship education should also be
informed that, they will not receive attention on specific issues or specific skills sets, as they
would in couples therapy.

Another important distinction between relationship education and couples therapy is that
therapy approaches are better equipped to handle the most serious problems in relationships.
These problems can include affairs, aggression, and co-morbid problems such as with
mental health, pornography, or substance abuse. Relationship education programs need to
have a plan of action to address these more serious problems. For example, in our own
relationship education work we give every attendee a referral document called Getting More
Help When Needed (please email authors for a generic version). Finally, therapists and
relationship educators can share clients, with each referring couples to the other. Based on
our own work, we have the impression that going to a relationship education program opens
the door to seeking more services when needed, however, data are needed to support these
impressions.

The troubling news about couples therapy is that relatively few couples seek couples
therapy, despite its advantages. For example, in one study of married couples, 19% of them
received some form of couples therapy. Of those who had filed for divorce, 37% received
therapy services beforehand (Johnson et al., 2002). Clearly, practitioners need to find a more
effective way to reach more couples and reach them sooner, before the most serious and
difficult problems to treat develop. In addition, when couples eventually do receive therapy,
they typically do not receive evidence-based services (Johnson et al., 2002).

Finally, and perhaps most importantly, compared to couples therapy, more couples tend to
receive relationship education. For example, a recent survey indicated that among those
married since 1990, 44% of couples had received some form of premarital relationship
education, typically provided in a religious organization (Stanley, Amato, Johnson, &
Markman, 2006). Importantly, those entering second marriages are less likely to receive
such services (Doss, Rhoades, Stanley, Markman, & Johnson, 2009). As Markman et al.

(2009) conclude, relationship education provides the best way to reach diverse (including
high risk) couples with evidence-based services.

Why is Relationship Education Important?

Although divorce rates have slowly declined in recent years (to a low point of 3.4/1000 in
2009), they continue to be high, with nearly 45% of first marriages ending in divorce (Raley
& Bumpass, 2003; Tajada-Vera & Sutton, 2010). The negative impact of family instability
is well documented and we refer readers to other reviews (e.g., Halford et al., 2003; Lebow,
Current Volume). In brief, research indicates that adults who are divorced or unmarried tend
to experience worse mental and physical health (e.g., Whisman, 2008). Furthermore,
children who experience high levels of parental conflict or the dissolution of their parents’
relationship tend to fare worse on a range of outcomes from infant development to later
adolescent social adjustment (Amato, 2001; Cummings & Davies, 1994; Grych & Fincham,
1990).

Demographic shifts—Because various forms of family instability are increasing (Lebow,
2010), we anticipate that over the next decade the negative effects of relationship distress
may expand, affecting an even larger number of people. For example, although cohabiting
relationships tend to be much less stable than marriage, more couples are choosing to live
together before marriage, or not marry at all (Stanley, Whitton, & Markman, 2004).
Furthermore, many children will experience significant family instability, given that 40% of
children are born to unmarried parents (Ventura, 2009). Many other children will witness the
divorce of their parents, and many will live with a parent who is cohabiting at some point
while growing up (see Bumpass & Lu, 2000). Further, children whose parents are unmarried
are exposed to a higher risk for abuse (Turner, Finkelhor, & Ormrod, 2007) and tend to have
poorer outcomes (Brown, 2004).

Relationship education’s response to demographic shifts—The relationship
education field has, in some ways, lagged behind these shifts in demographics and concerns
about the negative effects of relationship distress and instability. Traditionally, relationship
education services were generally limited to engaged couples or newlyweds. Recent meta-
analyses of relationship education confirms that research on relationship education has also
tended to focus on these groups (Hawkins et al., 2008; Blanchard, Hawkins, Baldwin &
Fawcett, 2009). More recently, programs have been extended to unmarried couples who may
or may not be planning marriages (such as the Building Strong Families project mentioned
later in the paper) and to individuals who may or may not be in relationships (e.g., Antle et
al., in press; Pearson, Stanley, & Rhoades, 2008). By reaching couples and individuals who
would otherwise not have had access to relationship education these programs have helped
address some of the changing family demographics, however, much more work needs to be
done. The changes in the number of couples who live together or bear children without
being married indicate that many adults form significant romantic unions long before they
marry. If relationship education only reaches those in committed, premarital relationships,
we miss opportunities to help some people make important relationship decisions. Thus,
relationship education should be extended to individuals and couples earlier in their
relationships.

Cohabitation—Additionally, it may be important to address cohabitation more directly in
relationship education, as this is a fast growing demographic and an area that most
relationship education programs do not address. Rhoades, Stanley, and Markman (2009)
offer a detailed discussion of cohabitation and relationship education. Briefly, they suggest
that relationship education with cohabiting couples needs to focus not only on teaching good
communication skills, but also on helping couples consider and discuss their expectations

for the future as well as specific psychoeducational material on commitment. They also
suggest that relationship education delivered to individuals or youth should include
information on cohabitation and, more broadly, about how to make healthy decisions in
relationships.

Children—Similarly, given the increase in the nonmarital birth rate, increasingly more
couples have children from previous relationships. As noted in an excellent review article by
Higginbotham, Miller, and Niehuis (2009), traditional relationship education programs
generally do not address issues specific to these couples who face unique issues such as
children by previous partners, co-parenting, issues related to money and paying child
support, and jealousy regarding communication with ex-partners. In a review of premarital
preparation for couples entering remarriages, normalization and social support were two of
the major factors couples found to be useful. Research-based programs specifically for
remarital couples, building in part on the work of Higginbotham and colleagues, are now
underway (Whitton, Nicholson & Markman, 2008, for a review). Thus, while the first
decade of the new millennium has seen some major expansion in the reach of relationship
education, both the content and the reach need even greater expansion to keep up with the
changing makeup of families in the United States.

Before reviewing the studies that have been published from 2002 to the present, we first
provide an overview of the conceptual model underlying some of the evidence-based
relationship education programs.

Theoretical Rationale for Major Models of Intervention

In brief, the major theoretical rationale for most evidence-based relationship education
programs (drawing from behavioral exchange and social learning theories) is that the quality
of communication and conflict management early in a relationship is associated with the
quality and the health of the relationship over time. Over the last several decades, several
long-term studies following couples before marriage indicate that the seeds of future marital
problems often present themselves in early interactions (e.g., Markman, Rhoades, Stanley,
Whitton, & Ragan, 2010, also see Wadsworth & Markman, 2010). Thus, evidence-based
relationship education programs focus on modifying interactions associated with future
relationship outcomes (Halford, Markman, & Stanley, 2008).

The conceptual base of the research extends beyond the simple association between
communication, conflict management, and future outcomes. For example, in the past decade
the field has increasingly focused on both research and theory regarding the following: 1)
positive factors as protective factors in relationships as well as the role of transformative
processes in relationships, such as commitment, sacrifice, and forgiveness (see Fincham,
Stanley, & Beach, 2007), 2) the link between marital quality and a variety of individual
functioning dimensions, as reviewed earlier (e.g., Whisman, 2008), and 3) how parenting
and child functioning are related to marital quality and vice versa (e.g., Cowan, Cowan,
Pruett, Pruett, & Wong, 2009). Finally, as noted elsewhere (Markman, Rhoades, Delaney,
White, & Pacific, 2009) evidence-based relationship education programs often follow a
prevention science model that focuses on intervening on risk factors associated with future
problems, as well as protective factors associated with future relationship health (see Coie et
al., 1993).

Relationship Education Research Review

Here we provide a comprehensive review of the research published (or accepted for
publication) since the last decade review article (2002-present). The bulk of the information
from our review is included in Table 1. In this table we list the authors, date of publication,

sample characteristics, sample size, intervention program, research design (i.e., control
group, random assignment), assessment points, and outcomes.

Descriptive Summary of What We Found (See Table 1)

We found 30 studies which evaluated a total of 21 programs. The results generally indicated
that relationship education programs as compared to a variety of control groups were
successful in improving outcomes ranging from communication to marital satisfaction
(adjustment) to individual function. We do not elaborate on the specifics of the findings here
because they are reviewed in detail in the table and two recent meta-analyses also provide an
excellent overview of findings (Blanchard et al., 2009; Hawkins et al., 2008). These meta-
analyses report, for example, an effect size of .44 for communication measures at post–test
as well as follow-up. These effect sizes, though somewhat lower than those that are found
for treatment studies, are impressive given that the majority of the studies are prevention
studies. Interestingly, stronger findings emerged for more rigorous designs (e.g., randomized
controlled trials).

Overall, while the outcome findings were both interesting and important, we feel that the
most important set of findings in the past decade emerged from two large-scale projects.
First, a study on the effectiveness of the Prevention and Relationship Enhancement Program
(Markman et al., 2010) in the U.S. Army indicated an effect of relationship education for
divorce. Divorce is rarely studies in research on relationship education because of the
necessity of large samples and long-term data. In that study, relationship education reduced
the risk for divorce two-fold, as measured one-year after the intervention (Stanley, Allen,
Markman, Rhoades, & Prentice, 2010).

One other particularly important study conducted during the past decade is the federally-
funded Building Strong Families study (Wood, McConnell, Moore, Clarkwest, & Hsueh,
2010). In the first report on this large-scale (N = 5,102), eight-site randomized controlled
trial of relationship education provided to unmarried couples who are having a child together
(see www.buildingstrongfamilies.org). Preliminary results from the Building Strong
Families study are generally disappointing, with very few positive effects of relationship
education and even some negative effects (Wood et al., 2010). When sites were analyzed
separately, only one site showed significant positive findings across many of the relationship
quality variables. This one site, located in Oklahoma City and called Family Expectations,
integrated PREP with a program called Becoming Parents (Jordan, Markman, Stanley &
Blumberg, 1999). The results showed that participating couples were more likely to stay
together; had higher levels of happiness, support, affection, and fidelity, and were better at
parenting than couples in the control group.

One reason Oklahoma’s program may show positive outcomes while other do not is that
they have a higher-than-average rate of intervention completion. This high rate of
completion may be partly attributable to the fact that Oklahoma uses material incentives for
program participation. For example, couples earn “Crib Cash” that they can spend at an on-
site store for session attendance (see http://www.familiesok.org/thecrib.html).

Another possible reason for the success of the Oklahoma’s Family Expectations program
may be their innovative implementation of post-workshop services. These services included
booster sessions as well as planned activities for couples and families, such as a holiday
party every December for program participants. Such services should be strongly considered
in future relationship education programs and their effects should be evaluated in research
over the next decade.

In addition, the very strong organizational structure supporting the delivery of Family
Expectations likely plays an important part in the outcomes achieved. The program is well-
staffed and run professionally. More generally, stronger administration of large scale
community-based relationship education efforts will likely be associated with stronger
outcomes. For more discussion of the Family Expectations program and findings from the
Building Strong Families evaluation specific to Oklahoma, see Devaney and Dion (2010).

Methodological Strengths and Weaknesses

In this section we use the format in Table 1 as much as possible to review the strengths and
weaknesses of the studies conducted on relationship education from 2002 to 2009.

Sample characteristics—The samples described in Table 1 included a mix of premarital
and marital couples, with most studies either not distinguishing between the two or
combining the two groups in analyses. Many of the studies included cohabiting participants,
but most did not indicate how many, nor did they look at differences between married and
cohabiting participants. When information on couples’ satisfaction was provided, many
studies used cutoffs to eliminate distressed couples from the samples.

More generally, the couples included in the research reflect the increasing diversity of the
field. Studies now include evaluations of interventions for couples with low income levels,
unmarried couples with a child together, couples in which one partner has a medical
problem, military couples, foster and adoptive parents, step-families, and couples with
children. Thus, good progress continues on the aforementioned recommendations by
Halford et al. (2003) in the last review paper of increasing the accessibility of services for
high risk and diverse populations. There have been major strides in the last decade to offer
and evaluate services to couples with low-income levels, including the large scale, multi-site
evaluation mentioned earlier (Wood et al., 2010; for a full review see Hawkins & Ooms,
2010). Also consistent with the recommendations from the last review paper, we found
evaluations of programs that offer services during transition periods.

Nevertheless, wide gaps exist between the diversity of those who are participating in
research and whom we are serving in practice. That is, the participants receiving services are
not generally included in the studies we have reviewed. Many populations exist that are
either underserved or not served at all including: older couples; gay, lesbian, or
transgendered couples; separated and divorced people; cohabiting couples; and single people
searching for a relationship. Recently, Whitton and her research team have started to
evaluate a relationship education program for gay couples (e.g., Whitton & Buzzella, 2011).
We hope that the field will continue to reach out to diverse populations in terms of both
delivery of research-based services and the evaluation of these services using rigorous
research design in the next decade.

Interventions—Several different intervention approaches were evaluated in the last
decade. Although increasing diversity in the content of and approach to relationship
education may be positive in some ways, some of these programs are not grounded in theory
and/or research. Furthermore, many of the studies in Table 1 were evaluated by researchers
who developed, and sometimes delivered, their own interventions. These kinds of research
designs may lead to bias in the research. One solution to this potential bias is to have other
research teams evaluate programs.

In addition, despite the strong recommendation made by Halford et al. (2003) in the
previous decade review programs explicitly target the prevention of relationship aggression,
most interventions fail to do so. Teaching couples conflict management skills in an
education program is not to be confused with “anger management” treatment programs,

which are explicitly designed to treat intimate-partner violence. There is one study which
suggests that learning conflict management may reduce the risk of later aggression
(Markman & Hahlweg, 1993) but relationship education hoping to prevent or reduce
aggression need to go beyond teaching conflict management skills (e.g., helping those in
unsafe relationships end them, teaching anger management skills, changing attitudes about
women, and teaching attendees about healthy relationships). Some of these interventions
will need to focus on partners individually, rather than having them attend together (see
Rhoades & Stanley, in press for more discussion).

A larger problem for this field is that most relationship education services that are delivered
are not being evaluated at all. Thus, linkages between practices as defined by Halford et al.
(2003), current practice, and research on current practice, remain separated by wide gaps
that need to be bridged in the next decade.

Design—As indicated in Table 1, there is much diversity in the methodological quality of
the studies. On the positive side, there have been several randomized clinical trials (RCTs)
implemented in the last decade. This kind of design is the strongest in terms of establishing
effects of an intervention (more on RCTs below). Though we did not examine effect sizes,
meta-analyses conducted by others (Blanchard et al., 2009; Carroll & Doherty, 2003;
Hawkins et al., 2008) indicate that the most powerful effect sizes emerge from the best
methodologically-designed research. The majority of the studies conducted in the last
decade used weaker designs. In terms of the type of control group, most studies used a no-
intervention control group, and the second most frequently used control group was an
alternative intervention. There were no placebo-control group designs to control for
attention and expectations, which could provide alternative explanations for positive effects.
In research conducted prior to the studies reviewed in the current paper, several studies used
placebo controls such as reading a relationship book (e.g., Halford, Sanders & Behrens,
2001) or watching and discussing a movie (Rogge, Cobb, Johnson, Lawrence, & Bradbury,
2002). In general, relationship education programs have outperformed placebo control
groups.

Measuring outcomes—The majority of the studies revealed positive effects of
relationship education on key indicators of relationship quality including communication
quality, conflict management skills and relationship satisfaction. However, there were a
paucity of studies that measured communication using observational measures, which are
the gold standard in terms of assessing communication (Markman & Notarius, 1987; Weiss,
Heyman, Halford, & Markman, 1997). In addition, very few studies measured other
important dimensions of relationship quality including measures of protective factors, such
as commitment, friendship, and passion.

Follow-ups—The absence of long-term follow-up is notable. More studies need to include
longer-term follow-ups, as the vast majority of studies assess outcomes only at post-test.
This is a major problem, because the goals of prevention programs are by definition long-
term in nature. In addition, there need to be at least three data points to apply state-of-the-art
growth curve analyses to evaluate change over time. Without more assessment points, non-
linear effects in relationship education cannot be captured. Perhaps even more importantly,
future research needs to document how long the effects of relationship education last and if
“sleeper effects” emerge over time. In general the data that do exist show that long-term
follow-up trajectories display a tendency toward attenuation (e.g., Bodenmann, Pihet,
Shantinath, Cina, & Widmer, 2006), highlighting the need for booster sessions and other
post-intervention services.

Only one study evaluated the use of booster sessions (Braukhaus, Hahlweg, Kroeger, Groth,
& Fehm-Wolfsdorf, 2003), and it found promising results. However, these findings require
replication with a control group and in a randomized clinical trial. In general, although most
researchers recommend booster sessions, few programs use them, fewer studies evaluate
them, and those that do have trouble persuading couples to participate (e.g., Pregulman,
Rienks, Markman, Wadsworth, Einhorn & Moran, in press).

Suggested Program of Research and Interventions with Diverse Populations

Many of the studies reviewed in Table 1 are not incorporated into a systematic program of
planned research. Here, we offer a model for researchers who want to develop a program of
research consistent with the best practices for relationship education research. The first step
is to start with a population of interest (preferably a high-risk population) and then develop,
use, or adapt a relationship education program for these couples and/or individuals. The next
step is to pilot the intervention and then use a pre-post, no control group design, to see if
there are effects over time and if it is acceptable to the population of interest (see Markman
et al., 2004, for an example). Then, research teams can move first to quasi-experimental
studies, then to randomized clinical trials, and finally to dissemination trials. It is also
important to have other researchers cross-validate findings to ensure that results are not
biased.

A stage that is often missed and that is relatively easy to implement is to conduct
“effectiveness” studies where real world use of the intervention is evaluated through
assessments on outcomes of interest from clients, service providers, and organizations.
Some research teams have been successful in moving studies in a laboratory setting (i.e.,
efficacy studies) to testing disseminations of intervention with different populations in real-
world settings (Hahlweg, Grawe, & Baucom, 2010). While more research is needed,
evaluations of dissemination studies have yielded promising findings (e.g., Markman et al.,
2004).

Thus, there is emerging evidence from the past decade that research-based programs
developed in university settings are transportable to a number of community settings (see
also Wood et al., 2010). The transportability of relationship education constitutes one of the
major accomplishments in the field because we have now reached hundreds of thousands of
people since the last review, including close to a quarter of a million people in Oklahoma
alone (Ooms, 2010).

Mechanisms of change—Progress has also continued to be made in investigating
mechanisms of change for relationship education interventions (see Wadsworth &
Markman, 2010, for a review). To show that a mechanism of change is operating,
evaluations first must show that the targets of the intervention (e.g., communication quality)
change from pre to post and then must show that changes in the target variable(s) are
associated with other changes of interest (e.g., improved relationship satisfaction, lower
divorce rate). The findings presented in Table 1 and meta-analyses (e.g., Hawkins et al.,
2008) indicate that the target variables of interventions do typically change. Most of the
studies reviewed in Table 1 (as well as studies from prior decades) show that couples
improve their ability to communicate from pre to post assessment compared to control
groups. However, mixed findings emerge when researchers examine the extent to which
changes in such target variables are associated with other outcomes of interest. In at least
one case, the findings were not in the predicted direction (see Schilling et al., 2003).
However, these results may be attributable to correlations between husband and wife
interactions that were not taken into account (Stanley et al., 2007). Nonetheless, the existing
body of research on mechanisms of change in relationships leaves much to be discovered.

Future work should continue to attempt to identify why programs are successful and what
the key ingredients are to helping couples and individuals improve their relationships. The
relationship education (and marital therapy) field can benefit from following the lead of the
conduct disorder and substance abuse fields both of which as demonstrated stronger
evidence for mechanism of change of therapeutic interventions in these areas.

Moderators—Moderators are also very important to consider when evaluating relationship
education programs. Here, the questions revolve around the extent to which a program
works differently and produces different outcomes for one group versus another. A major
issue in the field that has emerged in the last decade, for example, is whether relationship
education programs work better for high risk (e.g., children of divorce and aggression)
versus low risk couples (Halford et al., 2008). The Building Strong Families study and the
related report specific to Oklahoma’s site also identified some potential moderators of
effects, particularly race (African American or not) and education (see Devaney & Dion,
2010; Wood et al., 2010). The answers to questions about which groups benefit more or less
are decidedly mixed and moderators remain a burning topic for the next decade to tackle.
Wadsworth and Markman (in press) provide a more detailed discussion of moderator effects.

Issues in Conducting Randomized Clinical Trials (RCTs)

Conducting a RCT is easier said than done and here we very briefly cover some of the issues
in designing and implementing a RCT in the relationship education field. One of the most
interesting research issues in the field is how to design a randomized clinical trial. We next
describe the approach to RCTs that the Administration for Children and Families has taken
in their two large-scale RCTs of relationship education. We focus on these projects because
their very large sample sizes and in-depth measurement mean that they have the power to
make a significant impact on this field in the coming decade. Just as there are many ways to
have a good relationship, there are many ways to do a very good randomized clinical trial.

Both of these studies focus on the effectiveness of relationship education delivered by
community organizations to couples with low-income levels. Instead of focusing on the
evaluation of one specific program or intervention, they each use a multisite design in which
each site chose it’s own program. Thus, these projects are evaluations of relationship
education in general, not a particular approach to relationship education (see
www.buildingstrongfamilies.org and www.supportinghealthymarriage.org for more details).

With regard to the design of these RCTs, both projects include random assignment of
couples to either relationship education or a no-treatment control group. The Building
Strong Families RCT (Wood et al., 2010) described earlier used an “intent-to-treat”
approach to analyses that is different what is often used in this field. An intent-to-treat
approach is more common in studies evaluating the implementation of a program (rather
than the effectiveness of a specific curriculum) and it involves analyzing data from all
participants as they were randomized, regardless of whether they completed the intervention.
Importantly, across the eight sites involved in this study, 39% of couples who entered the
study did not attend any sessions at all, which may have reduced the impact of the program.

Another characteristic that different about these studies versus most studies in this field is
that neither of them conducted what are typical pre assessments, wherein which key
outcome variables are measured before the intervention. Instead, they collected baseline
information on demographics and are now collecting data at planned intervals post-
intervention.

The rationale for not conducting pre-assessments is that random assignment of couples to
conditions assures that all pre-test variables, if collected, would be equal across groups.

Avoiding a comprehensive pre-assessment also decreases the risk of the assessment serving
as an unmeasureable intervention in itself. Under these assumptions, comparing groups at
follow-up assessment points will answer the research questions effectively. Although this
makes sense, uncertainty remains because pre-test differences may exist due to unplanned
selection effects or chance occurrences (e.g., when a coin is tossed 10 times, sometimes it
comes out to 8 heads and 2 tails). In addition, because there are no pre-post data, questions
regarding mechanisms of change cannot be directly investigated.

In our own work, even with random assignment, we sometimes have significant pre-test
differences. However, we know these differences exist and we have the option of dealing
with the differences in our analyses. Using propensity scores to handle group differences in
quasi-experimental designs may also be used in RCTs when pre-test differences exist (David
Atkins, personal communication, May, 2010). Further discussion as how best to deal with
such differences is beyond the scope of this paper.

Another issue in RCTs involves the recruitment of couples. Three strategies have been used
in the field: 1) Recruit couples for basic research and after couples complete the basic
research (which provides pre-assessment data), then randomly assign them to intervention or
control group(s) and tell them about the intervention. In other words, couples do not know
anything about the intervention until after completing the basic research. Researchers using
this strategy tend to have a large “decliner” group since couples did not volunteer to be in
the research knowing there was an intervention option and thus many will not be interested.
2) Recruit couples for intervention and then tell them about the research after random
assignment. In this scenario, you might get more attrition from couples in the control group
since they were denied an intervention in which they were interested. 3) Recruit couples for
an intervention study and tell participants about all the research conditions so that they agree
to participate in whatever group to which they are assigned. In this approach, assignment to
a group happens after pre-assessment. In all of these approaches, pre-assessment must occur
before condition assignment so that researchers avoid biases associated with knowing one’s
condition. However, under the third approach, participants may still slant responses one way
or the other, depending on which group they would like to get into. True placebo control
designs may mitigate this issue if all interventions appear equally plausible.

Researchers must remember that random assignment does not guarantee representation of
the population. Clearly, the strongest studies randomly select from the population of interest
(e.g., all couples who live in the United States) and then randomly assign participants to
intervention and control conditions. To our knowledge, such a study has not yet been done,
but it would be a highly valuable contribution to this field.

How the Field has Changed Since the Last Review

In reviewing how the field has changed in the last decade, we focus on funding and social
policy initiatives, the general practice of relationship education, and the research we have
reviewed.

Funding and social policy—A significant development in the last decade has been the
creation of several large-scale programs that have led to the widespread use of relationship
education programs in the community. The first of these programs is the federal Healthy
Marriage and Fatherhood Initiative, funded by the Administration of Children and Families
(ACF), which has provided over $150,000,000 for services in the form of 5-year grants
beginning in 2006 and ending in 2011. (Note: New funding for healthy marriage
programming in 2011 was announced in December 2010 with the reauthorization of the
Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program, although, at the time this paper went to
press, the ACF has not yet indicated how these funds will be allocated.) This federal Healthy

Marriage and Fatherhood Initiative also funded the two large-scale evaluation studies
mentioned earlier.

A second development in the last decade is that several states now have healthy marriage
initiatives of their own (see the National Healthy Marriage Resource Center’s website for
more information: www.healthymarriageinfo.org/programs/index.cfm). The state that has
devoted the most energy toward the goal of increasing access to relationship education is
Oklahoma. Since that state’s marriage initiative began in 1999, over 240,000 residents of
Oklahoma have received relationship education, representing the largest dissemination
project related to relationship education this field has ever seen. For more information about
this program, see Dion (2006) and Hendrick (2008). For a discussion of related policy
implication of initiatives like Oklahoma’s, see Amato and Maynard’s work (2007).

A third large-scale community program is the U.S. Army’s Strong Bonds program that
offers relationship education throughout the Army. Services within this program are
delivered by Army clergy members to all levels of Army personnel and their families (see:
www.strongbonds.org). These two programs have greatly increased the visibility of
relationship education for policy makers and they have led to very widespread dissemination
of relationship education activities.

One issue related to these new, large-scale dissemination programs is whether programs are
research-based and empirically-tested. PREP remains the only program that has been rated
as empirically-based and tested by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services
Administration (SAMHSA; see http://www.nrepp.samhsa.gov). Evaluations of programs
that are being widely used, including those funded under federal and state initiatives, are
needed and should be a high priority in the field because many couples are now receiving
services that have not been adequately tested.

Innovations in research and practice—There has been an increase in the diversity of
programs offered to couples and individuals, including many based research-based
relationship education programs like Couples Communication (Miller, Nunnally &
Wackman, 1976) Relationship Enhancement (Guerney, 1977), Couple Care (Halford, 2011),
and PREP (Markman et al., 2010). There are also new programs that represent creative
variations on traditional relationship education themes, such as a mindfulness-based
intervention (Carson, Carson, Gil, & Baucom, 2004) and individual interventions designed
to both enhance couples relationships (Markman et al., 2009), as well as to help partners exit
unhealthy relationships and improve their chances for successful mate selection (Rhoades &
Stanley, 2009). A fuller discussion of the important trends in the relationship education field
with regards to providing programs for individuals (both in and out of relationships) is
included below.

We noted in our research review that there was an increase of evaluations on the impact of
relationship education services as delivered to couples who are more diverse than the White
middle-class couples who were typically the focus of earlier studies. At the same time,
services are being provided to many other groups and these services have not been
evaluated. Such groups include: partners in same-sex relationships, individuals in prisons,
students in middle school and high school, refugee couples, and couples in other countries.
Thus, more evaluations of the services now being delivered need to be a high priority for the
field.

In terms of diversity in modes of service delivery, in the last decade, the relationship
education field has provided services over the telephone and over the Internet, as well as the
provision of relationship coaching over the phone (e.g., Halford, 2010; Loew et al., 2011),

We have also increased diversity in where services are delivered, with the most important
changes being in the provision of services in the communities in which people live. We have
increased the diversity of service providers, such that service providers are often now trained
to provide services in a particular setting while delivering a specific program (Markman et
al., 2009). We suggest elsewhere that the “messenger matters” and that service deliverers
who know the couples and their experiences and backgrounds may do a better job than even
trained professionals (Markman et al., 2004). For example, in our work with the U.S. Army
evaluating PREP for Strong Bonds (e.g., Stanley et al., 2010), the service providers are
chaplains, and many go to war with the soldiers in the program. Such connections of service
providers to participants in a program likely contributes to higher levels of alliance with
leaders, and higher alliance has been linked with more positive outcomes (Owens, Rhoades,
Stanley, & Markman, in press).

Thus, the field is beginning to provide services to couples who desire and need our services,
regardless of ability to pay. The services are delivered in their community by a service
provider trained specifically for the program and who is either a community member or
knows the audience well. All of the above ideas are consistent with the philosophy and
principles of the Community Mental Health Center Movement that was fueled by the
passage of the Community Mental Health Centers Act in 1963. Interestingly (and sadly) the
Community Mental Health Center Act was the last piece of legislation John F. Kennedy
signed before he was tragically assassinated less than a month later. A more detailed review
of the links between the relationship education and the Community Mental Health Center
Act is provided by Markman et al. (2009).

Issues and Recommendations

In this section, we highlight the major issues from our review and make recommendations
for the next decade of research and practice. We use a best practices framework to compare
what we recommended 10 years ago to the current state of the field and future goals.

Engaging men

Research to date has suggested that virtually every group that has had an opportunity to
participate in relationship education programs have expressed high levels of interest and
participation, though there are barriers unique to each group (e.g., childcare for children).
There are also common barriers for all couples, such as getting both partners “in the room, ”
so that they can receive services at the same time. Many of the common barriers are
discussed by Pregulman et al. (in press). Here we focus on one of biggest issue in the field --
motivating men to participate in research and interventions. While relationship education
has been particularly appealing to men given the focus on learning skills, ground rules, and
talking without fighting (Ooms, 2010), there is still a lot of work to be done. For example,
one barrier for men is their concern about sharing feelings and dealing with past issues. In
our work in PREP, we tell partners that they are not expected to share personal information
with the other couples in the room and that talking about personal issues is only done with
each other. In addition we tell couples that we focus on current and future issues, rather than
stirring up the past. Also appealing to some men is our approach of focusing on being aware
of the importance of the relationship as well as deciding rather than sliding when it comes to
relationship decisions. Finally, we have found that using male/female presenting teams
provides another way of increasing men’s participation.

Enhance motivation and consider incentives

A key issue in the relationship education field involves motivating people who are not
currently experiencing problems to seek services or take advantage of services. As we noted

before, it is hard to convince couples who are experiencing problems to seek help, so it is
often even harder to convince people not experiencing difficulty to seek services (also see
Doss et al., 2009).

One very controversial solution to the motivation issue facing our field is the issue of
providing incentives. Many people in the field think that it is inappropriate from a research
or service perspective to pay couples for their participation in interventions. However,
incentivizing couples seems to be working in Oklahoma (see earlier discussion and Devaney
& Dion, 2010). While data on the cost-benefit analyses of incentives are not yet available,
one could argue that for every dollar invested in having couples complete a relationship
education program (program costs plus any incentives), many times this amount would be
saved in terms of health care costs, divorce, child behavior problems, and work loss (Turvey
& Olson, 2006 ). Thus, relationship education is an excellent investment for a community.

Study leader effects and the alliance between leaders and attendees

There is a plethora of research in the psychotherapy literature indicating that the quality of
the relationship between clients and therapists determines outcomes (e.g., Pinsof, Zinbarg, &
Knobloch-Fedders, 2008). However, we have a paucity of studies in the relationship
education literature on the topic of alliance. One recent study indicates that the working
relationship between relationship education providers and the couples they serve is
important in understanding the impact of relationship education (Owen et al., in press).
More work in this area in clearly needed.

On a related note, there are few studies that evaluate the impact of specific leader
characteristics on outcomes. Owen et al. (in press) demonstrated that different leaders have
different degrees of impact, but the specific characteristics that make individuals good
leaders for relationship education are relatively unknown. There are a large number of
questions here both theoretical and pragmatic. For example, how important is the match
between leaders and attendees on factors such as gender, age, ethnicity, marital status, or
sexual orientation? To what extent is co-leading relationship education better, worse, or
similar, to it being delivered by one person? Do programs delivered by at least one male
presenter promote men’s engagement in relationship education? Having said all of this, our
experience leads us to conclude that the competency and enthusiasm of the presenter is more
important than any specific leader characteristics, but this is an empirical question.

Study moderators and mediators of program impact

As noted earlier, we know very little about the degree to which the proposed mechanisms of
change in relationship education programs (e.g., communication skills) are associated with
longer-term outcomes of interest (e.g., divorce, child functioning). Similarly, we know very
little about factors that moderate program effects. Research in the next decade should focus
on these very important issues (see Wadsworth & Markman, in press, for a fuller
discussion).

Employ observational measures

Only a handful of the studies reviewed included observational measures to assess
intervention outcomes. Given that the goal of most interventions includes changing couples’
interactions, and that self-report measures of communication provide only one perspective
on interactions, the omission of observational measures precludes fully answering basic
questions about the effects of relationship education.

Evaluate dissemination efforts

There need to more studies of the effects of the dissemination of relationship education. One
important metric of such evaluations would be the use of programs by those trained in them.
For example, in one study, the majority of clergy trained in PREP were using at least parts
of the program up to 5 years after they were trained (Markman et al., 2004).

In summary, the field of relationship education has substantially advanced in the last decade.
In particular, the field has made strides toward achieving some of the “best practices” in
relationship education recommended in the last decade review, including increasing access
to programs, reaching out to high risk and diverse populations, and including information on
healthy relationships. Paraphrasing Stanley (2001), we know a great deal about what works
to help couples through relationship education, but we still need to know more. Hopefully
this paper has set forth a roadmap for the field as we move forward.

The Integration of Relationship Education and Couples Therapy: A

Conversation with the Authors

We conclude by providing our personal perspectives on the relationship education field,
through the lenses of our dual roles as therapists and educators. We both are relationship
education program developers, researchers, trainers, and service providers as well as
practicing couples therapists and supervisors of trainees in couples therapy.

Who We Are

HM: I am a licensed clinical psychologist, and for 33 years I have had a relatively small
private practice seeing couples and individuals using empirically-supported interventions.
My primary clients include couples, but I also sometimes see individuals. More recently, I
have begun providing additional therapy for men in more individually-oriented therapy in
conjunction with therapy for the couple. I am also the founder of PREP and I direct and
provide supervision for a couples therapy clinic at the University of Denver.

GR: In addition to my research work at the University of Denver, I also have a small private
practice in which I see couples, individuals, and children. In my practice, I integrate
relationship education into many of my couple, adult, and adolescent cases, while also using
other empirically-supported treatments. I have also worked to develop several relationship
education curricula including one focused on individuals (rather than couples) called Within
My Reach. Additionally, I provide supervision to doctoral students on their therapy cases at
the University of Denver.

How we Integrate Relationship Education into Clinical Practice

HM: In my own work as a therapist, after an assessment of issues and history, the early
sessions with a couple tend to be very consistent with an educational approach. I teach
couples communication and conflict management skills and then teach three core principles
from our PREP family of programs: 1) to help them decide rather than slide in their
relationship during both major life transitions and on a daily basis, 2) to have them work
individually and together to make their relationship safe for positive connections, and 3) to
do their part to implement the tools they learn on a daily basis in their relationship. Our
focus on “do your part,” coincides with the recommendations of many relationship experts
(e.g., Hollis, 2003), suggesting that each partner needs to work on him or herself in order to
increase their chances of having a healthy, happy relationship. This focus on self-
improvement often helps couples improve in terms of managing negative affect, increasing
positive connections, and understanding the meaning of some of the deeper themes in
relationships such as forgiveness, sacrifice, and commitment (Fincham et al., 2007). As

therapy progresses, I integrate the basic skills and principles of relationship education with
more traditional cognitive-behavioral couples therapy, as well as other forms of couples
interventions.

GR: I integrate relationship education into my therapy practice by teaching concepts, skills,
and principles from relationship education curricula to therapy clients. In particular, I use
concepts from PREP and Within My Reach most commonly because these are the two
programs with which I am most familiar and because they have received the greatest amount
of research support in the literature. Not surprisingly, many of the communication skills that
couples learn in relationship education are also useful to couples in therapy. Indeed, as we
discussed earlier, an overlap exists between behavioral couples therapy and relationship
education in terms of the skills and principles couples learn.

Another way that I integrate relationship education includes referring clients to local
relationship education workshops. As in many states, Colorado offers free relationship
education workshops for couples and individuals through a grant from the Administration
for Children and Families (www.marrywell.org). I find that both couples and individuals in
therapy can often benefit from attending a relationship education workshop because they
learn new skills and come back to therapy thinking about their relationships in new ways. As
a clinician trained in relationship education, I can then support the new skills they have
learned and help them to continue using them well.

HM: I also find it best in my practice to have couples who come to therapy to attend a
weekend couples workshop (e.g., www.loveyourrelationship.com) as a prelude to therapy; it
is simply more efficient to teach couples these skills in groups rather than in a typical
therapy session.

Working with individuals

GR: In my practice. many individuals (both adults and older adolescents) who come for
therapy present with relationship issues, but may also have specific problems in other areas
(e.g., depression, addictions). Research suggests that relationship problems and many other
mental health problems are comorbid, and in many cases relationship issues are part of the
cause as well the treatment of the individual concern. Thus, discussing principles from
individual-oriented relationship education curricula (like Within My Reach) with clients and
teaching them communication skills for their romantic and family relationships has been
very valuable not only for their relationship issues but also for their individual issues.

HM: We have found in our research that relationship education delivered to individuals can
be successful in providing a positive impact on the attending partner as well as the non-
attending partner (Markman et al., 2009). This finding counters the prevailing wisdom in the
field that individual therapy for relationship issues is detrimental. This perspective in the
field formed in part from an early study by Gurman and Kniskern (1977) which found that
seeing one partner when there is a relationship problem may increase risks for relationship
deterioration.

Benefits of Becoming Trained in Relationship Education

GR: As a clinician, I have found that knowing relationship education curricula has also
enhanced my ease of transitioning from teaching skills to working directly on content in
therapy sessions. Having the training and skills to lead workshops in relationship education
has raised my awareness of appropriate times to teach skills formally or informally in
therapy. Depending on the clients’ needs, I sometimes teach skills from PREP or Within My
Reach in a highly structured format and assign homework directly from the curriculum.
Other times, I teach the skills less directly and provide coaching for the clients on using

skills while they are grappling with an issue in session. A background in teaching these
skills to a wide range of audiences has helped me to decide which approach to use. More
generally, knowledge of relationship education curricula extends a clinician’s toolbox,
providing a wider repertoire of skills, activities, and resources with which to provide clients.
Many of the activities that attendees complete, and most of the techniques or concepts they
learn during relationship education workshops, can easily translate into therapy. Thus,
training and experience in relationship education can increase flexibility as a therapist.

Training in relationship education can also lead to new avenues for providing services. In
my own consulting work, I have recently extended relationship education to non-romantic
relationships. For over a year, my colleagues and I have worked with the Colorado
Department of Transportation on a project teaching relationship education to their
maintenance workers. Over 1500 snow plowers and road crew workers are receiving
relationship education that is aimed both at improving communication and relationships
among co-workers, as well as, relationships with family members at home. This eight-hour
course has been very well received by the administration, as well as by the employees
themselves.

HM: I hope that service providers and researchers in the couples field will consider seeking
training in one of the research-based relationship education programs. You will have the
potential to 1) reach couples who really want our services, but have been uncomfortable
seeking them, 2) teach tools that people can learn relatively easily, and 3) offer services that
have the potential to achieve positive impacts not just on relationships, but on children,
individual well-being, and one’s community.

While relationship education services do not generally bring in a lot of income to the service
provider, social policy makers now recognize the benefits of increasing healthy relationships
and marriages in the community. Thus, providers may be able receive reimbursement
through existing or new grants or institute funding, even if they provide services for free. To
the extent funds continue to be available for such community-based relationship education
services, positions will be open for marriage and family therapy practitioners to be involved
at many levels, from workshop leaders, to trainers of other leaders, to supervisors.

GR: In general, relationship education, when it is well developed and well delivered, often is
a portal for individuals and couples to seek more intensive services for individual, couple, or
family problems. Being in a safe and supportive educational setting that provides valuable
skill training often leads attendees to consider (and often seek) opportunities for getting
more help. In addition to participants receiving a general referral list (see “Getting More
Help” document, please email the authors for a generic copy), relationship education service
providers can give targeted referrals to individuals who otherwise may not receive them.
Thus, these practices increase access to all forms of individual, couples, and family
interventions.

HM: Finally, you can amplify your impact on couples by blending relationship education in
your work. Let’s say a couples therapist is seeing 20 couples a week and couples stay in
treatment an average of 4 months. Thus, the therapist is impacting about 60 couples a year.
However, if the therapist was also to implement a relationship education event (e.g., a one
day workshop) every month with 20 couples in the event, he or she would be impacting an
additional 240 couples, some of whom may seek therapy services with that therapist after
the relationship education event.
