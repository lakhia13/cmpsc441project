Stress hormone response to the DEX–CRH
test and its relation to psychotherapy
outcome in panic disorder patients with
and without agoraphobia

Abstract
This study tested whether the hormonal stress response to the DEX–CRH test may be predictive of the psychotherapy
success for panic disorder (PD). Thirty-four patients diagnosed either with agoraphobia with PD or PD without
agoraphobia were subjected to cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). Patients (pre-therapy) and healthy volunteers
were exposed to the DEX–CRH test. Blood samples were taken for cortisol and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)
assessment. Established panic-speciﬁc questionnaires were handed out for the pre-therapy and post-therapy
evaluation of disease severity (with reference to panic beliefs and agoraphobic cognitions, fear of bodily sensations,
agoraphobic avoidance behaviour). Repeated measures ANCOVA were conducted for the analysis of the pre-therapy
hormonal response, and Pearson’s correlation analysis to test for associations with the psychotherapy outcome. Data
analyses revealed large effect sizes for CBT in the clinical measures (η2 ≥ 0.321), main effects of time for cortisol and
ACTH with no differences between both groups, and signiﬁcant associations between cortisol release and
agoraphobic cognitions for the patients. PD diagnosis had no impact on the hormonal response. However, those
patients with higher cortisol release showed less improvement after CBT (signiﬁcantly for agoraphobic cognitions).
Clinical implications of these ﬁndings are the prediction of the therapy success from a potential endocrine correlate
whose persistency (if assessed repeatedly) during the treatment may predict (non-)response to the current treatment,
possibly representing a decision support for a change in treatment to avoid the continuation of an inefﬁcient
treatment.

Introduction

Panic disorder (PD) is an episodic mental disorder
associated with substantial reductions in the quality of
life1. PD is characterised by repeated acute panic attacks,
concerns about future attacks, and their assumed impli-
cations to mental and somatic health followed by sig-
niﬁcant behavioural changes related to the panic attacks2.

Patients with PD frequently consult emergency depart-
ments and their general practitioner for a variety of
unspeciﬁc symptoms such as palpitations, dizziness, and
shortness of breath. The ﬁscal costs of PD, and even
subthreshold PD, were found to be the highest compared
to other mental disorders3. Nevertheless, treatment for
PD is available with proven efﬁcacy; the economic returns
for society far outreach individual beneﬁts.

However, even though psychotherapy is the ﬁrst choice
treatment for PD4, there is still a proportion of patients
who fail to demonstrate symptom remission following
psychotherapeutic interventions5,6. To date, psychother-
apy outcome research has put little emphasis on biological

correlates of the therapy outcome but has focused pri-
marily on symptom severity itself as negative predictor7,8,
for comorbid mental disorders9–11 and motivation for
psychotherapy8, both with no impact on the therapy
success. Studies examining biological correlates within
psychotherapy
success prediction showed that PD
patients with the lowest cortisol stress response showed
the least improvement from psychotherapy (in response
to individually feared situations12, and in response to
the Trier Social Stress Test13). Until now, it has been
uncertain if the cortisol stress response to the combined
dexamethasone suppression/corticotropin-releasing hor-
mone challenge (DEX–CRH) test, which is more cost-
efﬁcient than the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST), may be
predictive of the psychotherapy outcome as well. How-
ever, the DEX–CRH test has more adverse effects than the
TSST, for instance slight nausea, metallic taste, scraping
feeling in the throat, sensation of heat and on rare occa-
sions allergic reactions with shortage of breath14.

The combined DEX–CRH test is a widely used, reliable
tool in psychiatric research to evaluate the neuroendo-
crine course and autonomic dysregulations of psychiatric
disorders15. The DEX–CRH test requires the oral intake of
1.5 mg of a synthetic cortisol-like compound (dex-
amethasone) the night before investigation (11 pm) and
the venous injection of 100 µg CRH at the day of inves-
In mentally and somatically healthy
tigation (3 pm).
individuals,
the prolonged administration of dex-
amethasone inhibits the adrenocorticotropic hormone
(ACTH) and cortisol release after additional administra-
tion of CRH. Therefore, the hormonal response to the
DEX–CRH test provides an index for the normative
functioning of the central glucocorticoid feedback reg-
ulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis
(hence ACTH and cortisol suppression after prolonged
DEX–CRH administration)15. Generally, changes in the
activity of the HPA axis as the body’s major endocrine
stress axis have been investigated extensively in reference
to stress and anxiety or mood disorders (e.g., refs. 16,17,).
Contradictory results exists for an altered HPA axis
functionality with both evidence for a hypo- or hyper-
reactive response pattern as a function of different mental
disorders. Patients diagnosed with a major depression
often showed an increased stimulation of the HPA axis
(e.g., refs. 18–20), though a hypocortisolism pattern has
also been reported, especially in elderly patients with a
severe major depression diagnosis17. However, for anxiety,
most evidence exists for a hypo-response pattern, for
instance in patients diagnosed with PD (e.g., refs. 21–24)
and post-traumatic stress disorder (e.g., refs. 25–27).
Studies investigating the HPA axis responsivity with the
DEX–CRH test in PD patients reported mixed ﬁndings.
Most of the evidence was shown for a DEX–CRH non-
suppression in PD patients who failed to show blunted

ACTH and cortisol responses in comparison to healthy
individuals28–33. In contrast to this non-suppression pat-
tern, there is an evidence for lower cortisol levels in PD
patients as seen in healthy individuals22,34. Besides, some
studies failed to show substantial differences in the
DEX–CRH hormonal stress response between the PD
patients and healthy individuals, therefore providing evi-
dence for a “normative” DEX–CRH suppression in PD
patients (for ACTH22; for cortisol35,36; for both cortisol
and ACTH37,38). However, the impact of the hormonal
stress response to the DEX–CRH test on psychotherapy
success in PD patients is relatively unclear. In depressed
patients, DEX–CRH non-suppression has established
itself as a reliable predictor for symptom relapse39–44. In a
sample of PD patients investigated by Coryell et al. (1991),
a DEX–CRH non-suppression before treatment was
associated with more severe anxiety symptoms and dis-
ability after treatment with benzodiazepines30, yet were
unable to ﬁnd this association in an earlier sample45.

In the current investigation, patients in need of psy-
chotherapeutic care for panic and agoraphobic sympto-
matology were exposed to hormonal stress induction
using the combined DEX–CRH test at the beginning of
the psychotherapeutic intervention. We aimed at inves-
tigating previous ﬁndings of an inverse relationship
between the cortisol stress response upon the TSST, and
the psychotherapy outcome could be replicated also for
the DEX–CRH test which induces hormonal stress. Fur-
thermore, we predicted that it would be possible to
replicate an overall DEX–CRH non-suppression pre-
viously seen in patients diagnosed with PD. For this
purpose, a control group including healthy volunteers was
recruited to establish a possibility of comparison with the
“normative” hormonal response to the DEX–CRH test.

Methods
Study participants

This study was part of a trial on psychotherapy success
in patients diagnosed with PD with or without agor-
aphobia previously published13. The patient sample was
recruited from May 2008 to May 2013 from the University
Hospital of the Technische Universität Dresden, Ger-
many, before the start of cognitive behavioural psy-
chotherapy. Patients consulted the hospital on their own
initiative or upon the recommendation of their general
practitioner/psychiatrist. The healthy control participants
were recruited via newspaper advertisements and mat-
ched to the patient sample by age and sex. General
inclusion criteria were being aged 18 to 65 years and being
ﬂuent in the German language. Exclusion criteria inclu-
ded a history of substance abuse, benzodiazepine drug
use, psychotic or bipolar disorder, post-traumatic stress
disorder, eating or somatisation disorder, current preg-
nancy as well as any severe physical illness (e.g., cancer, a

metabolic or autoimmune disorder) within the previous 2
years. The Structured Clinical Interview (SCID)46,47 for
DSM-IV-TR diagnosis of mental disorders on axis I and
II2 is routine standard diagnostic in the recruiting hospital
and was conducted by trained clinical
interviewers.
Diagnoses were conﬁrmed by an experienced psy-
chotherapist (KP). Patients with a current primary diag-
nosis of PD without agoraphobia (F41.0) or agoraphobia
with PD (F40.01), were included in the study. Secondary
diagnoses of a mild major depressive disorder or speciﬁc
phobia were permitted for inclusion in the patient group.
Inclusion in the healthy control group was established
using the DIA-X stem questions48 to conﬁrm that the
participants did not have a history of mental disorders.

Forty-three patients with PD and 34 healthy volunteers
were screened with respect to the deﬁned inclusion and
exclusion criteria. Eight patients were excluded due to a
current diagnosis of psychoactive substance use disorder
(for details: n = 3 alcohol dependence syndrome, n = 2
comorbid alcohol and cannabinoid dependence syn-
drome, n = 1 cannabinoid dependence syndrome, n =
1 stimulants dependence syndrome, n = 1 multiple drug
use) and one patient due to leukaemia, resulting in a
sample of n = 34 patients with a primary diagnosis of
either agoraphobia with PD or PD without agoraphobia
(23 females, mean age ± SD: 35.50 ± 12.74) and n = 34
age-matched and sex-matched healthy volunteers (25
females, mean age ± SD: 33.82 ± 12.50). A total of n = 30
patients showed agoraphobia with PD and n = 4 patients
showed PD without agoraphobia. Four patients were on
antidepressant medication (selective serotonin reuptake
inhibitor: Citalopram (n = 2), Paroxetine; tricyclic: Opi-
pramol). Comorbid mental disorders were major depres-
sion (single episode: n = 8; recurrent episode: n = 4) and
speciﬁc phobia (n = 4).

All the study participants provided written informed
consent. The study procedure was approved by the
local Ethics Committee of the Medical Faculty of the
Technische Universität Dresden, Germany
(No#
EK460230008).

Cognitive behavioural therapy and clinical measures

Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) for the patients
(not the healthy volunteers) was administered in indivi-
dual and group sessions within 5 weeks of semi-
residential care during which patients completed the
following units: psycho-education referring to anxiety and
in particular PD; explanation of
the confrontation
treatment rationale; exposure therapy including inter-
therapist-accompanied and self-
oceptive
managed confrontation with feared situations, and, at
last, cognitive therapy to modify anxiety-maintaining
beliefs. The therapy was standardised based on the man-
ual by Lang et al.49 Both the psycho-education and

exposure,

explanation of
the treatment rationale were adapted
as daily group sessions within the ﬁrst 2 weeks. All the
other units were administered as individual therapeutical
contacts. All the study therapists were experienced in
exposure therapy and cognitive behavioural techniques
and were regularly supervised by an experienced psy-
chotherapist (KP).

Information on sociodemographic variables, including
sex, age, body mass index (BMI), and smoking status, as
well as any somatic diseases and medication intake were
assessed in a routine medical examination prior to the
CBT. The participant’s physical activity was assessed non-
standardised asking (a) “Are you regularly involved in
sports (yes/no?), and (b) “How many hours per week have
you been engaged in sports in the previous 3 months?”.
The following self-report questionnaires were handed out
in the German version both at the beginning of the study
and after therapy. (1) The Panic & Agoraphobia Scale
(PAS)50 was obtained to evaluate the global severity of the
PD diagnosis. The PAS includes 13 items which belong to
ﬁve subscales (panic attacks, agoraphobia, anticipatory
anxiety, disability, and concerns about health) and must
be answered on a 4-point Likert scale. A higher PAS total
score indicates more severe panic symptoms. The PAS
holds adequate test-retest-reliability (r = 0.78) and an
internal consistency reliability of Cronbach’s α = 0.8850.
With regard to criterion validity, the PAS demonstrates
high correlations with the patient’s global impression of
impairments in quality of life (r = 0.82), as well as with
other panic-speciﬁc scales (r ≥ 0.68)50,2.
(2)The Agor-
aphobic Cognitions Questionnaire (ACQ)51 is a self-
report questionnaire assessing fearful panic beliefs and
catastrophic cognitions about panic symptoms. 15 items
must be answered on a 5-point scale anchored from
(“thought never occurs”) to 4 (“thought always occurs”).
The items are then averaged, both for the two subscales
(loss of control, physical concerns) and the total score. (3)
The Bodily Sensations Questionnaire (BSQ)51 measures
fear of bodily sensations often occurring during panic
attacks with 17 items to be answered on a 5-point Likert
scale ranging from 0 (“not frightened”) to 4 (“extremely
frightened”). The items are then averaged. (4) Agor-
aphobic avoidance behaviour was assessed using the
Mobility Inventory (MI)52. The respondent indicates for
26 situations avoidance behaviour on a 5-point scale with
response anchors ranging from 0 (“never”) to 4 (“always”)
twice, once when confronted with the situation by him/
herself and once when accompanied by another person.
The items are then averaged separately for both. The
German version of the three panic-speciﬁc questionnaires
(2) to (4) meets high internal consistency with Cronbach’s
α = 0.69 up to α = 0.87 as well as appropriate test-retest-
reliability with r ≥ 0.7453.
(5) The Beck Depression
Inventory II (BDI)54,55 was handed out to evaluate the

severity of depressiveness. This self-report rating inven-
tory is composed of 21 groups of items matching the
DSM-IV-TR major depression criteria2. Each item group
consists of a list of four statements arranged in increasing
intensity. The respondent is asked to choose the most
appropriate alternative which best describes the way he or
she felt during the previous 2 weeks. The inventory is
(Cronbach’s α ≥ 0.84) and con-
internally consistent
current to other self-report tools for depression (r = 0.72
to r = 0.89)56. Only the panic-speciﬁc questionnaires were
handed out twice and the BDI was only handed out at the
beginning of the study.

DEX–CRH test and cortisol collection

The DEX–CRH test was performed according to the
protocol published by Schreiber et al.31 and Heuser et al15.
1.5 mg Dexamethasone was administered orally at 11 pm.
All the study participants came to the hospital at 2 pm the
following day and rested in supine position with light
reading permitted. They were instructed to refrain from
eating, drinking, and smoking at least 2 h before as well as
during testing. A venous catheter for blood sample col-
lection was placed by a study nurse after an accom-
modation time of 30 min. Blood samples were taken 75
and 1 min prior to the intravenous injection of 100 µg
CRH as well as immediately, 10, 20, 30, 45 and 60 min
post-injection. Blood samples were stored at 4 °C. For the
determination of plasma cortisol concentrations, blood
was collected in serum gel monovette (Sarstedt, Nüm-
brecht, Germany) and immediately centrifuged at 4 °C and
3000 r.p.m. for 10 min. For the determination of plasma
ACTH concentrations, blood was collected into tubes
containing a mixture of trasylol and EDTA (Sarstedt,
Nümbrecht, Germany). Then, plasma was stored at −80 °
C and at −20 °C before being assayed for ACTH and
cortisol. Plasma cortisol concentrations were determined
using a commercially available radioimmunoassay kit with
the Solid Phase Antigen Linked Technique (SPALT) with
the LIAISON-Analyzer (DiaSorin, S.p.A., Italy). Plasma
ACTH was analysed using an immunoradiometric assay
(Immulite, 2500 ACTH, Germany). All hormone analyses
took place in the endocrinology laboratory of the Uni-
versity Hospital of the Technische Universität Dresden.
Due to the relatively short but intense treatment of
5 weeks with almost daily confrontation sessions, the
DEX–CRH test was only performed before the start of
the CBT.

Statistics

Group comparisons with respect to sociodemographic
and pre-therapy clinical variables were evaluated using
univariate analyses of variance (ANOVA) for continuous
variables and χ2-test for dichotomous variables. ANOVA
for
repeated measures were conducted to test
for

differences over time in the continuous clinical outcome
measures of the PAS, ACQ, BSQ, and MI. Blood ACTH
and cortisol data were subject to log transformation to
reduce skewness. For ACTH analysis, data from one PD
patient and from one healthy volunteer were excluded due
to outlying values of more than three standard deviations
above the mean. Group differences in the hormonal stress
response (both for cortisol and ACTH) were assessed
using a 2 (group: PD, healthy volunteers)×8 (time: −75,
−1, 0, 10, 20, 30, 45, and 60 min) ANCOVA for repeated
measures with baseline hormonal values (−75 min, −1
min) as covariates. To account for comorbid depression in
35.3% of the PD patients (n = 12), the BDI sum score was
added as additional covariate. Greenhouse-Geisser cor-
rections were used when necessary. Psychotherapy
response was deﬁned as at least 50% symptom reduction
from pre- to post-therapy in the described questionnaires
(except for the BDI). The DEX–CRH test non-suppression
was deﬁned as an increase of cortisol
levels of more
than 138 nmol/l compared to baseline57. Pearson’s
correlational analyses (Bonferroni-corrected with α = 5%/
7 tests = 0.7%) were conducted to quantify the associa-
tions between mean cortisol concentrations (of
the
eight
time points of blood sample collection) and
the psychotherapy outcome. For this, psychotherapy
outcome scores were deﬁned as percentage scores
of the respective pre-therapy questionnaire scores, i.e.,
negative percentage scores indicate symptom reduction
from pre- to post-therapy and positive percentage scores
indicate an increase in symptomatology, respectively. All
statistical analyses were performed using SPSS for Win-
dows, version 22 (IBM, Chicago, IL). Data in ﬁgures are
presented in original units and were plotted using Sigma
Plot 11.0 for Windows (Systat Software, Inc., Erkrath,
Germany).

Results
Sociodemographic and clinical measures

A brief description of the sociodemographic and pre-
therapy clinical characteristics of the included study par-
ticipants is provided in Table 1. Groups were well mat-
ched with regard to sociodemographic variables (p-
values ≥ 0.156). As expected, patients diagnosed with PD
with or without agoraphobia showed signiﬁcantly higher
scores in all panic-related questionnaires (p-values ≤
0.052) and in depressiveness measured with the BDI
(p ≤ .001). All the comorbid major depression diagnoses
were present in those patients diagnosed with agor-
aphobia with PD who showed descriptively higher levels
in depressiveness (mean ± SE: 13.14 ± 9.53) than those PD
patients without agoraphobia (10.00 ± 4.58; F1;31 = 0.310;
p = 0.582). According to the PAS self-report, 17.6% (n =
6) of the patients showed borderline panic and agor-
aphobic symptoms, 23.5% (n = 8) a mild, 41.2% (n = 14) a

Hormonal stress response to the DEX–CRH test

There were no signiﬁcant differences in the DEX–CRH
suppression rates between the study groups (χ² = 0.108,
df = 1, p = 1.000). 82.4% of the patients (n = 28) and
the healthy volunteers (n = 29) showed a
85.3% of
DEX–CRH suppression. Fig 1 illustrates the hormonal
stress response to the DEX–CRH test as a function of
study group. Univariate ANOVA revealed signiﬁcant
group differences in baseline cortisol levels measured 75
min prior to CRH-injection (patients: mean ± SE: 2.76 ±
0.41; healthy volunteers: 3.04 ± 0.50; p = 0.016) as well as
in baseline cortisol levels measured 1 min prior to CRH-
injection (patients: 2.78 ± 0.38; healthy volunteers: 3.00 ±
0.48; p = 0.040). No signiﬁcant group differences in
baseline ACTH levels both 75 min and 1 min prior to the
CRH-injection were seen.

Repeated measures analysis of covariance (ANCOVA),
with baseline cortisol
levels and the BDI sum score
added as additional covariates, revealed a signiﬁcant main
effect of time (F1.815;108.889 = 8.132, p ≤ 0.001, η2 = 0.119).
Neither a signiﬁcant
time x group interaction effect
(F1.815;108.889 = 0.823, p = 0.432, η2 = 0.014) nor a main
effect of group (F1;60 = 0.089, p = 0.767, η2 = 0.001) could
to ACTH concentrations,
be observed. With respect
repeated measures ANCOVA, with baseline ACTH con-
centrations and the BDI sum score added as covariates,
revealed a signiﬁcant main effect of time (F1.990;117.416 =
27.932, p ≤ 0.001, η2 = 0.321), while no time x group
interaction effect (F1.990;117.416 = 0.516, p = 0.597, η2 =
0.009) nor main effect of group (F1;59 = 0.059, p = 0.809,
η2 = 0.001) were seen.

Psychotherapy outcome

ANOVA revealed highly signiﬁcant reductions in all the
panic-related self-report measures from pre-therapy to
post-therapy with large effect sizes (η2 ≥ 0.14) ranging
0.321 ≥ η2 ≤ 0.547 (see Table 2 for details). Different
therapy responder rates were seen ranging from 29.4%
(measured with the PAS and BSQ) to 61.8% (measured
with the MI) depending on the speciﬁc questionnaire used
(see Table 1 for details). With regard to the PAS self-
report after psychotherapy, 35.3% (n = 12) of the patients
showed borderline panic and agoraphobic symptoms,
26.5% (n = 9) a mild, 29.4% (n = 10) a moderate, and 5.9%
(n = 2) a serious disease severity.

The Pearson’s correlational analysis showed signiﬁcant
associations between mean cortisol concentrations and
the ACQ loss of control outcome score (r = 0.489, p =
0.005; see Fig. 2). No signiﬁcant associations were seen
between mean cortisol concentrations and the PAS, ACQ
physical concerns and total score, BSQ, and MI outcome
scores (p ≥ 0.028).

Discussion

We performed an intervention study of 5-week CBT in
patients diagnosed either with agoraphobia with PD or PD
without agoraphobia and exposure to the DEX–CRH test
in both the patient and healthy control group. We pre-
dicted cortisol non-suppression in the patient group on
the basis of our literature review. Concerning psy-
chotherapy outcome, we analysed whether we would be
able to replicate the inverse associations between the
cortisol stress response and post-therapy disease severity

which we had previously observed in a sample of PD
patients confronted with the TSST.

therefore the least

CBT showed large effect sizes with signiﬁcant reduc-
tions in all cardinal symptom clusters of PD (panic beliefs
and agoraphobic cognitions, fear of bodily sensations,
agoraphobic avoidance behaviour). Concurrently,
the
number of patients who reported a moderate or serious
disease severity decreased (from 41.2 to 29.4% observed
for moderate and from 17.6 to 5.9% for severe severity of
illness), while the number of patients reporting borderline
or mild severity increased, respectively (from 17.6 to
35.3% observed for borderline and from 23.5 to 26.5% for
mild severity). Regarding psychotherapy success, those
patients with higher cortisol concentrations upon CRH-
injection showed percental increases in disease severity
improvement by psy-
after CBT,
chotherapy. We thus conﬁrm former ﬁndings of an
inverse correlation between cortisol concentrations and
therapy success12,13. It seems that those patients who
show less
show inadequate
improvement from psychotherapy. With regard to the
TSST, an adequate and “normative” response pattern
refers to a cortisol release of at least 2- to 4-fold elevations
above baseline levels, as has been reliably reported for
healthy individuals58,59. Patients of our previous trial who
did not show a TSST stress response, thus displaying low
cortisol concentrations upon psychosocial provocation,
show concurrently a higher severity of disease and less
improvement after therapy13. Siegmund et al.12 exposed
the patients to situations feared individually and observed
that patients who showed less cortisol concentrations
during exposure had a worse therapy outcome. Results

suggest that patients diagnosed with PD with or without
agoraphobia fail to activate cortisol release when neces-
sary. Adequate responding to the DEX–CRH test
is
indexed via cortisol suppression15. In the present sample,
and that of Coryell et al.30, patients who showed adequate
cortisol suppression showed concurrently higher therapy
success than indexed in lower levels of disease severity.
Speciﬁcally, in the present sample, the inverse correlation
between cortisol
levels and therapy outcome was pre-
eminent in the loss of control scale of agoraphobic cog-
nitions. Losing control/going crazy is a prominent feature
in PD and results suggest that its activation during the
therapy process holds a key role in psychotherapy success.
This implication combines well with established recom-
mendations for CBT for PD patients recommending a
high level of fear49. The DEX–CRH test is an interoceptive
hormonal stressor that PD patients might have experi-
enced as an “interoceptive challenge” triggering panic-
speciﬁc fears of a physical catastrophe and of
losing
control. PD patients usually show a heightened level of
fear of interoceptive sensations resembling panic60 and
report fear of medication intake due to possible side
effects, for instance. The DEX–CRH test requires the oral
intake of dexamethasone as well as CRH-injections. One
might suggest that anticipatory fear of uncomfortable
bodily sensations may be responsible for psychophysio-
logical arousal and thus heightened baseline cortisol
levels. However, this study didn’t include an anxiety rating
to evaluate any discomfort in facing the DEX–CRH test,
and we actually observed substantial lower baseline cor-
tisol levels in PD patients. Furthermore, contrary to our
expectations, most of
the patients with and without
agoraphobia did not show the expected non-suppression
pattern, instead showing adequate cortisol stress respon-
ses comparable to the stress response pattern seen in the
healthy volunteers. Though we included various stress-
related variables in the sample characterisation, the dif-
ferences mentioned in baseline cortisol levels may have
resulted from a variable that we not assessed, e.g., over-
protective parental behaviour61. Most of the study parti-
cipants (>80% in both groups) demonstrated DEX–CRH
suppression. This ﬁnding of DEX–CRH suppression
concurs with previous studies who also failed to show an
impact of the PD diagnosis on DEX–CRH suppression
rates36–38. However,
it conﬂicts, ﬁrst, with reports of
DEX–CRH non-suppression in PD patients28–33,62 and,
secondly, with reports of
lower post-
DEX–CRH cortisol levels in PD patients as compared to
healthy volunteers22,34. Lower basal cortisol levels might
have resulted from the habituation of cortisol releases
from a chronically activated HPA axis. Some authors
suggested that the alterations in the HPA axis that have
been observed in some studies in contrast to the con-
sistent hypo-responsive pattern might have resulted from

substantial

anticipatory fear, not from spontaneous occurring panic
attacks32,63. This mechanism could explain the relatively
consistent pattern of a cortisol non-responsiveness upon
provocation in PD patients12,13,25,64,65.

Previous psychotherapy research has primarily put an
emphasis on psychological or disorder-related variables to
predict the therapy success in PD patients (e.g., refs. 8,9,)
resulting in no consistent associations. Implications of
these study results may tentatively include the prediction
of the therapy success from a potential endocrinological
correlate whose persistency of inadequate cortisol sup-
pression during treatment may predict response or non-
response to the current treatment. However, this sug-
gestion remains rather speculative. Future studies could
include a second DEX–CRH test as well as a further rating
of the disease severity to test if an improvement in HPA
axis functioning (adequate cortisol suppression) was
associated with a better treatment response. Further, if the
improvement in HPA axis functioning precedes clinical
improvement, this correlate may be used in addition to
clinical and self-evaluation of the disease severity as a
decision support. Such a study design could test the
hypothesis if patients who don’t show improvement in the
DEX–CRH-test were not likely to respond to the current
treatment and probably require a change of the treatment
strategy to avoid leaving patients under an inefﬁcient
treatment.

The limitations of this study refer to characteristics in
the patient sample. First, our ﬁndings with respect to the
association of
the cortisol stress response and psy-
chotherapy outcome may not extend to patients with a
“pure” PD diagnosis or patients with other comorbid
mental disorders. Second, this study was conducted with a
relatively small sample size making it harder to detect
signiﬁcant differences. Finally, we did not
include a
follow-up assessment to explore whether the cortisol
stress response is also predictive of
long-term psy-
chotherapy response. In conclusion, despite the named
limitations, PD patients with and without agoraphobia
demonstrated “normative” cortisol stress responses to the
DEX–CRH test compared to healthy volunteers. An
association between the cortisol stress response and psy-
chotherapy outcome could be shown signiﬁcantly for
agoraphobic cognitions. Speciﬁcally, those patients who
showed inadequate cortisol suppression demonstrated
less improvement after CBT, especially concerning the
fear of losing control. Implications for future studies are
the recruitment of larger sample sizes and the imple-
mentation of
follow-up
assessment.
