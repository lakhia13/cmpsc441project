Abstract: Experiencing a traumatic situation such as breast cancer can, beside negative consequences,
have a positive impact, described as post-traumatic growth (PTG). A factor that facilitates psycholog-
ical recovery when coping with stressful events is psychological resilience. The aim of the present
study was to assess whether PTG occurs in a group of women with breast cancer and whether
resilience is a personal trait contributing to its occurrence. The study group comprised 100 women
with breast cancer, aged 31–80 years, almost half of whom were aged 61–70 years (n = 46, 46%).
The Post-Traumatic Growth Inventory, the Impact of Event Scale, and the Resilience Assessment
Questionnaire (KOP) were used for the study. All women manifested PTG, with a mean intensity of
76.61 ± 13.45 points. The greatest changes were observed in the subjects’ appreciation of life, and
the smallest in their relations with others, self-perception, and spiritual changes. The KOP scale
measured a mean resilience of 103.80 ± 16.57. The results obtained conﬁrm the co-occurrence of
psychological resilience and PTG, especially personal resilience and social competences. Additionally,
women subjected to additional traumatic events other than cancer manifested a higher level of PTG.

1. Introduction

Cancer is a genetic disease caused by a DNA mutation. Epidemiological data show
that cancer is the second most common cause of death in Poland [1]. Worldwide, 1.7 million
women develop cancer each year, and in 2018 the mortality rate was 678 thousand [2].

Rehabilitation involving physical exercises and psychological help is an important
element of cancer treatment. The goal of psycho-physical rehabilitation is to reduce the
effects of physical treatment (e.g., lymphoedema, the swelling of the upper limb on the
operated side) and also to mitigate the negative psychological effects, for example, social
and occupational maladjustment, family issues, and the fear of mutilation, suffering, or
death [3]. Psychological therapy also aims to reduce stress and restore a patient’s emotional
state to the time before the disease. Promoting positive emotions and reinforcing the
strengths create opportunities for patients to improve the quality of their lives [4].

Cancer treatment is a long-lasting and exhausting experience, both for the body and
mind of the patient. Breast amputation in particular may be a traumatic experience, often
leading to a loss of self-worth. Proper medication, including chemotherapy, causes hair
loss and a general worsening of one’s appearance. Therapeutic success is hugely affected
by support from family, friends, psychologists, and psychiatrists. Many women with
breast cancer seek support from organisations uniting women with various breast cancers.
Throughout Poland, over 70 such associations, known as “Amazons Clubs”, aim to educate,
run social campaigns, and lend ongoing support to people struggling with cancer [5].

Cancer is a traumatic experience for the patient, affecting their functioning in many
respects. Trauma is deﬁned as a psychological injury brought about by strong emotional
stimuli. The concepts of trauma and stress are related, but clinical psychology makes a
clear distinction between trauma and a stressful situation. Stressful events are those a
person can cope with. In the case of trauma, coping with adversity is very difﬁcult or
impossible. Currently, the World Health Organization deﬁnes traumatic events as exposure
to a severely threatening or catastrophic short- or long-term stressor. When describing
trauma, emphasis is placed on the affected person’s self-appraisal [6].

In some people, traumatic situations can bring about not only negative consequences
but also positive changes, described as post-traumatic growth (PTG) [7]. The occurrence
of trauma does not automatically lead to growth; it is a process that involves a strategy in
dealing with a dramatic experience. The sense of personal happiness, for example, having
overcome an illness, cannot be identiﬁed as PTG. Research has shown that PTG occurred in
30–90% of those who had been through traumatic situations [8].

The term “post-traumatic growth” was ﬁrst used in 1996 by Tedeschi and Calhoun [9].
They deﬁned post-traumatic growth as “positive change that the individual experiences as
a result of the struggle with a traumatic event” [10]. Later, they further speciﬁed that PTG
was “a struggle with the new reality in the aftermath of trauma that is crucial in determining
the extent to which post-traumatic growth occurs”. Positive changes include better self-
perception, improved interpersonal relationships, and a change in life philosophy [11]. This
may manifest as greater resistance to stress, taking up various life challenges, and greater
appreciation of life and loved ones, as well as changes in religious spheres [9]. Regarding
the conceptual model of post-traumatic growth, it has been deﬁned as an innate biological
mechanism whose role is to protect the person against the effects of stress [12].

Trauma can be treated as a basis for personal growth. Nonetheless, its occurrence does
not determine that the negative effects of cancer will be experienced as, for example, PTSD.
People affected by PTG can manifest distress and low well-being [13].

Good social relations, marriage and good family relationships, younger age, and
a shorter diagnosis time in the case of cancer all favour growth [13]. Authors point to
the positive inﬂuence of religious beliefs on PTG, viewing increased coping with stress,
forgiveness, and sense of belonging as positive factors [14].

It has been found that PTG in oncological patients was greatly affected by traits such
as the ability to adapt to a difﬁcult situation, good mental and physical health, slight
symptoms of distress and post-traumatic stress, and rigid discipline during treatment [4].
Scientiﬁc research has demonstrated that, in the case of breast cancer, PTG is inﬂuenced
by factors such as awareness of the invasive impact of the disease on the body, relapse
concerns, perception of cancer as a life-threatening disease, and the intensity of the anti-
cancer therapy. It follows that in women who have survived breast cancer, PTG is closely
linked to coping based on emotions, support of others, problem coping, and adaptation to
new life circumstances [15].

One dimension that can determine a person’s adaptive capabilities when faced with
a traumatic situation, and subsequently affect PTG, is resilience. The word “resilience”
comes from the Latin ”salire’ and means ”spring, spring up”. “Resilire”, therefore, means
”spring back”, or go back to the original state. Resilience is understood as psychological
endurance, which can be interpreted as a personality trait manifesting as the ability to cope
in a particular situation, a process, or its result [16].

Broadly speaking, resilience is a trait that enables a person to function optimally
despite failures. It is an ability to stay away from negative experiences; it is a type of
positive adaptation associated with trauma [17]. Experts underscore the signiﬁcance of
developing resilience during a lifetime and point to the importance of positive social factors
in this process. This competence is essential in overcoming difﬁculties in life, stress, or
traumas [18].

The aim of the present study is to establish the level of PTG within a group of cancer
patients, as well as the relationship between PTG and sociodemographic variables such

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 6509

as age, time from diagnosis, relationship status, survival of additional traumatic events,
and resilience. The results obtained in the study should be of help to psychologists and
doctors, as well as others who want to support women struggling with cancer, such as
family members.

To date, research on PTG has not focused on patients associated with Amazon Clubs
in Poland. Due to cultural differences, it seemed reasonable to recruit Polish women with
breast cancer for this research.

2. Materials and Methods

This study is a cross-sectional study and is based on a questionnaire. We surveyed
100 Amazon Club members throughout Poland, all of whom had breast cancer in the past.
When starting the study, the maximum number of participants was not speciﬁed. An
electronic version of the questionnaire was made available and 150 paper-based research
questionnaires were sent to Amazon Clubs all over Poland. Not all questionnaires were
completed despite participants’ prior declarations of intent. Some of the questionnaires
were ﬁlled in incorrectly and had to be rejected. In total, we received 115 questionnaires,
100 of which were completed correctly. Consent was obtained from the Bioethical Commis-
sion (KE-0254/165/2021) to conduct the research. The respondents were informed about
their anonymous status and the purpose of the survey.

The following tools were used:
Post-Traumatic Growth Inventory (PTGI) This tool was authored by Tedeschi and
Calhoun, adapted for the Polish context by Ogi ´nska-Bulik and Juczy ´nski. It consists of
21 statements concerning positive changes resulting from a negative life event. Each
surveyed person responds to the statements by choosing what they perceive to be the
most appropriate answer, from “I did not experience this change” (0 pts) to “I experienced this
change to a very great degree” (5 pts). Choosing a higher score testiﬁes to a greater intensity of
the positive change. The inventory comprises four subscales: (1) Changes in self-perception,
(2) changes in relating with others, (3) greater appreciation of life, and (4) spiritual change [8].
Impact of Event Scale—Revised This tool was developed by Weiss and Marmur, and
adapted by Juczy ´nski and Ogi ´nska-Bulik. The 22 statements measure post-traumatic stress
disorder (PTSD), with each statement relating to a speciﬁc symptom. Respondents mark
their answers on a 5-point scale (from 0 to 4). The total score enables a screening assessment
of post-traumatic stress. The scale also makes it possible to assess the chief symptoms of
PTSD: (1) Intrusion, (2) arousal, and (3) avoidance [19].

KOP-26 This tool was developed by G ˛asior, Chodkiewicz, and Cechowski. It examines
resilience, deﬁned as personal, family, and social competences, allowing people to better
cope with traumatic events, stress, and life problems. It comprises 26 statements, assessed
on a 5-point scale. The personal competences examined are related to the ability to pursue
targeted and responsible action, as well as to maintain the sense of the meaning of one’s
life. Family competences are regarded as mutual understanding, a sense of support from
loved ones, and friendly family atmosphere. Social competences are related to the ability to
ﬁnd oneself in a new situation, and openness to being helped by others [20].

3. Results
3.1. Characteristics of the Study Group

In the study group (n = 100), almost half of the respondents were women aged
61–70 years (n = 46, 46%), and the large majority lived in a town (n = 91, 91%). The ma-
jority of respondents had lived with the diagnosis for over 10 years (n = 60, 60%), putting
patients who had lived with their diagnosis for 5–10 years (n = 18, 18%) and less than 5 years
(n = 22, 22%) in the minority. Almost half of respondents were college educated
(n = 49, 49%), and three-ﬁfths of the respondents were married (n = 60, 60%). Approximately
one-third of respondents (n = 35, 35%) reported traumatic events other than cancer, and
three-quarters of the surveyed presented symptoms suggestive of PTSD. See Table 1 for a
study group description.

3.2. Results

The mean level of PTG measured using the PTGI in the study group was 76.61 ± 13.45
points. The respondents were the most likely to perceive changes in their appreciation of
life (4.00 ± 0.86 pts), but less likely to perceive changes in their appreciation of relating
with others (3.73), self-perception (3.60 ± 0.73), and spiritual change (2.95 ± 1.33). The
mean PTSD level assessed using the IES-R was 49.57 ± 16.08 points. The strongest PTSD
symptoms were intrusion (2.33 ± 0.85) and arousal (2.22 ± 0.79); avoidance was weaker
(2.19 ± 0.72). The mean resilience assessed using the KOP scale was 103.80 ± 16.57. The
descriptive statistics of the quantitative variables are presented in Table 2.

A correlation was found between PTG and resilience (r = 0.54, p < 0.05), especially
in two resilience subscales: personal resilience (r = 0.54, p < 0.05), and social competences
(r = 0.45, p < 0.05). A weaker correlation occurred between post-traumatic growth and
family competences (r = 0.38, p < 0.05), arousal (r = 0.31, p < 0.05), and overall severity
of post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS; r = 0.30, p < 0.05). The correlation matrix is
presented in Table 3.

No statistically signiﬁcant differences in PTG and its components were found in
women of different ages (see Table 4), in women with illnesses of different durations (see
Table 5), or in married and unmarried women (see Table 6).

Women who stated living with cancer was their only experience of a traumatic event
presented a lower PTG level as compared with women who had experienced many trau-
matic events (74.46 ± 13.30 and 80.60 ± 12.98, respectively, Z = 2.38, p < 0.05). Women
who had experienced only one traumatic event (cancer) also manifested lower changes
in self-perception and relating with others as compared with those who had experienced
multiple traumatic events (see Table 7).

4. Discussion
4.1. The Level of Post-Traumatic Growth

Our aim was to demonstrate a relationship between PTG and factors such as spiritual-

ity, appreciation of life, self-perception, and relating with others.

Psychological theory identiﬁes PTSD and PTG as separate phenomena, related to each
other in complex ways. In this relationship, stress and suffering are a catalyst triggering
growth. The causes of PTG are rooted in changes in fundamental beliefs about oneself
and the surrounding world, which arise when an individual is confronted with extreme
events [21]. Research, to date, indicates that the trauma associated with the diagnosis,
treatment, and overcoming of breast cancer leads to PTG in some patients. A direct con-
frontation with death activates stress and triggers mechanisms generating PTG. Suffering is
transformed into a value that is beneﬁcial to the sufferer. Based on the available research on
PTG in persons who have grappled with cancer, we can conclude that PTG is the prevailing
tendency among respondents [22].

The present PTGI-based study demonstrates a mean growth of PTG by 76.61 ± 13.45
points, which seems to corroborate the present theoretical model of PTG in an oncological
disease. This result shows that traumatic events related to breast cancer prompt growth
in patients. It is adaptive and results from cognitive processing of traumatic events. A
systematic review of 47 papers has shown that breast cancer patients who have undergone
chemotherapy or radiotherapy manifest growth which is positively correlated with appre-
ciation of life following dramatic experiences, changes in self-perception, and relating with
others [23]. The data we collected suggest that women with breast cancer noticed positive
changes in their appreciation of life (4.00 ± 0.86 points). Slightly lower growth occurred in
relating with others (3.73) and self-perception (3.60 ± 0.73).

Researchers in China split a group of 612 women who previously had breast cancer into
three groups based on the relationship between PTG incidence and the intensity of PTSS.
Three types of patterns were isolated: a growth group (mild PTSS, high PTG) accounting for
47.4%, a resilient group (mild PTSS, mild PTG) at 34.6%, and a struggling group (high PTSS,
high PTG) constituting 18%. No group was identiﬁed among the Chinese respondents that
manifested severe PTSS and no growth, which was consistent with studies conducted in
other cultures. It was also noted that various kinds of traumatic events generated different
levels of PTG [23].

4.2. Relationship of PTG with Sociodemographic Variables

It can be concluded that mechanisms of PTG formation depend not only on individual
predisposition, but also on general social and cultural conditions. Cross-sectional analyses
conducted in recent years to examine the relationship between suffering and growth in
women with breast cancer have indicated that the occurrence of PTG was accompanied
by stress alleviation and improvement in the psychological condition of the respondents.
Conversely, women with low PTG manifested increased depressive symptoms and lower
mood. A 2017 study conducted using the PTGI conﬁrmed that much lower PTG was
evident in depressed women, particularly in areas such as life evaluation and seeing new
opportunities [24].

Research was conducted in Iran on a group of 210 women with diagnosed breast
cancer and showed that the satisfaction of basic needs was positively related to PTG. It was
assumed that individuals have a better chance of coping with a traumatic situation such as
an oncological illness if their basic needs, such as autonomy, competence, or family ties,
have been met. They treat such a tough experience as a confrontation with reality and they
have a sense of control over events [25].

Similar research has been conducted, in 2019 in Croatia, that demonstrated a positive
link between PTG and sense in life, seeking the meaning of life and life satisfaction. The
sample consisted of 149 patients who had recovered from cancers, afﬁliated with an
oncological organisation. The respondents manifested a mild degree of PTS and positive
changes (M = 3.33, SD = 1.15; total PTG = 62.68, SD = 22.68). PTG was at least at a

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 6509

8 of 13

medium level in 72.5% of the participants. Interestingly, the analysis also showed that
PTG was dependent on cancer location. Breast cancer survivors manifested higher PTG
than those who had recovered from mouth, throat, or larynx cancer [26]. A longitudinal
study conducted over 8 months from diagnosing ﬁrst-to-third-degree breast cancer in
653 female patients at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and the University of
Texas Southwestern Center for Breast Care conﬁrmed that PTG developed over time, and
that most patients observed the changes within the ﬁrst year of the diagnosis. In this study,
higher PTG was positively linked to education, longer time elapsed since diagnosis, higher
initial level of cancer intrusion, and the growth of social support [27].

Over time, cancer survivors experience growth in such areas as approach to life and
relating with others [28]. A review of 10 studies led to the conclusion that 5 years after
the initial cancer diagnosis, the majority of patients assess the quality of their life as high,
especially with respect to relations with others, personal strength, spiritual change, and
appreciation of life. Additionally, one analysis showed that 10 years after recovery patients
enjoyed greater satisfaction with life and better personal relations as compared with the
control group [23].

The above-cited examples from the literature indicate that PTG researchers have tried
to explain the phenomenon using various contexts, considering such factors as culture,
type of cancer, duration, depressive symptoms, impact of active coping, and catering for
one’s own needs. Overall, it can be concluded that PTG is strongly positively linked to the
occurrence of traumatic experiences, in particular, oncological breast disease. Our study
corroborates the results to date. For example, it emerged that our respondents perceived the
greatest changes in terms of appreciation of life, with lesser changes in their appreciation of
relating with others, self-perception, and spiritual change.

Psychological theory interprets spirituality as an aptitude for spiritual experiences
manifested in the transcendent sphere and moral sensitivity, as well as coping in ultimate
situations. These are personal resources that can be used to deal adaptively with problems,
especially difﬁcult and traumatic problems [29]. It was assumed that a traumatic experience
associated with breast cancer leads to deeper changes in the spiritual sphere. Current
studies have shown that spirituality was positively correlated with PTG in breast cancer
survivors. A systematic review of 47 papers demonstrated that 75% of breast cancer
patients manifested PTS symptoms and PTG, the latter interpreted as an increase in personal
strength, relationships, and appreciation of life [23]. The results presented in 23 publications
from 2002 to 2016 conﬁrmed the positive impact of spiritual growth on PTG in cancer-
diagnosed and treated patients [28]. Psychologically, spirituality can be viewed from
two perspectives. It can be understood as religiousness or something distinct from religion.
Spirituality is deﬁned in the literature as potential adaptive resources which an individual
utilises in the face of tragic events. Their role is to help a person to cope with adversity, to
protect them from the destructive inﬂuence of events, and as a result, to initiate PTG [30].
Studies conducted in the USA using the Eastern Oncology Group database intended
to verify the following hypotheses: (1) Spirituality will be negatively linked to emotional
distress in patients, (2) spirituality will have a positive inﬂuence on PTG, and (3) the
spirituality of the patients and their partners affects each other. The results conﬁrmed the
ﬁrst two assumptions. However, the partner’s spirituality had no bearing on PTG [28].

In an analysis carried out in 2019 in Croatia, it was established that respondents with
PTG (72.5% of the participants experienced moderate positive changes) reported very slight
changes in the spiritual sphere [26].

Various studies have conﬁrmed that women with breast cancer experience PTG in
the realm of personal relations, spirituality, and appreciation of life. The increased man-
ifestation of these values in the process of adapting oneself to illness can counteract the
negative consequences of disease [25]. The women afﬁliated with Polish Amazon Clubs
whom we interviewed manifested spiritual changes at a rather low level (2.95 ± 1.33). A
lack of signiﬁcant growth in the spiritual sphere could have been due, for example, to high
functioning of respondents before their illness, which was difﬁcult to assess in the present

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 6509

study. They were not asked how they assessed their spiritual growth; they were only asked
about the fact of growth after the cancer experience. Furthermore, the scope of analysis
was limited to individuals belonging to the helping association, which may have affected
the study results. The breast cancer survivors received social support, and they were not
in urgent need of seeking spiritual growth. Further research should explore differences
in various approaches to this issue, comparing them with results obtained from studies
involving non-members of Amazon Clubs.

American investigators have found that high PTG accompanied younger non-white
women who underwent chemotherapy. While going through greater difﬁculties related to
the course of their illness, they experienced depressive states and manifested active coping,
unlike patients with lower PTG. Older women manifested lower PTG. Similarly, a lower
level of depressive symptoms and active, adaptive coping was noted; the diagnosis was
not as disruptive to them as the younger group [31]. Most studies have not conﬁrmed the
impact of age, marital status, or income on PTG [32], although there are also studies that
have demonstrated a positive relationship between older age and PTG. It was noticed in
victims of sexual assault and those with an acquired brain trauma [33,34]. In a group of
breast cancer patients in Slovenia, age did not increase differences in PTG values [35].

4.3. Relationship of PTG with Resilience

Resilience and PTG should be viewed as two distinct concepts; however, despite the
differences, they are closely interlinked. The present research seems to conﬁrm this by
establishing the co-occurrence of PTG and resilience (r = 0.54, p < 0.05). This suggests there
is a possibility of optimising breast cancer care through activities intended to strengthen
resilience. In this way, the negative impact of physical, psychological, and social changes
occurring during treatment can be mitigated, and health-promoting behaviours can be
developed. Our results were consistent with the conclusions of other studies, which
havee suggested that resilience increased the likelihood of PTG in both HIV-positive
individuals [36] and women with infertility [37].

An earlier study of women with cancer showed that the trauma of breast cancer
contributed to positive changes in their lives. Resilience signiﬁcantly correlated with the
majority of PTG factors. Highly resilient women showed more positive changes, especially
in their self-perception and appreciation of life. However, no correlation was observed
between the level of resilience and changes in relating with other people or in the spiritual
sphere. The study involved only women residing in Lodz Voivodeship, who underwent
mastectomy during their treatment. The present study also demonstrates the co-occurrence
of PTG and resilience, mainly in terms of personal resilience, which aligns with earlier
conclusions. Further, changes in social competences were also noticed, unlike in the
analysis mentioned above. This difference may be due to the more diverse study group. For
example, women whose treatment plan did not include breast removal were not excluded
from our survey, and the respondents were from various regions of Poland [9].

A systematic review of 39 studies established that resilience was related to clinical,
sociodemographic, social, and psychological variables, with the latter having the greatest
signiﬁcance, and that psychological stress was most commonly associated with reduced
resilience. The majority of the studies relied on various forms of the Connor–Davidson
Resilience Scale (CD-RISC) (n = 20) [38].

In a China-based cross-sectional study involving 260 women with breast cancer, it
was observed that resilience was signiﬁcantly correlated with anxiety, depression, and
PTG. All participants underwent chemotherapy. However, one exclusion criterion was a
recent experience of another severe traumatic event, existing mental disease, or a serious
concurrent illness. To obtain data, the study utilised the PTGI, the Hospital Anxiety and
Depression Scale (HADS, a Chinese hospital scale revised in line with scales used abroad),
and the CD-RISC scale. Fear and depression both correlated negatively with resilience and
PTG, but there was a signiﬁcant positive correlation between resilience and PTG. It was
shown that resilience had a direct positive inﬂuence on PTG, Additionally, it mitigated

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 6509

anxiety and depression during chemotherapy. This suggests the need for psychological
rehabilitation available in oncological wards, as this should promote PTG [39].

There are also studies that havee not conﬁrmd positive correlations between PTG
and resilience. Such observations were made in Israel and Lebanon, where the PTG result
obtained in highly resilient people was rather low. These ﬁndings may be due to the fact
that people with high levels of resilience are less likely to experience psychiatric disorders
including PTSD [40].

In the present study, no statistically signiﬁcant differences in PTG (nor its components)
were found in our respondents. Here, we surveyed women aged 31 and older, which was
dictated by the nature of the disease. In the case of other cancers typical of other age groups,
the results could be different. We do not know the reaction of very young women to cancer,
and this, surely, would be very difﬁcult to ascertain. It is possible that we would have
obtained better scores for older persons if we had surveyed a different traumatic event.
This may encourage comparative studies in this respect.

Resilience was been shown to play a mediating role between a coping strategy in a
difﬁcult situation and the quality of relating with others. The higher the level of the partners’
planning in a difﬁcult situation, the higher the level of their resilience, thus, increasing their
commitment to the relationship [41]. As such, resilience has a positive effect on the creation
and maintenance of satisfying social bonds [41]. In light of the above, it was assumed that
it would be possible to observe different levels of PTG in married and unmarried women.
However, no statistically signiﬁcant differences were found in this area (p > 0.05). Future
research in this area would have to include those in informal relationships as well, which
would make it possible to determine the overall impact of the romantic relationship and
partner support on the ability to cope with traumatic events and PTG.

Research carried out in the USA using the PTGI within the ﬁrst two years of a breast
cancer diagnosis has indicated that women experiencing moderate to high growth had
previously had high levels of intrusive thoughts about the problem or they suffered depres-
sive symptoms. In contrast, those with low PTG were less depressed and not affected by
high invasiveness of their illness. The results also suggest that a high level of active and
adaptive coping favours high PTG [35].

Our study showed that women with additional traumatic experiences had higher PTG
(74.46 ± 13.30) than those facing breast cancer alone (80.60 ± 12.98). Thirty-ﬁve out of
100 respondents mentioned various other personal tragedies, typically one or two events.
The assumption that additional problems decrease growth was not conﬁrmed; the reason
for this was not discovered. It may be due to the fact that all respondents received support
in Amazon Clubs. There have been no similar studies conducted among persons not
afﬁliated with such an organisation. A more detailed study could determine to what degree
the accumulation of dramatic experiences causes growth and when it leads to decreased
growth. The present results clearly show that patients with one traumatic experience
(breast cancer) manifested lower positive changes in self-perception and relations with
others as compared with patients struggling with additional traumatic events. Changes in
appreciation of life and spirituality were not statistically signiﬁcant.

5. Conclusions

Our research has demonstrated that the trauma presented by breast cancer is conducive
to positive changes in the life of the patients. These changes are noticeable mainly in
appreciation of life, relations with others, and self-perception, and less in the spiritual
sphere. This implies that such women become more aware, self-conﬁdent, and more
committed to their loved ones. Despite such beneﬁts, the results we obtained also indicated
the co-occurrence of negative effects. Three quarters of the interviewed women presented
symptoms indicative of PTSD, related mainly to intrusion, arousal, and avoidance. This
may suggest that persistent thoughts of the trauma encourage its processing, resulting in a
greater likelihood of developing PTG. Due to such experiences, women should better cope
with other stressful situations in the future.

Roughly, one-third of respondents (35%) reported the presence of traumatic events
other than cancer. It was in this group that higher PTG was observed relative to those
for whom breast cancer was the only trauma at the time. In addition, the proportion of
respondents who were exposed to more stressful events manifested higher levels of changes
in self-perception and changes in relationships.

The results described here conﬁrm the co-occurrence of post-traumatic development
and resilience, especially personal resilience and social competence. The ability to beneﬁt
from trauma is a sign of good adaptation and mental health, thus, preventing various
mental dysfunctions and protecting people against some negative effects such as PTSD.

The level of the observed PTG was affected neither by age nor marital status. The
present study, however, cannot unambiguously rule out such a relationship due to the
relatively low diversity of the respondent group. Almost half of the respondents (46%)
were women aged 61–70 years, and most of them (60%) were married at the time of the
survey. In order to analyse this relationship more reliably, it would be necessary to reach
out to more people below the age of 40, as this age group was a distinct minority (15%).

This study, due to a small number of respondents and its cross-sectional character, did
not allow the direction of the correlation to be unambiguously determined. Nonetheless, it
points to the need for further research in this area.
