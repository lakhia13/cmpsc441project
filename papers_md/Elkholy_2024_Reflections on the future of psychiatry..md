The new Deputy Editor of BJPsych
International introduces articles in the current
issue on topics as diverse as metacommunity
psychiatry, child and adolescent mental health
services in Australia and the Philippines, the
mental health of the UK’s Gypsy, Roma and
Traveller populations, Indigenous mental
health professionals in Bangladesh, and the
relationship between spirituality and
behavioural addictions.

Psychiatric Association

As the new Deputy Editor of BJPsych International,
it was a pleasure to read through the articles
in this issue. In doing so, I realised it has been
7 years since publication of The Lancet Psychiatry
and World
(WPA)
Commission’s report on the future of psychiatry.
The report addresses
the opportunities and
challenges that face psychiatry, covering areas
including
treatments,
services, healthcare systems, mental health law,
digital psychiatry and the training of

Evolving services and systems
Focusing on services and healthcare systems,
there is no doubt that psychiatry is one of the fast-
est evolving and adapting medical specialties. The
impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is a good
example of how practice, training and teaching
evolved to meet individual and societal needs.
Another example is the move from institutional-
isation to community psychiatry. In this issue of
BJPsych International, an interesting and thought-
provoking article titled ‘Metacommunity: the cur-
rent status of psychiatry and mental healthcare
and implications for the future’ discusses the his-
tory and origins of community psychiatry and
challenges facing it.3

While still on the topic of services, it is crucial to
stop and reﬂect on the status and needs of current
systems. I invite you to read two articles in this
issue shedding light on child and adolescent men-
tal health systems in Australia and Philippines.
Both articles provide insight on their respective
mental health services and challenges they face.4,5

considering varying needs in diverse populations.
This includes advocacy for the rights of people liv-
ing with mental illness and against discrimination,
working with people with lived experience,
families, carers and communities. In this domain,
this issue has two interesting articles. The ﬁrst
addresses the situation of Gypsy, Roma and
Traveller (GRT) populations in the UK. The
authors argue the need for a culturally informed
approach to develop services accessible to GRT
communities, who have considerably worse men-
tal health outcomes than the general population.6
the situation
from a different angle: the practitioners. The
authors discuss
the need for having more
Indigenous mental health practitioners. They
argue that Indigenous people are less likely to
seek healthcare, owing to the insufﬁcient number
of healthcare professionals representing their
communities. Focusing on Bangladesh,
they
hope that increasing representation among men-
tal health professionals will ensure that mental
health services in Bangladesh are inclusive and
embracing the country’s diversity.7

The second article looks at

Spirituality and of behavioural addictions
The past few years have seen an increased interest
in behavioural addiction. The inclusion of gaming
disorder in classiﬁcatory systems has brought
more attention to the topic and the variety of
behaviours that can be considered problematic.
Kanabar et al8 discuss in their narrative review
the complex relationship between spirituality
and different
forms of behavioural addiction.
The authors concluded with the potential value
of understanding this relationship in enhancing
the care provided, and the need for more robust
research on the topic.
