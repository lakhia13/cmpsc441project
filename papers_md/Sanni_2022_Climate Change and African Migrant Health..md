Abstract: Introduction: Climate change exacerbates existing sociopolitical and economic vulnera-
bilities, undermining livelihoods, inﬂating the risk of conﬂict, and making it difﬁcult for people to
remain stable. In 2019, around 25 million new displacements occurred due to natural disasters. This
review aims to summarize the existing evidence regarding the impact of climate change on the health
of African immigrants. Methods: Nine databases were systematically searched using a strategy
developed in collaboration with a subject librarian. Potentially relevant articles were identiﬁed,
screened, and reviewed by at least two reviewers, with a third reviewer resolving conﬂicts where
necessary. Data were extracted from relevant articles using a standardized form. Results: Seven
studies (three cross-sectional, two qualitative, one cohort, and one need assessment report) were
identiﬁed; they included different categories of African migrants and reported on various aspects
of health. The included articles report on climate change, e.g., ﬂooding, drought, and excess heat,
resulting in respiratory illness, mental health issues, malnutrition, and premature mortality among
African immigrants. Conclusion: This review suggests climate change adversely affects the physical,
mental, and social health of African immigrants. It also highlights a knowledge gap in evidence
related to the impact of climate change on the health of African immigrants.

1. Introduction

The United Nations identiﬁes climate change as one of the most signiﬁcant crises of
our time. Climate change acts as a threat multiplier, exacerbating existing sociopolitical
and economic vulnerabilities, undermining livelihoods, inﬂating the risk of conﬂict, and
making it difﬁcult for people to remain stable. In 2019, approximately 50.8 million people
were internally displaced across the globe, costing more than USD 4 billion a year in Africa
alone [1]. In that same year, ~2 million new displacements were as a result of natural
disasters [2], the occurrence of which is increasing simultaneously with climate change,
related to increasing greenhouse gas concentrations, including ﬂooding, drought, an in-
creased frequency and intensity of climate-related disasters, and sea-level rises. UNICEF
(2017) [3] predicts that, by the end of the 21st century, 70 million people and up to 30% of
Africa’s coastal areas could be affected by climate change. These environmental changes
are inﬂuencing human migration through their intersection with other political, economic,
demographic, social, and environmental drivers of mobility [4,5]).

Climate change is associated with severe economic and social impacts and has also
become a major health concern, not just for migrants. Water pollution and scarcity, in-
creased air pollution, and changes in food production may affect anyone but, as with
many stressors, climate change will hit vulnerable populations the hardest. For example,
warmer temperatures are causing malaria to spread to higher altitudes [6] and will serve
to increase the number of people affected worldwide. These numbers are substantial; in
2018, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported an estimated 228 million malaria
episodes worldwide, 93% of which were in the WHO Africa Region [7]. Climate-related

migration may have grave health effects and well-being consequences for both host and
home communities. However, there is a dearth of literature on the health consequences of
climate change for African migrants. This scoping review aims to identify original research
articles that examine the relationship between climate change and African migrants’ health.

2. Methods

Our review was designed and conducted in adherence with the Preferred Report-
ing Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews
(PRISMA-ScR) statement [8]. This scoping review followed Arksey and O’Malley’s [9]
ﬁve-stage approach.

2.1. Stage 1: Developing the Research Question

Our research question was: “What is known in the literature about the effect of climate

change on the health of African migrants?”.

2.2. Stage 2: Identifying the Relevant Studies

A systematic literature search was conducted by an experienced health sciences librar-
ian (MK) to identify all relevant published studies. Searches were performed in February
2021 using the following databases: Medline (1946–present), EMBASE (1974–present),
PsycINFO (1806–present), Global Health (1910–present), and HealthSTAR (1966–present)
via OVID; Cumulative Index for Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL)
(1936–present) and Environment Complete (1950–present) via EBSCOhost; Scopus via
Elsevier (1976–present); Sociological Abstracts (1952–present) and Dissertations and The-
ses Global (1861–present) via ProQuest; and Cochrane Library via Wiley (1993–present).
These databases were searched using a combination of natural language vocabulary and
controlled terms (subject headings) whenever available, derived from three main concepts:
(1) climate change and natural disasters, (2) African migrants, and (3) health and wellness.
To increase search sensitivity, publication date, language, and study type restrictions were
not applied. In total, 1553 records were identiﬁed. Duplicate records (n = 614) were auto-
matically removed upon import to the systematic review management software (Covidence
version 2). The full search strategy is attached as an appendix.

2.3. Stage 3: Article Selection

Two research personnel independently selected and reviewed each article that met the
following inclusion criteria: (1) focus on climate change; (2) focus on African immigrants;
and (3) focus on health. We excluded grey literature and articles that were not peer-
reviewed. Disagreements were resolved by a third reviewer. A total of 943 titles and
abstracts were screened for potential eligibility from which 158 articles were advanced for
full-text review. Seven articles were ultimately selected for inclusion in this scoping review.
We also reviewed the reference lists of included articles but found no additional studies
that met our inclusion criteria. This information is summarized in detail in a PRISMA ﬂow
diagram (Figure 1).

2.4. Stage 4: Data Charting and Data Extraction

The following information was extracted from each of the seven articles: author(s)
name, year of publication, country of study, study type, sample size, age of subjects, type
of migrants, type of climate change, ﬁndings, and conclusion.

2.5. Stage 5: Collating, Summarizing, and Reporting the Results

The characteristics and results reported in each included article are summarily de-
scribed. We present an overview of existing evidence relating to the relationship between
climate change and African migrant health.

3.1. Study Characteristics

The characteristics of the seven articles included in this scoping review are presented
in Table 1. Three studies were cross-sectional, two were qualitative, one was a cohort
study, and one was a need assessment report. The population size in the included arti-
cles ranged from 29 to 1.5 million. The age of participants was reported in only three
studies (18–100 years, children under 5 years, and an average age of 27.9 years, respec-
tively). Three of the seven studies included refugees, one included internally displaced
persons (IDPs), one included African migrants in a European country, and one included
rural-urban migrants. The included articles assessed different aspects of climate change,
including ﬂooding, exposure to particulate matter, wind speed, dew point, rainfall, and
temperature, and reported on different aspects of health, including poor hygiene/ san-
itation, access to healthcare, mental health, and social capital, malnutrition, respiratory

3.2. Poor Hygiene/Sanitation

In their qualitative study focusing on refugees and IDPs, A study [14]) reports that
forceful migration due to climate change often results in overcrowding because migrants
tend to move from rural to urban areas. Therefore, immigrants are often faced with health
issues including open defecation and a lack of or inadequate water and sanitation systems.
Similarly, the authors of a cross-sectional study conducted among IDPs affected by ﬂooding
in Nigeria also suggest the signiﬁcant level of sickness observed among their respondents
may be due to overcrowding [10].

3.3. Access to Healthcare

A study [10] reported that IDPs across three states in Nigeria who were affected by the
ﬂooding had reduced access to healthcare due to damage to the infrastructure. Speciﬁcally,
only 8 (57%) of the 14 pregnant women interviewed had access to antenatal care, primarily
due to a lack of money to access care and transportation to the nearest facility. They also
suggest the signiﬁcant increase in sickness among their study population was due to a
lack of access to malaria control and healthcare facilities; the proportion of IDPs in their
study who had access to insecticide-treated bed nets decreased from 78.9% pre-disaster to
57.7% post-disaster. Inequities in aid provision and access to services across several refugee
camps that were equally affected by drought in Kenya were reported by [11].

3.4. Mental Health and Social Capital

In a study by Lindvall et al. [14] identify poor mental health as one of the signiﬁcant
problems among IDPs and refugees affected by drought in Somalia; they report that
many people were traumatized due to forced displacement as a result of war or climate
change. Similarly, Heaney and Winter [13] report migrants who were displaced due to
climate change in Tanzania encountered mental health issues including stress, sadness, and
loneliness. In one cross-sectional study, the perception of climate change was reportedly
negatively correlated with social capital (r = −0.416) among African refugees living in
Nigeria, Liberia, Afghanistan, and Italy [16] that is, as the perception of climate change
increased, social capital decreased. The authors also report a signiﬁcant negative correlation

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 16867

5 of 7

(r = −0.256) between the loss of social capital and emotional disorders and a positive
correlation between the perception of climate change and emotional disorders (r = 0.231).
These ﬁndings must be interpreted with caution because a small number of non-Africans
were included in the correlation coefﬁcient calculation. Speciﬁcally, only 6 of the 100 study
participants were from Afghanistan, and such a small number is unlikely to have signiﬁcant
effects on the reported estimates.

3.5. Malnutrition

A study [10] reported their study participants (IDPs affected by ﬂooding) had sig-
niﬁcantly better feeding habits before the disaster; however, they noted that they did not
consider the quality and class of the food. Lindvall et al. [14] also report that drought may
lead to the loss of livestock, which consequently affects the health and nutrition of people.
Dar and Khan [11] report that children in refugee camps in Kenya affected by drought
suffered from severe malnutrition.

3.6. Respiratory Health

A cohort study that included refugees in Kenya reports a signiﬁcant positive correla-
tion between climate variables and the incidence of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) [15].
Speciﬁcally, this included a signiﬁcant moderate correlation between RSV incidence and
wind speed (p = 0.003) and insigniﬁcant weak correlations between RSV incidence and
temperature (p = 0.289) and RSV incidence and dew points (p = 0.201).

3.7. Premature Mortality

One article assessing the needs of IDPs suggests high rates of maternal, child, and
neonatal mortality rates among persons that were internally displaced due to drought
in Somalia, possibly due to shortages of trained healthcare personnel [14]. One USA
study that assessed the effect of air pollution on over one million migrants from Asia,
Africa, Latin America, Europe, Oceania, and North America reports that immigrants
originating from Asia, Africa, and Latin America experienced higher annual average
exposures to ﬁne particles than those from other regions [12]. Although the authors did
not distinguish the outcomes for African immigrants from the outcomes for immigrants
from other regions, they note that the differences in average ﬁne particle exposure were
smaller between immigrants by time since immigration than by region of origin. They
also report that immigrants from Asia, Africa, and Latin America had higher premature
mortality attributable to ﬁne particle exposure compared to immigrants from other regions.

4. Discussion

This scoping review provides an overview of existing evidence regarding the impact
of climate change on the well-being of African immigrants. Findings from the articles
included in this review suggest climate change may lead to a wide range of health problems
in this population. Overcrowding, mental trauma, physical illness, and increased morbidity
were some of the issues highlighted by the included studies as consequences of climate
change across different African immigrant groups. Climate change was also reported to
result in reduced access to healthcare services. Insufﬁcient social capital and emotional
disorders were associated with how refugees perceived climate change across populations.
Climate change effects such as rising temperatures, heat waves, ﬂoods, tornadoes,
hurricanes, droughts, ﬁres, deforestation, and glacier retreat, along with the disappearance
of rivers and desertiﬁcation, have consequences for human physical and mental health [17].
Many African groups have been displaced from their homes due to extreme weather events,
resulting in homelessness and inadequate access to healthcare facilities. Unexpected and
unplanned displacement due to climate change may harm people’s health; forced dis-
placement may lead to a range of illnesses such as mental disorders and the spread of
communicable diseases [7]. Additionally, inconsistent or inadequate rainfall patterns affect
the supply of safe drinking water and, therefore, may lead to increases in waterborne dis-

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 16867

eases as well as drought and famine. Extreme weather conditions increase the prevalence of
malnutrition and undernutrition due to plants failing to survive in unfavorable conditions.
Overall, climate change is projected to lead to 250,000 additional deaths each year between
2030 and 2050 [7]. The potential impacts of climate change on the world as a whole are
beginning to be better deﬁned. However, this scoping review highlights the paucity of
evidence on the effects of climate change on the health of African immigrants, hence the
need for further research in this area.

5. Conclusions

This scoping review has a number of strengths. First, to the best of our knowledge, it is
the ﬁrst to provide an overview of the relationship between climate change and the health of
African immigrants. Second, multiple sources were searched to identify potentially relevant
articles for inclusion in the scoping review. Third, articles were thoroughly screened by at
least two trained reviewers, and conﬂicts were resolved by a third reviewer. One major
limitation of this study is the small number of articles that were included, which could limit
the generalizability of the ﬁndings; as such, the results presented should be interpreted
with caution. This limitation serves to highlight the need for further research in this area,
especially qualitative research focusing on the lived experiences of African migrants related
to climate change. Understanding how climate change affects migrants with underlying
health conditions and the effect of changes in climate on maternal, child, and neonate
health would be valuable, as would longitudinal studies that focus on the long-term effects
of climate change on the health of African migrants.

Overall, this scoping review suggests climate change affects the physical, mental,
and social aspects of African immigrants’ health. Climatic and environmental changes,
population changes, and migration are strongly correlated with the development and,
therefore, have a substantial impact on global sustainability discourses [18,19] and are
intertwined with the effects noted here in terms of health. African migrants and IDPs
are vulnerable groups, and climate change will worsen their struggle. This population is
often faced with poor living conditions including overcrowded settlements, inadequate
protection from weather extremes, and inadequate access to healthcare. These conditions
are traumatic and underscore the stark need for mental health support services for this
population. Furthermore, governments should seek to develop a long-term strategy, i.e.,
beyond a rapid-response system, to prevent or mitigate the health-related effects of natural
disasters where possible.
