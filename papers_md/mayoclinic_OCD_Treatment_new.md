Steps to help diagnose obsessive-compulsive disorder may include:

- Psychological evaluation.This includes talking about your thoughts, feelings, symptoms and behavior patterns to find out if you have obsessions or compulsive behaviors that get in the way of your quality of life. With your permission, this may include talking to your family or friends.

- Physical exam.This may be done to rule out other issues that could cause your symptoms and check for any related complications.


### Diagnostic challenges


It's sometimes hard to diagnoseOCDbecause symptoms can be like those of obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, anxiety disorders, depression, schizophrenia or other mental health disorders. And it's possible to haveOCDand another mental health disorder. Work with your doctor so that you can get the right diagnosis and treatment.

Obsessive-compulsive disorder treatment may not result in a cure. But it can help bring symptoms under control so that they don't rule your daily life. Depending on how serious yourOCDis, you may need long-term, ongoing or more-intensive treatment.

The two main treatments forOCDare psychotherapy and medicines. Psychotherapy also is known as talk therapy. Often, a mix of both treatments is most effective.

Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), a type of psychotherapy, is effective for many people withOCD. Exposure and response prevention (ERP), a part ofCBTtherapy, involves exposing you over time to a feared object or obsession, such as dirt. Then you learn ways not to do your compulsive rituals.ERPtakes effort and practice, but you may enjoy a better quality of life once you learn to manage your obsessions and compulsions.

Certain psychiatric medicines can help control the obsessions and compulsions ofOCD. Most commonly, antidepressants are tried first.

Antidepressants approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treatOCDinclude:

- Fluoxetine (Prozac) for adults and children 7 years and older.

- Fluvoxamine (Luvox) for adults and children 8 years and older.

- Paroxetine (Paxil) for adults only.

- Sertraline (Zoloft) for adults and children 6 years and older.

- Clomipramine (Anafranil) for adults and children 10 years and older.

However, your doctor may prescribe other antidepressants and psychiatric medicines.


### Medicines: What to consider


When talking with your doctor about medicines forOCD, consider:

- Medicine selection.In general, the goal is to effectively control symptoms at the lowest possible dose.OCDmay sometimes require higher doses of medicines to be the most effective in controlling your symptoms. It's not unusual to try several drugs before finding one that works well. Your doctor might recommend more than one medicine to effectively manage your symptoms. It can take weeks to months to get better after starting a medicine for your symptoms.

- Side effects.All psychiatric medicines may have side effects. Talk to your doctor about possible side effects and about any health monitoring needed while taking psychiatric drugs. And let your doctor know if you have troubling side effects.

- Suicide risk.Most antidepressants are generally safe, but theFDArequires that all antidepressants carry black box warnings. These are the strictest warnings for prescriptions. In some cases, children, teenagers and young adults under 25 may have an increase in suicidal thoughts or behavior when taking antidepressants. This is especially true in the first few weeks after starting or when the dose is changed. If suicidal thoughts occur, contact your doctor or get emergency help at once. Keep in mind that antidepressants are more likely to lower suicide risk in the long run by making your mood better.

- Interactions with other substances.When taking an antidepressant, tell your doctor about any other prescription medicines available without a prescription, herbs or other supplements you take. Some antidepressants can make some other medicines less effective and cause dangerous reactions when combined with certain medicines or herbal supplements.

- Stopping antidepressants.Antidepressants aren't thought to be addictive, but sometimes physical dependence can occur. Stopping treatment suddenly or missing several doses can cause withdrawal-like symptoms. This is sometimes called discontinuation syndrome. Don't stop taking your medicine without talking to your doctor, even if you're feeling better. You may have a relapse ofOCDsymptoms. Work with your doctor to lower your dose safely over time.

Talk to your doctor about the risks and benefits of using specific medicines.


### Other treatment


Sometimes, psychotherapy and medicines can't controlOCDsymptoms. In cases that don't respond to treatment, other options may be offered:

- Intensive outpatient and residential treatment programs.Full treatment programs that stressERPtherapy principles may help people withOCDwho struggle with being able to function because of how serious their symptoms are. These programs usually last several weeks.

- Deep brain stimulation (DBS).TheFDAhas approvedDBSto treatOCDin adults ages 18 years and older who don't respond to traditional treatment.DBSinvolves implanting electrodes within certain areas of your brain. These electrodes produce electrical impulses that may help control impulses that aren't typical.DBSisn't widely available, and it is rarely used.

- Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS).TheFDAhas approved threeTMSdevices — BrainsWay, MagVenture and NeuroStar — to treatOCDin adults. These devices are used when traditional treatment hasn't been effective.TMSdoesn't require surgery. It uses magnetic fields to stimulate nerve cells in the brain to make symptoms ofOCDbetter. During aTMSsession, an electromagnetic coil is placed against your scalp near your forehead. The coil delivers a magnetic pulse that stimulates nerve cells in your brain.

If you're thinking aboutDBSorTMS, talk with your doctor to make sure you understand all the pros and cons and possible health risks.
