Abstract

Objective: The prevalence of treatment-resistant schizophrenia (TRS) among people with first-episode schizophrenia 
(FES) has been sub-optimally researched in Australia and internationally. We evaluated the prevalence of TRS among a 
cohort of FES patients and compared their sociodemographic and clinical characteristics to those with FES who were 
treatment responsive.

Methods: Over 2 years, we collated demographic, clinical and treatment-related data of all patients with ICD-10 (Inter-
national Classification of Diseases, Tenth revision) diagnosis of schizophrenia who were active in October 2020 at four 
early psychosis intervention services (EPIS) in Western Australia. We used a modified version of Suzuki et al. criteria to 
diagnose TRS. The data were analysed utilising descriptive statistics, the Mann–Whitney U test, Student’s t-test and the 
False-Discovery Rate method.

Results: The prevalence of TRS among the 167 patients diagnosed with FES was 41.3%, and the rates did not differ 
significantly  between  the  services  (p = 0.955).  Those  in  the  TRS  group  were  less  independent  (p = 0.011),  had  more 
prolonged unemployment (p = 0.014) and were more likely to be on disability pension (p = 0.011) compared to the treat-
ment responsive group. Furthermore, they had greater severity of symptoms (p = 0.002), longer duration of psychiatric 
symptoms (p = 0.019), more hospitalisations (p = 0.002) and longer cumulative admission durations (p = 0.002).

Conclusions: Our study revealed that treatment resistance to antipsychotics is prevalent among people with FES man-
aged at EPIS. Notably, it establishes an association between TRS and heightened clinical severity and psychosocial and 
treatment burden. These findings highlight the imperative for early detection of treatment resistance and timely and 
specialised interventions for this condition in mental health services.

Introduction

Treatment-resistant schizophrenia (TRS) is both a clinical 
diagnosis and research descriptive and has been varyingly 
defined (Howes et al., 2017; Suzuki et al., 2012). Of late, 
attempts  have  been  made  to  define  the  concept  of  TRS 
more  precisely,  incorporating  parameters  such  as  a  vali-
dated diagnosis of schizophrenia and persistence of signifi-
cant symptoms despite adequate pharmacological treatment 
(Howes  et al.,  2017).  A  recent  meta-analysis  reported  a 
pooled prevalence of TRS among people with schizophre-
nia at various stages of their illness (mean illness duration 
16.2 years)  of  36.7%,  with  a  range  between  15.4%  and 
75.6% (Diniz et al., 2023). TRS is associated with a lower 
quality of life, higher unemployment rates, more significant 
impairment in achieving living milestones and greater reli-
ance on supported accommodation in comparison to treat-
ment  responsive  patients  with  schizophrenia  (Demjaha 
et al., 2017; Iasevoli et al., 2016; Lally et al., 2016). From a 
clinical  perspective,  TRS  is  associated  with  an  increased 
number  of  hospitalisations,  more  days  spent  in  hospital, 
more severe positive and negative symptoms, worse cogni-
tive  function,  more  comorbidities,  higher  prevalence  of 
substance abuse, poorer prognosis and significantly higher 
healthcare costs compared to treatment responders (Correll 
et al.,  2019;  Kane  et al.,  2019;  Kennedy  et al.,  2014; 
Millgate et al., 2022).

Many  clinicians  conceptualise  TRS  as  associated  with 
chronicity  and  diagnosing TRS,  particularly  among  those 
within the first episode of schizophrenia (FES), can often 
be  missed  or  delayed  (Demjaha  et al.,  2017;  Lally  et al., 
2016;  Wold  et al.,  2023).  The  prevalence  of  TRS  among 
FES  cohorts  has  been  sub-optimally  researched. A  recent 
meta-analysis  highlighted  the  research  gap  regarding  the 
prevalence  of  TRS  among  FES  patients,  estimating  the 
prevalence rate of 24.4% (Siskind et al., 2022). However, 
the generalisability of this finding is constrained by several 
factors. The  meta-analysis  identified  a  limited  number  of 
studies examining TRS prevalence in FES cohorts, reveal-
ing  considerable  heterogeneity  among  them  with  rates 
ranging  from  8.97%  (Kahn  et al.,  2018)  to  44.6% 
(Yoshimura et al., 2019). Many studies also included indi-
viduals  with  other  psychotic  disorders,  alongside  FES 
patients  (Demjaha  et al.,  2017;  Doyle  et al.,  2017;  Kahn 
et al.,  2018;  Lally  et al.,  2016;  Malla  et al.,  2006;  Smart 
et al., 2019; Yoshimura et al., 2019). Some of the included 
intervention 
studies  were  short-term  algorithm-based 
research evaluating the efficacy of medications (Agid et al., 
2011;  Kahn  et al.,  2018;  Yoshimura  et al.,  2019)  or  used 
proxy markers for TRS, such as the prescription of clozap-
ine (Doyle et al., 2017; Wimberley et al., 2016).

Approximately 70–80% of patients diagnosed with TRS 
among those experiencing FES, have treatment resistance 
from the initiation of antipsychotic treatment. Conversely, 
an  additional  20–30%  develop  resistance  after  6  months 
following  an  initial  period  of  good  response  to  treatment 

1081

(Demjaha et al., 2017; Lally et al., 2016). This latter group 
is  likely  to  be  missed  in  short-term  studies  on  the  preva-
lence of TRS. Similarly, while clozapine is considered the 
gold  standard  for  the  treatment  of  people  with  TRS 
(Wagner  et al.,  2021),  its  initiation  is  often  delayed  for 
many years (John et al., 2018), and it is under-prescribed 
(Bachmann et al., 2017). Thus, identifying TRS based on 
clozapine  prescription  could  underestimate 
its  rate. 
Moreover, very few studies have compared TRS patients’ 
clinical and sociodemographic characteristics to treatment 
responders  in  early  schizophrenia  (Crespo-Facorro  et al., 
2021; Nucifora et al., 2019). In addition, to our knowledge, 
the prevalence of TRS in FES has not been well-researched 
in Australian settings. Thien et al. (2018) conducted a study 
on  544  young  people  with  first-episode  psychosis  at  an 
early psychosis programme in Melbourne and reported that 
65 met the criteria for TRS. However, only 13.1% of their 
sample  had  a  diagnosis  of  schizophrenia,  and  the  rest 
attracted other diagnoses. We evaluated the prevalence of 
treatment resistance in individuals with FES receiving clin-
ical  services  at  Early  Psychosis  Intervention  Services 
(EPIS).  In  addition,  we  compared  the  sociodemographic 
and clinical characteristics of those with treatment-resistant 
and treatment-responsive FES.

Method
Ethics approval

This study was part of a larger study titled the clinical and 
economic benefits of early use of clozapine in first-episode 
schizophrenia.  The  Western  Australian  Health  Human 
Research  Ethics  Committee  and  the  governance  commit-
tees of the sites involved approved the study. This compo-
nent  of  the  study  was  done  under  a  waiver  of  consent 
approved by the ethics committee.

Setting

This  study  included  participants  from  four  EPIS  outpa-
tient  programmes  in  metropolitan  Western  Australia, 
comprising  a  non-governmental  organisation  (headspace 
Early Psychosis Program – hEP), two public EPIS from the 
Southern  Metropolitan  Health  Service  (SMHS)  and  one 
from the East Metropolitan Health Service (EMHS). These 
services provided intensive clinical services to patients in 
the  early  stages  of  psychosis,  and  patients  who  were 
accepted  to  these  services  had  a  psychotic  illness  of  less 
than 5 years duration. The services were clinically led by 
consultant  psychiatrists,  and  the  multidisciplinary  clinical 
staff provided clinical and care coordination services to the 
patients.  As  part  of  the  EPIS  clinical  protocol,  the  care 
coordinators  made  frequent  clinical  contacts  (on  average, 
weekly)  with  patients  and  their  families,  both  within  the 
clinic  setting  and  in  the  community.  The  psychiatrists  or 
psychiatry  registrars  of  the  team  reviewed  the  patients’

mental state, medications and progress, on average, once a 
month. Detailed notes of the reviews were recorded in the 
patients’ medical records.

Participant selection

Lists of all patients who were active with the four EPIS in 
October 2020 were obtained. From these lists, we selected 
all patients diagnosed with schizophrenia according to the 
International  Classification  of  Diseases  10th  Revision. 
Diagnoses were made through a comprehensive review of 
medical notes and consultation with the team’s consultant 
psychiatrist.

Instruments, measures and sources of 
information

Before the study, the recruited research officers, who were 
experienced mental health clinicians, were trained by a sen-
ior  psychiatrist  (A.P.J.)  in  gathering  relevant  clinical  and 
demographic data from the patients’ medical records. These 
trained  research  officers  collected  existing  demographic, 
clinical  and  treatment-related  data  of  the  patients  with  a 
diagnosis  of  schizophrenia  from  these  patients’  medical 
records.  The  research  officers  collected  the  data  from 
October 2020 through August 2022. Data available until to 
the  point  of  review  of  the  individual  patients’  medical 
records were collected. Collected sociodemographic details 
included  age,  gender,  years  of  formal  education,  marital 
status, income and accommodation. Clinical details such as 
the primary diagnosis, comorbidities, substance abuse, age 
of  first  psychiatric  symptoms,  age  of  onset  of  psychosis, 
number of psychiatric admissions, total days in hospital for 
psychiatric  illness,  nature,  dose  and  duration  of  antipsy-
chotic  treatments.  The  duration  of  psychiatric  symptoms 
was  calculated  as  documented  age  of  first  psychiatric 
symptoms subtracted from age at time of study. Similarly, 
the  duration  of  psychosis  was  calculated  as  documented 
age of first psychotic symptoms subtracted from age at time 
of study. The response of the patients to each antipsychotic 
trial and the reasons for discontinuation of antipsychotics 
were  obtained.  The  research  officers  also  completed  the 
Clinical  Global  Impression  –  Schizophrenia  (CGI-SCH; 
Haro et al., 2003) scale for each patient, relying on clinical 
information extracted from the patients’ medical records of 
symptom profile and severity.

CGI-SCH positive symptom score of 4 or more and func-
tional impairment. Recent assessments of patients’ support 
level,  accommodation,  employment  status,  income  status 
and  social  support  were  considered  in  determining  func-
tional impairment. We did not use a rating scale such as the 
Functional  Assessment  for  Comprehensive  Treatment  of 
Schizophrenia  (FACT-Sz)  or  the  Global  Assessment  of 
Functioning (GAF), nor did we employ a cut-off score for 
functional impairment, as suggested by Suzuki et al. (2012). 
Medical records were carefully reviewed regarding infor-
mation  on  non-adherence.  If  the  persistence  of  positive 
symptoms  was  considered  as  due  to  non-adherence  with 
antipsychotics, those patients were not rated as meeting the 
criteria of TRS of failed antipsychotic treatment.

In Western Australia, clozapine is indicated for TRS or 
for patients with schizophrenia who experience intolerable 
side  effects  from  at  least  two  other  antipsychotics 
(Guidelines  for  the  Safe  and  Quality  Use  of  Clozapine 
Therapy  in  the  WA  health;  www.health.wa.gov.au/guide-
lines).  Consequently,  all  patients  treated  with  clozapine 
were considered to have TRS, irrespective of their current 
CGI-SCH score or functional disability, unless documenta-
tion  indicated  that  clozapine  was  prescribed  for  reasons 
other than TRS. In cases of uncertainty regarding TRS sta-
tus, clarification was sought from the consultant psychia-
trist associated with the respective treating team.

Statistical analysis

Data were analysed using the open-source statistical pack-
age Jamovi version 2.2.5. Descriptive statistics were used. 
For comparisons between the groups, the Mann–Whitney 
U  test  was  applied  for  non-parametric  continuous  values, 
whereas  the  Student’s  t-test  was  applied  for  continuous 
variables.  Non-normal  distributions  are  described  using 
median and interquartile ranges (IQRs), while normal dis-
tributions are described using mean and standard deviation 
(SD). The chi-square test was applied to categorical values. 
The  false-discovery  rate  method  was  utilised  to  adjust 
p-values,  given  the  necessity  for  multiple  comparisons 
within the same dataset (Menyhart et al., 2021). The thresh-
old level of significance was set at α = 0.05.

Defining treatment resistance

The research officers used a modified version of the Suzuki 
et al.  (2012)  criteria  to  identify  TRS.  They  categorised 
patients into the TRS sub-category after reviewing all data 
and  consulting  with  two  senior  consultant  psychiatrists 
(A.P.J. and G.S.). Criteria included a confirmed diagnosis 
of  schizophrenia,  at  least  two  past  antipsychotic  trials  of 
6 weeks each with suboptimal symptom response, a current 

A total of 394 patients were part of the EPIS services when 
the lists were obtained. Out of these, 167 had a diagnosis of 
schizophrenia, with 48% (80) originating from the hEP pro-
gramme, 38% (64) from SMHS and 14% (23) from EMHS. 
These  patients  were  considered  as  having  FES.  Almost 
three-quarters  of  the  cohort  with  FES  were  male;  their 
mean age was 24 years (SD 4.44 years; see Table 1). Most 
participants were single (81.44%) and resided with family

or  friends  (76.05%)  and  half  (50.3%)  were  classified  as 
requiring support for daily living. Around 60% were unem-
ployed and nearly half of the sample received regular gov-
ernment  financial  support.  The  cohort  had  an  average 
education level of 12 years. Regarding clinical characteris-
tics, the mean duration of psychosis was over 3 years (SD 
1.88 years),  and  the  mean  age  of  onset  of  psychosis  was 
20.8 years  (SD  4.55 years).  About  35.3%  were  actively 
engaged in substance abuse, 65.9% had a concurrent psy-
chiatric  condition,  and  25.7%  had  a  comorbid  medical 
condition.

Prevalence of TRS

The overall prevalence rate of TRS was 41.3% among this 
cohort,  with  an  insignificant  variation  across  the  service 
providers  (hEP  42.5%,  EMHS  43.5%,  SMHS  39.1%, 
χ2 = 0.328, p = 0.955).

Sociodemographic differences between TRS 
and non-TRS patients

A significantly higher proportion of the TRS patients were 
recipients  of  the  disability  support  pension  (20.29%, 
p = 0.011) than the non-TRS patients (6.12%; see Table 2). 
Moreover,  the  TRS  patients  were  deemed  as  significantly 
less  independent  in  terms  of  the  daily  level  of  support 
required  than  the  non-TRS  cohort  (p  0.011).  Although  a 
larger  percentage  of  TRS  patients  were  male,  single  and 
unemployed,  these  differences  did  not  achieve  statistical 
significance  (p = 0.062,  p = 0.055  and  p = 0.068,  respec-
tively). Nevertheless, their unemployment duration was sig-
nificantly  longer  by  approximately  1.5 years  compared  to 
the non-TRS group (p = 0.014). The age, education level and 
type of accommodation were the same between the groups.

Clinical differences between TRS and non-
TRS patients

In the analysis of clinical factors (see Table 3), TRS patients 
endured psychiatric symptoms for an additional 12 months 
(p = 0.019)  compared  to  the  treatment  responsive  group. 
They  also  scored  significantly  higher  across  the  positive, 
negative  and  cognitive  subdomain  and  CGI  total  scores 
than  the  non-TRS  patients  (p = 0.002).  Furthermore,  the 
TRS  patients  had  significantly  more  hospitalisations  for 
psychiatric  illness  than  non-TRS  patients,  with  approxi-
mately  3.04  admissions  (SD = 2.21)  compared  with  1.76 
(SD = 1.41),  respectively  (p = 0.002).  In  addition,  TRS 
patients  had  undergone  significantly  longer  cumulative 
duration  of  psychiatric  admissions,  with  a  median  of 
52 months (IQR ±118) compared with 26 months (±44) for 
non-TRS  patients  (p = 0.002).  The  TRS  group  underwent 
significantly more antipsychotic trials, with a median of 4 
(IQR ±2),  compared  to  a  median  of  3  (IQR ±2)  for  non-
TRS  patients  (p = 0.002).  However,  there  were  no  differ-
ences  observed  in  the  age  of  onset  of  psychosis  and 
psychiatric symptoms, as well as in the levels of comorbid 
psychiatric  and  general  medical  illnesses  between  the 
groups. In addition, the groups showed similarities in terms 
of substance abuse history and usage patterns.

Discussion
Prevalence of TRS at early intervention 
services
Our study revealed a prevalence of TRS of 41.32% among 
a cohort of FES patients in Western Australia’s EPIS. The 
prevalence of TRS in our sample is higher than the figures 
of  22%  and  24.4%  reported  in  the  metanalyses  of  TRS 
among  FES  (Diniz  et al.,  2023;  Siskind  et al.,  2022)  but 
close to the rate of 37.8% reported among 239 FES patients 
followed up for approximately 5 years after first presenta-
to  psychiatric  services  (Ajnakina  et al.,  2020). 
tion 
However, other researchers have reported lower prevalence 
rates of 15–23% (Demjaha et al., 2017; Lally et al., 2016; 
Smart et al., 2019; Stokes et al., 2020) during 5 to 15 years 
of follow-up of patients with first-episode psychosis/schiz-
ophrenia. The authors of the meta-analysis on FES observed 
that there were only nine studies that evaluated the preva-
lence  of  TRS  in  FES,  and  the  rates  ranged  from  8.97% 
(Kahn et al., 2018) to 44.6% (Yoshimura et al., 2019) with 
significant methodological differences between the studies. 
The length of follow-up periods among these studies varied 
between  2  and  120 months.  A  significant  proportion  of 
patients with FES, reported to be between 20% and 30% of 
those who have TRS, develop it at a later stage of illness, in

the  first  5  years  following  an  initial  period  of  treatment 
response (Demjaha et al., 2017; Lally et al., 2016). A con-
siderable  number  of  the  previous  studies  had  a  short  fol-
low-up  period  (Agid  et al.,  2011;  Kahn  et al.,  2018; 
Lieberman  et al.,  1993;  Malla  et al.,  2006;  Smart  et al., 
2019)  and  could  have  missed  the  patients  with  FES  who 
later developed TRS. In our study, the TRS group exhibited 
a  mean  duration  of  psychosis  over  42 months  (SD 
22.3 months),  and  it  is  possible  that  a  subset  of  our  TRS 
patients developed treatment resistance over the preceding 
period of psychosis, contributing to the overall higher TRS 
prevalence rate in our study. Furthermore, among the previ-
ous  studies  on  TRS  prevalence  in  FES,  lost  to  follow-up 
ranged  from  15%  to  68%  (Agid  et al.,  2011;  Lieberman 
et al., 1993), while our data collection included all individ-
uals originally included in the cohort. The low prevalence 
rate of TRS reported by some of the studies with high drop-
outs is likely to be an underestimate. It is feasible that those 
with TRS were more likely to have dropped out from fol-
low-up,  thereby  artificially  decreasing  the  rate  of  TRS 
(Siskind  et al.,  2022).  Some  authors  have  only  included 
patients  treated  with  clozapine  in  their  definition  of  TRS 

(Doyle  et al.,  2017;  Lally  et al.,  2016;  Wimberley  et al., 
2016).  However,  clozapine  is  underutilised,  and  its  com-
mencement  is  often  delayed  for  many  years  (John  et al., 
2018; Muñoz-Manchado et al., 2023), and thus it is quite 
likely that these studies have underreported the true preva-
lence of TRS. Furthermore, many studies on the prevalence 
of TRS in first-episode psychosis have included diagnoses 
other than schizophrenia, such as psychosis not otherwise 
specified  (Demjaha  et al.,  2017;  Doyle  et al.,  2017;  Kahn 
et al.,  2018;  Lally  et al.,  2016;  Malla  et al.,  2006;  Smart 
et al., 2019; Thien et al., 2018; Yoshimura et al., 2019) and 
affective  and  substance-induced  psychosis  (Thien  et al., 
2018). The nature of the cohort, the setting from where they 
are drawn, the study design and criteria used to define TRS 
can all affect the prevalence rate. While the TRIPP criteria 
to  define  TRS  has  been  broadly  accepted,  some  authors 
have suggested that the prevalence of TRS as identified by 
the TRRIP or similar criteria in the early course of illness is 
likely to be an underestimate and should be interpreted with 
caution,  as  a  large  proportion  of  patients  with  primary 
antipsychotic 
remain  unidentified 
(Dempster et al., 2021; Wold et al., 2023).

The  prevalence  rate  of  TRS  in  our  study  was  similar 
across the services included. The specialised EPIS included 
in our study are likely to provide clinical services to indi-
viduals  with  more  severe  FES.  In  contrast,  treatment-
responsive FES patients may receive care through primary 
or  other  secondary  services  elsewhere,  which  were  not 
captured in our study. While we carefully ascertained treat-
ment responses to antipsychotic trials through a compre-
hensive review of the medical and multidisciplinary staff’s 
clinical notes in the medical records, it is possible that the 
treating  teams  would  have  missed  some  cases  of  non-
adherence with antipsychotics or the psychotic symptoms 
were directly caused by substance abuse and not entered as 
such in the medical records. These patients could have been 
wrongly classified as treatment non-responders to antipsy-
chotics and falsely classified as having TRS, inflating the 
prevalence  of  TRS  in  this  cohort.  Non-adherence  with 
antipsychotics and substance abuse is very common in peo-
ple with schizophrenia (Cahaya et al., 2022; Kennedy et al., 
2014), and a significant proportion of those referred to spe-
cialised  services  for  evaluation  of TRS  were  found  to  be 
non-adherent  (Howes  et al.,  2017).  The  TRRIP  Working 
Group  recommended  determining  treatment  adherence 
through several sources, including serum levels, which may 
reduce  false-positive  treatment  resistance  by  mitigating 
treatment nonresponse secondary to non-adherence (Howes 
et al., 2017).

TRS patients have more severe 
psychopathology, psychosocial burden and 
treatment needs compared with non-TRS 
patients

Our  study  revealed  that  patients  with  TRS  had  a  higher 
global  CGI  score  and  scored  higher  in  all  the  CGI  sub-
domains  of  positive,  negative  and  cognitive  symptoms 
than  their  non-TRS  counterparts.  These  findings  are  in 
keeping with the existing literature that demonstrates the 
persistence of psychotic, negative and cognitive symptoms 
in TRS patients (Howes et al., 2017; Iasevoli et al., 2016; 
Millgate  et al.,  2022),  contributing  to  more  significant 
social  and  functional  limitations  (Correll  et al.,  2019; 
Kennedy  et al.,  2014).  We  also  found  that  TRS  patients 
were receiving the disability support pension at more sig-
nificant proportions and had been unemployed for a longer 
mean  duration  of  months.  TRS  patients  also  required 
higher  levels  of  daily  support  than  non-TRS  patients. 
These findings are in keeping with earlier studies, which 
showed that individuals with TRS are more likely to expe-
rience a decrease in quality of life, increased medical costs 
and  have  lower  employment  rates  (Iasevoli  et al.,  2016; 
Kane et al., 2019), a trend that was also observed in early 
schizophrenia  (Crespo-Facorro  et al.,  2021).  The  greater 
clinical  severity  and  functional  impairments  and  nonre-
sponse to traditional antipsychotics from illness onset have

prompted some to postulate that TRS is a categorically dis-
tinct type of schizophrenia with changes in receptors such 
as  glutamate,  serotonin  and  gamma-aminobutyric  acid 
(GABA)  rather  than  dopamine,  neuroimaging  findings, 
greater  genetic  loading  and  neurocognitive  impairments 
(Demjaha et al., 2012; Farooq et al., 2013; Mouchlianitis 
et al., 2016; Suzuki et al., 2015). However, the neurobio-
logical mechanisms that lead to the development of treat-
ment  resistance  are  not  distinctly  demarcated  and 
understood. An  alternate  theory  posits  that TRS  exists  at 
the  more  severe  end  of  the  continuum  with  treatment-
responsive  schizophrenia  and  non-affected  first-degree 
relatives of patients with schizophrenia (Frank et al., 2015; 
Millgate  et al.,  2022).  Others  have  suggested  that  dopa-
mine supersensitivity due to long-term D2 receptor block-
ade by antipsychotics (Silvestri et al., 2000) or cumulative 
lifetime  adversities  and  trauma  (Hassan  and  De  Luca, 
2015) have a role in the genesis of TRS.

Our study revealed that TRS patients had a more signifi-
cant total number of psychiatric admissions and had length-
ier  admissions  compared  with  non-TRS  patients,  which 
implies higher direct costs to health systems. This is sup-
ported by a recent study investigating the economic impli-
cations  of  early  treatment  resistance  in  schizophrenia, 
which  found  that  individuals  who  exhibited  early  nonre-
sponse incurred more than double the healthcare costs com-
pared to early responders (Ascher-Svanum et al., 2008). In 
addition,  researchers  who  have  reviewed  the  literature  in 
this  area  suggested  that  the  total  health  costs  for  TRS 
patients were approximately tenfold higher than those for 
non-TRS  patients,  with  the  major  contributor  being 
increased  days  spent  in  hospital  by  patients  with  TRS 
(Kennedy  et al.,  2014;  Peng  et al.,  2011).  Other  research 
has highlighted that individuals in the early stages of schiz-
ophrenia exhibit a higher rate of psychiatric hospitalisation 
and  more  prolonged  hospital  admissions,  resulting  in 
increased  direct  medical  costs  (Nicholl  et al.,  2010). 
Moreover, healthcare expenditures have been shown to rise 
in  tandem  with  the  severity  of  the  disease  (Millier  et al., 
2012). Consequently, early schizophrenia patients who are 
resistant to treatment are likely to incur substantially higher 
healthcare  costs  compared  to  treatment  responders  and 
those with chronic TRS.

We observed that the proportion of males and those who 
were single were higher among the patients with TRS, but 
the figures narrowly failed to reach statistical significance. 
The role of gender and marital status in predicting TRS is 
still unsettled (Bozzatello et al., 2019), and a meta-analysis 
did not observe an increase in males among the TRS group 
(Diniz et al., 2023). We did not find significant differences 
between earlier onset of psychosis or psychiatric illness or 
level of education between the two groups. These findings 
are  not  in  concordance  with  some  of  the  recent  research 
findings  that  younger  age  of  onset  and  lower  educational 
level are robust predictors of those likely to go on to develop

EPIS offers an ideal environment for the early diagno-
sis of treatment-resistant FES. Although this study did not 
examine  treatments,  early  identification  of  TRS  among 
people  with  FES  within  these  settings  may  facilitate  the 
timely 
interventions. 
Unfortunately,  pharmacological  guidelines  for  treating 
FES often provide varied and less-specific recommenda-
tions, with the selection of antipsychotics typically based 
on  side-effect  concerns  rather  than  comparative  efficacy 
benefits (Keating et al., 2017). In a recent study involving 
a cohort of 207 patients with FES, it was noted that, after 
12 months of treatment, only 35 out of the 97 individuals 
who  met  the  criteria  for  no  early  clinical  recovery  had 
undergone sufficient trials with two antipsychotics to sat-
isfy the TRIPP criteria (Wold et al., 2023). Persisting with 
treatment  with  ineffective  antipsychotics  or  trying  aug-
mentation  with  additional  psychotropic  agents  are  not 
uncommon practices among clinicians in managing treat-
ment  nonresponse  (Dempster  et al.,  2021;  Wold  et al., 
2023).  A  structured  evaluation  of  treatment  response  in 
the early phases to identify non-responding FES patients 
and  providing  active  interventions,  including  changing 
ineffective  treatments  and  commencing  clozapine  early, 
should become part of the usual clinical practice of EPIS 
(Bittner  et al.,  2023;  Stokes  et al.,  2020;  Thien  et al., 
2018).

Strengths and limitations of the study

This study has notable strengths, including selecting the 
cohort  from  diverse  EPIS  from  various  metropolitan 
regions  in  WA.  The  data,  meticulously  compiled  by 
trained  research  officers  under  senior  psychiatric  over-
sight, enhances the study’s robustness. Another strength 
is  the  comprehensive  follow-up  of  all  initially  included 
FES patients throughout the study, covering a significant 
duration from their initiation with the early intervention 
teams.

However,  the  study  has  certain  limitations.  All  data, 
including that of the determination of TRS status and rat-
ing  of  CGI-SCH  was  completed  based  on  documented 
clinical notes raising the possibility of documentation and 
interpretation  bias.  It  is  possible  that  a  proportion  of 
patients who were treatment responsive were discharged 
from  the  service  relatively  early,  which  could  affect  the 
findings  of  the  study.  Moreover,  the  exclusive  focus  on 
actively engaged EPIS patients might overlook individu-
als  utilising  alternative  psychiatric  or  primary  care  ser-
vices,  thus  potentially  introducing  selection  bias.  The 
majority  of  male  participants  could  limit  the  generalisa-
bility of the findings to broader populations. Furthermore, 
our study did not measure functional impairment using a 

validated  scale,  unlike  Suzuki’s  criteria  (Suzuki  et al., 
2012),  which  requires  both  moderate  symptom  severity 
and  functional  impairment  evidenced  by  a  score  of ⩽ 49 
on FACT-Sz or ⩽ 50 on GAF to determine treatment fail-
ure.  This  may  introduce  measurement  bias.  In  addition, 
we  did  not  verify  treatment  adherence  through  multiple 
sources, as recommended by the TRRIP Working Group 
(Howes et al., 2017), which could result in misclassifica-
tion  and  an  overestimation  of  treatment  resistance  rates 
among FES patients.

Conclusion

In summary, our study sheds light on the high prevalence of 
TRS among people with FES and the more severe clinical 
manifestations  and  profound  psychosocial  disabilities  of 
this group compared to the non-TRS group. The identified 
high prevalence and severity of illness emphasise the sig-
nificant proportion of individuals facing challenges in treat-
ment response early in their psychotic illness. Longitudinal 
long-term  prospective  studies  of  FES  would  provide  a 
clearer picture of the prevalence and time course of devel-
opment of TRS in FES. The high prevalence of TRS and 
the significant clinical severity and functional impairment 
of TRS in FES point towards the need for EPIS and other 
mental health services to be vigilant in detecting TRS early 
and  providing  appropriate  interventions  promptly,  espe-
cially earlier consideration and use of clozapine.
