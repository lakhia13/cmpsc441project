Abstract

Investigation of relationship patterns between co-occurring symptoms has greatly improved the
efficacy of psychiatric care. Depression and anxiety often present together, and identification of
primary versus secondary psychiatric symptoms has implications for treatment. Previous
psychotherapy research investigating the relationship between social anxiety and depression, across
social anxiety treatment, found that severity of social anxiety accounted for the majority of change
in depression severity across time. Conversely, severity of depression accounted for little variation
in severity of social anxiety. The current investigation was conducted to extend these findings by
examining this mediational relationship in a pharmacologic trial comparing paroxetine (n = 20) and
placebo (n = 22). Social anxiety and depression severity were assessed weekly, for 16 weeks.
Consistent with the previous study, results indicated that social anxiety severity mediated the majority
of variance in depression severity, with little variance accounted for by a test of the reverse mediation.
Surprisingly, this same pattern was also found in the placebo group. These findings suggest that this
pattern of mediational relationships may be fundamental to social anxiety, rather than specific to
treatment modality or secondary comorbidity.

INTRODUCTION

A statistical test of mediation is an invaluable tool, long used to help understand how one
variable exerts influence on another and the extent to which a third variable may influence this
relationship. Essentially, mediation is determined by the degree to which the following five
conditions are met: 1) the predictor must significantly predict the outcome variable
independently (path c); 2) the predictor variable must significantly predict the mediator variable
(path a); 3) the mediator must significantly predict the outcome variable (path b); 4) when both

the predictor and the mediator simultaneously predict the outcome variable, the mediator must
continue to demonstrate a significant relationship with the outcome variable; and 5) the strength
of the predictor variable on the outcome variable will be significantly decreased when both the
predictor (now path c′) and mediator variable simultaneously predict the outcome variable. If
path c′ is significantly lowered in strength, in comparison to path c, but still maintains a
significant relationship with the outcome variable, this is consistent with partial mediation. If
path c′ is significantly lowered in strength, in comparison to path c, and path c′ fails to show a
significant relationship with the outcome variable, this is consistent with full mediation.

In examining the influence of cognitive behavioral group therapy for social anxiety,
Moscovitch and colleagues (1) found that improvement in depression over time was fully
mediated by social anxiety symptoms, explaining 91% of session to session variation.
However, only 6% of the improvement in social anxiety symptoms was accounted for by
changes in depression, with depression being a partial mediator. These results suggest that
depressive symptoms co-occurring with social anxiety (also known as social phobia) may best
be conceptualized as a function of the social anxiety, rather than being mutually independent.
This interpretation would be congruent with related areas of research which find that most
anxiety disorders are primary in nature but increase the risk for secondary depression (2),
treating anxiety disorders may prevent the development of subsequent depression (3), and
among this comorbid population, interpersonal rejection may be a fundamental aspect of
depression symptoms (4).

Moscovitch and colleagues (1) are the first to report a unidirectional mediational relationship
between temporal changes in social anxiety and depressive symptoms and the first to utilize
hierarchical linear modeling statistical procedures (5) to examine this relationship. However,
it is unclear whether these results are specific to cognitive behavioral group therapy. The current
investigation was conducted to determine if this relationship is evident following
pharmacological treatment for social anxiety with paroxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake
inhibitor. While one could argue that the same pattern of mediational relationships should be
seen regardless of the treatment modality, it is relevant that Moscovitch and colleagues utilized
a form of group psychotherapy specific to the treatment of social anxiety only (i.e.,
psychotherapy did not target symptoms of depression). Paroxetine is an effective treatment for
both major depressive disorder and social anxiety, independently (6). It is plausible that
paroxetine would decrease both social anxiety and depressive symptoms without one symptom
type mediating changes in the other.

The present investigation also includes a placebo group. This is particularly important as many
individuals show improvement in psychiatric symptoms with placebo treatment or waitlist-
control (7,8), a point raised by Moscovitch and colleagues (1). Assessment of the mediational
relationships in question, with placebo treatment, will help determine if this phenomenon is
fundamental to amelioration of social anxiety symptoms, regardless of treatment type, or
specific to a particular modality of treatment.

METHODS

The present investigation is a secondary analysis of a clinical trial of paroxetine in the treatment
of social anxiety among individuals with a co-occurring alcohol use disorder (9). The study
was approved by the hospital’s Humans Subjects Review Committee and subjects participated
with informed, voluntary, written consent. Complete participant inclusion/exclusion criteria
and greater detail on procedures can be found in that article. For brevity, only methodological
information relevant to the current investigation is included. All participants in the current
investigation met diagnostic criteria for an alcohol use disorder (alcohol abuse or dependence)

in addition to social anxiety, a distinct difference from the sample utilized by Moscovitch and
colleagues (1).

Participants

Procedures

Participants were randomized to either placebo (n = 22) or paroxetine group (n = 20).
Participants in the paroxetine and placebo groups did not statistically differ in age [M = 25
(SD = 6.5), 30 (SD = 8.3)], gender (Male = 55%, 50%), ethnicity (Caucasian = 100%, 82%),
or proportion of current DSM-IV major depressive disorder (N = 2, 2), respectively.

Participants were recruited through community advertisement for an investigation of
pharmacological treatment of social anxiety. These advertisements did not mention the
inclusion requirement of an alcohol use disorder, and none of the participants were seeking
treatment for an alcohol problem. Participants were initially screened by telephone, and those
likely meeting criteria for both social anxiety disorder and an alcohol use disorder were invited
to a comprehensive in-person screening. Diagnoses of social anxiety and alcohol use disorders
were completed with the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV-TR (10), and additional
inclusion/exclusion criteria were assessed.

Eligible participants were then enrolled in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of
paroxetine. Treatment was provided for 16 weeks. Initial dosage of paroxetine was 10 mg and
was titrated to a maximum of 60 mg at 4 weeks. Participants were assessed weekly for
compliance using pill-count and biomarkers and completed assessments of functioning
(psychological and medical).

Participants were compensated $50.00 for participation at week 16. Of particular relevance to
the current investigation, every week participants completed the Beck Depression Inventory
(BDI) (11) to assess severity of depressive symptoms, and the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale
(LSAS) (12) to assess severity of social anxiety symptoms. The BDI (11) is a 21-item self-
report measure, is widely used in both research and for clinical purposes, and has demonstrated
good psychometric properties (13,14). Scores range from 0 to 63. The LSAS is a
psychometrically-validated, standardized questionnaire widely used in research studies to
quantify social anxiety severity and treatment response (12). The LSAS total score ranges from
0 to 144. Inclusion criteria included a baseline total score of at least 60 on the LSAS.

Statistical Analyses

The Baron and Kenny (1986) method of testing mediation has been adapted for multilevel
analyses (15–18).1 Similar to Moscovitch and colleagues (1), this adapted mediation test was
applied to examine whether changes in depression were mediated by changes in social anxiety.
Consistently, the reverse was examined, assessing whether changes in social anxiety were
mediated by changes in depression. The predictor variable in the current investigation was time
(temporal fluctuation across weeks). Mediation was assessed separately for each group
(paroxetine and placebo). Thus, four multilevel mediation analyses were conducted, depression

1Kenny, Korchmaros, and Bolger (17) described the analysis of Level 1 mediation in a hierarchical model and pointed out that the Sobel
test of the significance of the indirect path (e.g., time to BDI to LSAS) required the covariance of the two regression coefficients. More
recently, Bauer et al. (15) detailed a method of obtaining the covariance by simultaneous estimation of the entire model via “stacking the
data set” and indicating (with dummy-coded indicator variable) which variable (i.e., mediator or final dependent variable) was the
dependent variable for each row in the data set. Their method was employed in the current investigation’s analyses. Thus, the strength
of the indirect (mediator) path was assessed by using a Sobel test (24) as well as by calculating percent variance accounted for by the
mediational path (17), taking into account the amount of covariance between paths a and b (15). Essentially, the percentage of variance
accounted for by the mediational path is calculated by: ((ab + c′ + covariance of a and b)-c′)/(ab + c′ + covariance of a and b)).

mediating social anxiety and social anxiety mediating depression, for the paroxetine and
placebo groups separately, with time as the predictor for all analyses.

Data were analyzed as a multi-level or hierarchical linear model (HLM) in which the repeated
observations are nested within subjects. Conceptually, HLM models can be thought of as two
simultaneous regressions: Level 1 and Level 2. Level 1 variables change with individual
observations across time (e.g. week, BDI, LSAS). Level 2 variables distinguish between
subjects but remain constant across observations (e.g. treatment group, gender, etc). The
coefficients at Level 1 (e.g. BDI as a function of week) are the dependent variables of the Level
2 regression (e.g. treatment group). In this analysis the Level 2 regression was simply an
intercept, as the treatment groups were analyzed separately.

Four multilevel mediational analyses were conducted. The first set of analyses examined
whether changes in social anxiety accounted for changes in depression over time. The second
set of analyses examined whether changes in depression accounted for changes in social anxiety
over time. Statistical tests are shown in tables; mediational relationships (B values for each
path) are shown in figures. Within each figure, circled B values reflect results from the
paroxetine group; non-circled values reflect the placebo group.

RESULTS

Participants

Participants in the paroxetine and placebo groups did not differ in severity of social anxiety
symptoms [LSAS M = 87 (SD = 14.9), 93 (SD = 18.5)] or severity of depressive symptoms at
baseline [BDI M = 17 (SD = 10.3), 17 (SD = 11.0)]. ANOVA analyses testing differences in
baseline level of LSAS score and BDI score, by treatment group, were non-significant [F (1,
41) = 1.13, p >.05; F (1, 41) =.01, p >.05; respectively].

Analyses of Time on Depression and Social Anxiety

A hierarchical linear model, with slopes as outcome, was conducted to determine changes in
depression (BDI) and social anxiety (LSAS) over time. These relationships constitute paths c
and a for all subsequent analyses. Level 1 in these analyses was BDI or LSAS predicted by
time (temporal fluctuation across weeks). Subjects were nested within treatment group
(paroxetine or placebo), a level 2 variable.

For depression severity, participants in both treatment groups significantly improved over time
(paroxetine group: B = −.38, p=.001; placebo group B=−.32, p=.021). For social anxiety
severity, the paroxetine group showed significant reductions over time (B= −2.45, p=.001);
this slope reached a trend level (B= −2.10, p=.053) for the placebo group. Although significance
in paths c and a are a pre-requisite for conducting a mediational analysis (Baron and Kenny,
1986), because the p value was so close to reaching significance for the placebo group in this
case, analyses were continued for the placebo group to permit comparison with the paroxetine
group.

Social Anxiety Mediates Depression Severity—Analyses to examine whether changes
in depression severity (BDI scores) were mediated by changes in social anxiety severity (LSAS
scores) were conducted (see Figure 2 and Table 1). Two sets of analyses were performed, one
for each treatment group (paroxetine and placebo). As reported above, both treatment groups
decreased in depression over time (path c in this model), and both treatment groups showed at
least a trend level decrease in social anxiety over time (path a in this model).

LSAS scores were predictive of depression scores (path b) for both treatment groups (p’s <.
01), reflecting that social anxiety and depression severity covaried within participants over
time. When controlling for the effect of social anxiety, however, time was no longer a
significant predictor of depression scores (i.e., path c′ was no longer significant for either the
paroxetine or the placebo group). Sobel’s test indicated that the indirect effect of LSAS on the
relationship between time and BDI was significant for both the paroxetine group (p<.001) and
the placebo group (p<.05). Social anxiety severity mediated 96% and 76% of the variance of
time on depression severity for the paroxetine and placebo groups, respectively.

Taken together, the results indicate that social anxiety severity was a full mediator of the
relationship between time and depression severity. The results were similar regardless of
whether participants received paroxetine or placebo.

Depression Mediates Social Anxiety Severity—Analyses to examine whether changes
in social anxiety severity were mediated by changes in depression were then conducted to
determine whether reverse mediation was present (see Figure 3 and Table 2). Analyses were
conducted separately for paroxetine and placebo groups. For this model, path c reflects whether
treatment groups decreased over time in LSAS scores. As reported above, this slope was
significant for the paroxetine-treated group and approached significance (p=.053) for the
placebo group. Both the paroxetine and the placebo group significantly decreased in depression
scores over time (path a).

Depression severity scores were predictive of social anxiety scores (path b) for both treatment
groups. When controlling for the effect of depression, time remained a significant predictor of
LSAS score for both the paroxetine and placebo groups (path c′), though the strength of this
relationship was diminished. Sobel’s test indicated that the indirect effect of BDI on the
relationship between time and LSAS scores was significant only for the paroxetine-treated
group (p<.01); it reached a trend level (p=.08) for the placebo group. In the paroxetine group,
depression severity mediated 23% of the variance of time on social anxiety severity.

Taken together, the results indicate that depression severity was a partial mediator of the
relationship between time and social anxiety severity. The results were similar regardless of
treatment group.

DISCUSSION

Results from the present investigation indicate that variation in depression is tightly coupled
with session to session variation in social anxiety. Further, the results strongly suggest that
changes in depression are driven by changes in social anxiety (i.e., depression variation is
“mediated” by social anxiety). Results also suggest that change in social anxiety is only
partially mediated by changes in depression symptoms. These results extend upon the study
by Moscovitch and colleagues (1) in which they (1)investigated mediational relationships
between depression and anxiety during a course of cognitive behavioral group therapy for
social anxiety. Our results are consistent with theirs, which is notable in that we examined these
relationships in participants receiving a medication approved to treat social anxiety and
depression, as well as in participants who received placebo.

Results of the current investigation suggest that improvement in depression severity is driven
by improvement in social anxiety severity. Paroxetine and other selective serotonin reuptake
inhibitors (SSRI) have been shown to be effective in the treatment of both major depressive
disorder and social anxiety independently (6). Given the independent efficacy of paroxetine,
one might assume that ameliorations of depressive and anxiety symptoms might be positively
correlated, but not have a mediational relationship, when treated pharmacologically.

Moscovitch and colleagues (1) suggested that amelioration of depression symptoms during
social anxiety treatment may be the result of increased social interaction, subsequent to a
reduction in social anxiety. However, the psychotherapy treatment utilized targeted social
anxiety specifically, while paroxetine influences both depression and social anxiety, and yet a
mediational pattern is still maintained.

The placebo control group demonstrated improvements in both depression and social anxiety
symptoms, although not at the magnitude seen in the paroxetine group. This is not uncommon,
as it is well known that placebo medication can contribute to improvement in many medical
and psychological symptoms (19), and more specifically, for social anxiety (7,20,21), and
depression (8). Of particular interest in the current investigation, the placebo group
demonstrated a mediational pattern consistent with that observed in the paroxetine group.
Specifically, in the placebo group, social anxiety symptoms fully mediated depression
symptoms, accounting for 76% of the variance in the effect of placebo on depression scores.
In the test of reverse mediation, consistent with the paroxetine group, depression symptoms
were a significant partial mediator, accounting for about 33% of the variance in the effect of
placebo on social anxiety. This seems to suggest that among patients presenting with primary
social anxiety, depression symptoms will be ameliorated regardless of treatment type, as long
as the treatment is effective in reducing social anxiety severity. It should be noted, however,
that the relationship between placebo and time was at an alpha of .053, and the decrease in
relationship between these variables, when accounting for the mediator, was at the trend level
(p =.08).

The current investigation was consistent with Moscovitch and colleagues (2005), which is
remarkable given that the three treatment modalities examined exert their effect through
different pathways (e.g., challenging dysfunctional cognitions vs. increased availability of
serotonin vs. the “hope” of pharmacologic treatment). This makes it tempting to speculate that
the observed relationships are fundamental to the specific form of psychopathology (i.e., social
anxiety). Supporting this speculation, interpersonal rejection sensitivity is particularly
prevalent in the diagnostic assessment of depression among this comorbid population,
suggesting overlap with social anxiety (4). On the other hand, studies have shown that
depression symptoms decrease following treatment of other anxiety disorders as well. For
example, treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder (22) and generalized anxiety disorder
(23) both result in reductions in depression. However, for these studies and others it is unknown
whether improving the anxiety disorder drives the reduction in depression, or whether this
phenomenon is specific to social anxiety disorder. The answer could have significant treatment
implications.

It is important to note that in the current investigation, few participants met diagnostic criteria
for major depressive disorder (2% of each group). While one might speculate a different pattern
of mediational relationships among individuals with dual diagnoses versus subclinical
depression, this does not appear to be the case. Moscovitch and colleagues (1) partialled their
sample into two groups: those meeting dual diagnoses (clinical mood disorder and clinical
social anxiety) and those with clinical social anxiety and subclinical symptoms of depression.
The same pattern of mediational relationships was indicated for both groups, regardless of
clinical status of depression.

There are some notable limitations of the current investigation. Specifically, the current
investigation was a secondary analysis of a clinical trial which was not specifically designed
to examine the question at hand. Further, for the population in the current study, social anxiety
disorder was a primary diagnosis; however, all patients also met diagnostic criteria for a
comorbid alcohol use disorder. Given that the current investigation successfully replicated
findings of a similar study (1), it seems unlikely that the comorbid alcohol use disorder

substantially influenced the mediational relationship between social anxiety and depression
symptoms. Additionally, all participants explicitly sought treatment for social anxiety disorder
rather than an alcohol use disorder. Thus, use of the current population for investigation of the
mediational relationship between social anxiety and depression seems justifiable. However,
because all were treatment-seeking for social anxiety, it cannot be assumed that results would
generalize to populations seeking treatment for depression.

In sum, the current investigation replicated previous findings of social anxiety symptoms fully
mediating, and accounting for the vast majority of variation of, secondary depression symptoms
during the treatment of social anxiety. The current study extends upon previous research by
documenting the same phenomenon while using a different treatment modality,
pharmacological treatment (paroxetine), as well as placebo. The fact that results agreed across
three treatment modalities (psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy, placebo) suggest a fundamental
relationship between social anxiety and depression in subjects seeking treatment for social
anxiety – that is, successfully reducing severity of the former will likely improve the latter.
Future research should be conducted to examine the mediational relationships between other
comorbid primary and secondary mental health disorders. Current treatments may prove even
more effective through a better understanding of the relationships between comorbid
psychiatric disorders and symptoms.
