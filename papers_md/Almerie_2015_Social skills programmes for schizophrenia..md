Background

A B S T R A C T

Social skills programmes (SSP) are treatment strategies aimed at enhancing the social performance and reducing the distress and difficulty
experienced by people with a diagnosis of schizophrenia and can be incorporated as part of the rehabilitation package for people with
schizophrenia.

Objectives

The  primary  objective  is  to  investigate  the  effects  of  social  skills  training  programmes,  compared  to  standard  care,  for  people  with
schizophrenia.

Search methods

We searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group’s Trials Register (November 2006 and December 2011) which is based on regular searches
of CINAHL, BIOSIS, AMED, EMBASE, PubMed, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and registries of clinical trials. We inspected references of all identified
studies for further trials.

A further search for studies has been conducted by the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group in 2015, 37 citations have been found and are
currently being assessed by review authors.

Selection criteria

We  included  all  relevant  randomised  controlled  trials  for  social  skills  programmes  versus  standard  care  involving  people  with  serious
mental illnesses.

Data collection and analysis

We  extracted  data  independently.  For  dichotomous  data  we  calculated  risk  ratios  (RRs)  and  their  95%  confidence  intervals  (CI)  on  an
intention-to-treat basis. For continuous data, we calculated mean differences (MD) and 95% CIs.

Main results

We included 13 randomised trials (975 participants). These evaluated social skills programmes versus standard care, or discussion group.
We found evidence in favour of social skills programmes compared to standard care on all measures of social functioning. We also found
that rates of relapse and rehospitalisation were lower for social skills compared to standard care (relapse: 2 RCTs, n = 263, RR 0.52 CI 0.34 to
0.79, very low quality evidence), (rehospitalisation: 1 RCT, n = 143, RR 0.53 CI 0.30 to 0.93, very low quality evidence) and participants’ mental

state results (1 RCT, n = 91, MD -4.01 CI -7.52 to -0.50, very low quality evidence) were better in the group receiving social skill programmes.
Global state was measured in one trial by numbers not experiencing a clinical improvement, results favoured social skills (1 RCT, n = 67,
RR 0.29 CI 0.12 to 0.68, very low quality evidence). Quality of life was also improved in the social skills programme compared to standard
care (1 RCT, n = 112, MD -7.60 CI -12.18 to -3.02, very low quality evidence). However, when social skills programmes were compared to a
discussion group control, we found no significant differences in the participants social functioning, relapse rates, mental state or quality
of life, again the quality of evidence for these outcomes was very low.

Authors' conclusions

Compared to standard care, social skills training may improve the social skills of people with schizophrenia and reduce relapse rates, but
at present, the evidence is very limited with data rated as very low quality. When social skills training was compared to discussion there
was no difference on patients outcomes. Cultural differences might limit the applicability of the current results, as most reported studies
were conducted in China. Whether social skills training can improve social functioning of people with schizophrenia in different settings
remains unclear and should be investigated in a large multi-centre randomised controlled trial.

Social skills programmes for people with schizophrenia

Social  skills  programmes  (SSP)  use  behavioural  therapy  and  techniques  for  teaching  individuals  to  communicate  their  emotions  and
requests. This means they are more likely to achieve their goals, meet their needs for relationships and for independent living as well as
getting on with other people and socially adjusting. Social skills programmes involve 'model learning' (role playing) which was introduced
to improve general 'molecular' skills (eye contact, fluency of speech, gestures) and 'molar' skills (managing negative emotions, giving
positive feedback). Social skills programmes enhance social performance and reduce the distress and difficulty experienced by people
with schizophrenia. Social skills programmes can be incorporated as part of a rehabilitation package for people with schizophrenia.

The main objective of this review is to investigate the effectiveness of social skills programmes, compared to standard care or discussion
groups, for people with schizophrenia. Based on searches carried out in 2006 and 2011, this review includes 13 trials with a total of 975
participants. Authors chose seven main outcomes of interest, all data for these outcomes were rated to be very low quality. The review
found significant differences in favour of social skills programmes compared to standard care on all measures of social functioning. Rates
of relapse were lower for social skills compared to standard care and there was a significant difference in favour of social skills on people’s
mental state. Quality of life was also improved in the social skills programme compared to standard care. However, when social skills
programmes were compared to discussion groups, there were no significant differences in people’s social functioning, relapse rates, mental
state or quality of life.

Compared to standard care, social skills programmes may improve the social skills of people with schizophrenia and reduce relapse rates.
However, at the moment evidence is very limited with data only of very low quality available. Cultural differences might also limit the
relevance of current results, as most reported studies were conducted in China. Whether social skills programmes or training can improve
the social functioning of people with schizophrenia in different settings remains unclear and should be further investigated in a large multi-
centre randomised controlled trial.

GRADE Working Group grades of evidence
High quality: Further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect.
Moderate quality: Further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate.
Low quality: Further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate.
Very low quality: We are very uncertain about the estimate.

1 Risk of bias: very serious. Only one of the trials had adequate sequence generation. Allocation concealment was unclear in all trials and none were blinded. Two trials addressed
incomplete data adequately and three were free from selective reporting. It was unclear in all trials whether they were free from other biases.
2 Inconsistency: serious. See comment.
3 Imprecision: very serious. Data were not combined, but for each single study the 95% confidence intervals around the pooled effect estimate are very wide.
4 Publication bias: strongly suspected. Less than five studies provided data for this outcome.
5 Risk of bias: very serious. The RCT that provided data for this outcome did not have adequate sequence generation, allocation concealment and blinding. It was unclear whether
there were other biases.
6 Risk of bias: very serious. Neither of the two RCTs were blinded, and it was unclear in both if there was adequate allocation concealment. Only one had adequate sequence
generation and one addressed incomplete data adequately. It was unclear in both if they were free from other biases.
7 Inconsistency: serious. There was moderate heterogeneity for this outcome. This may be explained by differences in type of social skills training. Ma 2003 included sessions on
medication and symptom management as well as social skills, whereas in Saren 2004 the focus was on interpersonal interaction.
8 Risk of bias: very serious. The RCT that provided data for this outcome had unclear allocation concealment and was not blinded. It was unclear if it was free from other biases.

Description of the condition

Schizophrenia  can  occur  as  a  single  episode  of  illness.  By  far
the  greater  proportion  of  sufferers,  however,  have  remission  and
relapses;  for  up  to  41%  of  those  who  develop  schizophrenia
it  becomes  a  chronic  and  often  disabling  illness  (Prudo  1987).
Antipsychotic medications are commonly used for management of
symptoms.  However,  the  conclusions  reached  by  meta-analytical
methods  are  that  treatment  with  antipsychotic  medication
'should  be  combined  and  coordinated  with  other  interventions
involving  the  patient's  family,  and  social  psychological  and
psychotherapeutic  support'  (MSPI  1997).  These  treatments  are
subsumed under the general term 'rehabilitation'.

Preceding  the  movement  of  care  into  the  community,  the
rehabilitation process was mostly provided by the large psychiatric
hospitals  in  which  sufferers  often  spent  many  years  (Wing  1961;
Wing  1970).  This  pattern  of  care  has  now  changed  (Hume
1995).  During  the  1980s  many  psychiatric  hospitals  were  closed,
community-based services were developed, and psychiatric units
in  general  hospitals  were  established.  Currently,  few  chronically
mentally  ill  people  spend  longer  than  a  few  weeks  per  year  in
hospital.  The  rest  of  their  care  takes  place  in  the  community.  Up
to 75% of people with chronic schizophrenia are maintained in the
community in the United Kingdom - chronic in this case is defined
as  lasting  more  than  2.5  years  (Davies  1990).  Relative  to  other
chronic illnesses, the personal and economic costs of schizophrenia
are  considerable  (Knapp  1994).  It  is  therefore  important  to  offer
rehabilitation treatments that are both clinically effective and cost-
effective.

Description of the intervention

As  a  part  of  the  rehabilitation  package 
for  people  with
schizophrenia,  social  skills  programmes  (SSP)  aim  to  utilise
behaviour  therapy  principles  and  techniques 
for  teaching
individuals to communicate their emotions and requests, so they
are  more  likely  to  achieve  their  goals  and  meet  their  needs  for
relationships and roles required for independent living and social
competence (Kopelowicz 2006).

SSP involves 'model learning' (role playing) which was introduced
to  improve  general  'molecular'  skills  (eye  contact,  fluency  of
speech,  gestures,  etc)  and  'molar'  skills  (managing  negative
affects, giving positive feedback, etc.) (Brenner 1994). A problem-
solving  model  was  later  incorporated  and  rehabilitation  topics
that  are  particularly  relevant  for  people  with  schizophrenia  were
introduced  (Liberman  1993).  The  application  of  these  modules
appears far more effective than control conditions, particularly in
terms  of  generalisation  of  skills  and  social  adjustment  (Marder
1996; Wallace 1998).

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

motivate participants to implement these communications in real-
life situations.

Why it is important to do this review

This review focuses on social skills programmes, which are some
of the most established psychosocial treatments for schizophrenia
(Liberman 1986; Liberman 1986a) but vary in use across the world.
Essentially,  social  skills  programmes  are  treatment  strategies
aimed  at  enhancing  the  social  performance  and  reducing  the
distress  and  difficulty  experienced  by  people  with  a  diagnosis  of
schizophrenia. Few reviews exist (Kopelowicz 2006) and none are
maintained.

Criteria for considering studies for this review

Types of studies

All  relevant  randomised  controlled  trials.  If  a  trial  had  been
described as 'double blind' but implied randomisation, we planned
to include such trials in a sensitivity analysis. If their inclusion did
not result in a substantive difference, they would have remained in
the analyses. If their inclusion did result in statistically significant
differences, we would not have added the data from these lower
quality  studies  to  the  results  of  the  better  trials,  but  presented
such  data  within  a  subcategory.  We  excluded  quasi-randomised
studies,  such  as  those  allocating  by  alternate  days  of  the  week.
Where  people  were  given  additional  treatments  within  a  social
skills  trial,  we  only  included  data  if  the  adjunct  treatment  was
evenly distributed between groups and it was only the social skills
programme that was randomised.

Types of participants

Adults, however defined, with schizophrenia or related disorders,
including schizophreniform disorder, schizoaffective disorder and
delusional disorder, again, by any means of diagnosis.

We were interested in making sure that information is as relevant
to  the  current  care  of  people  with  schizophrenia  as  possible  so
proposed  to  clearly  highlight  the  current  clinical  state  (acute,
early  post-acute,  partial  remission,  remission)  as  well  as  the
stage (prodromal, first episode, early illness, persistent) and as to
whether  the  studies  primarily  focused  on  people  with  particular
problems  (for  example,  negative  symptoms,  treatment-resistant
illnesses).

Types of interventions

How the intervention might work

1. Social skills training programmes

include 

in  SSP 

Learning-based  procedures  used 
identifying
the  problems  and  setting  the  goals  in  collaboration  with  the
client.  Through  role  play  or  behavioural  rehearsal,  participants
demonstrate the required skills and positive or corrective feedback
is given to them accordingly. By social modelling and behavioural
practice,  participants  observe  and  repeat  the  skills  until  the
communications reach a level of quality tantamount to success in
the  real-life  situation.  Homework  assignments  are  then  given  to

Defined  as  any  structured  psychosocial  intervention,  whether
group  or  individual,  aimed  at  enhancing  the  social  performance
and  reducing  the  distress  and  difficulty  in  social  situations.  The
key components are; i. a careful behavioural-based assessment of
a range of social and interpersonal skills; ii. An importance placed
on  both  verbal  and  non-verbal  communication;  as  well  as  the
individual's ability to; i. perceive and process relevant social cues;
and ii. to respond to and provide appropriate social reinforcement.

This approach has the goal of building up individual behavioural
elements  into  complex  behaviours.  The  aim  is  to  develop  more
effective  social  communication.  There  is  considerable  emphasis
not  just  on  clinic-based  interventions  (including  modelling,  role-
play  and  social  reinforcement)  but  also  the  setting  of  homework
tasks and the applicability of the treatment.

Programmes where social skills training are a component part of a
more complex rehabilitation intervention were excluded, as were
token economies, life skills programmes and other similar milieu-
based interventions which may include an element of social skills
training in a broader programme.

Programmes of five sessions and less are considered as 'brief ', and
six or more as 'long'. Place of residence is defined as either 'hospital'
or  'community'  for  the  purposes  of  this  review.  For  example,  if
people  are  in  hospital  at  time  of  attending  a  day-hospital  based
programme  they  are  considered  to  be  receiving  'hospital-based'
care.  If,  on  the  other  hand,  they  attend  the  day  hospital  from
home then they are considered to be receiving' community-based'
care. Trained staff are those personnel who hold a professionally
recognised health care qualification.

2. The control treatment

Defined  as  standard  care  without  a  dedicated  programme  of  the
type described above.

Types of outcome measures

If  possible  we  divided  outcomes  into  short  term  (less  than  six
months), medium term (seven to 12 months) and long term (over
one year).

Search methods for identification of studies

Electronic searches

1. Cochrane Schizophrenia Group’s Trials Register

The  Trials  Search  Co-ordinator  (TSC)  searched  the  Cochrane
Schizophrenia  Group’s  Register  of  Trials 
(November  2006,
December 21, 2011) using the following search strategy:

((*social* OR *personal*) AND (*skill* OR *program* OR *training*))
in  Title,  Abstract  and  Indexing  Terms  Fields  of  REFERENCE
and  (*social  skill*  OR  *social  support*  OR  *sociotherapy*  OR
*socioenvironmental* OR *interpersonal*) in Intervention Field of
STUDY

The Cochrane Schizophrenia Group’s Register of Trials is compiled
by systematic searches of major resources (including AMED, BIOSIS,
CINAHL,  EMBASE,  MEDLINE,  PsycINFO,  PubMed,  and  registries  of
clinical  trials)  and  their  monthly  updates,  handsearches,  grey
literature, and conference proceedings (see Group Module). There
is  no  language,  date,  document  type,  or  publication  status
limitations for inclusion of records into the register.

Searching other resources

1. Reference searching

We inspected references of all identified studies for further relevant
studies.

2. Personal contact

We contacted the first author of each included study for information
regarding unpublished trials.

relevant  abstracts.  A  random  20%  sample  was  independently
re-inspected  by  Muhammad  Qutayba  Almerie  (MQA)  to  ensure
reliability.  Where  disputes  arose,  the  full  report  was  acquired  for
more  detailed  scrutiny.  Full  reports  of  the  abstracts  meeting  the
review criteria were obtained and inspected by MOA and MS. Again,
a  random  20%  of  reports  were  re-inspected  by  MQA  in  order  to
ensure reliable selection.

For  the  June  2010  search,  review  authors  Nicola  Maaya  (NM)
and Hanna Bergman (HB) independently inspected citations, and
identified and inspected relevant abstracts. A random 20% sample
was  independently  re-inspected  by  Karla  Soares  Weiser  (KSW)  to
ensure reliability. Full reports were obtained and inspected by NM
and HB and a random 20% of reports were re-inspected by KSW.
Where it was not possible to resolve disagreement by discussion,
we attempted to contact the authors of the study for clarification.

Data extraction and management

1. Extraction

For  the  November  2006  search,  review  authors  MOA,  MA  and  MJ
extracted  data  from  included  studies.  Where  further  clarification
was  needed,  the  authors'  of  trials  were  contacted  to  provide
missing data. Any disagreements were discussed and the decisions
documented.

For  the  June  2012  search,  review  author  NM  extracted  data
from  all  included  studies.  In  addition,  to  ensure  reliability,  HB
independently  extracted  data  from  a  random  sample  of  these
studies,  comprising  10%  of  the  total.  Again,  any  disagreement
was  discussed,  decisions  documented  and,  if  necessary,  authors
of  studies  were  contacted  for  clarification.  With  remaining
problems  KSW  helped  clarify  issues  and  these  final  decisions
were  documented.  Data  presented  only  in  graphs  and  figures
were extracted whenever possible, but included only if two review
authors independently had the same result. Attempts were made
to  contact  authors  through  an  open-ended  request  in  order  to
obtain missing information or for clarification whenever necessary.
If  studies  were  multi-centre,  where  possible,  we  extracted  data
relevant to each component centre separately. The data from the
Chinese  papers  were  extracted  by  a  speaker  of  that  language
(JX); but these Chinese language studies were not re-inspected by
review authors.

2. Management

2.1 Forms

Data were extracted onto standard, simple forms.

2.2 Scale-derived data

We included continuous data from rating scales only if:
a. the psychometric properties of the measuring instrument have
been described in a peer-reviewed journal (Marshall 2000); and
b. the measuring instrument had not been written or modified by
one of the trialists for that particular trial.

Ideally, the measuring instrument should either be i. a self-report or
ii. completed by an independent rater or relative (not the therapist).
We realise that this is not often reported clearly, in Description of
studies we have noted if this is the case or not.

2.3 Endpoint versus change data

Assessment of risk of bias in included studies

There are advantages of both endpoint and change data. Change
data can remove a component of between-person variability from
the analysis. On the other hand, calculation of change needs two
assessments  (baseline  and  endpoint),  which  can  be  difficult  in
unstable and difficult to measure conditions such as schizophrenia.
We decided primarily to use endpoint data, and only use change
data  if  the  former  were  not  available.  Endpoint  and  change  data
were  combined  in  the  analysis  as  we  used  mean  differences
(MD) rather than standardised mean differences (SMD) throughout
(Higgins 2009, Chapter 9.4.5.2 ).

2.4 Skewed data

Continuous  data  on  clinical  and  social  outcomes  are  often  not
normally  distributed.  To  avoid  the  pitfall  of  applying  parametric
tests  to  non-parametric  data,  we  aimed  to  apply  the  following
standards to all data before inclusion: a) standard deviations SDs)
and  means  were  reported  in  the  paper  or  obtainable  from  the
authors;  b)  when  a  scale  starts  from  the  finite  number  zero,  the
SD,  when  multiplied  by  two,  is  less  than  the  mean  (as  otherwise
the mean is unlikely to be an appropriate measure of the centre of
the distribution, (Altman 1996); c) if a scale started from a positive
value (such as the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS,
Kay 1986), which can have values from 30 to 210), the calculation
described above was modified to take the scale starting point into
account. In these cases skew is present if 2 SD > (S-S min), where S is
the mean score and S min is the minimum score. Endpoint scores on
scales often have a finite start and end point and these rules can be
applied; however, we did not find any skewed endpoint data. When
continuous data are presented on a scale that includes a possibility
of negative values (such as change data), it is difficult to tell whether
data are skewed or not. Skewed data from studies of less than 200
participants would have been entered as other data within the data
and analyses section rather than into a statistical analysis. Skewed
data pose less of a problem when looking at means if the sample
size is large and would have been entered into statistical syntheses.

2.5 Common measure

To facilitate comparison between trials, if necessary we converted
variables that can be reported in different metrics, such as days in
hospital (mean days per year, per week or per month) to a common
metric (e.g. mean days per month).

2.6 Conversion of continuous to binary

Where possible, efforts were made to convert outcome measures
to dichotomous data. This was done by identifying cut-off points
on rating scales and dividing participants accordingly into 'clinically
improved' or 'not clinically improved'. It is generally assumed that
if there is a 50% reduction in a scale-derived score such as the Brief
Psychiatric  Rating  Scale  (BPRS,  Overall  1962)  or  the  PANSS  (Kay
1986),  this  can  be  considered  as  a  clinically  significant  response
(Leucht 2005; Leucht 2005a). If data based on these thresholds were
not available, we used the primary cut-off presented by the original
authors.

2.7 Direction of graphs

Where possible, we entered data in such a way that the area to the
left of the line of no effect indicates a favourable outcome for social
skills training.

Again review authors NM and HB worked independently to assess
risk of bias by using criteria described in the Cochrane Handbook
for  Systematic  Reviews  of  Interventions  (Higgins  2009)  to  assess
trial quality. This set of criteria is based on evidence of associations
between overestimate of effect and high risk of bias of the article
such  as  sequence  generation,  allocation  concealment,  blinding,
incomplete outcome data and selective reporting.

If the raters disagreed, the final rating was made by consensus, with
the  involvement  of  another  member  of  the  review  group.  Where
inadequate  details  of  randomisation  and  other  characteristics  of
trials were provided, we contacted authors of the studies in order to
obtain further information. Non-concurrence in quality assessment
was reported, but if disputes arose as to which category a trial is to
be allocated, again, resolution was made by discussion.

The level of risk of bias is noted in both the text of the review and
in the Summary of findings for the main comparison and Summary
of findings 2.

Measures of treatment effect

1. Binary data

For  binary  outcomes  we  calculated  a  standard  estimation  of  the
risk  ratio  (RR)  and  its  95%  confidence  interval  (CI).  It  has  been
shown  that  RR  is  more  intuitive  (Boissel  1999)  than  odds  ratios
and  that  odds  ratios  tend  to  be  interpreted  as  RR  by  clinicians
(Deeks 2000). For statistically significant results we had planned to
calculate the number needed to treat to provide benefit /to induce
harm statistic (NNTB/H), and its 95% confidence interval (CI) using
Visual Rx (http://www.nntonline.net/) taking account of the event
rate in the control group. This, however, has been superseded by
Summary  of  findings  for  the  main  comparison  and  Summary  of
findings 2, and the calculations therein.

2. Continuous data

For continuous outcomes we estimated the mean difference (MD)
between groups. We preferred not to calculate effect size measures
(standardised  mean  difference  (SMD)).  However,  if  scales  of  very
considerable similarity were used, we presumed there was a small
difference  in  measurement,  and  we  calculated  effect  size  and
transformed  the  effect  back  to  the  units  of  one  or  more  of  the
specific instruments.

Unit of analysis issues

1. Cluster trials

Studies  increasingly  employ  'cluster  randomisation'  (such  as
randomisation by clinician or practice) but analysis and pooling of
clustered data poses problems. Firstly, authors often fail to account
for  intra-class  correlation  in  clustered  studies,  leading  to  a  'unit
of  analysis'  error  (Divine  1992)  whereby  P  values  are  spuriously
low, confidence intervals unduly narrow and statistical significance
overestimated.  This  causes  type  I  errors  (Bland  1997;  Gulliford
1999).

We did not have any data from cluster trials. Had there been data
from these types of trials, and where clustering was not accounted
for  in  primary  studies,  we  would  have  presented  data  in  a  table,
with  a  (*)  symbol  to  indicate  the  presence  of  a  probable  unit
of  analysis  error  and  contacted  first  authors  of  studies  to  obtain

intra-class  correlation  coefficients  (ICCs)  for  their  clustered  data
and adjusted for this by using accepted methods (Gulliford 1999).
If  clustering  had  been  incorporated  into  the  analysis  of  primary
studies,  we  would  have  presented  these  data  as  if  from  a  non-
cluster randomised study, but adjusted the data for the clustering
effect.

We have sought statistical advice and have been advised that the
binary data as presented in a report should be divided by a 'design
effect'. This is calculated using the mean number of participants per
cluster (m) and the ICC [Design effect = 1 + (m-1)*ICC] (Donner 2002).
If the ICChad not been reported, it would have been assumed to be
0.1 (Ukoumunne 1999).

If  cluster  studies  have  been  appropriately  analysed  taking  into
account ICCs and relevant data documented in the report, synthesis
with  other  studies  would  have  been  possible  using  the  generic
inverse variance technique.

2. Cross-over trials

A major concern of cross-over trials is the carry-over effect. It occurs
if an effect (e.g. pharmacological, physiological or psychological) of
the treatment in the first phase is carried over to the second phase.
As a consequence, on entry to the second phase the participants
can differ systematically from their initial state despite a wash-out
phase. For the same reason cross-over trials are not appropriate if
the condition of interest is unstable (Elbourne 2002). As both effects
are very likely in severe mental illness, we would have only used
data of the first phase of cross-over studies.

3. Studies with multiple treatment groups

Where a study involved more than two treatment arms, if relevant,
the additional treatment arms were presented in comparisons. If
data  were  binary  these  were  simply  added  and  combined  within
the two-by-two table. If data were continuous we combined data
following  the  formula  in  section  7.7.3.8  (Combining  groups)  of
the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions.
Where the additional treatment arms were not relevant, these data
were not reproduced.

Dealing with missing data

1. Overall loss of credibility

At some degree of loss of follow-up, data must lose credibility (Xia
2009). We chose that, for any particular outcome, should more than
50%  of  data  be  unaccounted  for,  we  would  not  reproduce  these
data or use them within analyses. If, however, more than 50% of
those in one arm of a study were lost, but the total loss was less than
50%, we addressed this within the 'Summary of findings' table/s by
down-rating quality. Finally, we also downgraded quality within the
'Summary of findings' table/s where loss was 25% to 50% in total.

2. Binary

In the case where attrition for a binary outcome was between 0%
and 50%, we presented data for the total number of participants
randomised  for  studies  that  used  an  intention-to-treat  (ITT)
analysis; where studies did not use an ITT analysis, we presented
completer-only data.

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

3. Continuous

3.1 Attrition

In  the  case  where  attrition  for  a  continuous  outcome  was
between 0% and 50% and completer-only data were reported, we
reproduced these.

3.2 Standard deviations

If  standard  deviations  (SDs)  were  not  reported,  we  first  tried  to
obtain the missing values from the authors. If not available, where
there  are  missing  measures  of  variance  for  continuous  data,  but
an exact standard error (SE) and confidence intervals available for
group means, and either P value or T value available for differences
in mean, we can calculate them according to the rules described
in the Handbook (Higgins 2011): When only the SE is reported, SDs
are calculated by the formula SD = SE * square root (n). Chapters
7.7.3 and 16.1.3 of the Handbook (Higgins 2011) present detailed
formulae for estimating SDs from P values, T or F values, confidence
intervals, ranges or other statistics. If these formulae do not apply,
we  can  calculate  the  SDs  according  to  a  validated  imputation
method  which  is  based  on  the  SDs  of  the  other  included  studies
(Furukawa 2006). Although some of these imputation strategies can
introduce error, the alternative would be to exclude a given study’s
outcome  and  thus  to  lose  information.  We  planned  to  examine
the  validity  of  the  imputations  in  a  sensitivity  analysis  excluding
imputed values.

3.3 Last observation carried forward

We anticipated that in some studies the method of last observation
carried forward (LOCF) would be employed within the study report.
As with all methods of imputation to deal with missing data, LOCF
introduces uncertainty about the reliability of the results (Leucht
2007). Therefore, if LOCF data had been used in the trial, if less than
50% of the data had been assumed, we planned to reproduce these
data and indicate that they were the product of LOCF assumptions.

Assessment of heterogeneity

1. Clinical heterogeneity

We  considered  all  included  studies  initially,  without  seeing
comparison  data,  to  judge  clinical  heterogeneity.  We  simply
inspected  all  studies  for  clearly  outlying  people  or  situations
which we had not predicted would arise. When such situations or
participant groups arose, these were fully discussed.

2. Methodological heterogeneity

We  considered  all  included  studies  initially,  without  seeing
comparison  data,  to  judge  methodological  heterogeneity.  We
simply inspected all studies for clearly outlying methods which we
had not predicted would arise. When such methodological outliers
arose, these were fully discussed.

3. Statistical heterogeneity

3.1 Visual inspection

We  visually  inspected  graphs  to  investigate  the  possibility  of
statistical heterogeneity.

3.2 Employing the I2 statistic

Heterogeneity  between  studies  was  investigated  by  considering
the  I2  method  alongside  the  Chi2  'P'  value.  The  I2  provides  an

estimate  of  the  percentage  of  inconsistency  thought  to  be  due
to  chance  (Higgins  2003).  The  importance  of  the  observed  value
of  I2  depends  on  i.  magnitude  and  direction  of  effects  and  ii.
strength  of  evidence  for  heterogeneity  (e.g.  'P'  value  from  Chi2
  test,  or  a  confidence  interval  for  I2).  an  I2  estimate  greater  than
or equal to around 50% accompanied by a statistically significant
Chi2  statistic  was  interpreted  as  evidence  of  substantial  levels
of  heterogeneity  (Section  9.5.2  -  Higgins  2009).  When  substantial
levels  of  heterogeneity  were  found  in  the  primary  outcome,
we  explored  reasons  for  heterogeneity  (Subgroup  analysis  and
investigation of heterogeneity).

Assessment of reporting biases

Reporting biases arise when the dissemination of research findings
is  influenced  by  the  nature  and  direction  of  results  (Egger  1997).
These  are  described  in  Section  10  of  the  Cochrane  Handbook  for
Systematic  Reviews  of  Interventions  (Higgins  2009).  We  are  aware
that funnel plots may be useful in investigating reporting biases but
are  of  limited  power  to  detect  small-study  effects.  As  we  did  not
have more than 10 studies providing data for outcomes, we did not
need to use funnel plots. If future versions of this review do require
funnel plots, we will seek statistical advice in their interpretation.

Data synthesis

We understand that there is no closed argument for preference for
use of fixed-effect or random-effects models. The random-effects
method incorporates an assumption that the different studies are
estimating  different,  yet  related,  intervention  effects.  This  often
seems  to  be  true  to  us  and  the  random-effects  model  takes  into
account differences between studies even if there is no statistically
significant heterogeneity. There is, however, a disadvantage to the
random-effects  model.  It  puts  added  weight  onto  small  studies
which often are the most biased ones. Depending on the direction
of effect these studies can either inflate or deflate the effect size.
Therefore,  we  chose  the  fixed-effect  model  for  all  analyses.  The
reader  is,  however,  able  to  choose  to  inspect  the  data  using  the
random-effects model.

Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity

1. Subgroup analyses - only primary outcomes

We planned to perform subgroup analyses to assess the impact of
the following possible sources of heterogeneity for any of the social

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

skills training programmes: brief versus long programmes, clinical
state, stage or problem. However, there were not enough data to
undertake these analyses.

2. Investigation of heterogeneity

If inconsistency was high, this was reported. First, we investigated
whether  data  had  been  entered  correctly.  Second,  if  data  were
correct, the graph was visually inspected and outlying studies were
successively removed to see if heterogeneity was restored. For this
review  we  decided  that  should  this  occur  with  data  contributing
to the summary finding of no more than around 10% of the total
weighting, data were presented. If not, data were not pooled and
issues  discussed.  We  know  of  no  supporting  research  for  this
10% cut-off but are investigating use of prediction intervals as an
alternative to this unsatisfactory state.

When  unanticipated  clinical  or  methodological  heterogeneity
was  obvious  we  simply  stated  hypotheses  regarding  these  for
future  reviews  or  versions  of  this  review.  We  did  not  anticipate
undertaking analyses relating to these.

Sensitivity analysis

We  also  planned  to  conduct  sensitivity  analyses  for  the  main
outcomes  for  trials  with  the 
implication  of  randomisation,
assumptions made for lost binary data, trials with high risk of bias,
imputed  values  and  fixed-effect  versus  random-effects  models.
However, all of the outcomes had less than 10 trials that reported
data.

Included studies

The  current  review  includes  17  reports  describing  13  studies
involving 975 participants.

1. Methods

All  studies  were  stated  to  be  randomised.  Dobson  1995,  Hayes
1995,  Huang  2005  and  Ng  2006  all  stated  that  the  assessors
were  blinded  to  the  participant's  treatment  allocation;  it  was
unclear in Potelunas 1982 whether all raters were blinded. In Tsang
2001,  the  raters  were  blinded,  but  it  was  unclear  whether  the
participants were. Chien 2003, Cui 2004, Kopelowicz 1998, Lu 2004,
Ma 2003, Mayang 1990 and Saren 2004 did not report that blinding
was  attempted.  For  further  details  please  see  sections  below  on
Allocation and Blinding in Risk of bias in included studies.

2. Duration

Five  trials  were  undertaken  for  no  longer  than  three  months:
Chien 2003 four weeks; Cui 2004 12 weeks; Kopelowicz 1998 three
months,  Lu  2004  eight  weeks;  Mayang  1990  four  sessions  with
a  four-week  follow-up  (it  did  not  report  the  frequency  of  the
sessions); and Potelunas 1982 six weeks. Seven trials were longer
than three months: Dobson 1995 involved nine weeks of training
with  three  months  of  follow-up  for  all  participants,  although  the
follow-up period lasted up to one year for the social skills group;
Hayes  1995  lasted  for  18  weeks,  but  had  an  additional  period  of
six  months  where  the  patients  received  decreasing  frequency  of
training; the duration of Huang 2005 was six months; Ma 2003 had
eight weeks of intervention and 26 weeks follow-up; Ng 2006 was
eight weeks with a six-month follow-up; Saren 2004 was 10 weeks
with  12  months  follow-up;  and  Tsang  2001  was  10  weeks  with  a
three-month follow-up period.

3. Participants

All  participants  were  people  with  a  chronic  mental  illness,
mostly  with  schizophrenia  and  schizoaffective  disorders.  One  of
the  studies  randomised  only  men  (Cui  2004)  and  two  studies
randomised only women (Mayang 1990 and  Potelunas 1982); the
others  included  both  sexes.  Data  on  mean  age  were  available
from seven trials. The average age was between 33 and 48 years.
Ma  2003  did  not  report  any  demographic  information  about  the
participants.

All studies included patients with schizophrenia and schizoaffective
psychoses.    Three  studies  used  the  Diagnostic  and  Statistical
Manual  of  Mental  Disorders,  fourth  edition  (DSM-IV)  criteria,  one
used the third edition (DSM-III), two used the third version of the
Chinese  Classification  of  Mental  Disorders  (CCMD-III),  three  used
the second version (CCMD-II), and four studies did not report the
diagnostic criteria.

4. Setting

Nine studies used a hospital setting (Chien 2003; Cui 2004; Dobson
1995;  Huang  2005;  Kopelowicz  1998;  Lu  2004;  Mayang  1990;  Ng
2006; Tsang 2001); in four studies (Hayes 1995; Ma 2003; Potelunas
1982; Saren 2004) the participants were outpatients. Three of the
included trials were conducted in USA, five in China, one in Taiwan,
two in Hong Kong, one in Canada and one in Australia.

5. Interventions

5.1 Experimental treatment

In  Chien  2003,  the  social  skills  training  focused  on  conversation
and assertiveness skills. Participants attended a one-hour session
twice  a  week  for  four  weeks.  In  Dobson  1995,  the  focus  was  on
communication and assertiveness for four one-hour sessions per
week over a nine-week period.

The  social  skills  training  programme  used  in  Cui  2004  was  the
UCLA  Social  and  independent  Living  Skills  programme,  which
includes: i) general social interpersonal skills training, using video
demonstration,  role  play  and  discussion;  ii)  educating  patients
of  the  purpose  and  function  of  antipsychotic  medication;  iii)
medication  management;  iv)  how  to  recognise  a  drug  adverse
effect; v) opportunity to discuss issues relating to drug therapy. The
training lasted 90 to 120 minutes per session, and there were three
sessions per week for 12 weeks.

Ma 2003 also used the UCLA Social and independent Living Skills
programme  as  the  social  skills  training  (90  to  120  minutes  per
session,  one  session  a  week  for  eight  weeks)    and  Kopelowicz
1998 used an adapted version, which was translated into Spanish
(participants attended three months of training four days a week,
although the length of each session was not reported).

The social skills training in Hayes 1995 emphasised interpersonal
skills,  social  problem  solving,  positive 
time  use  skills,
generalisation  enhancement  techniques,  and  used  instructions,
modelling,  behaviour 
feedback,  and  structured
homework. The training consisted of 36 sessions of 75 minutes over
18 weeks, followed by a six-month period in which patients received
decreasing frequency of training.

rehearsal, 

The social skills training in Huang 2005 was delivered in groups of
eight to nine people, and each session was two hours per weeks
for  24  weeks.The  social  skills  group  also  received  routine  drug
therapy, recreational activities and work in the wards, which was
the standard care for all patients.

In Lu 2004, the training included targeted problem solving training
to  improve  patients'  attention  and  planning  skills  with  the  aim
of  gradually  improving  patient's  social  function.  Training  was  60
minutes per session and two sessions per week for eight weeks.

In  Mayang  1990and  Ng  2006,  the  social  skills  training  focused
on  problem  solving  skills  (receiving  skills,  processing  skills  and
sending  skills)  and  involved  instructions,  modelling,  feedback,
role  playing,  social  reinforcement.  The  training  consisted  of  four
sessions of 45 minutes of training in Mayang 1990 and 30 to 32 hours
of treatment within eight weeks in Ng 2006.

In Potelunas 1982, the social skills training consisted of four one-
hour sessions over four weeks of videotaped presentation of eight
problem  situations,  videotaped  modelling,  behaviour  rehearsal,
coaching and feedback, which occurred within a work adjustment
programme.

In  Saren  2004,  the  training  focused  on  making  eye  contact,
facial  expressions,  tone  of  voice,  language  fluency,  posture  and
gestures and overall enthusiasm. Training was provided in groups
of between 10 to 12 people, for 60 to 90minutes per session, three
sessions per week for 10 weeks. In Tsang 2001, social skills training

also consisted of basic social skills (facial expression, gestures etc.)
and basic social survival skills (personal appearance, tidiness), but
also included core work-related skills. In this study there were two
intervention groups: one received social skills training plus follow-
up support, which consisted of contact with group members and
the trainer; the other group received only the social skills training
and no follow-up support.The training consisted of 10 weekly group
sessions lasting one and a half to two hours, with approximately six
to eight people in each group.

5.2 Control treatment

In five of the studies (Chien 2003; Cui 2004; Huang 2005; Kopelowicz
1998;  Tsang  2001),  the  comparison  treatment  was  standard
psychiatric care. However, three of the studies (Dobson 1995; Hayes
1995; Ng 2006) used a discussion group as the control treatment
to  control  for  any  confounding  effects  that  arise  from  interacting
with the therapist during social skills training. Dobson 1995 used
a  social  milieu,  which  consisted  of  structured  activities  including
supportive discussion groups, exercise groups and activity groups,
and  occurred  at  same  time  of  day  and  same  length  of  time  as
social  skills  training  group.  Hayes  1995  used  a  discussion  group
condition, which focused on interpersonal relations and purposeful
use of time using open ended questions, paraphrasing, reflecting,
and  summarising  the  participants'  comments  to  promote  self-
disclosure.  In  Ng  2006,  the  control  treatment  was  supportive
group discussion with topics that included practical tips on money
management  and  information  on  application  for  social  security
allowances,  with  special  attention  paid  to  avoid  discussions  on
interpersonal skills issues and use of behavioural techniques. Two
studies (Mayang 1990 and Potelunas 1982) had both standard care
and  a  discussion  group  as  their  control  treatments.  In  Mayang
1990, the interaction group condition consisted of non-treatment
interaction  with  trainers,  and  in  Potelunas  1982,  the  discussion
control was four one-hour sessions over four weeks of videotaped
presentation and discussion of eight problem situations.

7. Outcomes scales

7.1 Social functioning

i) Disabilities Assessment Schedule - DAS (WHO 1988)
This  scale  covers  six  domains:  cognition  –  understanding  and
communicating;  mobility;  self-care  –  hygiene,  dressing,  eating
and  staying  alone;  interacting  with  other  people;  life  activities  –
domestic  responsibilities,  leisure,  work  and  school;  participation
–  joining  in  community  activities.  Higher  scores  indicate  a  worse
outcome. Ma 2003 reported data from this scale.

ii) Social Disability Schedule - SDSS (WHO 1988)
The  SDSS  is  a  Chinese  simplified  version  of  the  World  Health
Organization’s  Disability  Assessment  Schedule  and  assesses  10
different aspects of social functioning (WHO 1988). Higher scores
indicate a worse outcome. Lu 2004 and Saren 2004 reported data
from this scale.

iii) Social avoidance and disability scale - SAD (Watson 1969)
The  Social  Avoidance  and  Distress  Scale  (SAD)  is  a  28-item,  self-
rated  scale  used  to  measure  various  aspects  of  social  anxiety
including distress, discomfort, fear, anxiety, and the avoidance of
social  situations.  Higher  scores  indicate  a  worse  outcome.  Saren
2004 reported data from this scale.

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

This scale is a Chinese rating scale, commonly used for assessing
response  to  antipsychotic  treatment.  Higher  scores  indicate  a
worse outcome. Huang 2005 reported data from this scale.

v) Social Situations questionnaire - SSQ (Bryant 1974)
Measures  self-perception  of  social  difficulty;  participants  rate
their anxiety and avoidance of 30 different social situations from
zero  “no  difficulty”  to  four  “avoidance  if  possible”.  Higher  scores
indicate a worse outcome. It is not clear whether this is a validated
scale. Hayes 1995 reported data from this scale.

vi) Social Behaviour Schedule - SBS (Wykes 1986)
The  scale  covers  21  behaviour  areas  such  as  destructive
behaviours, personal appearance and hygiene, measured on a five-
point Likert scale from zero (no problem or acceptable behaviour)
to four (serious problem). Higher scores indicate a worse outcome.
  Hayes 1995 reported data from this scale.

vii) Social functioning scale - SFS (Birchwood 1990)
This scale is an 81-item self-administered questionnaire covering
several  behaviour  areas:  employment,  social  withdrawal,  pro-
social  activities,  recreation,  interpersonal  functioning,  perceived
independence, 
independence
competence  and  perceived 
performance.  Higher  scores  indicate  a  better  outcome.  Ng  2006
reported data from this scale.

viii) Conversation with a stranger task - SCON (Wallace 1985)
This assesses the participants’ skill in initiating a conversation in
an unstructured five-minute interaction with a stranger. It is scored
on a rating scale from one “skill not evident” to five “very high level
of skill”.  Coding of the SCON used the system described by Bellack
1990. It is unclear whether the SCON is a validated scale. Hayes 1995
reported data from this scale.

7.2 Mental state

i)  Scale  for  the  Assessment  of  Negative  Symptoms  -  SANS
(Andreasen 1983)
This  scale  allows  a  global  rating  of  the  following  negative
symptoms:  alogia  (impoverished  thinking),  affective  blunting,
avolition-apathy, anhedonia-asociality, and attention impairment.
Assessments are made on a six-point scale from zero (not at all) to
five (severe). Higher scores indicate more symptoms. Hayes 1995
and Ng 2006 reported data from this scale.

ii)  Scale  for  the  Assessment  of  Positive  Symptoms  –  SAPS
(Andreasen 1983).
This  is  a  six-point  scale  providing  a  global  rating  of  positive
symptoms  such  as  delusions,  hallucinations  and  disordered
thinking. Higher scores indicate more symptoms. Ma 2003 reported
data from this scale.

iii) Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale - BPRS (Overall 1962)
This is used to assess the severity of abnormal mental state. The
original scale has 16 items, but a revised 18-item scale is commonly
used.  Each  item  is  defined  on  a  seven-point  scale  varying  from
'not present' to 'extremely severe', scoring from zero to six or one
to  seven.  Scores  can  range  from  zero  to  126,  with  high  scores
indicating  more  severe  symptoms.  Cui  2004,  Hayes  1995  and  Ng
2006 reported data from this scale.

7.3 General Functioning

iv) Scale of Social Skills for Psychiatric Inpatients - SSPI (Guo 1995)

i) Morningside Rehabilitation Status Scale - MRSS (Affleck 1984)

Better health.

In  this  scale  four  individual  areas  are  rated  on  an  8-point  scale:
dependency, occupation and leisure activity, social isolation, and
current  symptoms.  Higher  scores  indicate  a  worse  outcome.  Lu
2004 reported data from this scale.

7.4 Global state

i) Global Assessment Scale - GAS (Endicott 1976)
This  is  an  observer-rated  scale  for  evaluating  the  overall
functioning  of  a  patient  during  a  specified  time  period  on  a
continuum  from  psychological  or  psychiatric  sickness  to  health.
Score ranges from zero to 100, where higher score indicates a better
outcome. Hayes 1995 reported data from this scale.

ii) Clinical Global Impression Scale - CGI (Guy 1976)
This  is  used  to  assess  both  severity  of  illness  and  clinical
improvement,  by  comparing  the  conditions  of  the  person
standardised  against  other  people  with  the  same  diagnosis.  A
seven-point scoring system is usually used with low scores showing
decreased  severity  and/or  overall  improvement.  Huang  2005
reported data from this scale.

7.5 Quality of Life

i) Quality of Life Scale - QLS (Heinrich 1984)
This six-point quality of life scale has been designed as an outcome
instrument  for  schizophrenic  deficit  syndrome  as  well  as  to
measure impaired functioning in studies of chronic schizophrenia,
to  assess  the  deficit  syndrome's  impact  on  the  patient's  life.
There  are  seven  severity  steps  (zero  to  six,  six  being  adequately
functioning and zero being deficient). The time frame is one month.
Four  item  categories  have  been  identified  by  factor  analysis  1)
interpersonal relationships (seven items), 2) instrumental role (four
items), 3) intrapsychic function (seven items) and 4) commonplace
objects and activities. Hayes 1995 reported data from this scale.

ii) General Well-Being Scale - GWB (Dupuy 1977)
This  is  a  self-administered  questionnaire  consisting  of  18  items
covering  six  dimensions  of  anxiety,  depression,  general  health,
positive well-being, self-control and vitality. There is a total score
running  from  zero  to  110,  higher  scores  indicate  less  distress.  Lu
2004 reported data from this scale.

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

iii) Rosenberg Self-esteem scale - SES (Rosenberg 1965)
The Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale is a 10-item self-report measure
of global self-esteem. It consists of 10 statements related to overall
feelings of self-worth or self-acceptance. The items are answered on
a four-point scale ranging from strongly agree to strongly disagree.
The SES has also been administered as an interview. Scores range
from 10 to 40, with higher scores indicating higher self-esteem. Lu
2004 reported data from this scale.

Excluded studies

We  excluded  104  studies.  Of  these,  seven  studies  were  not
randomised.  The  other  97  studies  were  randomised  but  either
the experimental groups were allocated to a programme that had
some elements of social skills but also incorporated other training
interventions,  for  example  life  skills  and  cognitive  behavioural
therapies, or the control group was not only standard care, but for
example,  holistic  therapy.  We  did,  however,  include  studies  that
used a discussion group as an attention control.

Awaiting assessment

Eight studies are awaiting assessment.

Ongoing studies

We found eight ongoing studies, three have social skills
training programmes as the intervention (NCT00338975 2006,
NCT00791882 2008, NCT00183625 2005), two include health
management training with the social skills training (NCT00069433
2003, Pratt 2008), one has cognitive behavioural social skills
training as the intervention (NCT00237796 2005), another social
cognition and interaction training (NCT00601224 2008) and one
attention shaping procedures (NCT00391677 2006).

Risk of bias in included studies

We  prepared  a  'Risk  of  bias'  assessment  for  each  trial.  Our
judgments regarding the overall risk of bias in individual studies is
illustrated in Figure 2 and Figure 3. Overall, we felt the risk of bias
in the included studies to be high.

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

Allocation

All  studies  were  stated  to  be  randomly  assigned.  However,  only
three of the studies described how allocation to intervention was
undertaken:    Cui  2004,  Ng  2006  and  Saren  2004  each  used  a
random  numbers  table.  Only  Ng  2006  described  the  allocation
concealment; it was unclear in the remaining studies.

Blinding

Only  Tsang  2001  was  stated  to  be  double  blind,  although  it  was
unclear if participants in the control group were blinded. In five of
the studies the assessors were blinded (Dobson 1995, Hayes 1995,
Huang 2005, Ng 2006 and Potelunas 1982), although in Potelunas
1982 it was unclear whether all the raters were blinded.

Incomplete outcome data

Two  studies  did  not  have  any  incomplete  data  (Lu  2004  and  Ma
2003),  seven  studies  did  not  address  incomplete  outcome  data
adequately and it was unclear in four of the studies (Mayang 1990,
Potelunas 1982, Ng 2006 and Tsang 2001).

Selective reporting

Four of the studies were free from selective reporting (Huang 2005;
Ma 2003; Ng 2006 and Saren 2004), the remaining nine studies were
rated as high risk of bias for selective reporting.

Other potential sources of bias

It was unclear in all of the trials except Dobson 1995 whether they
were free from other biases. In Dobson 1995 there was bias from

of the social skills training group (1 RCT, n = 120, MD -6.8 CI -10.52
to -3.08).

1.2 Relapse

Two  studies  reported  on  the  number  of  participants  relapsing,
with  follow-up  between  six  months  and  12  months.  A  significant
difference  was  found  in  favour  of  the  social  skills  group  (2  RCTs,
n = 263, RR 0.52 CI 0.34 to 0.79; Analysis 1.2). The results showed
moderate heterogeneity (I2 = 40%).

1.3 Global state: not clinically improved

Huang 2005 reported data for this outcome at six months follow-
up and found that significantly more participants showed a clinical
improvement  in  global  state  in  the  social  skills  training  group
compared to the standard care group (1 RCT, n = 67, RR 0.29 CI 0.12
to 0.68; Analysis 1.3).

1.4 Service outcome: re-hospitalisation

Saren  2004  reported  data  on  re-hospitalisation  at  12  months
follow-up and showed a significant difference in favour of the social
skills group (1 RCT, n = 143, RR 0.53 CI 0.30 to 0.93; Analysis 1.4).

1.5 Mental state

1.5.1 Average endpoint score in negative and positive symptoms

Hayes 1995 and Ma 2003 measured negative symptoms on the SANS
scale with eight and 18 weeks follow-up, respectively, and found a
significant difference in favour of the social skills training group (2
RCTs, n = 187, MD -8.92 CI -10.46 to -7.38). Ma 2003 also measured
positive symptoms on the SAPS scale, and also found a significant
difference favouring social skills training (1 RCT, n = 120, MD -1.90 CI
-3.37 to -0.43; Analysis 1.5).

1. COMPARISON 1: SOCIAL SKILLS versus STANDARD CARE

1.1 Social functioning

1.1.1 Social functioning:  Average endpoint score

We found significant differences between social skills and standard
care on all scales that measured social functioning (Analysis 1.1). Lu
2004 reported data on the Social Disability Schedule (SDSS) at eight
weeks (1 RCT, n = 112, MD -1.50 CI -2.39 to -0.61) and Saren 2004
at 12 months (1 RCT, n = 143, MD -10.00 CI -11.35 to -8.65). Saren
2004 also reported data on the Social Avoidance and Distress Scale
(SAD) at 12 months follow-up (1 RCT, n = 143, MD -16.00 CI -17.04 to
-14.96) and Huang 2005 reported data on the Scale of Social-skills
for Psychiatric Inpatients (SSPI) at six months follow-up (1 RCT, n =
67, MD -6.06 CI -7.17 to -4.95). In addition, Ma 2003 reported data
for general functioning on the Disability Assessment Scale (DAS) at
26 weeks follow-up and also found a significant difference in favour

Cui 2004 reported the average change in mental state at 12 weeks
follow-up (Analysis 1.6).  General symptoms were measured using
the  BPRS  (1  RCT,  n  =  91,  MD  -4.01  CI  -7.52  to  -0.50)  and  negative
symptoms were measured using the SANS (1 RCT, n = 91, MD -7.70,
CI -12.33 to -3.17), both of which showed a significant improvement
in symptoms in the social skills group compared with standard care.

1.6 General functioning: average endpoint score

Lu  2004  reported  data  on  the  Morningside  Rehabilitation  Status
Scale  (MRSS)  at  eight  weeks  follow-up  and  found  a  significant
difference in favour of the social skills training for the participants
rehabilitation status (1 RCT, n = 112, MD -10.60 CI -17.47 to -3.73;
(Analysis 1.8).

1.7 General functioning: employment

(Kopelowicz 1998) reported whether participants were employed
at the end of the study and found no difference between treatment
groups (n = 46, RR 5.43 CI 0.28 to 107.33) Analysis 1.9.

1.8 Leaving the study early

We found no significant differences between social skills training
and standard care for the number of participants leaving the study
early with follow-up between eight weeks and 12 months (9 RCTs,
n  =  719,  RR  2.04  CI  1.00  to  4.16;  Analysis  1.10).  In  Kopelowicz
1998,  two  people  in  the  social  skills  group  dropped  out  because

they had found employment, but despite this there was very low
heterogeneity for these results (I2 = 10%).

1.9 Quality of Life: average endpoint score

Lu 2004 measured quality of life at 8 weeks follow-up on two scales,
the General Well-Being scale (n = 112, MD -7.60 CI -12.18 to -3.02)
and the Self-Esteem scale (n = 112, MD -8.30 CI -10.07 to 6.53), both
of which showed a significant difference in favour of the social skills
training (Analysis 1.11).

2. COMPARISON 2: SOCIAL SKILLS versus DISCUSSION
CONTROL

2.1 Social functioning: average endpoint score

Two studies reported data for this outcome at six months follow-
up, each on two different scales, none of which showed a significant
difference  between  social  skills  training  and  a  discussion  control
(Analysis  2.1).  Hayes  1995  measured  social  functioning  on  the
Social situations questionnaire (SSQ) (n = 63, MD -1.10 CI -11.14 to
8.94) and the conversation with a stranger task (SCON) (n = 63, MD
-2.50 CI -5.52 to 0.52). Ng 2006 used the Social Functioning Scale
(SFS) (n = 36, MD 4.60 CI -7.54 to 16.74) and the Social behaviour
schedule (SBS) (n = 36, MD 0.50 CI --2.56 to 3.56).

2.2 Relapse

This outcome was reported by Ng 2006 at six months follow-up and
no significant difference was found between the treatment groups
(1 RCT, n = 33, RR 2.12 CI 0.44 to 10.10; Analysis 2.2).

2.3 Global state: average endpoint score

Hayes 1995 reported data for global state on the Global Assessment
Scale at six months follow-up and found no significant difference
between the social skills training and the discussion control (1 RCT,
n = 63, MD 4.50 CI -1.20 to 10.20) (Analysis 2.3).

2.4 Mental state: average endpoint score

Two  trials  reported  the  average  endpoint  score  for  general
symptoms  at  six  months  follow-up  on  the  BPRS  scale  and  found
no significant difference between the treatment groups (2 RCTs, n =
99, MD 0.22 CI -4.05 to 4.49; Analysis 2.4). The results showed high
heterogeneity (I2 = 54%). In addition, the two trials also found no
significant difference in negative symptoms on the SANS scale (2
RCTs, n = 99, MD 2.89 CI -4.43 to 10.22; Analysis 2.4). These results
were moderately heterogeneous (I2 = 19%).

2.5 Leaving the study early

Two trials reported data for this outcome at three months and six
months  follow-up  and  showed  no  significant  difference  between
the  social  skills  training  and  discussion  control  (2  RCTs,  n  =  69,
RR  1.58  CI  0.37  to  6.68;  (Analysis  2.5).  The  results  showed  no
heterogeneity (I2 = 0%).

2.6 Quality of life

Hayes 1995 reported data on quality of life at six months follow-up
and found no significant difference between the treatment groups
(Analysis 2.6). (1 RCT, n = 63, MD 3.70 CI -6.47 to 13.87).

Summary of main results

The  summary  below  reflects  the  outcomes  chosen  for  the
'Summary  of  findings'  tables  chosen  to  be  of  clinical  importance
before  seeing  the  data.  These  are  considered  to  be  the  main
findings of this review. For all outcomes, we judged the quality of
evidence  to  be  very  low  -  randomisation  was  not  well  described,
observation bias was impossible to exclude and few attempts were
made to minimise it, and outcomes were poorly reported.

1. COMPARISON 1: SOCIAL SKILLS versus STANDARD CARE

1.1 Social functioning

We found it surprising that - for this comparison - social functioning
was  just  so  poorly  reported.  The  use  of  various  scales  made
any  potential  analysis  prone  to  problems  from  the  very  many
assumptions  that  would  have  had  to  be  made.  Four  studies
reported on 585 people but different scales were used in each with
little  help  for  the  reader  in  the  interpretation  of  what  outcomes
would mean in everyday life.

1.2 Relapse/rehospitalisation

Two  trials  suggest  (n  =  263)  that  the  risk  of  relapse  is  halved
in  between  six  and  12  months  follow-up.  The  low-quality  data
are  also  moderately  heterogeneous  -  but  this  is  an  encouraging
finding  -  mirroring  that  of  the  risk  of  rehospitalisation.  If  only
rehospitalisation had some suggestion of decrease and not relapse
then it may have been argued that the putative increase in social
skills would have helped avoid admission. However, this is not the
case  and  there  is  a  suggestion  that  the  social  skills  programmes
help  offset  the  relapse  as  well.  This  finding,  as  others,  need
replicated in larger studies.

1.3 Mental state: general symptoms

Mental state outcomes were few and is it not clear that the social
skills programmes have any effect.

1.4 Global state: not clinically improved.

The  global  state  outcome,  as  measured  by  the  CGI,  was  also
favouring  social  skills  programmes.  This  is  in  keeping  with  the
relapse and rehospitalisation outcomes but is only based on one
very small study (n = 67).

1.5 General functioning

One small study (n = 112) reported on general functioning. We have
not been able to find explanation of what a 10-point decline would
mean in everyday life, but the decline did favour the social skills
programme group.

1.6 Quality of life

Finally,  the  quality  of  life  measure  also  favoured  the  social  skills
programme group in one study (n = 112).

1.7 Overall

The  overall  impression  that  we  are  left  with  is  that  social  skills
programmes, in the hands of expert and committed practitioners -
who these trialists were - may have some valuable effects (please
see Implications for research).

2. COMPARISON 2: SOCIAL SKILLS versus DISCUSSION
CONTROL

As stated above, we thought that is would not be right to summate a
social skills programme versus standard care comparison with that
comparing the social skills programme to a more active discussion
group control. However, data were more thin and inconclusive.

2.1 Social functioning

Two studies (total n = 63 people) reported on two different scales.
There did not seem to be any difference between the social skills
programme and the discussion group control.

2.2 Relapse

One  tiny  study  (n  =  35)  reported  on  relapse  with  no  differences
between  groups.  Such  outcomes  should  be  reported  as  a  matter
of routine - but it would seem likely that much larger studies are
needed  to  highlight  differences  with  any  degree  of  meaningful
confidence.

Five of the studies were conducted in China and reported in Chinese
(Cui 2004; Huang 2005; Lu 2004, Ma 2003; Saren 2004), a further two
were conducted in Hong Kong and reported in English (Ng 2006 and
Tsang  2001)  and  one  was  in  Taiwan  and  also  reported  in  English
(Chien 2003).Of the remaining five studies, three were conducted in
the USA, one in Canada and one in Australia. Most of the data for the
results are from the Chinese studies and those conducted in Hong
Kong.

Should  we  have  been  able  to  synthesise  more  data  across  the
inevitable  varied  definitions  of  'social  skills  programme'  and
different care cultures we might have been able to see if, despite
these  differences,  findings  were  consistent  -  and  in  being  so,
supported the idea of wide applicability. More data are needed.

Quality of the evidence

1. Methods

Most studies did not address incomplete data adequately as they
did  not  use  an  intention-to-treat  analysis.  Only  three  of  the  13
included  studies  described  an  adequate  sequence  generation,
and  only  one  described  the  methods  used  to  conceal  allocation.
Twelve of the studies were not blinded and in one (Tsang 2001), it
was unclear. Four studies were free from selectively reporting the
outcomes. Dobson 1995 was not free from other biases and it was
unclear in the remaining studies. All the studies were small.

2.3 Global state, mental state. quality of life

2. Reporting

In  the  one  study  of  63  people  global  state  was  unchanged.  This
applies to mental state (2 RCTs, n = 99) and quality of life 1 RCT, 63
people).

2.4 Overall

When social skills training was compared to this discussion control,
no  evidence  was  found  to  suggest  that  social  skills  training  was
superior  to  the  control  group  for  improving  social  functioning,
employment, relapse rates, mental state, global state, quality of life
and leaving the study early.

Overall completeness and applicability of evidence

1. Completeness

Even  for  outcomes  for  which  we  identified  usable  data,  because
all  studies  were  of  a  small  sample  size  (range  18  to  148)  we  feel
that  no  outcomes  could  be  labelled  as  complete.  We  did  not
find  studies  with  any  data  for  the  following  outcomes:  general
behaviour, engagement with services, satisfaction with treatment
and economic outcomes.

2. Applicability

The definition of social skills training varied between studies, and
we  have  tried  to  be  as  consistent  as  possible  when  screening
potential  studies.  All  programmes  had  an  element  of  social
problem  solving  and  used  techniques  of  modelling,  role-play
and  social  reinforcement.  Some  trials  focused  on  interpersonal
communication  such  as  conversation  and  assertiveness  skills,
whereas  others  were  more  diverse  and  included  symptom  and
medication  management.  The  focus  of  the  studies  also  differed,
with the aim of some to reduce stress and the risk of relapse and
others focusing on employment.

Reporting  was  very  poor.  Many  of  the  trials  presented  data  that
we were not able to use, mostly because authors had not reported
either means or SDs, or data were not from a validated scale. For
two included trials we were not able to use any data (Mayang 1990
and Potelunas 1982) and for a further four, we could only use data
for one of the outcomes.

2. Consistancy of measure

For the outcomes for which data were available, with the exception
of  leaving  the  study  early,  only  one  or  two  small  trials  provided
data.  The  studies  used  different  assessment  scales  and  we  were
unable to pool the divergent outcome data, which further hinders
the detection of potential treatment effects.

Potential biases in the review process

We have worked only with published reports. By doing this we may
be perpetuating a reporting and publishing bias. In addition, it was
not possible to tell if there was publication bias, as most of the 13
included trials did not provide useful data, and a funnel plot could
not be performed. Five of the reports were written in Chinese. These
studies  were  assessed  and  data  extracted  by  one  person  who  is
fluent in Mandarin (JX).

We do not think that we embarked on this review with prior biases
as to the effects of the programme of care - and have tried to keep
to the protocol guidance we stipulated before seeing any data.

We realise the search date is out of date and new studies may have
been published which could alter the results of this review. We are
currently assessing results of a new search and aim to update this
review within the next six months.

Implications for practice

1. For people with schizophrenia

Studies  are  still  so  limited  that  this  package  of  care  has  to  be
thought of as experimental. There is no indication that these social
skills programmes do harm and some that they do good. If asked
to join a social skills programme, the person could be encouraged
that randomisation occurs to add to the body of useful knowledge.

2. For clinicians

Whether  social  skills  programme  do  any  more  good  than  other
interventions is unproven. Less sophisticated approaches may be
just  as  effective.  Until  more  evidence  is  available,  social  skills
programmes  should  be  thought  of  as  experimental  and  not  fully
tested.

3. For policy makers

Compared  with  standard  care,  social  skills  training  may  improve
the social skills of schizophrenic patients and reduce relapse rates,
but at present, the evidence is very limited. In addition, there is no
evidence to suggest that social skills training is superior to the act of
discussing problems in a group. Currently, because of lack of good,
consistent, applicable data social skills programme have to be seen
to  be  vulnerable  to  replacement  by  other  approaches  with  more
robust evidence.

Implications for research

1. General

Only  four  of  the  included  studies  predate  CONSORT  (Begg  1996;
Moher 2001) but many had not followed guidance in their reporting.
Clear  and  strict  adherence  to  the  CONSORT  statement  may  well
have resulted in this review having more data. Full availability of all
data from each study could greatly help future reviewers (AllTrials).

Many excluded trials could find a place in new or existing systematic
reviews. It is difficult to categorise all these studies for presentation
in a table but we have assigned them broad categories and suggest
Cochrane reviews that may cover these areas (Table 1).

2.2 Trials

If  social  skills  training  programmes  are  to  be  incorporated  into
the  treatment  of  people  living  with  schizophrenia,  more  reliable
evidence is needed. Future trials should involve all consumers of
care, including the patients, families and carers, organisations that
provide  care  for  those  with  schizophrenia  and  not  only  focus  on
research  outcomes.  There  is  certainly  a  need  for  a  large  multi-
centre randomised controlled trial to show if social skills training
is  affected  by  cultural  differences.  Interpretation  of  social  skills
programmes research would be enhanced if future trials made use
of  validated  measures  -  perhaps  even  only  those  used  in  routine
care and preferably agreed upon by a COMET-type approach.

We are aware that enormous effort and care goes into the design
of a trial and that we can only suggest some thoughts about design
from our understanding of what has gone on before (Table 2). We
have,  however,  looked  at  these  trials  very  carefully  and  do  think
that  there  are  some  lessons  to  be  learnt  about  gaining  valuable
information from simplicity of design. After all, with the complexity
of  design  that  has  gone  before,  we  are  left  in  the  dark  about  the
most basic effects of this approach.
