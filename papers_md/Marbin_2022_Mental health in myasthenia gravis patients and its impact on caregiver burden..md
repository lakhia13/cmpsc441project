Psychiatric comorbidities are relevant in patients with Myasthenia gravis (MG). Also, MG patients 
experience a reduced health-related quality of life (HRQoL). We aimed to quantify the impact of 
depression as well as self-perceived MG severity on HRQoL and caregivers’ burden. In this cross-
sectional study, we used a survey encompassing demographic, disease-related information, and 
standardized questionnaires to assess symptoms of depression, anxiety, HRQoL (MG Quality of Life 
scale; MG-QoL15), and caregiver burden (Burden Scale for Family Caregivers; BSFC). Data from 1399 
participating patients (96%) and 1042 caregivers (65%) were eligible for further analysis. Symptoms 
of depression and anxiety disorder were indicated by 31% and 36% of patients. Self-reported MG 
severity (MG severity) and MG-QoL15 scores were strongly associated (estimated marginal means for 
severe versus mild MG severity = 18 95% CI [16; 21]; p ≤ 0.001). Adjusting for symptoms of depression 
decreased the estimated strength of this association (estimated marginal means for severe versus 
mild MG severity = 15 [13; 17]; p ≤ 0.001). Caregiver burden was associated to MG disease severity 
(estimated marginal means for severe vs. mild MG severity = 0.16 [0.13; 0,19); p ≤ 0.001) and also 
negatively influenced by symptoms of depression (estimated marginal means = 0.12 [0.09; 0.15]). 
Symptoms of depression and anxiety disorder in MG are frequent. Beyond MG severity, symptoms of 
depression have negative effects on HRQoL as well as on caregivers’ burden. Diagnosis and treatment 
of psychiatric comorbidities should be considered an important element in MG care. Screening tools 
for mental health conditions should be implemented at least in specialized MG centers.

Myasthenia gravis (MG) is a chronic, autoimmune-mediated disease of the neuromuscular junction with fluctuat-
ing weakness in skeletal  muscles1. The median prevalence is 15 per 100,000  persons2. Symptoms can encompass 
ocular such as diplopia and ptosis, faciopharyngeal weakness like dysphagia and dysarthrophonia as well as 
generalized weakness affecting limb, neck, and torso musculature. Almost 20% of patients suffer from a life-
threatening myasthenic crisis at least once during the disease. It is characterized by respiratory insufficiency, 
requiring intensive care treatment with mechanical  ventilation3,4. Although significant advances in therapy 
prolonged overall life expectancy, a reduced Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) is reported, especially 
among MG patients with bulbar and generalized  symptoms5. There is inconsistent data about the reduction 
of psychological domains in the  HRQoL5,6. Activities of daily life (AdL) are also reduced in MG  patients7. The 
impact of MG itself as well as its comorbidities including those affecting mental health have become an important 
focus in research.

Psychiatric comorbidities like depression, anxiety disorder, or posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are highly 
prevalent in smaller cohorts of MG patients, with prevalences of depression ranging from 14 to 58%8,9. Depres-
sion and other factors like illness stability and impairments have been identified as important factors affecting 
the  HRQoL10, which needs to be considered in the MG patients’  treatment11. So far, the detection and adequate 
treatment of mood disorders in MG patients seems  insufficient12,13. However, the impact of MG severity and 
related mental disorders on the burden of disease is limited. Importantly, their effects on caregivers’ burden are 
unknown. We hypothesize that the prevalence of depression, anxiety disorder, and PTSD is not only higher

well as comorbid depression, have a significant impact on patients’ HRQoL and caregivers’ burden.

Thus, we investigate the prevalence and possible underdiagnosis of psychiatric symptoms (depression, anxi-
ety, and PTSD) in MG patients. We aim to quantify the effect of MG severity and symptoms of depression on 
patients’ HRQoL and caregivers’ burden.

Methods
Patients. 
In cooperation with the German Myasthenia Society (self-help group for MG in Germany; DMG), 
we reached out to all 3280 members via postal mail between April and October 2017 asking them to fill out a 
questionnaire.

The study participants were instructed to return their completed questionnaire in a prepaid envelope with 
no identifying information to ensure the anonymity of the survey and its participants. Further patients were 
recruited by our physicians in our MG outpatient clinic (“Integrated MG Center”) at Charité University Hospital, 
Berlin. Prior to enrollment, all patients had to confirm that they did not already participate in this study via the 
DMG and gave written informed consent. No refund was given.

All participants were asked to encourage their caregivers to provide information via an additional question-
naire assessing the caregiver burden. Exclusion criteria were participants’ age under 18, missing diagnosis of MG, 
and insufficiently completed questionnaires, defined a priori in case less than fifty percent of all items answered. 
All data was de-identified for analysis. The study has been approved by the Charité University Medicine Berlin’s 
ethics committee (reference number EA1/028/17) and registered at www. clini caltr ials. gov (NCT03205306). All 
research was performed following the Helsinki Declaration.

Parameters and scores.  The questionnaires contained demographic data such as gender, age, marital sta-
tus, and educational status. Relevant disease-related information such as current disease severity (low, medium, 
high), antibody status, age at onset of myasthenia-related symptoms and time of diagnosis, comorbidities (auto-
immune, cardiac or psychiatric (depression, anxiety disorder, PTSD, other)), medication, history of myasthenic 
crisis and exacerbation.

Psychiatric symptoms and burden of disease were assessed by using the following validated German versions 
of standardized and self-administrated questionnaires: Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), MG 
Quality of Life Scale (MG-QoL15), short DSM-IV screening scale for PTSD (PTSD-7), Freiburger Fragebogen 
zur Krankheitsverarbeitung (FKV; not available in English) and Burden Scale for Family Caregivers (BSFC).

The HADS is a screening instrument with high validity and reliability (sensitivity and specificity 0.8; Cron-
bach’s alpha for Anxiety: 0.83 and for Depression: 0.82) to detect depression and anxiety amongst patients with 
somatic  diseases14. It contains seven items for each anxiety and depression. The cut-off score is seven, indicating 
cases above cut-off in gradation mild (8–10), moderate (11–14), and severe (> 14). The MG-QOL15 is a short 
version of the sixty items  MGQOL15. It is a disease-specific health-related QoL scale, with lower scores indicat-
ing a higher HRQoL.

We asked each patient with a myasthenic crisis (with ICU submission) or exacerbation throughout the disease 
to fill out the PTSD-716,17. A sum score of ≥ 4 implies the possibility of PTSD with a sensitivity of 80% and specific-
ity of 97%, and reliability is also high (Cronbach’s alpha 0.90)16. To investigate coping strategies, we used the FKV 
questionnaire, assessing different dimensions of coping mechanisms, e.g. cognition, emotion, and  behavior18.

To examine perceived caregivers’ burden, we used the short version of the BSFC including 10 domains such 
as reduced life satisfaction, physical exhaustion, conflicting demands, or affection for their health by caregiving. 
Cronbach’s alpha for the complete scale was 0.9219.

Statistical analysis.  For data transfer and analysis, we used IBM SPSS Statistics 25 and STATA IC 14. We 
compared  sociodemographic  characteristics,  questionnaire  scores,  and  clinical  characteristics  between  the 
myasthenia subgroups (disease severity) using the chi‐square test, or Kruskal–Wallis-test, where indicated.

General linear models were used to estimate the association between self-reported disease severity as the 
independent variable and MG-QoL15 and caregiver burden as dependent variables, respectively. Models were 
stepwise adjusted for potential effect mediation by depression according to HADS scores (1: < 8; 2: 8–10; 3: 11–14; 
4: > 14), as well as the potential confounding factors gender, age, education, marital status, myasthenic crisis/
exacerbation, duration of disease, disease latency and treatment escalation (IVIG/Rituximab) as well as a history 
of other autoimmune disease or cardiovascular disease as binary variables.

Continuous variables with a right-skewed distribution, namely the duration of disease and the disease latency 
were log-transformed before being entered into the model. Adjusted  R2 values are given for goodness of fit. A 
two-sided significance level of α = 0.05 was considered. No adjustment for multiple testing was applied and all 
p-values constitute exploratory data analysis.

Ethics approval.  The study has been approved by the Charité University Medicine Berlin’s ethics committee 
(reference number EA1/028/17), and registered at www. clini caltr ials. gov (NCT03205306).

Results
The questionnaires were filled out by 1451 patients yielding an overall response rate of 44.2% (Table 1). Consid-
ering to the exclusion criteria, 52 questionnaires had to be excluded. Caregivers’ response rate was 47% (1596). 
Incompletely filled-out questionnaires had to be excluded, 65% of the questionnaires were eligible for further 
analyses (1042). The median duration of MG was 9 years (IQR 4–18), the median age of MG onset was 39 years 
(IQR 24–57) in women and 62 years (IQR 51–70) in men. Correspondingly, the median age of diagnosis was 
44 years (IQR 28–60) in women and 62 years (IQR 51–70) in men. Less than half of the patients had undergone 
thymectomy (42.9%), with 67.7% of them being female patients. Intake of regular and delayed-release pyridostig-
mine was reported by 63.5% and 39.0%. The most commonly used immunosuppressant was azathioprine (43.8%), 
and steroids were taken by 23.4% of the participants. Escalation therapy with Rituximab and IVIG was reported 
by 3.4% and 8.2%, respectively. Experience of at least one myasthenic crisis was reported by 17.2% of patients, 
whereas 22.8% reported exacerbations of MG. The lead institution in MG care was a certified center for MG care 
("integrated myasthenia center") for 20.7% of patients and a neurological outpatient clinic of a university hospital 
for 30.9%. The majority of patients (60.8%) also visited a registered neurologist or general practitioner regularly. 
The most abundant somatic comorbidities, cardiovascular and autoimmune disorders were reported by 18.1% 
and 18.9%, respectively (Table 1), with rheumatoid arthritis, hypothyroidism, Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, psoria-
sis, and systemic lupus erythematosus being the most often reported autoimmune disorders (data not shown).

Of all, 81.4% negated a diagnosed mental health condition, a prediagnosed depression has been reported by 
11.6%, and 5.7% reported an anxiety disorder (Table 2). In contrast, when assessing the prevalences of psychiatric 
symptoms by using standardized questionnaires (HADS), we observed significantly higher rates of symptoms of 
depression (30.8%) and anxiety disorder (35.5%). Signs of possible PTSD could be identified in 10.7% of patients 
with a self-reported myasthenic crisis (with ICU submission) or exacerbation, which equals 4.4% of the total 
study population. There were no differences in the frequencies of possible PTSD between patient groups report-
ing myasthenic crisis and exacerbation. The severity of symptoms of depression as well as anxiety disorder was 
associated significantly with higher MG severity. The numbers of symptoms of depression and possible PTSD 
was almost three to eight times higher in patients with high MG severity compared to low (39.0% vs. 14.4% in 
symptoms of depression; 8.2% vs. 1.1% in PTSD). Amongst MG patients with high MG severity, anxiety was 
twice as common as in patients with low disease severity (38.4% vs. 19.4%).

A third of patients with a psychiatric diagnosis were undergoing psychotherapeutic treatment (35.5%), and 
more than half were undergoing pharmacotherapy (57.8%). Antidepressants were taken by 69.2% of patients 
with severe and 64.8% of patients with moderate depression according to HADS. In contrast, only 50.0% with 
severe and 36.2% with moderate symptoms of depression were in psychotherapy. Importantly, the majority of 
patients who underwent psychotherapy (93.9%) reported benefiting therefrom. Sleep difficulties were reported 
by 63.0%. A restricted sexual life due to their MG was reported by 54.0% of patients.

The median MG-QoL15 score was 12 (IQR 4–26; Table 1). Linear regression analysis revealed that the self-
reported MG severity was strongly associated with higher MG-QoL15 scores. The estimated marginal means 
for MG-QoL15 score for severe vs. mild self-reported MG severity was 18.26 95%CI [15.92; 20.60]; Table 3), 
suggesting a lower HRQoL in patients with a high MG severity as compared to those with mild MG severity 
(adj  R2 = 0.264).

The estimated strength of association for MG severity on MG-QoL15 decreased after adjusting for symptoms 
of depression, whereas model fit increased. The estimated marginal means of MG-QoL15 score for severe vs. 
mild MG severity = 15.37 95%CI [13.39; 17.35]; Adj  R2 = 0.490; Table 3). Depression as a possible comorbidity 
might partially explain the association between MG disease severity and HRQoL. Accordingly, in model 2, higher 
depression categories were significantly associated with higher MG-QoL15 scores, therefore with a decreased 
HRQoL (Fig. 1).

In contrast, adjustment for gender in model 3 as well as for age, education, marital status, myasthenic crisis, 
duration of disease, disease latency, and treatment escalation (IVIG/rituximab) in model 4 only slightly affected 
the effect estimates of self-reported severity (estimated marginal means of MG-QoL15 score for severe vs. mild 
MG severity = 14.36 95%CI [12.23 16.48]; Adj  R2 = 0.560; Table 3). In model 4, the female gender was significantly 
associated with a lower HRQoL (higher MG-QoL15 score values; estimated marginal means of MG-QoL15 
scale score for female vs. male patients = 2.86 95%CI [1.48; 4.24]). The same was observed for escalation therapy 
with IVIG or Rituximab (estimated marginal means of MG-QoL15 scale score for escalation therapy vs. no

sion = 0.12 95%CI [0.09; 0.15]; Adj  R2 = 0.22), suggesting that depression, as possible comorbidity of the patient, 
explained in part the association between MG severity and caregiver burden (adj  R2 = 0.223). In model 2, higher 
depression categories were significantly associated with higher BSFC scale scores (Fig. 2).

Adjusting for gender in model 3 and for the other potentially confounding variables in model 4 showed no 
substantial change in effect estimates, suggesting that these factors did not have an impact on the association 
between MG severity and caregiver burden (Table 4), except thymectomy having a minor impact.

Discussion
This study demonstrates that symptoms of depression, anxiety disorder, and PTSD in MG patients were not only 
high among MG patients but that, with implications of higher prevalences of depression and anxiety disorder, 
these conditions might also be underdiagnosed. Out of all MG patients, 81.4% reported no diagnosed mental 
health condition. Patients with higher MG severity reported depression and anxiety disorder more frequently 
than patients with lower MG severity. MG disease severity was strongly associated with patients’ HRQoL as well 
as caregiver burden. Beyond MG severity, symptoms of depression had negative effects on HRQoL in MG patients 
as well as on caregiver burden. In addition to the effect of depression, patients’ HRQoL as well as caregiver 
burden were negatively associated with the patient’s female gender and positively associated with thymectomy.
In the literature so far, the prevalence of depression in MG patients differed between 14 and 58%9,20, whereas 
the prevalence of anxiety disorders ranged between 20 and 55%21–23,. This variability can be explained by the 
considerable heterogeneity of the cohorts, sample sizes, clinical measures, and assessment methods, including 
the diagnostic criteria used. PTSD has been reported in 51% of MG patients after an episode of respiratory insuf-
ficiency. A positive finding in PTSD screening was more likely in patients with higher HADS score  values24. The 
prevalence of psychiatric comorbidities in the general population in  Germany25 is much lower when compared 
to this study’s findings of related symptoms in the MG cohort data (15.4% vs. 35.5% for anxiety; 8.2% vs. 30.8% 
for symptoms of depression, and 2.3% vs. 4.9% for PTSD). Interestingly, the PTSD-7 results revealed similar 
rates of PTSD in MG patients with a history of an exacerbation and a myasthenic crisis. Compared to the preva-
lence of anxiety disorder of 24% to 29% in post-stroke and 22% in multiple sclerosis patients, MG patients were 
substantially affected more  often26–28.

Our data based on the HADS questionnaire suggests an underdiagnosis of depression and anxiety disorder 
MG patients. MG patients with symptoms of depression and anxiety disorder had a corresponding diagnosis in 
only 23.3% and 12.7%, respectively.

In the largest study to date which has been conducted prior to 2010, 38.6% of 1518 patients had a diagnosed 
 depression10, the rates were three times higher than in our study but close to the results of HADS. While the other 
characteristics of the MG patients were very similar to our study with both being conducted in Germany, the 
difference is likely due to a changed situation in MG patients’ care (previously combined specialty for neurology 
and psychiatry with now often separated residency tracks). Our study highlights the importance of increasing 
the awareness of mental health conditions and the necessity for implementing diagnostic measures, such as 
easy-to-use screening tools. These tools might help to diagnose and treat comorbid mental health conditions in 
MG patients more effectively. For example, studies have shown that stroke patients benefit from screening for 
 depression29.

The simultaneous presence of MG and symptoms of depression, for instance, can be challenging for diagnos-
ing depression in MG patients and vice versa. Thus, depressive symptoms can be misinterpreted as myasthenic 
symptoms such as fatigue and the other way around. In contrast, the difficulty in clearly distinguishing symp-
toms of depression from fatigability and fatigue symptoms of MG might lead to delayed or misdiagnosis in MG 
 patients30. It has been reported that only one patient out of ten with myasthenic symptoms gets an adequate MG 
 diagnosis31. Young women are more likely to get a psychiatric diagnosis, whereas men are more often misdiag-
nosed with other somatic  diseases32. This is consistent with our study’s findings that women have significantly 
higher latencies in diagnosis than men (3.0 vs. 1.3 years). This not only raises the question of why women are 
diagnosed later but also whether a higher latency of diagnosis increases the risk for depression in women. The 
overlap of myasthenic and depressive symptoms in MG patients (with or without comorbid depression) leads to 
difficulties for physicians in making an adequate diagnosis. We demonstrated a strong association between self-
reported disease severity and HRQoL, which is largely affected by comorbid depression. This is consistent with 
the results of a previous study of eighty  patients33. Our results suggest that depressive symptoms are—amongst 
the variables we investigated—the most influential factor affecting the perceived MG severity and HRQoL. We 
cannot rule out that the effect is at least partially inverse, with higher MG severity and lower HRQoL leading 
to a higher likelihood to develop depressive symptoms. The female gender was strongly associated with lower 
HRQoL corroborating findings of previous  studies5,34. It has also been reported that the female gender as well 
as depression are directly associated with worse disease  severity35,36. Several factors might explain the gender 
differences in HRQoL, including differences in experiencing and reporting the severity of symptoms in general. 
Female patients tend to report significantly more physical symptoms and higher symptom severity levels than 
 men37, which might reduce the HRQoL as shown by our results. Secondly, according to our data female patients 
experienced a long latency between the onset of symptoms and diagnosis. During this period, circumstances like 
physician hopping, inadequate therapies, the experience of discrimination and humiliation, and misdiagnosis 
due to broad differential diagnoses might be stressful and therefore affect the HRQoL. The understanding of 
the interaction of depression, gender, perceived disease severity, and HRQoL in MG patients is scarce. A recent 
study with 179 patients showed a moderate correlation between disease severity and depression as well as the 
female  gender35. For other chronic diseases like chronic renal disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and cardiovascular 
disease depression is a known factor affecting perceived disease  severity38–40.

Vol.:(0123456789)www.nature.com/scientificreports/We observed an improved HRQoL after thymectomy. Consistent with our results, gender differences in 
HRQoL were abolished in MG patients after  thymectomy34. The burden of disease was lower after thymectomy, 
and patients had fewer exacerbations and also required less immunosuppressive  medication41,42.

MG disease severity and the caregiver burden were strongly associated. Symptoms of depression increased 
the effect of this association, but it also had a direct and negative effect on the caregiver burden. In the general 
population, the mental status of a care recipient was associated with the caregiver burden and, more importantly, 
the caregiver burden was nearly significant in predicting depression in  caregivers43. Thus, another important 
aspect of MG care should be the provision of supportive measures not only for patients but also for their caregiv-
ers. For example, when caregivers are under greater strain, outpatient care services, and psychological assistance, 
especially with systemic therapy, psycho-education, and self-help groups can provide relief to the social tension 
field of families. Female patients’ caregivers showed a lower caregiver burden, whereas female caregivers of male 
MG patients experienced a higher burden. In general, female caregivers experience a more significant caregiver 
burden than  men44. The higher strain has been explained by women experiencing more secondary stressors, 
such as financial and relational problems. Depending on the cultural background and the social norms of gender, 
women feel more obligated to provide care than men and feel more  strain45.

Our study has several limitations. Although our analyses are based on a large group of patients, we cannot 
be confident that our cohort is representative. Most participants were members of the national self-help group 
representing approximately a quarter of all German MG patients. Moreover, we investigated only German MG 
patients. Although the Global Burden of Disease data from the World Health Organization (WHO) showed 
comparable prevalences amongst high-income countries like European Countries or the United  States46, our data 
might not reflect the situation of MG patients in low-income countries. Importantly, due to the cross-sectional 
design of our study, we cannot conclude causality. Psychiatric disorders such as depression and anxiety disorders 
can be misdiagnosed as myasthenia gravis and vice versa. This is due to the overlapping complaints as well as 
the methodological limits of a patient survey. Thus, psychiatric comorbidities including PTSD may then also be 
captured too sensitively. Although the HADS is a reliable screening tool for assessing depression and anxiety, it 
is not identical to the ICD-10 diagnostic criteria and thus clinical diagnosis. The prevalence of depression based 
on HADS screening may therefore be  overestimated47. Similarly, our results from the PTSD-7 questionnaire must 
be interpreted cautiously, as they cannot be equated with a PTSD diagnosis. Another limitation is our definition 
of myasthenic crisis. To distinguish between myasthenic crisis and exacerbation, we asked patients not only 
whether they had a "myasthenic crisis" but also whether they were treated in an intensive care unit setting in that 
case. For patients who reported a myasthenic crisis and were treated in an intensive care unit, we assumed that 
they had a myasthenic crisis. For patients who reported a myasthenic crisis and were treated in a normal ward 
setting, we assumed that they had an exacerbation. For assessing gender-related differences in QoL and disease 
burden we used a heteronormative approach, which does not consider non-binary gender as well as same-sex 
partnership. Finally, we used the MG-QoL15 scale and not yet the new slightly revised version (MG-QoL15r), 
which is preferred in current research because of its slightly better  performance48.

Conclusion
A higher awareness of mental illnesses like depression or anxiety is urgently required in MG care. Measures for 
depression, anxiety disorder, HRQoL, and activities of daily life should be standard tools in MG care. Female 
MG patients are at higher risk and might benefit from a systematic approach to mental health status assessment 
in particular. This strategy should be applied as early as possible in the course of the disease to offer appropriate 
treatment services, such as psychotherapeutic care in the outpatient setting. Our findings suggest that guideline-
based treatment of depression can improve perceived illness severity and HRQoL in MG patients and reduce 
caregiver burden.
