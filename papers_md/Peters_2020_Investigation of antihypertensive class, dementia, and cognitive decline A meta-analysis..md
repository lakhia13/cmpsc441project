Abstract

Objective
High blood pressure is one of the main modiﬁable risk factors for dementia. However, there is conﬂicting evidence
regarding the best antihypertensive class for optimizing cognition. Our objective was to determine whether any
particular antihypertensive class was associated with a reduced risk of cognitive decline or dementia using compre-
hensive meta-analysis including reanalysis of original participant data.

Methods
To identify suitable studies, MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO and preexisting study consortia were searched from
inception to December 2017. Authors of prospective longitudinal human studies or trials of antihypertensives were
contacted for data sharing and collaboration. Outcome measures were incident dementia or incident cognitive decline
(classiﬁed using the reliable change index method). Data were separated into mid and late-life (>65 years) and each
antihypertensive class was compared to no treatment and to treatment with other antihypertensives. Meta-analysis
was used to synthesize data.

Results
Over 50,000 participants from 27 studies were included. Among those aged >65 years, with the exception of diuretics,
we found no relationship by class with incident cognitive decline or dementia. Diuretic use was suggestive of beneﬁt in
some analyses but results were not consistent across follow-up time, comparator group, and outcome. Limited data
precluded meaningful analyses in those ≤65 years of age.

Conclusion
Our ﬁndings, drawn from the current evidence base, support clinical freedom in the selection of antihypertensive
regimens to achieve blood pressure goals.

Clinical trials registration
The review was registered with the international prospective register of systematic reviews (PROSPERO), regis-
tration number CRD42016045454.

Dementia is a major public health problem aﬀecting around
50 million individuals worldwide. A new case is diagnosed
every 3 seconds and prevalence is estimated to rise to 131.5
million cases by 2050.1 High blood pressure (BP) is widely
recognized as one of the main modiﬁable risk factors for
dementia.2–5 Even though BP-lowering treatment is readily
available, we lack clinical hypertension guidelines for the
management of brain health. This reﬂects in part the con-
ﬂicting evidence on the best antihypertensive class for opti-
mizing cognitive outcomes and reducing risk of dementia,
with some classes, e.g., calcium channel blockers, thought to
have a pleiotropic neuroprotective eﬀect beyond BP-
lowering.3,4,6–14 Existing meta-analyses are limited because
information is lost with pooling of published results that
conﬂate data across diﬀerent age groups (mid and late-life);
lack data on minimum length of exposure to antihypertensive
class; adjust for diﬀering confounders; use diﬀering statistical
measures, variable deﬁnitions of cognitive outcomes, and
varied lengths of follow-up; and combine treated and un-
treated comparator groups.11–14 We have conducted a two-
stage individual participant data meta-analysis examining an-
tihypertensive class using standardized measures across
studies and subsequent meta-analysis. Data from 56,866
participants drawn from 27 studies were synthesized to eval-
uate the relationship between each antihypertensive class and
incident cognitive decline and dementia.

Experts in the ﬁeld were also consulted and searches were
carried out for relevant trials using the following sources:

studies)

The lead reviewer (R.P.) carried out the literature searches.
All identiﬁed abstracts, or titles where abstracts were un-
available, were double-read and a list of potentially relevant
evidence compiled independently by each of the 2 reviewers
(R.P., J.P.). The lists were compared with diﬀerences resolved
by discussion. Once the list of possible publications was
agreed upon,
full texts of relevant documents were in-
dependently read and assessed for relevance. To minimize the
eﬀect of publication bias, a list of potentially eligible studies
was also compiled by examining those included in preexisting
consortia,
i.e., collaborative groups of longitudinal studies
with a focus on cognitive outcomes. Publications, protocols,
and web information were searched for each of the studies in
the consortia to identify whether they might have suitable data
for inclusion. The lead or corresponding author from each
publication/study was then contacted and asked to provide
raw data or aggregate data summaries, using a standard tem-
plate, for use in a study-level meta-analysis.

Methods
Data sources and searches
To identify studies for inclusion in this systematic review and
meta-analysis,
the databases MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-
Process, Embase, and PsycINFO were searched from in-
ception to December 2017. The search terms used were (de-
mentia or cognit* or mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer
disease or dementia vascular or dementia multi-infarct) and
(antihypertensives or antihypertensive agents or diuretic or
diuretics or thiazide or thiazide-like or calcium channel blocker
or calcium channel blockers or calcium antagonist or
angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin-
converting enzyme inhibitors or ACE inhibitors or angioten-
sin receptor blocker or angiotensin receptor blockers or ARB or
β-blocker or adrenergic β-antagonist). Details of the search
strategy are given in appendix e-A (doi.org/10.5061/dryad.
t9n4n3p). Reference lists and lists of studies contained within
established study consortia relating to cognitive outcomes were
screened for potentially relevant published articles and studies.

AHM classes were deﬁned as calcium channel blockers (CCB),
angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I), diuretics,
β-blockers (BB), and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB).

Participants with a diagnosis of dementia or cognitive im-
pairment at baseline were excluded. Incident cognitive decline
was assessed using the reliable change index (RCI) using the
Chelunes method.15 Since the cognitive data are drawn from
diﬀerent populations and with some variation in repeat testing
times, this method allows standardization of reliable decline
across cognitive tests with a fall in the RCI value greater than
1.645, i.e., changes exceeding the 90% conﬁdence interval
(CI) for RCI categorized as reliable. Follow-up cognitive
testing was required to be after the minimum 1 year AHM
exposure period and cognitive change was assessed sub-
sequent to or concurrent with this. Cognitive tests were cat-
egorized as screening tests and tests of memory, executive
function, attention, and speed of processing. Incident de-
mentia was classiﬁed as present or absent. Dementia type was
not considered because of the high likelihood of mixed
pathology.

As the relationship between BP and cognitive function may
diﬀer in mid and late life,3–5 data were dichotomized by age
into (late-life) >65 years at baseline vs (midlife) ≤65 years. To
reduce risk of bias from short follow-up, lag periods of 1 and 5
years were used such that data were separated into those with
follow-up durations of ≥1 or ≥5 years. The requirement for
a minimum follow-up period reduces the risk of inadvertently
including prevalent cases. Where study visit frequency meant
that all participants had ≥5 years follow-up, i.e., participants
were only seen at intervals of 5 or more years, these were
included in the latter category. The analyses for each study
dataset followed the same procedure.

Data synthesis and analyses
Meta-analyses were conducted for the endpoints of both
cognitive decline and dementia.

Each antihypertensive class was examined separately;

BP or, where this was unavailable, for the presence of hy-
pertension at baseline, plus age, sex, and education. Adjusted
results were combined to produce a pooled odds ratio (OR).
Raw data relating to the number of cases and controls for
each class were also combined to produce an unadjusted
pooled ratio. Forest plots were used to show study level and
pooled ratios.

To evaluate bias due to participant loss by AHM class, the
eﬀect of baseline AHM class on later mortality or dropout was
also examined using logistic regression. These analyses were
adjusted for baseline systolic BP or presence of hypertension,
age, sex, and education.

Random eﬀects models were used for meta-analyses, regard-
less of heterogeneity measured by I2, since the studies were
drawn from a range of populations. Where only one study was
available for a particular analysis, no meta-analysis could be
carried out and results were not reported. The I2 statistic and
Egger test were used to examine heterogeneity and publica-
tion bias, respectively.

Finally, to broadly examine the role of study-level character-
istics, study OR for the comparison between AHM and no
treatment or placebo were plotted against the primary decade
of recruitment and percentage of participants who were fe-
male, and additional multilevel regression models were run
with study OR as the dependent variable. In addition, because
of potential diﬀerences in the relationship between hyper-
tension and cognitive outcomes by sex, analyses comparing
AHM to no treatment or placebo were rerun separately for
male and female participants.

Standard protocol approvals, registrations,
and patient consents
The review was registered with the international prospective
register of systematic reviews (PROSPERO), registration num-
ber CRD42016045454. Ethical approval was obtained from the
Science and Medical Human Research Medical Committee
(DERC). Australian National University approval (reference
2016/500) was granted September 23, 2016. Analyses were
carried out using SAS v9.3 and StatsDirect v3.0.198.

Data availability
Data availability depends on agreement from each of the
participating studies subject to their regulatory requirements
and appropriate data sharing arrangements.

Because cognitive change is insidious, classiﬁcation of event
dates is problematic for cognitive outcomes. To reduce bias
associated with diﬀerent study designs and varied duration
between cognitive assessments, logistic regression models
were used with incident cognitive decline or dementia as the
dependent variable. Since the eﬀect of AHM class on cog-
nitive function is thought to be pleiotropic, models exam-
ining class were adjusted at study level for baseline systolic

Results
Study characteristics
A pool of 2,429 abstracts was screened and 82 articles were
examined at the full-text stage. Of these, articles reporting on 27

psychological testing. Due to variation in the timing of study
visits, baseline age, and data on exposure to antihypertensive
class, and cognitive test or dementia outcome, the number of
studies combined in each meta-analysis varied.

Late-life >65 years, incident dementia
For those aged >65 years, we evaluated the eﬀect of anti-
hypertensive class compared to no antihypertensive treat-
ment or placebo for incident dementia. After adjustment for
age, sex, baseline SBP, and education, there was no associ-
ation between CCB, ACE-I, BB, or ARB use and risk of
developing dementia compared to those without treatment
or with placebo and among studies with ≥5-year or ≥1-year
follow-up (for ≥5-year follow-up, see table 1 and ﬁgure 1,
and for ≥1-year follow-up, table e-2, doi.org/10.5061/dryad.

a statistically signiﬁcant lower risk of incident dementia only
in those with ≥1-year
follow-up (OR 0.83; 95% CI
0.72–0.96), but not statistically signiﬁcant in those with
≥5 years of follow-up (OR 0.84; 95% CI 0.55–1.29). Un-
adjusted results showed a similar association (table e-3,

table e-4, doi.org/10.5061/dryad.t9n4n3p). Unadjusted
results were similar (table e-5, doi.org/10.5061/dryad.
t9n4n3p).

Data for further analyses per cognitive domain were available
for a subset of cohorts and suﬃcient to allow meta-analyses
for the cognitive domains of memory and attention but not for
speed of processing or executive function. For memory, BB
use was associated with an increased risk of decline in those
with ≥1-year follow-up pooled ratio (OR 1.53; 95% CI
1.04–2.27). There were no further statistically signiﬁcant
associations between AHM class and incident decline in
memory or attention measures (table e-6, doi.org/10.5061/
dryad.t9n4n3p).

Heterogeneity and publication bias
Point estimates varied considerably in direction and magni-
tude per study (ﬁgures 1 and 2 and ﬁgures e-2 and e-3, doi.
org/10.5061/dryad.t9n4n3p). Heterogeneity in the meta-
analyses ranged from 0% to 67.7% (tables 1 and 2 and tables
e-2 and e-3, doi.org/10.5061/dryad.t9n4n3p), but publica-
tion bias measured by Egger test was only observed for BB
compared to the untreated population for dementia in those
with ≥1-year follow-up (p = 0.0471) and for ACE-I compared
to those with other antihypertensive treatment for dementia
in those with ≥5 years of follow-up (p = 0.0362). Overall,
there were no consistent patterns for either dementia or
cognitive decline outcomes.

Mortality and attrition by
antihypertensive class
Additional analyses were performed to assess whether there
was an association between baseline AHM class and risk of
death or dropout. OR for the outcomes death and dropout
(combined) for the diﬀerent AHM classes adjusted for age,
sex, education, and baseline SBP or, where this was unavail-
able, for presence of hypertension at baseline, were as follows:
diuretics, OR 0.95 (95% CI 0.79–1.13); BB, OR 0.98 (95% CI
0.86–1.12); CCB, OR 0.93 (95% CI 0.76–1.13); ACE-I, OR
1.04 (95% CI 0.94–1.16); and ARB, OR 0.79 (95% CI
0.63–1.00). For some studies, data were available for either
dropout or death but not both. Results did not change when
the analyses were rerun excluding these studies.

Midlife ≤65 years
Fewer data were available in the ≤65 age group. No dis-
cernible pattern of results was evident for the diﬀering an-
tihypertensive classes (table e-7, doi.org/10.5061/dryad.
t9n4n3p).

Secondary analyses: Antihypertensive

≥1-year or ≥5-year follow-ups, adjusted for age, sex, educa-
tion, and baseline SBP or presence of hypertension. Further
analyses in a subset of 10 cohorts adjusting only for age, sex,
and education to avoid overadjustment for BP did not change
conclusions. In RCTs, there were no statistically signiﬁcant
associations between AHM use in RCT populations with ≥1-
year follow-up and either incident dementia or cognitive de-
cline (table e-8, doi.org/10.5061/dryad.t9n4n3p). However
with ≥5 years of follow-up, AHM use was associated with
a 35% lower risk of developing dementia in the fully adjusted
pooled ratio (OR 0.65; 95% CI 0.51–0.82), but the associa-
tion was not statistically signiﬁcant with the risk of incident
cognitive decline (OR 0.44; 95% CI 0.15–1.25).

In those aged ≤65 years, 2 cohort studies were available to
compare antihypertensive treatment with no treatment or
placebo and could be combined for the outcome of dementia in
those with ≥5 years of follow-up (pooled OR 0.79; 95% CI,
0.43–1.48). Four cohorts were similarly pooled for the out-
come of incident cognitive decline in those with ≥5 years of
follow-up (pooled OR 1.00; 95% CI 0.60–1.67) and 2 cohorts
for cognitive decline in those with ≥1 year of follow-up (pooled
OR 1.15; 95% CI 0.81–1.64). There were 2 RCTs with data
available for cognitive decline in those with ≥1 year of follow-up
(pooled OR 0.91; 95% CI 0.57–6.42). There were no data to
examine dementia outcomes in those with ≥1 year of follow-up.

Results for AHM treatment compared to no treatment were
diﬀerent for RCTs and cohort studies, and the RCTs reported
the highest baseline SBP. It is possible that RCTs, despite the
placebo eﬀect, have had comparator untreated populations at
higher risk than untreated populations in the cohort studies.
Where data were available, the cohort studies in general
reported only small to moderate diﬀerences between mean
baseline BP in their treated and untreated populations. This
suggests the possibility of some degree of successful BP control
over time in the treated group, at least in some of the cohorts.

Sensitivity analyses
There were no clear patterns in ﬁndings or signiﬁcant rela-
tionships by study type for those that were not trials of anti-
hypertensives or when the OR of the participating study
samples were plotted against decade of recruitment or per-
centage of female participants (appendix e-C, doi.org/10.
5061/dryad.t9n4n3p). Furthermore, rerunning the treated
and untreated comparison by sex in those >65 years showed
no diﬀerences for men and women (table e-9, doi.org/
10.5061/dryad.t9n4n3p).

risk, but this was not consistent across cognitive outcomes
(dementia, cognitive decline), comparator group (no treat-
ment or treatment with other antihypertensives), or length of
follow-up (≥1 or ≥5 years). To be speciﬁc: (1) diuretic use
compared to no AHM or placebo was not associated with
a reduced risk of cognitive decline and was only associated with
a reduced risk of dementia in those with ≥1 but not ≥5 years of
follow-up; and (2) diuretic use compared to other AHM was
not associated with a reduced risk of dementia and was only
associated with a reduced risk of cognitive decline (MMSE) in
those with ≥5 but not ≥1 year of follow-up. Use of BB com-
pared to no AHM was associated with an increased risk of
decline in memory in a subset of 7 cohorts with available data in
those with ≥1 year of follow-up only and showed no relation-
ship with incident dementia or general cognitive decline. Sec-
ondary analyses found AHM to be associated with a reduced
risk of dementia and cognitive decline compared to placebo in
hypertensive clinical trial populations with ≥5 years of follow-
up. No association was observed in cohort studies.

Evidence in context
To our knowledge, this study is the ﬁrst of its kind examining
the eﬀect of antihypertensive drug class on cognitive out-
comes using reanalyzed individual data standardized across
and assembled from individual studies. Similarly, it is the ﬁrst,
to our knowledge, that uses standardized measures of cogni-
tive decline; looks separately at midlife and late life; requires
a minimum exposure to antihypertensive treatment; and
examines both short- and longer-term follow-up as recom-
mended for the robust evaluation of incident dementia.10

The association between diuretics and reduced risk of cognitive
decline or dementia is promising. However, given the variation in
results from the individual studies and the lack of any consis-
tently clear ﬁnding across cognitive outcomes, these results
should be interpreted with caution. Furthermore, as one of the
earlier classes of drug, diuretics may have been used more fre-
quently as ﬁrst-line treatment. As such, they may dispropor-
tionately represent
those more recently diagnosed with
hypertension or those with lower severity or chronicity of hy-
pertension, which may have been associated with relatively lower
disk of cognitive decline and dementia. The absence of a clear
beneﬁt of one antihypertensive class over another is congruent
with the cardiovascular literature47 and the mixed nature of the
current evidence base. For example, the cognitive function lit-
erature has reported on diﬀerent combinations of singular and
multiple antihypertensive classes and found varyingly in favor of
diuretics,12 ARB,13,14 ACE-I,13,14 CCB,11 and BB48 without the
evidence coalescing consistently in favor of one particular class.

Discussion
In this standardized comprehensive analysis examining the
associations between AHM class and incident dementia or
cognitive decline, we found no consistent pattern of evidence
to support the beneﬁt of one AHM class over another. In those
aged >65 years, use of diuretics was associated with a reduced

Regarding AHM as a group, our meta-analyses that compared
treated and untreated groups reported a signiﬁcant result only
in the RCT data of those with ≥5 years of follow-up. This is
congruent with, but larger than, the reductions seen in the
existing literature.9 One explanation for the lack of a ﬁnding
in cohort studies could be the comparison of a higher-
risk already-treated group with a lower-risk untreated

normotensive comparator group. That is not to imply that
further reduction in BP would not result in a lowering of risk,
as has recently been suggested in the Systolic Blood Pressure
Intervention Trial–Memory and Cognition in Decreased
Hypertension (SPRINT-MIND),49 although of course close
monitoring would be needed to avoid excessive lowering and
potential harm. It is also possible that there are diﬀerences in
the decision-making of participants when choosing to enter
intervention studies compared with non-intervention-based
cohort studies, leading to representation of diﬀerent pop-
ulation groups, neither of which may be representative of the
general population. There were, moreover, relatively few
studies with data from the midlife age group or with domain-
speciﬁc neuropsychological outcomes (which are arguably
more robust than the MMSE). In addition, a recent study has
suggested that genetic risk may inﬂuence the relationship
between AHM, speciﬁcally ACE-I, and cognitive outcomes50
and should therefore be taken into account, but these data
were unavailable for our analyses.

Strengths and limitations
Prior systematic reviews, observational studies, and clinical
trials reporting on antihypertensive class and cognition have
risked bias due to inclusion of participants without requirement
for any minimum follow-up or minimum exposure to a partic-
ular class, without separation of participants from mid and late-
life, and often without standardization of cognitive decline.
Unlike prior work, strengths of this study include (1) mini-
mizing the risk of publication bias by deriving data from sys-
tematic
consortia;
(2) combining data from a large number of participants across
a wide geographical range of studies, maximizing the inclusion
of relevant data; (3) standardization of exposure to antihy-
pertensive classes (minimum exposure 1 year); (4) separation
of data into exposure in mid and late-life age groups (>65, ≤65
years); (5) requirement of a minimum follow-up/lag period
(≥1 and ≥5 years), i.e., excluding those who were followed for
less than 12 months; (6) standardization of cognitive decline
across varied time periods and taking account of variation
within each sample; (7) standardization of statistical methods
and available covariates; (8) use of both unadjusted and ad-
justed results; (9) comparison of each class against no treat-
ment and against other antihypertensive treatment; and (10)
a low level of heterogeneity in the analyses.

Limitations include a potential diﬀerential dropout or survivor
bias in normotensive or controlled hypertensive participants;
nevertheless, there was no association between baseline AHM
class and subsequent dropout or death, suggesting no par-
ticular bias by class for inclusion in these longitudinal analyses.
There was a lack of data available on individual drug or drug
subclass and dose, reasons for prescription choice, and, as is
common to all such observational studies and most clinical
trials, an unavoidable overlap between classes, where partic-
ipants are prescribed additional classes as needed to control
their BP. However, if pleiotropic eﬀects were present by class,
they might be expected to be shown regardless. Furthermore,

there is no strong evidence as yet to suspect that any pleio-
tropic eﬀect by class would manifest only in a subpopulation,
and our results show no obvious pattern by age, sex, or decade
of study recruitment. Further limitations include the in-
evitable use of a general cognitive screening instrument, the
MMSE, which although allowing us comparability across
studies is far from the sophisticated neuropsychological test-
ing that would ideally be used to measure cognitive change.
The classiﬁcation or diagnosis of cognitive decline and de-
mentia during a disease process with insidious onset and
progression is also inevitably open to bias in any study and
particularly where data are maximized in a combined study
such as ours. Pragmatic use of the RCI and standardized
dementia diagnoses for binary outcomes without taking time
to event into account is the most robust option but may lose
some of the subtleties available within individual cohorts.

Future perspectives
Outstanding questions remain and future research should in-
vestigate whether the results would diﬀer had we been able to
take fuller account of the changing relationships among BP,
treatment, aging, and cognition using a life-course approach and
had had access to further data from those younger than ≤65 years
or examined those with existing cognitive impairment. It is also
unclear whether there are selected drugs or subclasses that have
particular protective or detrimental eﬀects on cognition and the
current studies were not equipped with suﬃcient detail to ex-
amine this. Future clinical trials could investigate this in detail
using careful single drug comparisons and comprehensive
neuropsychological testing. Furthermore, despite the positive
results we found from the clinical trial samples we included,
there has been no clinical trial designed primarily to test the
eﬀect of BP-lowering on cognitive function. This remains
a crucial gap in the evidence base.

Our ﬁndings show some support for the message that low-
ering BP may lower dementia risk while also supporting
clinical freedom in the selection of antihypertensive regimens
to achieve BP goals.
