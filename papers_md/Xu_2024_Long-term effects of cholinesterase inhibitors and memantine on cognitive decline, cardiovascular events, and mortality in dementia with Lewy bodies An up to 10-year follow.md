Abstract

INTRODUCTION: We aimed to assess the impact of cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEIs)

and memantine on cognition, major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) and

mortality in dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB).

METHODS: A total of 1,095 incident DLB patients from the Swedish Registry on cog-

nitive/dementia disorders were included. Using an inverse probability of treatment

weighting, the effect of initiating ChEI or memantine within 90 days of DLB diagnosis

and nonuse was evaluated on cognitive trajectories and risks of MACE and death.

RESULTS: The use of ChEIs significantly slowed cognitive decline at follow-ups (Mini-

Mental State Examination [MMSE] -0.39 points/y; 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.96

to 0.18) compared to memantine (-2.49 points/y; -4.02 to -0.97) and nonuse (-2.50

points/y; -4.28 to -0.73). Treatment groups did not differ in MACE events. ChEI use

was associated with lower risk of death in the first year after DLB diagnosis (adjusted

hazard ratio [HR] 0.66, 95% CI 0.46, 0.94).

DISCUSSION: Our findings illuminate the potential benefits of ChEI treatment in DLB

patients.

BACKGROUND

Lewy body disease, which includes dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB)

with a lower all-cause mortality risk in a propensity score-matched

Alzheimer’s disease (AD).1 DLB has been shown to account for approx-
imately 10-15% of dementia cases,2 with an incidence rate ranging
from 1 to 5 per 1000 person/year.3 The global prevalence of DLB is

projected to increase from 5.5 million individuals in 2020, 14 million by
2050.4 DLB is associated with faster cognitive and functional decline
compared to AD.5 This leads to a notably worsening of quality of life in
affected individuals when contrasted with AD patients.6 Furthermore,

leading to elevated acetylcholine levels in the synapses of both central
and peripheral nervous system,23 with positive effects on cognitive

function, amelioration of psychiatric symptoms, and activation of the
cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway (CAP).24–26 Validation of these

findings in other populations with differing characteristics is important

to establish robust treatment recommendations in patients with

DLB.

The goal of this study was to investigate the long-term use of

with dementia from the time of the dementia diagnosis in Sweden. The

It is noteworthy that most clinical trials for DLB have been limited

to a maximum duration of 6 months to 1 year, leaving a paucity of

MMSE scores, type of dementia, and treatment at diagnosis date
and annual follow-ups.27 For this study, we integrated SveDem with

knowledge regarding the long-term effects of these treatments on

often requires a multidisciplinary approach involving neurologists,

geriatricians, neuropsychologists, and other specialists.

There is no information on ethnicity in Sweden. Participants and

their caregivers were informed verbally and in writing about SveDem

and had the option to decline participation. However, the require-

ment of written consent for this study was waived due to the register

data being pseudonymized before delivery to our research group. The

regional ethics committee in Stockholm approved the study, which
complied with the Declaration of Helsinki.29

2.2

Study population

We conducted a cohort study using a landmark design to compare

cognition trajectories and adverse outcomes among patients diag-

nosed with DLB who were prescribed different treatments within 3

months of diagnosis. The treatments considered were ChEI alone or

memantine alone, versus no treatment. To form our study population,

we identified all patients who received an incident diagnosis of DLB

and were registered in SveDem between May 1, 2007, and December
31, 2018 (n = 1,696). We excluded patients who were already on

ChEI or memantine at the time of their dementia diagnosis (prevalent
ChEI users, n = 320 or memantine users, n = 47), as well as those
who started concomitantly with both therapies (n = 56). An additional

122 individuals were excluded because of missing MMSE scores at
the time of diagnosis (n = 94) or with a baseline MMSE score < 10
(n = 28). The reason for this exclusion was that ChEIs in Sweden
should be initiated in mild to moderate dementia (MMSE score ≥10),

1. Systematic review: Currently, dementia with Lewy bod-

ies (DLB) lacks approved treatments, leading to off-label

use of cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEIs) and memantine

for symptom relief. However, the effectiveness of ChEIs

in DLB remains uncertain due to inconsistent trial results

and limited long-term data. The goal of the study is to

investigate the long-term effects of ChEIs and memantine

over 10 years, assessing their impact on cognitive decline,

major cardiovascular events, and all-cause mortality in

DLB patients.

2.

Interpretation: In this treatment-weighted cohort study,

the use of ChEIs in patients with DLB, compared to

memantine treatment or nonuse, is associated with a

reduced risk of cognitive decline over 5 years. No sig-

nificant differences in major cardiovascular events were

observed between all groups. However, ChEI use was

associated with lower mortality at the first year of follow-

up, but not in longer follow-up.

3. Future directions: Our findings shed light on the poten-

tial cognitive benefits of ChEI treatment in DLB patients.

Further research is necessary to elucidate the underlying

mechanisms and explore potential pleiotropic effects of

ChEIs on long-term outcomes.

DISCUSSION

In this large, longitudinal, nationwide DLB cohort, ChEI use slowed cog-

nitive decline compared to memantine and nonuse. A dose-response

relationship suggested higher ChEI doses provided greater cogni-

tive benefits. Significantly improved MMSE scores were noted for

donepezil and galantamine, but not rivastigmine. Memantine showed

challenges.

Our study found significantly slower cognitive decline in patients

using ChEI, consistent with several clinical
trials and meta-
analyses.12,33,34 For instance, a randomized, placebo-controlled
trial in Japan with DLB patients (n = 140) showed donepezil (5 mg or

10 mg) improved MMSE scores by 2.4-3.8 points after 12 weeks, with
positive changes in behavioral symptoms and caregiver burden.35 The
cognitive benefits of donepezil persisted in an open-label extension,36
whereas a phase III study only confirmed benefits for the 10 mg dose.37

no significant cognitive effect. Contrary to our prior findings in AD and

our initial hypothesis, ChEI in DLB did not reduce major adverse car-

Our findings, however, disagree with other trials/studies. For

instance, a recent network meta-analysis, which included eight ran-

and 10 mg), rivastigmine (not mentioned dose in the meta-analysis), or

its associated cholinergic projections, has been shown already in the

system has been associated with cognitive functioning in individuals
with prodromal DLB.43 Similarly, DLB patients’ performance on the

MMSE correlates with the degree of impairment in their choliner-
gic circuits, as assessed through transcranial magnetic stimulation.44

Of note, associations between volume loss in the basal forebrain and

cognitive impairments were repeatedly shown to be stronger in DLB
compared to AD patients.45,46 This observation, coupled with higher
