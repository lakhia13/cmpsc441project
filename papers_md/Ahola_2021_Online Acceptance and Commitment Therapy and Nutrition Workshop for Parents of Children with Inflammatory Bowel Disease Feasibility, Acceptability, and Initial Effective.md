Abstract: Parents of children with inﬂammatory bowel disease (IBD) are important members of
their healthcare team and inﬂuence their child’s adaptation to disease. The primary aim of this
research was to test the feasibility and acceptability of a three-session online parent workshop based
on acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) and address concerns about eating well and nutrition
in IBD. The secondary aim was to explore the initial effectiveness of this workshop in parent reported
psychological ﬂexibility, mindfulness, experiential avoidance, cognitive fusion, valued living, and
symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress. We used a single arm pragmatic prospective study
design with parents of children attending the IBD program at a tertiary pediatric healthcare centre
in Canada. Mixed methods patient reported outcomes were measured at baseline, immediate post
participation, and 3 months post participation in the workshop. Thirty-seven parents enrolled in the
study and feasibility and acceptability goals were largely met. Parents qualitatively described changes
to their parenting, what aspects of the workshop were most helpful, and targeted feedback on how to
improve workshop. Findings suggest that providing parents of children with IBD a brief online ACT
workshop including nutrition guidance is feasible and leads to changes in parenting behaviours.

1. Introduction

The unavoidable physical and emotional discomfort that comes with pediatric in-
ﬂammatory bowel disease (IBD) can negatively impact all aspects of a young persons’
health-related quality of life (HRQL) [1–5]. Parents are critical partners in their child’s
support network and health care team. This is in addition to managing the ﬁnancial,
logistical, emotional, and social demands of parenting in general. Parent mental health and
coping play an important role in their child’s adaptation following a diagnosis of IBD [6].
However, parents of children diagnosed with IBD are at increased risk of anxiety, depres-
sion, and ﬁnancial hardship related to the extra demands inherent in their chronically ill
child’s care [7].

The impact of a parent’s ability to cope with their child’s IBD can have a direct impact
on their child’s ability to cope. Controlling for child age, gender, IBD disease activity, and
pain intensity, parent rumination about their child’s pain was uniquely associated with

their child’s HRQL. This is over and above the child’s rumination or magniﬁcation of
their own pain [6]. Moreover, parent behaviours have also been shown to be an impor-
tant predictor of a child’s report of pain intensity in IBD samples [8–10]. These ﬁndings
highlight the importance of parents’ cognitions and behaviours related to their child’s pain,
regardless of their child’s current IBD disease activity. Greater attention to identifying
and supporting parents who may struggle with coping is critical for both parent and child
overall health. Research has shown that cognitive behavioural and mindfulness-based
therapies are equally effective in reducing stress and burn out in parents of children with
chronic conditions [11]. However, parents often experience barriers in access to parenting
support interventions in pediatric hospital settings (e.g., limited opportunities and trained
professionals, access only in large metropolitan locations). Offering online group-based
parent acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) is one solution to provide parents with
coping strategies and social support from others with shared lived experience.

ACT is a third wave cognitive behavioural therapy based on six interrelated processes:
present moment awareness, acceptance, cognitive defusion, self as context, values, and
committed action. The ACT modality emphasizes changing the way one relates to their
internal experiences, rather than trying to change the form or content of thoughts and
feelings. This approach is ideally suited to individuals with IBD who will inevitably suffer
with unwanted physical sensations (e.g., pain, fatigue, and urgency), feelings (e.g., stress,
anxiety), and thoughts (e.g., ‘is this the start of a ﬂare-up?’). ACT is a transdiagnostic
approach that is efﬁcacious with adults struggling with anxiety and depression and as
such, is applicable to parents with a broad range of symptoms and life circumstances [12].
ACT helps individuals develop the skills necessary to ﬂexibly respond to their internal
experiences (i.e., thoughts and feelings) and behave in a way that consistent with who and
what matters, as opposed to reacting to internal experience in an effort to avoid thoughts
and feelings. Empirical ﬁndings suggest that ACT is effective for improving HRQL in
clinical samples of adults living with chronic illness such as IBD [13,14] and in parents of
children with chronic conditions, chronic pain, and anxiety [11,15–18].

In addition to the need to support coping and increase social support, parents often
seek guidance on diet and nutrition in managing their child’s IBD. The use of complemen-
tary and alternative medicine (CAM), including nutritional supplements, probiotics, and
diets among families affected by IBD is well reported [19–21]. This interest and use of
CAM is common in pediatric IBD, despite being limited evidence for the role of diet and
other types of CAMs in inducing and maintaining disease remission in IBD (excluding
exclusive enteral nutrition in pediatric Crohn’s disease) [22–24]. Diet was also identiﬁed
as a top priority research question in a Canadian survey and meeting, highlighting that
it is an important topic among families impacted by IBD, and a source of concern and
stress [25]. A qualitative study of children with IBD and their families found that most
used the identiﬁcation of speciﬁc foods that inﬂuence symptoms or trigger ﬂare-ups as
a means of coping with IBD [26]. This can lead to food avoidance or exclusion diets in
children and adolescents with IBD, which may or may not be necessary and can negatively
impact nutritional status [27]. However, this study also found that families emphasized
healthy eating in addition to avoidance or moderation of trigger foods, especially due to
the difﬁculty of remaining adherent to exclusion diets (e.g., speciﬁc carbohydrate diet) [26].
Similar research among adults with IBD found that adults struggle signiﬁcantly with deci-
sions about diet, often related to uncertainty of whether a food will exacerbate symptoms
or disease, and encounter challenges with abstaining from foods [28]. Patients with IBD in
this sample also highlighted the social isolation of adhering to diets, given that food is an
integral part of many social events (e.g., birthdays, weddings, and dinner parties) [28].

Taken together, application of evidence-based cognitive behavioural interventions,
such as ACT, in combination with knowledge sharing and guidance on nutrition in IBD,
is a critical integrated multidisciplinary care approach to support families of children
and adolescents with IBD. Offering an ACT workshop online would improve access to
supportive care, while decreasing both direct and indirect costs associated with families

Children 2021, 8, 396

attending in-person workshops or interventions. The holistic and family-based approach
is particularly valuable within pediatric IBD as it can target psychosocial risk factors
known to negatively impact health outcomes (e.g., non-adherence, disease activity) [29–31].
Therefore, the aims of this work are to develop and test the feasibility, and acceptance and
initial effectiveness of a brief group-based online parent workshop, the iACT-P workshop.
The iACT-P workshop teaches ACT-based processes, provides guidance in nutrition, and
facilitates social support. Our work is guided by the following research questions:

1. What is the acceptability of the iACT-P workshop in terms of recruitment, retention,

2.

and perceived parent impact?
Do parents attending the iACT-P workshop experience a reduction in stress, anxiety,
depression, and increase in psychological ﬂexibility as evidenced by increased cogni-
tive defusion, mindfulness, and values-based living immediately after and 3 months
after workshop attendance?

2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Intervention

The iACT-P workshop included 3 weekly 90 min sessions offered during the evenings
on a weekday. Sessions were delivered to parents using Zoom, a secure online video
conferencing platform. iACT-P uses concepts of ACT, a third wave cognitive behavioural
approach based on six main processes to support psychological ﬂexibility [32]. Parents of
children with IBD often express worries about the possibility of a future IBD ﬂare in their
child. Instead of working to reframe or dispute these thoughts given the possibility and
likelihood of future ﬂares, ACT would teach parents skills to focus awareness and energy on
acting based on what is important to them, while taking thoughts and feelings with them,
instead of putting time and effort into trying to avoid or get rid of thoughts and feelings.
This approach allows parents to develop the skills necessary to respond with ﬂexibility
versus react to their internal experiences when parenting while also supporting their child
with IBD. The iACT-P workshop series also included structured content and discussions on
eating well with IBD, led by a registered dietician (IM) with extensive clinical and research
experience working with IBD. All workshop content and discussions were adapted for
parents in the pediatric IBD context. iACT-P workshops were facilitated by a licensed
clinical and health psychologist (SAK) with a longstanding personal mindfulness practice
and advanced training in applied mindfulness, ACT, and teacher training attendance in
mindfulness based cognitive therapy. In addition, parents were provided with electronic
nutrition in IBD handouts, electronic ﬁllable ACT matrix [33], links to free online guided
meditations, apps, and YouTube videos for both parents and children. See Table 1 for
session content.

2.2. Evaluation
2.2.1. Study Design

A pragmatic prospective prepost study design tested the feasibility and preliminary
effectiveness of an online ACT workshop for parents of children with IBD, the iACT-
P workshop.

2.2.2. Participants

Study eligibility criteria included inclusion criteria: (a) parents or primary caregiver
of a patient attending the IBD program at the Hospital for Sick Children (SickKids) in
Toronto, Canada, and (b) ability to speak and read English. Exclusion criteria: (a) signiﬁcant
cognitive or severe psychiatric (e.g., psychosis and active suicidal ideation) impairment in

2.2.3. Procedure

The study was conducted according to the guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki, and
approved by the Institutional Review Board of the SickKids Research Institute (#1000063162,
23 July 2019). Following institutional ethics approval, eligible parents of patients currently
followed in the IBD program at SickKids were invited to participate using standard recruit-
ment approaches (e.g., letters, posters, and approached during a clinic visit). A member
of the IBD team identiﬁed eligible parents and introduced them to the study, and if the
parent was interested, contact information was shared with a research assistant (RA). The
RA obtained consent either in person or via telephone.

Baseline demographic and child disease-related data were obtained from parents
at the time of enrolment. All parent outcome measures were administered online using
REDCap (research electronic data capture), a secure data collection platform. Participants
accessed a unique REDCap survey link via email to complete questionnaire measures
at baseline prior to the iACT-P workshop, immediately following the third session, and
3 months following the last session. Workshops were complementary, yet standalone,
so parents who did not complete all 3 workshops were still able to complete outcome
measures. Parents received a CAD 20 gift card for completing study measures at each
timepoint. Following completion of the iACT-P, parents were also invited to complete a
program feedback interview on the iACT-P with the purposes of improving feasibility and
acceptability in terms of content, structure, and format. Interviews were audio-recorded
and the research coordinator took detailed ﬁeld notes during the interview. Parents were
asked about their experience in the iACT-P workshop, any skills gained from the iACT-P
workshop, likes and dislikes, and any proposed changes to the structure of the workshop.

2.2.4. Measures

The two main outcomes of this study were acceptability and effectiveness of the
iACT-P workshop, as outlined below. All measures are psychometrically sound and have
been validated in adult and parent populations, and, when possible, in samples of parents
of children with chronic disease. Cronbach alphas were calculated to determine measure
internal consistency with 0.70 being deemed acceptable.

2.2.5. Data Analysis

Descriptive statistics were used to describe the sample characteristics at baseline using
measures of central tendency and dispersion. Rates of accrual, drop out, compliance, and
missing data were reported as percentages. Effectiveness outcome data will be analyzed
using an intent to treat approach. Repeated measures analysis of variance was conducted on
all quantitative parent reported outcomes. In addition, individual meaningful differences
were calculated for each parent and reported in a posthoc analysis. We used a measure
of 0.5 of standard deviation to deﬁne meaningful change on a measure. This was chosen
based on the literature as the most conservative estimate for our purposes of meaningful
improvement [52,53]. This patient centered approach to outcome reporting was explored
due to the various needs and preferences reported by parents (e.g., attending group for
social support vs. for mindfulness vs. for guidance on nutrition vs. prevention). Lastly, all
feedback interviews were transcribed verbatim and interview audio ﬁles were reviewed
for ﬁdelity. Qualitative data were then analyzed using simple content analysis with coding
to consensus and reviewed by 3 investigators with experience in qualitative data analysis.

3. Results
3.1. Study Participants

Thirty-seven parents were enrolled into the study and 32 participated in an iACT-
P workshop between November 2019 to July 2020 (see Table 3). Informed consent was
obtained from all subjects involved in the study. All were biological parents of a child with
IBD, primarily mothers of various ethnic backgrounds, with most graduating college or
university. Of the 37, 23 parents completed a qualitative interview post iACT-P workshop
(interviews conducted between December 2019 and August 2020).

3.2. Treatment Acceptability
3.2.1. Recruitment

A total of 72 parents were screened and offered the iACT-P workshop. Of those,
37 were enrolled (51.4%) and an additional six were on a waitlist for the next group at the
time of study completion due to scheduling. Of the 29 who did not enrol, 15 (20.8%) were
not interested and 14 (19.4%) were interested but lost to follow-up. Initial recruitment goals
of >70% were not met.

3.2.2. Retention

Of the 37 parents enrolled in iACT-P workshop, three parents withdrew (8%), one
prior to attending any sessions and two after attending one session. No parents declined
participation due to technological issues nor did any parent experience technological issues
that did not resolve within 10 min of the initial session. Attendance across groups was
86.5% overall, with 68.75% of parents attending all three sessions, 21.88% attending two
sessions, and the remaining 9.37% attending one session. With respect to sessions, 90.63%
of parents attended the ﬁrst session and 78.13% attended both the ﬁrst and second session.
All initial retention goals were met.

3.2.3. Parent Perceived Acceptability

All parents in attendance participated throughout the sessions and in all activities.
Although parents at times needed to excuse themselves, none left the video screen for longer
than 10 min. Responses on the treatment evaluation inventory found overall acceptability of
the iACT-P workshop for parents with an overall average of agree (mean = 4.00, standard
deviation = 0.79) with all items. Parents endorsed agree and strongly agree with the
following statements: 62.5% found iACT-P an acceptable way to deal with child’s IBD
(28% felt neutral), 81% would be willing to use this approach to change child’s health
behaviours, 73% liked the approaches used, 82% believe the iACT-P workshop is effective,
72% believe the iACT-P workshop is likely to result in permanent improvement, and
88% had a positive reaction to the iACT-P workshop. During qualitative feedback on
the length of the workshop, 74% of parents reported that 3 weeks was a sufﬁcient length
while 26% reported this amount of time was too short. When asked, 70% of parents would
have been open to more weeks in the intervention program. With respect to the length
of individual session, 61% reported that 90-min sessions were the right length while the
remining 39% reported that session length was too long. For format of the sessions, 83% of
participants reported that participating in the program through online videoconference was
suitable while 17% would have still preferred to participate in-person. All parents would
recommend the iACT-P workshop to other parents of children with IBD. Most common
reasons for recommending the iACT-P workshop include: sharing ideas and talking to
other parents, providing parents support, especially if they are isolated, provides parents
strategies (i.e., mindfulness and meditations) to deal with stress, the group helps with
anxiety, provides tools to help with parenting more broadly and helps parents to know
they are not alone in parenting a child with IBD.

Parents also provided feedback on how they would like to be supported more broadly.
Firstly, parents overwhelmingly requested more guidance and information on food and
access to dedicated IBD nutrition support, e.g., an IBD dietitian. Parents described the IBD
clinic as being focused on medication and excluded conversation about diet, naturopathic,
or alternative approaches to managing IBD. In particular, parents would like more guidance
on the role of food in IBD and how parents can support their child’s diet and nutritional
status. Parents also suggested that the hospital provide more opportunities for parents
to have social gatherings. Suggestions for formats included an online group or in person
coffee nights to provide a platform for parents to interact once a month to once every
few months in order to exchange ideas, information, and offer peer support and shared
experiences. Finally, parents requested more information on healthy living (nutrition,
exercise, and mental health) as it pertains to children and IBD. All acceptability goals
were met, however adaptations to be considered based on parent feedback are included in
Table 4.

3.3. Preliminary Effectiveness
3.3.1. Quantitative Outcomes

There were no signiﬁcant group improvements in any quantitatively measured do-
mains following participating in the iACT-P workshop (see Table 5). However, when
exploring individual meaningful differences (deﬁned as a change >0.5 standard deviations
(SD) observed in the sample at baseline), it was noted that six parents (21.4%) did not report
any improvements, while nine parents reported improvements in psychological ﬂexibility
(parent psychological ﬂexibility questionnaire-PPFQ) and an additional 13 reported im-
provements in a minimum of one ACT process (mindful attention awareness scale-MAAS,
parental acceptance and action questionnaire-PAAQ, cognitive fusion questionnaire-CFQ,
and valuing questionnaire-VQ). Thus, 78.6% of parents reported individual meaningful
improvements in overall psychological ﬂexibility or core ACT processes after participating
in the iACT-P group. With respects to symptoms of anxiety, 20 (69.0%) parents were within
normal limits at baseline and of the remaining 9 parents, 4 (13.8%) parents improved their
classiﬁcations post iACT-P group attendance while 5 did not change. Similarly, 19 (65.5%)
parents were within normal limits at baseline for symptoms of stress, of the remaining 10
parents, 5 (50.0%) improved their classiﬁcations post iACT-P workshop. Lastly, 20 (69.0%)
parents were within normal range for symptoms of depression at baseline, with 2 (22.2%)
of the remaining 9 parents improving a classiﬁcation post iACT-P.

3.3.2. Qualitative Outcomes

The content analysis revealed two main categories with subcategories that contribute
to parents’ qualitative outcomes post iACT-P workshop participation. Parents discussed
what they found most helpful about the iACT-P workshop and how they have changed as
parents after participating in the program. What was most helpful was the opportunity
for connection over shared lived experience, connecting to allied health, and learning
mindfulness. How they have changed as parents included increased awareness, the ability
to stay calm, and letting go of the need to ‘ﬁx’ everything.

What was most helpful about the iACT-P program: Parents reported what they
found most helpful about the iACT-P workshop. Overwhelmingly, the ﬁrst theme parents
spoke to was how the group allowed them to see that they were not alone in their journey
parenting a child with IBD. This sharing of lived experiences with other parents was a
comfort and was repeatedly shared in feedback interviews as being the most helpful aspect
of participating in the group. As one parent explains:

What I realized, I know there are other parents too, but now I realize lots of parents with
kids they are just like us and they are also having the same problems we are having so
it was good when we met a group of parents and when they tell us their stories, we feel
more conﬁdent, more brave. there are other people too facing these kinds of issues and
this made me feel that we aren’t alone. P011

The sentiment of not feeling alone and feeling supported by other parents was also de-
scribed by some as being a part of a community where members can relate to one another.
This parent also speaks to the normalizing effect of the group:

I liked that there were other parents involved because then it makes you realize you aren’t
an island and you aren’t the only one going through it and other families are experiencing
the same things with a child with IBD and realizing you aren’t the only one and giving
you a place to see how other people are handling it. P017

Other parents spoke about feeling validated as the biggest takeaway from the group. The
recognition by others, and in particular the IBD psychologist, about the challenges of
parenting children with IBD was explained as a helpful outcome of the group. One parent
explains being validated as follows:

. . . hearing [facilitator] talk about validating for us as parents how hard it is and honestly
if that’s all I heard in my 3 weeks that was the greatest thing I could have heard because
we aren’t hearing that in terms of when we go to clinic it is all about the child as it should

Children 2021, 8, 396

be and so we aren’t getting that support, we get it from each other I’ve been active in
trying to create parent groups so we are ﬁnding those ways to get some of that validation
with other parents but to hear the psychologist say that validated every heartache and
frustration that I feel. P008

A second theme centered around facilitating connections to allied health care professionals,
in particular the dietitian with experience in IBD and health psychologist. Having the
dietitian attend the iACT-P workshop was cited by the majority of parents as being one of
the most helpful aspects of the group. Parents wanted additional time and guidance from
the dietitian. One parent noted that in her group, parents were asking the dietitian very
basic or introductory questions. She explains:

. . . it also tells me that we are still not feeling as informed as we would like to be. In 6
years, I’ve never been handed a piece of paper and I’m very much ‘knowledge is power’.
As parents there is so much frustration because we can’t take away what our kids are
going through. But, if we are more informed, and the better informed we are, I think we
feel better in the process and more empowered in the process. P008

A third theme was how helpful the mindfulness and meditation techniques were in helping
parents to manage the stress of parenting a child with chronic illness. Perspective taking
tools that facilitated present moment awareness helped parents reﬂect on whether they
were acting according to their values (vs. avoidance behaviours). Using tools such as the
matrix were also discussed as strategies parents continued to use after the group in order
to evaluate priorities in day-to-day life. As one parent explains, even though meditation
was not a practice she would typically enjoy, she still found mindfulness to be meaningful
and helpful in her parenting role:

. . . mindfulness, it’s honestly it’s not my thing and my 15 year old with Crohn’s its not
her thing and we are trying to embrace it a little more because there were some really
good tips but I’ve come on board a little more. P019

How you have changed as a parent after the iACT-P program: Parents reﬂected upon
changes they saw in themselves as a result of being in the iACT-P workshop across three
themes. The way in which parents support their child through the challenges of IBD was
one notable change. In particular, parents explained that they now allow space for negative
experiences and do not always strive to “ﬁx” problems their children experience. This
parent comments:

The only thing that really hit home was one speciﬁc point which was . . . the point was
made about how sometimes kids come to you and they sort of dump their problems on
you, but they don’t really want you to solve their problems. They don’t want you to give
them solutions they just want you to listen and as parents we tend to want to ﬁx things
for them and sometimes that’s not always what we should be doing or that’s maybe not
what they want us to do. And that was probably the most signiﬁcant point that I took
home from the 3 sessions. P023

A second parent shares these sentiments:

One of the biggest skills I learned from this was lay off. Lay off your child. Let him be. Let
him breathe. Let him ﬁgure it out. And he voices that all the time. But I always thought,
I’m a mom, he’s a teenager, let him keep yelling at me and saying, ‘mom stop this, stop
this, why do you always keep asking me?’ I thought I just always have to continue being
persistent because that’s who we are, we’re parents, so you keep pushing forward. But
when a child is dealing with an illness, I think as a parent you just need to give them
time to breathe and let your child come to you. And I think that is my biggest advantage
or the biggest learning piece I’ve taken away from this. P009

Increased awareness in everyday life was a second change reported by parents. Parents
reported an increase in their ability to focus on one thing at a time or to take a moment
to enjoy what they were doing following their participation in the iACT-P workshop. By

Children 2021, 8, 396

11 of 16

taking a step back and rethinking one’s approach to their child’s IBD, parents discuss how
the function of their actions may be categorized as either moving away from thoughts
and feelings, or towards their values and goals with respect to their relationship with
their child.

The whole mindfulness piece really comes across loud and clear. I never thought of it in
relation to my child it was always in my own day to day life but thinking about how to
manage that kind of made me more aware and now taking a bit of a step back with what’s
happening and especially because we’ve been going through a pretty rough time in the
past couple of weeks. P027

The improved ability to work with difﬁcult situations and invite a ‘calm’ defused approach
as a means of self-care was a third change. Parents described that if one is able to work
through difﬁcult internal experiences by taking care of one’s self, this will have a trickle-
down effect to the children as they witness both self-care and responding (instead of
reacting). Although ‘staying calm’ is not aligned with the ACT processes, during interviews
parents described working with and accepting unwanted internal experiences as being able
to be ‘more calm’. The following parent explains this as her takeaway from the program:

. . . trying to stay calm through whatever experience or difﬁcult time you are going
through and take care of yourself, learn to take care of yourself because if you take care of
yourself you can take care of your children. P031

4. Discussion

This study sought to explore the feasibility, acceptability, and initial effectiveness of
an online ACT and nutrition workshop, the iACT-P workshop, for parents of children
with IBD. While initial recruitment fell slightly short of a priori goals (goal of >70%,
actual recruitment 51.4%), it parallels the literature on interventions targeting parents of
chronically ill children or children with intellectual delays [54–56]. All other measures of
feasibility and acceptability were met. Several adaptations were suggested by parents to
further support implementation as a part of routine integrated multidisciplinary clinical
care, namely the shortening of sessions and the addition of a 4th session. This will allow
for content and main discussion to end shortly after an hour and leave space for continued
discussion for those interested. Consideration for ongoing monthly drop-in parent support
sessions should also be explored.

Surprisingly, there were no signiﬁcant improvements in the overall analysis of parent
reported outcomes. The literature in online ACT interventions for parents often report
signiﬁcant improvements in parent stress, depression, and anxiety, although symptom
reduction is not a goal of ACT [17,56–59]. In exploring the individual differences in parents,
the majority reported improvements in either psychological ﬂexibility or some underlying
ACT processes. Improvements in ACT processes (e.g., mindfulness, acceptance, valued
living, and cognitive defusion) but not parent stress, anxiety, or depression, suggest that
parents’ ability to work with symptoms improved during the study, and while symptoms
still present, they were not as disruptive to their lives. This is clinically meaningful as
some degree of stress, anxiety, or depression while parenting a chronically ill child is
to be expected and therefore important to equip parents with skills to work with these
experiences. Indeed, research has suggested that ACT may be ideally suited to be provided
in an acute pediatric hospital for this reason [17]. Alternatively, the lack of signiﬁcant
ﬁndings may be, in part, due to the differences in parent needs prior to attending the iACT
workshop. The workshop was intended to be a component of integrated multidisciplinary
care and as such as inclusive as possible; allowing for parents to enrol for prevention or
building resilience vs. a focus on parents who are experiencing psychological distress (or
have children experiencing psychological distress). As a result, our sample reported mean
symptoms of stress and anxiety in the mild range and depression in the normal range at
baseline. Future research with larger samples may be able to identify whether there is a
parent phenotype that would beneﬁt most from this type of workshop and thereby can be

Children 2021, 8, 396

12 of 16

targeted, ideally early in their child’s journey with IBD in order to prevent worsening stress
or anxiety. Still, the group discussions were enriched by having a myriad of experiences
with respect to parent’s own mental health, their child’s mental health, and their child’s IBD
disease severity. Parents appreciated the ability to see the range of experiences of pediatric
IBD, both in terms of disease presentation but also implications at different developmental
ages. Parents qualitative reports are promising with respects to changes in their parenting
behaviours and being indicative of an incorporation of mindfulness into everyday life.
Their descriptions represented an increase in awareness, such as responding to their child
instead of reacting.

A strong theme across all sessions and outcomes were parents’ strong desire to have a
forum for sharing lived experiences of parenting a child with IBD. Our ﬁndings are similar
to those in the literature whereby systematic reviews of parent interventions in chronic
disease ﬁnd consistently strong positive qualitative ﬁndings but inconsistent results on
parent reported quantitative outcomes [60]. Our ﬁndings would support the need for
ongoing parent social support paired with education on living well with IBD, including
a holistic approach to care. For example, research in adults with IBD has highlighted
the nuanced importance of acceptance vs. tolerance of IBD and its symptoms [61]. ACT
skills paired with social support approaches would be particularly helpful in this regard as
acceptance is a core ACT process and our ﬁndings demonstrate shared lived experience
normalizes the illness experience.

Our ﬁndings also underscore the need for guidance in diet and nutrition within
pediatric IBD clinics. Studies of parents of children with IBD have found that many believe
that food is a cause of IBD and 61.5% avoid certain foods in fear of exacerbating symptoms
for their children [62]. In adults with IBD, a lack of knowledge of whether dietary changes
(e.g., food avoidance and exclusion diets) impacted IBD symptoms paired with those
dietary changes lead to maladaptive coping and social isolation that in turn decreased
psychosocial functioning [63]. In Canada, both pediatric and adult IBD experience ongoing
barriers to accessing more holistic care, including psychosocial and nutrition care [64,65].
Internationally, access to ‘high quality written’ IBD-speciﬁc nutrition information has also
been found to be variable [66]. Our ﬁndings alongside the literature demonstrate that there
is a need to explore ways in which to increase access to both psychosocial and nutrition in
IBD over the lifespan.

Limitations

Findings from this pilot study should be interpreted in light of several considerations.
The recruitment and data collection for this study occurred shortly prior to and during
the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Parents in different cohorts of the
iACT-P workshop would have been in different stages of COVID-19 restrictions during
both outcome measurement and workshop attendance. Although COVID-19 was a part
of conversations, the content of the iACT-P workshop remained primarily focused on
parenting in IBD and how COVID-19 has impacted the child relative to IBD. Given the
focus on feasibility for this pilot study, our sample size was small and there was no control
group data collected. Further research is warranted to determine whether parent reported
qualitative improvements are directly the result of the iACT-P workshop.

5. Conclusions

Parenting in the context of pediatric IBD necessitates navigation of medical appoint-
ments, procedures, and medications in addition to other parent responsibilities. As essential
members of a child’s healthcare team, it is crucial to support parents in caring for their child
with IBD. Family based approaches that target parents and include both psychosocial and
nutritional components are an example of providing integrated multidisciplinary care in
pediatric IBD clinics. Our ﬁndings suggest that a brief online parent workshop, the iACT-P
workshop is a feasible and acceptable approach to supporting parents in the pediatric IBD
context. Although no signiﬁcant improvements were seen via questionnaires, parents qual-

Children 2021, 8, 396

13 of 16

itatively shared that they beneﬁted from sharing lived experiences, increased awareness
and integrated mindfulness, and more clarity on eating well for IBD. Furthermore, results
support the need and preference of families for integrated dietician and mental health
supports for IBD clinical care. Future research into the effectiveness of the iACT-P and the
impact of incorporating additional ongoing maintenance supports (e.g., monthly drop-in
sessions) is warranted.
