Gender-related mental health differences
between refugees and non-refugee immigrants- a
cross-sectional register-based study

Abstract

Background: Being an immigrant in a high-income country is a risk factor for severe mental ill health. Studies on
mental ill health among immigrants have found significant differences in mental health outcome between
immigrants from high income countries and low-income countries. Being an asylum seeker or a refugee is also
associated with mental ill health. This study aimed to assess if there is a difference in mental ill health problems
between male and female refugee and non-refugee immigrants from six low-income countries in Sweden.
Methods: A cross-sectional, population-based study design was used comparing refugees with non-refugees. The
study size was determined by the number of persons in Sweden fulfilling the inclusion criteria at the time of the
study during 2006. Outcome: Mental ill health, as measured with the proxy variable psychotropic drugs purchased.
Refugee/Non-refugee: Sweden grants asylum to refugees according to the Geneva Convention and those with a
well-grounded fear of death penalty, torture or who need protection due to an internal or external armed conflict
or an environmental disaster. The non-refugees were all family members of those granted asylum in Sweden.
Covariates: Gender and origin. Potential confounders: Age, marital status, education and duration of stay in
Sweden. Background variables were analysed using chi square tests. The association between outcome, exposure
and possible confounders was analysed using logistic regression analyses. Multiple logistic regression analysis was
used to adjust for potential confounders.

Results: The study population comprised 43,168 refugees and non-refugees, of whom 20,940 (48.5%) were women
and 24,403 (56.5%) were refugees. Gender, age, origin, marital status and education were all associated with the
outcome. For female, but not male, refugees there was a significantly higher likelihood of purchasing psychotropic
drugs than non-refugees (OR = 1.27, 95% CI = 1.15 - 1.40).

Conclusions: Female refugees from low-income countries seem to be a risk group among immigrant women
from low-income countries, whereas male refugees had the same risk patterns as non-refugee immigrants from
low-income countries. This underlines the need for training of clinicians in order to focus on pre-migration stress
and the asylum process, among female newcomers.

Background
Being an immigrant in a high-income country is a risk
factor for severe mental ill health such as schizophrenia
[1] and suicide[2], and moderate mental ill health [3].
Studies on mental ill health among immigrants have
found significant differences in mental health outcome
between immigrants from high income countries and

low-income countries[4-8]. Being an asylum seeker or a
refugee is also associated with mental ill health, such as
posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression
[9-12].

The increased risk of mental ill health among refugees
has been attributed to pre- and post-migration stress
[12-15] and the asylum seeking process[10,11]. A sys-
tematic review and meta-analysis by Steel et al[15],
including 161 articles and reporting the results of 181
surveys comprising 81,866 refugees and other conflict-
affected persons from 40 countries, showed that pre-

migration stress, such as torture and other potentially
traumatic events, are associated with depression and
PTSD.

In a meta-analysis on pre- and post-migration factors
associated with mental ill health among refugees and
internally displaced persons (IDPs), Porter & Haslam
[12] analysed 59 independent comparisons of refugee
and non-refugee comparison groups. The meta-analysis
included 67,294 participants in studies from 1959 to
2002. Only two[16,17] of the 59 analyses compared
adults from the same low-income country or area that
had migrated (i.e. not IDPs) to the same high-income
country with a different exposure to pre-migration stres-
sors (refugees and non-refugees). The first study, com-
paring refugees (n = 44) with non-refugees (n = 76)
from Central America migrating to the US, found that
the refugees had a statistically significant greater num-
ber of PTSD symptoms. The second study found that
Tamil asylum seekers and refugees in Australia had
experienced more trauma events compared to non-refu-
gees, and there were statistically significant differences
between asylum seekers, refugees and non-refugees in
terms of PTSD, depression and anxiety. These two stu-
dies are limited to refugees and non-refugees from a sin-
gle country; hence it is not clear whether the differences
between refugees and non-refugees might be specific for
the country or area of origin. Silove[17] points out that
the reason for focusing solely on Tamils is that diversity
in cultural and linguistic background makes trans-cul-
tural comparisons problematic.

There are conflicting findings on the association
between time in host countries and mental ill health
among refugees. In some studies time seems to reduce
the effect of pre-migration stress, and suggest that the
impact of pre-migration stress is considerably reduced
after approximately ten years[13,18] however, other find-
ings suggest a more prolonged process[19,20]. There is
solid support for gender differences in mental ill health.
Depression has a higher prevalence among women[21]
and so does PTSD[22]. This seems to be the case also
for asylum seeking and refugee women[10,11,23,24].

Dissimilar economic, educational and cultural back-
grounds among refugees and other immigrant groups
with different origin contribute to the complexity in
making a distinction between consequences of pre-
migration and post-migration stress. Sweden grants asy-
lum to refugees according to the Geneva Convention
[25,26] including those who have reason to fear persecu-
tion in their native country due to race, nationality, reli-
gious or political beliefs, gender, sexual orientation or
membership to a particular social group. Others who
qualify for asylum in Sweden are those with a well-
grounded fear of suffering the death penalty, torture or
who need protection due to an internal or external

armed conflict or an environmental disaster in their
native country[26]. Refugees from low-income countries
who have been granted asylum in Sweden can be
expected to have been exposed to pre-migration stress
in their home country and possible also in the asylum
process[11]. However, non-refugee immigrants from the
same low-income countries accepted to Sweden for
family reunification might also have been exposed to
pre-migration stress in their country of origin but
accepted to Sweden on other terms than refugee
immigrants.

The utilisation of psychiatric care in high-income
countries including Sweden differs between migrants
and natives[27,28]. In Sweden in 1996, 1059 female
and 921 male migrants from Iran, Chile, Turkey, Kur-
distan, Poland and a random sample of 3001 Swedes
were interviewed regarding intake of psychotropic
drugs. All immigrants had a higher likelihood of intake
of psychotropic drugs than Swedish born, partly
explained by socioeconomic factors, acculturation sta-
tus, and sense of coherence[29]. Another research
group using the same data on the same immigrant
groups found that the higher use of prescribed analge-
sics and antidepressants was explained almost entirely
by a higher morbidity[30]. Two meta-analyses[9,12]
have pointed to a need for large sample sizes in studies
of mental ill health among refugees and populations
exposed to mass conflict and displacement. Register-
based studies are possible in Sweden due to a high
standard of official registers adapted for research pur-
poses[31]. Variables in the health registers of the Swed-
ish National Board of Health and Welfare include
details on who has been in contact with Swedish health
care system, the cause of the visit, except when treated
in primary care, and purchased prescribed drugs[32].
To have purchased prescribed psychotropic drugs
implies that a physician has clinically assessed the
patient’s symptoms as of psychiatric in nature, and by
filling the prescription; the patient has confirmed the
physician’s decision. Prescribed anti-depressants have
been used as a proxy in studies of moderate mental ill
health[33]. On the bases of the mentioned studies we
argue that prescribed psychotropic drugs cannot be
used as a proxy to compare mental health between
Swedish born and immigrants due to the utilisation
and intake differences described above. However it can
be used to compare immigrant groups if adjusted for
origin. Studying mental ill health with purchased psy-
chotropic drugs as a proxy is not optimal; however
data on inpatient care only shows a minor part of psy-
chiatric care. One advantage of using prescribed psy-
chotropic drugs as a proxy is that the measure includes
prescriptions to out-patients in psychiatry as well as
other medical disciplines, including general practice.

The research question in focus in the present study is:
Is there a mental health difference between immigrants
who have obtained a permanent residence permit on the
bases of asylum needs compared to those who have
been accepted on grounds of family reunion?

This study aims to assess if there is a difference in
mental ill health problems between male and female
refugees and non-refugee immigrants from six low-
income countries in Sweden.

Hypothesis 1: Refugee immigrants have a higher likeli-
hood of mental ill health than non-refugee immigrants
with the same country of origin.

Hypothesis 2: The differences are larger between

female than male immigrants.

Hypothesis 3: The hypothesised difference between
refugee and non-refugee immigrants is not explained by
duration of stay in Sweden, age, level of education or
marital status.

The specific objective is firstly to explore if there are
differences in mental health, measured by the likelihood
of purchase psychotropic drugs, between male and
female refugees and non-refugee immigrants from six
low-income countries. Secondly to see if this hypothe-
sised difference can be explained by duration of stay in
Sweden, age-level of marital status and education.

Methods
A cross-sectional, register-based study design was used
comparing refugees with non-refugees with the same
origin. As Sweden rarely accepts labour migrants from
the same places of origin as current large refugee popu-
lations group, the non-refugees are people who have
been granted residence permit in Sweden for reasons of
family reunion with a refugee.

To be included, the person had to fulfil the following
criteria according to the Swedish Population Registra-
tion System and the Swedish Board of Migration:

(cid:129) Aged 18 to 65 years and identified during the year
2006.
(cid:129) Born abroad and settled in Sweden.
(cid:129) Reside in Sweden for less than ten years.
(cid:129) Hold a resident permit either after being granted
asylum in Sweden (refugees) or for reason of family
reunion with a refugee (the non-refugee group).
(cid:129) Not hold a residence permit on reason for particu-
larly distressing circumstances (formally called
humanitarian grounds).

The reason for excluding persons admitted to Sweden
on reason for particularly distressing circumstances are
that these permits are given to persons in exceptional
cases, often suffering from life-threatening diseases[26].

The study size was determined by the number of per-
sons in Sweden fulfilling the inclusion criteria at the
time of the study. Persons who can be assumed to have
left the country without informing Swedish tax authori-
ties were excluded with methods described by Weitoft
[34]. Of the original study population, 1.77% were
excluded according to this criterion.

Data sources
Register based studies use data in official registers col-
lected for generic purposes. As a means of identification,
all Swedish citizens, or people living in Sweden with a
permanent residence permit, are assigned a personal
identity number in the Population Registration System.
After ethical approval and permission, it is possible to
link registers for research purposes, and the data is
made anonymous after collection. This study was per-
formed with data from Statistics Sweden (http://www.
scb.se/), the National Board of Health and Welfare
(http://www.socialstyrelsen.se/) and the Swedish Board
of Migration (http://www.migrationsverket.se/) adminis-
tered by Statistics Sweden.

Variables
Outcome
Mental ill health, as measured with the proxy variable
psychotropic drugs purchased, was used as the outcome.
The prescriptions include those from GPs and specialists
but exclude those to inpatients (0.2% of the population).
The relevant agents include antidepressants (ATC-code
N06A), tranquilizers (ATC-code N05B) and sedatives
(ATC-code N05C) but exclude antipsychotic agents
(ATC-code N05A). The reasons for excluding antipsy-
chotic agents are that antipsychotic agents are given for
severe mental illnesses known to have a much more
complicated aetiology than moderate mental ill health.
There is also a need to separate the limited group with
disabling psychiatric illnesses from those with severe
psychological reactions to trauma and the majority who
adapts once peace and order are restored among trauma
affected populations[35].

The outcome variable is turned into a binary variable
(has filled the prescription or not). Note that the out-
come is not a proxy for any specific mental health state
or diagnosis (such as PTSD or depression), but merely a
measure of the physician’s decisions.
Refugee/Non-refugee
Sweden grants asylum to refugees according to the Gen-
eva Convention and to those with a well-grounded fear
of suffering the death penalty, torture or who need pro-
tection due to an internal or external armed conflict or
an environmental disaster in their native country, as
mentioned above.

The non-refugees are all family members of those
granted asylum in Sweden, such as spouses, children
under 18 years and, in exceptional cases, relatives over
18, who are granted residence permit in Sweden for rea-
sons of family reunion[35].

Covariates
Gender and the country or area of origin; including
Afghanistan, Iraq, Iran, the Middle East (except Iran and
Iraq), Somalia and former Yugoslavia. The countries or
areas of origin represent origins with large refugee
groups in Sweden during the year 2006. The Iraqi group
was chosen as a reference category. A low-income coun-
try is here defined as a country not classified as a high-
income country by the World Bank[36] at the time the
immigrants arrived in Sweden.
Potential confounders
Age, marital status, education and duration of stay in
Sweden.

Age was coded into five dummy age groups: 18-24,
25-34, 35-44, 45-55 and 55-64 years. The 18-24 age-
group was chosen as a reference category.

Marital status was divided into single, married,
divorced and widow(-er). The marital status group, sin-
gle, was chosen as a reference group.

Education was coded in the following dummy groups:
less than 9 years, 9 years, 12 years, more than 12 years
of schooling and unknown length of schooling. Statistics
Sweden converted education completed outside Sweden
into equivalent levels of schooling in Sweden. The edu-
cation group, less than 9 years of schooling, was chosen
as a reference category.

Duration of stay was coded as ten dummy groups by

year.

Biases
There is always a risk of misclassification when studying
specific diagnoses of mental ill health among immigrants
due to inter-cultural diversity[27]. We therefore com-
bined antidepressants, tranquilizers and sedatives into a
single dichotomous outcome variable to minimise the
impact of differential diagnoses in groups from different
countries or areas of origin. However, some patients are
prescribed psychotropic drugs without having mental ill
health, such as sedatives prescribed to patients with
rheumatic pain. In order to test if there were differences
in the patterns of purchase of antidepressants, tranquili-
zers or sedatives we made a sensitivity test of the out-
come. There were no different patterns for any of the
outcomes.

Statistical analyses
Demographic variables were analysed using chi square
association between the outcome:
tests. The

psychotropic drugs purchased, and the covariates, and
the outcome and the potential confounders were ana-
lysed using logistic regression. Adjusted multiple logis-
tic regression analysis was used for the association
between the outcome, exposure and potential confoun-
ders. For the adjusted model, several effect modifiers
(indicated with a star * in the text) were tested with
stepwise logistic regression. The -2Log Likelihood
value was used to assess what model had the best fit.
Results are presented as odds ratios (OR) with 95%
confidence limits.

Ethical approval
This study was approved by Stockholm Regional Ethical
Review Board (2008/732-31).

Results
Participants and descriptive statistics
The study population comprised 43,168 refugees and
non-refugees, of whom 20,940 (48.5%) were women, and
24,403 (56.5%) were refugees. The majority of men were
refugees whereas among the women the majority was
non-refugees. Data on the participants’ origin, age, level
of education and marital status for refugees and non-
refugees, grouped by sex, is given in Table 1. For each
variable in Table 1, a Chi square test was conducted to
test whether the variable was associated with being a
refugee or not. All tests were found to be significant, p-
value < 0.0001, for both men and women. Those origi-
nating from former Yugoslavia had been in Sweden the
longest. Mean years of duration of stay in Sweden is
provided in Table 2.

Outcome
The crude odds ratios differences in psychotropic drugs
purchased between refugees and non-refugees, between
different countries or areas of origin (except men from
the Middle East), between age-groups, between different
levels of education (except for men with 12 years of
schooling) and between different marital statuses for
both men and women were all significant (Table 3).
Refugees, both men and women; were significantly more
likely to have purchased psychotropic drugs. No associa-
tion was found between psychotropic drugs purchased
and duration of stay in Sweden, neither when analysed
as one group nor analysed by reason for migration or by
origin.

The full model
When adjusting for all associated variables and the
effect modifier age-group*marital-status, refugee women
in comparison to non-refugee women, were found to
have purchased significantly more psychotropic drugs
(OR = 1.27; C.I.95 = 1.15-1.40), however non-refugee

Discussion
Refugee status, age, origin, marital status and education
were all associated with psychotropic drugs purchased;
however duration of stay in Sweden was not. The asso-
ciated variables and the effect modifier age-group*mari-
tal-status explained the difference between refugees and
non-refugees for men but not for women. The null-

hypotheses were fully rejected in the first and second
hypothesis and partly rejected in the third.

There was a significant difference in odds ratio for
refugee and non-refugee women not explained by age,
origin, marital status and education. Hence, there seems
to be a specific risk factor for mental ill health in being
a refugee woman from a low-income country in a high
income country that is separate from the risk factors in
being a female immigrant from a low-income country in
a high-income country as such, even for female immi-
grants from the same country. For men this does not
seem to be the case.

The differences in psychotropic drugs purchased
between immigrants of different origin are in line with
studies on intake of psychotropic drugs mentioned[29]
and have multiple explanations such as differences in
pre- and post-migration stress, cultural variations or dif-
ferent levels of communication problems between
patients and health care staff[27]. The Somali group had
the lowest crude odds ratios for purchase of psychotro-
pic drugs. A study with culturally validated question-
naires among Somalis in London presented lower PTSD
levels among Somali refugees than other refugee groups
[37]. The study found an association between mental
disorder and the use of Khat (legal in the UK, illegal in
Sweden) with amphetamine like properties. The authors

presented a theory that Khat might be used as self-med-
ication amongst those with depression[37].

The negative association between length of education
and psychotropic drugs and the positive association
between age and psychotropic drugs are in line with
other studies on refugee mental health[12]. As age is
such an important factor in its own right, and change in
marital status often is related to growing older, the
crude odds ratios of marital status are hard to interpret.
The effect modifier age-group*marital-status shows that
being married might be associated with increased risk
when young but become protective later in life. Dura-
tion of stay in Sweden was not associated with the out-
come and this finding could be explained with that
none of the participants had been in Sweden more than
ten years. There are conflicting findings on the associa-
tion between duration of stay in host country and men-
tal health where refugees seems to get better with time
[14] whereas the total immigrants stocks mental ill
health gets worse[3].

Strengths of the study include the large study base
with large sample sizes for seven different low-income
countries, the detailed information on origin and the

precision in the data on purchase of psychotropic drugs
thanks to the use of the Swedish Prescribed Drug
Register.

Using psychotropic drugs purchased as a proxy vari-
able for moderate mental health problems, on the one
hand, has made it possible to study less severe mental ill
health and mental health in outpatient care, including
primary care. On the other hand, the use of the proxy
has its limitations. Firstly, it lacks diagnostic control.
Secondly, those people who are prescribed psychotropic
drugs are likely to have more serious symptoms; hence
the proxy is likely to miss those with minor symptoms.
An additional weakness is due to the exclusion of anti-
psychotic agents. The potential misclassification of spe-
cific diagnoses of mental ill health among immigrants
may have caused some immigrants to be prescribed
antipsychotic agents instead of anti-depressive drugs,
tranquilizers or sedatives[27], which were included in
the proxy variable. This risk of misclassification might
be higher in some immigrant groups, creating invalid
differences between immigrants of different origin. Cul-
ture-bound under-utilisation of health services, use of
traditional healers, or not recognising the signals of

deviant mental health might also have led to invalid dif-
ferences between immigrants of different origin.
Another weakness is the information in the registers
regarding country or area of origin. For reasons of integ-
rity and ethics, Statistic Sweden does not keep records
of ethnicity. The fact that immigrants stem from the
same country does not necessarily mean that they have
the same main or minority culture. Hence, stratifying
for origin might be misleading in some cases, especially
for countries with shared borders and overlapping eth-
nic groups.

In a critical review on gender differences in depression
by Piccinelli and Wilkinson[21] it is stated that genetic,
biological factors and poor social support had much less
effect than adverse experiences, roles and psychological
attribute on the dissimilarities between women and
men. Studies from the Netherlands suggest that the asy-
lum process plays an important role as a factor for men-
tal ill health among immigrants especially for women
[10,11]. The Swedish Red Cross have highlighted the
difficulties for women being granted asylum in Sweden
[38]. It is possible that stresses and strains in the asylum
hardship together with the human right violations in the
country of origin add up and partly explain the higher
mental ill health levels among refugee women. There
might also be different patterns of family reunion for
male and female refugees making female refugees more
vulnerable than male refugees in terms of social
network.

The earlier findings on greater mental ill health pro-
blems among immigrants from low income countries
may partly be explained by a high proportion of female
refugees who have a greater likelihood of mental ill
health. For men there was no significant difference
between refugees and non-refugees from the same coun-
tries. There are probably multiple reasons for this gen-
der difference. One could be that that men and women
are affected differently by post-migration stressors. A
study by Blight and colleagues[24] on 413 persons from
Bosnia-Herzegovina coming to Sweden in 1993-1994
found that job occupancy was important to the health
of men in the study but for the women job occupancy
and living in an urban region appeared to be associated
with poor mental health. These and other post-migra-
tion factors need to be addressed in coming studies.

Conclusions
Female refugees from low-income countries seem to be
a risk group among immigrant women from low-income
countries, whereas male refugees have the same risk pat-
terns as non-refugee immigrants from low-income
countries. Reason for migration is an important determi-
nant for mental health among immigrants. Policy

makers should recognise that immigrants from the same
areas might have different starting points when it comes
to integration.
