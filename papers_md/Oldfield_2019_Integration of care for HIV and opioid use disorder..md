Abstract

Objective:  We sought to identify optimal strategies for integrating HIV- and opioid use disorder-
(OUD) screening and treatment in diverse settings.

Design:  Systematic review.

Methods:  We searched Ovid MEDLINE, PubMed, Embase, and PsycINFO and pre-identified 
websites. Studies were included if they were published in English on or after 2002 through May 
2017, and evaluated interventions that integrated, at an organizational level, screening and/or 
treatment for HIV and OUD in any care setting in any country.

Results:  Twenty-nine articles met criteria for inclusion, including 23 unique studies: six 
took place in HIV care settings, 12 in opioid treatment settings, and five elsewhere. Eight 
involved screening strategies, 22 involved treatment strategies, and seven involved strategies 
that encompassed screening and treatment. Randomized controlled studies demonstrated low 
to moderate risk of bias and observational studies demonstrated fair to good quality. Studies 
in HIV care settings (n=6) identified HIV- and OUD-related clinical benefits with the use of 
buprenorphine/naloxone for OUD. No studies in HIV care settings focused on screening for 
OUD. Studies in opioid treatment settings (n=12) identified improving HIV screening uptake and

clinical benefits with antiretroviral therapy when provided on-site. Counseling intensity for OUD 
medication adherence or HIV-related risk reduction was not associated with clinical benefits.

Conclusion:  Screening for HIV can be effectively delivered in opioid treatment settings, yet 
there is a need to identify optimal OUD screening strategies in HIV care settings. Strategies 
integrating the provision of medications for HIV and for OUD should be expanded and should not 
be contingent on resources available for behavioral interventions.

Registration:  A protocol for record eligibility was developed a priori and was registered in the 
PROSPERO database of systematic reviews (registration number CRD42017069314).

Introduction

HIV and opioid use disorder (OUD) are substantial global risk factors for disability 
and mortality, and they manifest as intersecting epidemics worldwide [1, 2]. Particularly 
prevalent among persons living with HIV (PLWH) [3, 4], OUD is associated with worse 
clinical outcomes, ongoing HIV risk behaviors [5], and ongoing HIV transmission [6, 
7]. The growing burden of OUD and related HIV outbreaks highlight a need for novel 
strategies for screening and treatment of both disorders [8, 9]. These public health trends 
have garnered unprecedented motivation for the adoption of unified models for OUD 
management and primary care, including HIV primary care [10].

Although care for people with or at risk for HIV and OUD can be complex [11], integrating 
HIV- and OUD-related care is feasible in HIV care settings, opioid treatment settings, 
and other care sites like primary care or public health clinics [12–21]. Integrated care is 
valued by PLWH with OUD [22, 23], a patient population that has demonstrated limited 
engagement with routine health services [24] and that is subject to overlapping forms 
of stigma that may obstruct care and worsen biologic and/or social outcomes [25–27]. 
International organizations, including the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS 
and the World Health Organization [28, 29] as well as US health reform laws [30] support 
the integration of substance use disorder services with primary care (including HIV primary 
care). Yet integration often does not occur [31, 32], how to integrate effectively in different 
care settings remains poorly understood, and quality metrics for integrated care are lacking 
[33].

Previous systematic reviews have demonstrated the feasibility and impact of integrating 
HIV care with other chronic conditions, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes [34], and 
mental health disorders [35]. One systematic review examined strategies for integrating 
HIV- with substance use-related care including 51 articles published through October 
2015, but it did not use opioid-derived search terms nor compare between integrated 
and non-integrated models or between different integration strategies [36]. Therefore, we 
performed a systematic review to identify interventions wherein HIV and OUD-related care 
are integrated, across the spectrum of care from screening to treatment and across diverse

care settings. This review will generate a comprehensive understanding of the evidence for 
integrated care to inform practice and policy for a large and vulnerable population.

Materials and methods

We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses 
(PRISMA) standards of quality for reporting systematic reviews [37]. This is part of 
a larger systematic review on the integration of OUD care with the care of infectious 
complications including hepatitis C and HIV. We developed a protocol for study eligibility 
a priori and registered it in the PROSPERO database of systematic reviews (registration 
number CRD42017069314) [38]. Our data synthesis process drew from realist synthesis, an 
analytic approach that considers the interaction between context, mechanism, and outcome 
in evaluating an intervention [39–41]. This study was not considered human subjects 
research by the Yale School of Medicine Human Investigation Committee.

Search strategy

Guided by the PICOS framework, we defined the populations, interventions, comparisons, 
outcomes, and study designs of interest a priori [42] (see Text Box). We defined 
integrated interventions as screening and/or treatment (including medications—such 
as antiretroviral therapy [ART], methadone, buprenorphine/naloxone, or naltrexone—or 
behavioral interventions) for HIV and OUD, employed at an organizational level [43].

We searched Ovid MEDLINE, PubMed, Embase, and PsycINFO on May 24, 2017. We 
identified additional studies by scanning other systematic reviews and bibliographies. 
We also searched the websites of the following pre-identified organizations: Society for 
General Internal Medicine, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Organization, 
the Association for Medical Education and Research in Substance Abuse, and the U.S. 
Health and Human Services’ HIV.gov website. We limited our search to studies with human 
subjects and those published in the English language. We also limited our search to those 
studies published in or after 2002 for three reasons. First, buprenorphine/naloxone was 
approved by the US Food and Drug Administration as the first schedule III medication for 
the treatment of OUD in 2002, heralding a new era for the outpatient management of OUD 
[44], including in PLWH [45]. Second, in late 2001 the US Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention published new recommendations for screening for HIV that focused on the 
expansion of screening in all medical settings, including those that provide services related 
to substance use disorders [46]. Third, this time point corresponds approximately with the 
advent of the late ART era (2000 and later), during which HIV treatments were associated 
with greater efficacy than previous eras [47].

To produce relevant vocabulary terms, we analyzed five previously identified key articles 
using the Yale MeSH Analyzer (http://mesh.med.yale.edu/). In each database, we ran 
scoping searches and used an iterative process to translate and refine the search strategies. 
We used the previously identified articles to validate the success of our searches (eSearch 1 
in Supplement).

Study selection

Page 4

Two authors (BO and NM) independently screened titles to remove clearly irrelevant 
citations, then these two authors independently screened abstracts using an algorithm 
developed a priori, resolving conflicts by consensus. We used Covidence, a systematic 
review software, to facilitate screeners’ independent organization, retrieval, and assessment 
of articles [48].

Quality assessment

Two reviewers independently completed the quality assessment of each study using the 
Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool for randomized trials [49] and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scales for 
observational studies [50] (BO reviewed all articles; NM, JT, and EJE shared the role of 
second reviewer).

Data extraction

For each screened article, two authors independently abstracted information about the 
context (HIV care settings, opioid treatment settings, or other), participants, intervention 
type (screening or treatment), and outcomes (including uptake of services, behavioral or 
biochemical outcomes, and general health outcomes along the care continuum [51]) in a 
standardized form. Extraction occurred concurrently with quality assessment by the same 
two authors (BO and either NM, JT, or EJE).

Intervention and outcome heterogeneity precluded meta-analyses. Instead, because we were 
interested in how integration strategies differed in different care settings, we drew from 
a realist synthesis strategy in which reviewers delineated the contextual influences that 
contributed to the outcomes of interest [40, 41] based on the following typology.

Intervention typology

Similar to previous systematic reviews on the integration of HIV care with the management 
of other disorders [35, 36], we classified interventions according to the entry point at which 
patients receive care: HIV care settings, opioid treatment settings, and other settings. HIV 
care settings included Infectious Disease clinics, specialized HIV clinics, and community-
based HIV or AIDS services organizations (which focus on case management and other 
supportive services, and may provide clinical services). Opioid treatment settings included 
opioid treatment programs or settings licensed to provide medications for OUD. Other 
clinical and community-based settings included those that could not be classified into the 
previous categories. In addition to corresponding with other reviews, this typology may 
facilitate the development of best-practices in different care settings.

Results

Our search yielded 7,178 articles and 3,188 remained after the removal of duplicates (Figure 
1). After screening titles, we screened 594 abstracts and identified 29 articles that met 
criteria for inclusion [12, 15, 17–20, 52–74]. On three occasions, multiple articles presented 
data from one study ([12, 17–19, 57, 62], [65, 66], and [69, 75]) yielding a total of 23 unique 
studies. These included eight randomized trials [20, 55, 58, 61, 63, 64, 69, 73, 75], 13 cohort

studies [12, 15, 17–19, 52, 53, 56, 57, 59, 60, 62, 65–68, 70–72], and two cross-sectional 
studies [54, 74].

Description of studies

We identified six studies that occurred in HIV care settings [12, 17–20, 57, 58, 61–63, 67, 
73], 12 studies that occurred in opioid treatment settings [52–56, 60, 64–66, 68–70, 74, 
75], and five studies that occurred in other settings, including correctional settings [71, 72], 
primary care clinics [58], mobile syringe-exchange units [15] or public health clinics [59]. 
The added element that defined interventions as integrated care was most often either OUD 
care or HIV care alone to a facility already providing care for the other disorder; in two 
studies both OUD and HIV care were introduced simultaneously and correctional facilities 
were the points-of-entry for both [71, 72]. With respect to outcomes measured, 19 studies 
examined clinical and laboratory outcomes, four examined health-related quality of life [54, 
58, 62, 72], two examined quality of care indicators [18, 54], one examined cost [19], and 
one examined patient satisfaction [74].

While most studies took place in North America (n=15 in the United States and n=1 in 
Canada), four took place in Europe [53, 54, 60, 68] and three took place in Asia [52, 59, 74]. 
Half of studies had a follow-up period of 12 months or longer (Table 1).

Quality assessment

The risk of bias among randomized studies was low to moderate (eTable 1 in Supplement), 
although no randomized studies blinded participants and personnel of the treatment phase 
and few described blinding of outcome assessment [55, 73]. Cohort studies were of fair to 
good quality (eTable 2 in Supplement). The most common reason for low quality assessment 
was the low quality of the non-exposed cohort (9 of 13), which was either drawn from a 
different source as the exposed cohort or no comparator cohort was generated other than a 
pre-intervention baseline [12, 15, 17–19, 52, 56, 57, 59, 60, 62, 68, 70, 71].

Interventions in HIV care settings

Among studies in HIV care settings (n=6), five examined interventions involving 
medications for OUD [12, 17–20, 57, 61–63, 73] and one in which motivational 
interviewing, social work, and peer groups were offered [67] (Table 2). Four of the five 
medication-based interventions included buprenorphine/naloxone and recruited an aggregate 
of 414 patients [12, 17–20, 57, 62, 63, 73], while one offered injectable naltrexone [61] 
and assigned 25 patients to the intervention and 26 to treatment-as-usual. Studies that 
centered on the provision of buprenorphine/naloxone demonstrated that administering these 
medications in HIV clinics correlates with clinical benefits such as initiation ART [12], 
decreased needle sharing [57], decreased opioid use [17],; operational sequelae included 
increased labor, overhead, and urine toxicology costs [19] as well as more primary care 
visits to the HIV specialist [63]. Health-related quality of life and HIV quality of care 
indicators were favorably associated with buprenorphine/naloxone administration if it was 
continued for one year [62]. Injectable naltrexone offered in HIV care settings demonstrated 
feasibility and safety and suggested that those offered injectable naltrexone were more 
likely to initiate and be retained on treatment than those offered treatment-as-usual, but the

study was not powered to detect clinical HIV or OUD outcomes [61]. The study whose 
intervention did not provide on-site treatment with medications for OUD, but instead on-site 
motivational interviewing with referral for medications, did not show improvements in HIV 
clinical outcomes [67].

Two randomized controlled trials examined different intensities of adjunctive counseling in 
addition to buprenorphine/naloxone [20, 73].Neither the addition of nurse-led counseling 
and adherence management [73], nor nurse-led enhanced medical management improved 
HIV- or OUD-related outcomes [20] compared favorably to physician-delivered medical 
management of buprenorphine/naloxone.

Interventions in opioid treatment settings

Among studies in opioid treatment settings (n=12), all occurred in outpatient settings and 
one included hospital-based detoxification programs [55], two examined HIV testing and 
counseling [55, 69, 75], six examined HIV medication management with antiretroviral 
therapy (ART) [53, 56, 60, 64–66, 68, 70], and three examined interventions that involved 
both HIV testing and counseling as well as ART management [52, 54, 74] (Table 3). In 
two randomized trials, HIV testing and counseling alone in opioid treatment settings led 
to increased HIV testing performed and feedback of results [55, 75], but the addition of 
sexual risk-reduction counseling did not lead to significant changes in sexual risk behaviors 
[69]. ART management in opioid treatment settings involved the prescription of ART in 
methadone clinics [68] or directly-administered ART (DAART) [53, 56, 60, 64–66, 70]. 
DAART in residential opioid treatment settings [53] and methadone clinics was safe and 
feasible [56, 60, 64–66, 70], but a randomized trial demonstrated that DAART compared 
with self-administered ART in methadone clinics did not lead to significant differences in 
clinical outcomes [63].

Interventions in opioid treatment settings that involved both HIV counseling and testing as 
well as ART management demonstrated high patient satisfaction [74], achievement of HIV 
and addiction quality indicators and higher likelihood of ART receipt [54], but no significant 
differences in clinical outcomes or health-related quality of life [52, 54].

Interventions in other settings

Other interventions (n=5) occurred in primary care clinics [58], mobile syringe-exchange 
units [15], government-run public health clinics [59], or used the criminal justice system as 
a point-of-entry [71, 72]. An intervention in primary care settings demonstrated that those 
receiving buprenorphine/naloxone, when randomized to brief sexual risk management or 
enhanced sexual risk management, exhibited similar process (retention in OUD treatment) 
and clinical outcomes (health-related quality of life or sexual risk) [58]. When methadone 
and HIV testing and treatment were integrated into public health clinics, more clients seek 
testing and start ART [59].

One small cohort (n=13 patients) demonstrated that HIV medication management in a 
syringe-exchange mobile unit led to improvements in HIV-1 RNA levels and CD4 cell 
counts in a pre-post design [15].

Two studies enrolled participants upon release from the criminal justice system. These 
demonstrated that, compared to those who did not opt for buprenorphine/naloxone, those 
who did along with ART provided in a community-based setting demonstrated improved 
viral suppression [72] and fewer opioid cravings [71].

Implementing integrated care

Many studies did not explicitly describe specifics of program implementation, such as the 
additional staff or training needed [12, 15, 17, 18, 52–55, 57–60, 69, 74, 76]. When a need 
for additional staff was described in the studies, these involved study personnel such as study 
clinicians [61] or research assistants [64, 70], nurses [19, 20, 63], peers or counselors [67, 
71, 72], addiction clinicians [19, 73] or HIV clinicians [56, 68].

Discussion

Summary of the evidence

This systematic review identified 23 studies that investigated the integration of care for 
HIV and OUD across a range of clinical settings, including HIV care settings, opioid 
treatment settings, primary care or public health clinics, mobile syringe-exchange units, 
and the US criminal justice system. These data suggest three principles to guide further 
research, clinical practice, and policy. First, HIV testing can be successfully integrated into 
a range of settings where OUD care occurs, including primary care clinics, hospital-based 
detoxification programs, mobile syringe-exchange vans, and methadone clinics. However, 
there is a lack of studies focused on OUD screening in HIV care settings. Second, 
medications for the treatment of HIV and OUD can be integrated into a range of HIV, 
opioid treatment, and other settings, but it is unclear which clinicians should be optimally 
involved (infectious diseases specialists, addiction specialists, primary care physicians or 
other providers). Third, while high-quality, randomized trials support the integration of HIV- 
and OUD-related care in specialty settings (HIV clinics and methadone clinics), high-quality 
evidence is needed to identify integration strategies in other settings such as primary care 
clinics, mobile syringe-exchange units, and community-based AIDS services organizations.

While previous systematic reviews have demonstrated that HIV care can be integrated with 
care for other disorders [34, 35] including substance use disorders [36], this is the first 
systematic review to focus on OUD specifically and draw comparisons between integration 
strategies. By focusing specifically on OUD and not all substance use disorders, this 
review facilitates comparison across models and strategies (for example, medications versus 
behavioral interventions). This review is timely given the evolving burden of OUD in the 
US, the interplay between the OUD epidemic and HIV transmission globally [8, 9, 77, 78], 
and the need for integrated care for these two disorders [10, 23, 33].

Medications are the cornerstone of treatment for HIV [79] and for OUD [80]. Integrated care 
strategies identified in this review focused on administering medications for both disorders 
in single organizations. While behavioral interventions may be important adjunctive 
treatments for PLWH who have OUD, the strategies identified in our review did not 
demonstrate added benefit to nurse-led adherence management nor to sexual risk-reduction

counseling. Therefore, a lack of ability to provide psychosocial and behavioral interventions 
should not be a barrier to the development of integrated care strategies. This is concordant 
with other systematic reviews that have not demonstrated benefit of behavioral interventions 
when combined with medications in the management of OUD [81].

Of the FDA-approved medications for the management of OUD, buprenorphine/naloxone 
and naltrexone are two practical options for HIV and/or primary care providers in the 
US given the regulatory restrictions on methadone dispensing [80, 82]. The evidence 
appraised here supports the use of buprenorphine/naloxone in HIV care settings. When 
enough prescribers are available to ensure sufficient coverage and a buprenorphine/naloxone 
coordinator (such as a nurse or counselor) is available, this integrated practice is feasible and 
can be highly satisfying to providers [83]. Only one study examined the use of naltrexone in 
HIV care settings and demonstrated feasibility and safety only [61]. This identifies a need 
for clinicians who care for PLWH to be proficient and certified to prescribe buprenorphine/
naloxone given a low prevalence of certified providers [84] and as prioritization among HIV 
providers often localizes OUD treatment lower than other health domains [85]. Furthermore, 
in countries where there are regulations on the prescription of buprenorphine/naloxone or 
methadone by primary care providers, such as in the United States, policies that decrease 
these barriers should be considered [86, 87] to increase access.

However, no studies directly compared methadone and buprenorphine/naloxone in 
integration strategies that were otherwise identical. Methadone remains an integral and 
effective treatment for OUD and is associated with HIV risk reduction [88].

The evidence appraised here supports the expansion of HIV medication management in 
opioid treatment settings, including methadone clinics, settings that provide buprenorphine/
naloxone, and other settings that offer evidence-based strategies for harm reduction among 
people with OUD such as mobile needle-exchange vans. Directly-observed ART therapy 
is feasible in these settings but not necessary, as data to date do not suggest that DAART 
is superior to self-administration [64]. As HIV medical management has become simpler 
[89], it is feasible that primary care clinicians including advanced practice nurses and 
non-specialists can provide this care in opioid treatment settings [90].

Gaps in the literature persist regarding optimal strategies for screening for OUD in HIV 
treatment settings as well as the optimal arrangements of providers who should be involved 
in integrated care provision. Minimizing barriers that primary care providers face in 
providing evidence-based treatments for OUD and/or HIV is needed. The development of 
best practices will depend upon filling these gaps, as well as ongoing feedback from front-
line providers and patients who are engaging in novel integrated models [91]. Effectiveness-
implementation hybrid study designs—which evaluate clinical interventions while collecting 
data on implementation [92]—may allow researchers to identify ideal models regarding 
staffing, training, and infrastructure, and such efforts are currently underway to address 
implementation of addiction treatment in HIV care settings [93]. Implementing co-located 
services may be a non-trivial investment in many settings and so future research should 
identify those implementation strategies that are associated with improved outcomes, cost-
effectiveness, and feasibility.

Limitations

This systematic review was limited to only English-language publications, so studies 
from low- and middle-income countries may have not been included. However, a recent 
systematic review of articles that focus on integration of HIV with substance use disorder 
care included studies from other languages and only identified one, and this was published 
before our time period of interest [36]. By including only studies published in or after 
2002, we may have missed articles from earlier periods. However, treatment for OUD 
and screening recommendations for HIV changed considerably in 2001 and 2002 [45–47], 
suggesting opportunities for integrated care not applicable to previous time periods. The 
varying nature of the clinical sites and interventions prohibited meta-analyses, and so we 
employed a narrative synthesis based on a realist framework to identify strategies that work 
in different clinical contexts [41]. Because we focused on interventions wherein care was 
integrated within one organization, we may have missed effective strategies that promote 
coordinated care across organizations [94]. Finally, because we included only quantitative 
studies, we did not include qualitative studies that may offer valuable insights into complex 
care processes and patient experiences [95].

Integrating HIV and OUD-related care can be effective across a range of settings and 
can be associated with improved provision of evidence-based treatments and better patient 
outcomes. Moderate to high-quality evidence supports the use of medications for HIV and 
OUD when integrated in single sites, including methadone clinics, HIV clinics, other opioid 
treatment settings, primary care clinics, or sites that offer evidence-based harm reduction 
strategies such as mobile syringe-exchange units. A lack of ability to provide behavioral 
interventions should not prohibit organizations from offering buprenorphine/naloxone to 
PLWH with OUD, and a lack of infrastructure for DAART should not prohibit organizations 
from offering HIV medication management. Policies that reduce the barriers for primary 
care providers to offer buprenorphine/naloxone or methadone to PLWH with OUD should be 
considered so that access to evidence-based medications can increase and strategies for care 
integration in primary care sites can be evaluated.
