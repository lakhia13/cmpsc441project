There are different types of peer support, but they all involve both giving and receiving support. This could be sharing knowledge or providing emotional support, social interaction or practical help. Everyone’s experiences are treated as equally important, and no one is more of an expert than anyone else.

How much help you give and receive will depend on what feels right for you at different times.

Research shows that peer support can improve people’s well-being, meaning they have fewer hospital stays, larger support networks, and better self-esteem, confidence and social skills.


### Different types of peer support


There are many different types of peer support. Some examples include:

- support groups or self-help groups. These are run by trained peers and focus on emotional support, sharing experiences, education and practical activities

- one-to-one support sometimes called mentoring or befriending. You meet someone to talk about how you’re feeling or to set goals, for example

Peer support can take many forms. It may be for particular groups of people (with a specific health condition or from a certain ethnic group, for instance). It could be provided face-to-face, on the phone or online. It may be weekly, monthly, ongoing or for a limited time.


### What can peer support help with?


Peer support programmes can help with various issues, including:

- divorce or relationship problems

- other mental health conditions

### Is peer support right for me?


Before finding peer support, you might want to consider whether it’s right for you.

It’s normal to find it difficult to open up, and you may feel nervous about sharing your experiences with others. Remember, they probably feel or felt the same way you do. You can choose how much to share with them.

Think about how you’re feeling at the moment. Could it be difficult to hear about other people’s experiences? While it can be helpful to hear how other people have coped, there might be times when it’s triggering or upsetting for you.

Peer support is very different from the tailored help you might get from your GP or counsellor. Remember that you’ll hear people’s personal experiences and strategies and that what worked for them may not be right for you.

Think about what you want to get from peer support. Different support groups will offer different things. So if you don’t want to sit and talk about how you’re feeling, try to find a group that offers an activity instead.

Don’t be afraid to ask questions before joining. For example, you may want to know how the sessions are structured, what you might be asked to do, how many people attend, and who leads the group. You could ask if you can bring someone with you, particularly if you’re nervous about joining a group for the first time.

If peer support doesn’t work for you, that’s ok. It doesn’t mean you’ve done anything wrong. It might just not be the right support for you now. You could always try again in future or find a different type of support that helps you. Read our guide onHow to look after your mental healthfor ideas.
