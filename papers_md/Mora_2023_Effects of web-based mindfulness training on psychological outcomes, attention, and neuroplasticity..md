Mindfulness meditation training (MMT) reliably reduces stress and anxiety while also improving 
attention. The primary aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between MMT, stress and 
anxiety reduction, and its impact upon improvements in attention on the behavioral and neuronal 
levels. As a second aim, we sought to explore any relationship between MMT, attention, and modified 
states of mind such as flow. 118 healthy, meditation‑naïve, participants were either assigned to a 
31‑day, web‑based, MMT or an active control, health training (HT). Participants underwent functional 
magnetic resonance imaging while performing the attention network test (ANT) to assess functional 
and behavioural attentional changes, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to assess microstructural 
neuronal changes and completed relevant questionnaires to explore changes in psychological 
outcomes. Results confirmed a reduction in perceived stress and anxiety levels in the MMT group and 
significant improvements in the overall reaction time during the ANT, albeit no specific effects on 
the attentional components were observed. No statistically significant changes were found in the HT 
group. Interestingly, a significant group‑by‑time interaction was seen in flow experience. Functional 
data exhibited an increased activity in the superior frontal gyrus, posterior cingulate cortex, and 
right hippocampus during the alerting condition of the ANT after the MMT; decreased stress and 
trait anxiety were significantly correlated with the activation in the right hippocampus, and increased 
flow was also significantly correlated with all the aforementioned areas. DTI data showed increased 
fractional anisotropy values in the right uncinate fasciculus indicating white matter microarchitecture 
improvement between the right hippocampus and frontal areas of the brain. This study, therefore, 
demonstrates the effectiveness of web‑based MMT on overall well‑being and attentional 
performance, while also providing insight into the relationship between psychological outcomes, 
attention, and neuroplastic changes.

Mindfulness meditation is defined as present-centered awareness of thoughts, feelings, or sensations acknowl-
edged and accepted free of  judgment1. In this paper, we used the term mindfulness meditation training (MMT) 
to refer to any program or training that incorporates mindfulness meditation in their practice. MMT has been 
demonstrated to notably improve perceived  stress2–5, anxiety, and consequently mental  health2,6–9, while also 
playing a role in improving various domains of cognitive function including attention, working memory, and 
problem-solving  skills10–13. On the other hand, prolonged periods of stress and anxiety can elicit a wide range of 
physical and psychiatric  diseases14, showing detrimental effects on cognitive  performance15–19. One of the main 
cognitive processes affected by chronic stress and anxiety is  attention18,20. Attention is generally defined as an

acute stress, from an evolutionary standpoint, plays a crucial role in drawing attention to threatening stimuli, 
chronic or disordered stress can have a negative effect on the ability to distribute attentional resources efficiently, 
thereby implicating cognitive  functioning22. An additional adaptive response to threats in the environment is 
anxiety. Like stress, anxiety can become maladaptive in trait anxious individuals causing deficits in cognitive 
functioning through the similar, inefficient, distribution of attentional  resources18. While stress and anxiety have 
been demonstrated to have a negative impact on cognitive, or attentional, functioning as a  whole15–18, a recent 
meta-analysis conducted on MMT was able to demonstrate that MMT can, overall, have a positive influence on 
attentional  mechanisms23. Given the documented detrimental effects of stress and anxiety on cognitive function 
and the positive effects of MMT on attention, we investigated whether stress and anxiety reduction following 
mindfulness training would be related to improvements in attention both on the behavioral and neuronal level.
To examine the effects of MMT on the different components of attention, this work followed Michael Pos-
ner’s attention network model which encompasses three attentional mechanisms that rely on specific, separate, 
networks in the brain: Alerting (i.e., vigilance), orienting (i.e., selection), and executive control (i.e., the process 
of blocking distractors while performing a task)24–27. These attentional mechanisms can each be measured via 
the attention network test (ANT)28. Posner’s ANT was therefore utilized in the present study to investigate: a) 
the effects of a web-based MMT on the different attentional components and psychological outcomes, b) any 
link between psychological outcomes and improved attention, and c) brain functional and anatomical changes.
Not only was previous research able to determine MMT’s effects on attentional mechanisms, but it was also 
demonstrated to have a positive effect on the psychological flow  experience29. The concept of flow was intro-
duced by the Hungarian psychologist, Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, where he defined flow as a state of conscious-
ness of optimal concentration and absorption in a given task which leads to a state of satisfaction or optimal 
 experience30. Though research on flow is nascent, a recent study showed that an increase in flow experience has 
a positive impact on the ability to sustain  attention31. Given the positive effect of MMT on flow and the close 
relationship between flow and attention, we thought that it would be interesting to investigate the association 
between MMT, flow-experience, and attention, in addition to how the reduction of stress and anxiety could lead 
to improvements in attention. To elucidate these associations, we used magnetic resonance (MR) neuroimaging 
techniques, in addition to standardized questionnaires, to determine the mechanisms underlying these relation-
ships and changes.

To date, neuroimaging studies have implicated several brain areas as playing a role in attentional processing 
such as the cingulate cortex (CC), prefrontal cortex (PFC), and  hippocampus32–34. Interestingly, the CC, PFC, 
and hippocampus have also been demonstrated to exhibit MMT elicited neuroplastic  changes35–37. For example, 
while previous functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have attributed the anterior cingulate 
cortex (ACC) to the processing of executive  control38, several studies were also able to attribute greater ACC 
activation in experienced  meditators39,40 in addition to observing an increase in ACC activation as a direct result 
of  MMT35. Interestingly, improvements in executive control have also been observed following short MMT 
interventions, which comprised of 20-min practice sessions per day for 3 to 5  days41,42. In fact, a recent short-
MMT study (i.e., a 4-day Templestay project, which consists in a four-day intensive mindfulness retreat based on 
Korean Buddhism) on naïve meditators was able to demonstrate a direct association between an improvement 
in executive control and increased activation in both the right ACC and the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex 
(DLPFC) using the  ANT43. The finding observed in the DLPFC is also supported by another study, in which 
an increased activation in the right DLPFC and decreased activation in the rostral prefrontal cortex (PFC) was 
observed in naïve-meditators after an 8-week, focused attention, MMT  program44. The PFC, an essential brain 
area for executive functions including working memory, rule learning, planning, attention, and  motivation45, 
has therefore been demonstrated to be susceptible to exhibiting neuroplastic changes upon completing MMT. 
Moreover, several resting-state neuroimaging studies were able to determine that MMT increases the functional 
connectivity between the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), dorsal ACC, and  DLPFC46–49.

Additionally, studies observing microstructural connectivity (i.e., white matter tracts) via diffusion tensor 
imaging (DTI) as well as regional grey matter volume via voxel-based morphometry were able to demonstrate 
neuroplastic changes as a consequence of engaging in MMT. For example, a recent MMT study found that naïve 
mediators, upon completing the eight-week mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) training developed 
by Jon Kabat-Zinn1, exhibited increased microstructural connectivity in the superior longitudinal fasciculus 
(SLF)47, which is a white matter tract connecting the PCC and the  DLPFC50. Other studies, in addition to 
observing changes in the SLF, observed increased connectivity between the corpus callosum and corona radiata, 
which are tracts connecting the ACC with diverse brain  areas51,52. Furthermore, studies investigating gray matter 
structure observed volumetric changes in brain areas that play an important role in attention such as the PCC 
and  hippocampus53,54.

Interestingly, the hippocampus is another brain area particularly susceptible to both stress and MMT-induced 
connectivity- and volumetric  changes55–57. In fact, prolonged, elevated, cortisol levels (i.e., a stress hormone) has 
been associated with lower hippocampal  volume58,59. Chronic exposure to cortisol is known to cause neuronal 
damage particularly in the hippocampus; it also reduces synaptic connections and hippocampal neurogenesis, 
being presumably reflected in a decrease of hippocampal  volume60,61. On the other hand, studies have observed 
larger hippocampal volumes in long-term  meditators62. Moreover, a study investigating the role of the hip-
pocampus in attention in children and adolescents found a significant correlation between increased hippocam-
pal volume and improved auditory  attention63. However, the association between the hippocampus, improved 
attention, and decreased stress levels as a result of MMT remains unknown.

It is important to note, that many of the previously mentioned MMT studies were provided with an in-
person MMT, and not a web-based MMT as in the present study. In-person MMT tend to be very expensive, 
require a specific time commitment, and have a limited group capacity. Web-based MMT on the contrary offer

number of participants can be included in the training. Due to technological development, and events such as 
COVID-19, research on web-based MMT is rising, and while initial research on web-based MMT demonstrates 
improved self-compassion, perceived stress, cognitive skills, mindfulness, and reduced anxiety and depression 
 symptoms64–67, there is a need of stronger and robust evidence, as the majority of these studies did not use an 
active control group to proof the efficacy of web-based MMT. Moreover, a recent review of MMT studies inves-
tigating effects on attention also highlighted the need of implementing active control groups to reliable study the 
effects of MMT, specifically, on  attention68. Therefore, in the present work we used a study design that included 
an active control group to elucidate whether a web-based MMT can effectively reduce stress and anxiety levels, 
improve attention, states of mind, and physical well-being. Also, to the extent of our knowledge, this is the first 
neuroimaging study using a web-based MMT to identify attentional improvement mechanisms on the neuronal 
level. If successful, this could provide a larger portion of the population with a validated tool to improve their 
overall mental health and physical well-being.

The present study, therefore, sought to investigate the effects of a web-based MMT on attention and its 
association with changes in stress, anxiety, and flow state on both the behavioral and neuronal levels. To achieve 
this aim, this study utilized state-of-the-art magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) methods and robust statistical 
analyses procedures. The study had an active control group, pre- and post-intervention measurements (i.e., 
longitudinal study), and was registered as a clinical trial.

We hypothesized that the web-based MMT would elicit a reduction in stress and anxiety levels in addition 
to improvements in attention, perceived mindfulness, physical well-being, and flow experience. We expected 
to observe these behavioral changes accompanied by changes in brain function and structure in the form of 
increased activation in areas of the CC and PFC during the ANT and increased fractional anisotropy (FA) in 
white matter tracts connecting significantly activated areas seen in the ANT as a result of the web-based MMT.

Methods
Participants
Participants were mainly recruited at Klinikum rechts der Isar, Munich, Bayern, Germany via flyer distributions, 
online advertisements, and word-of-mouth. The study was advertised as a health-improvement program to 
ensure that participants were not aware of the mindfulness intervention during the recruitment or start of 
the experiment. Participants were recruited based on the following inclusion criteria: (1) No prior or current 
psychiatric or neurological conditions; screened for using the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview 
(M.I.N.I)69, (2) no psychotropic drugs use (including Cannabis), (3) meditation-naïve (i.e., participants should 
not have had more than three meditation sessions in the past year or more than ten meditation sessions over the 
course of their life), (4) right-handedness, (5) proficiency in the German language, and (6) age between 18 and 
65 years. Additional exclusion criteria for the MRI sample were: (1) Pregnancy, (2) non-removable piercings, (3) 
tattoos on the head or neck, (4) metal parts or implants in the body, and (5) claustrophobia.

In a preliminary stage of the experiment, 19 participants were recruited for a pilot study to evaluate the effects 
of the web-based MMT on the behavioral level. Here, the effectiveness of the MMT on psychological outcomes, 
and cognitive function, specifically attention was observed. Following the completion of the pilot study, 72 
additional participants were recruited to participate in the main, neuroimaging, study. For the main behavioural 
study (i.e., measurement of psychological outcomes) a total of 75 participants (43 females and 32 males; (cid:31)age
(cid:31)YOE (years of education): 18 years, IQR: 5 years) were included. For 
:
24 years, IQR (interquartile range): 13 years; 
the main study, flow experience was included as a psychological variable of interest. As this measurement was 
not added in the behavioural pilot, we were able to include only 57 participants (29 females and 28 males; (cid:31)age
(cid:31)YOE:18 years, IQR: 5 years) for the flow experience sample. Finally, for the main MRI 
:
30 years, IQR: 17 years; 
(cid:31)YOE:18 years, IQR: 5.62 years) out of 
study only 42 (22 females and 20 males; (cid:31)age
:
72 recruited participants survived the inclusion criteria. HT and MMT groups were not statistically different in 
age, gender, and YOE. More detail can be seen in Fig. 1 where a flowchart containing the demographics of the 
participants included in the pilot study, behavioral study, and fMRI study is depicted. All participants received 
monetary compensation for their participation.

Procedure
The study was registered as a clinical trial using the ISRCTN registry: trial ID ISRCTN95197731. Written 
informed consent was obtained from all participants and the study was approved by the ethics committee of 
Klinikum rechts der Isar, Technical University of Munich. Subjects were screened and scanned no more than 
1 week prior to their first training session. All participants (in both the pilot and main study) completed a series 
of standardized questionnaires prior to- and upon completing the MMT or HT. The questionnaires were selected 
to assess stress levels (Perceived Stress Scale,  PSS70), perceived mindfulness (Mindful Attention Awareness Scale 
–German version,  MAAS71,72), anxiety levels (State and Trait Anxiety,  STAI73), physical well-being (Fragebogen 
zur Erfassung des körperlichen Wohlbefindens, FEW-1674), and flow experience (Flow Short Scale,  FSS75).

Participants in the imaging component of the main study were scanned on a 3T Philips Ingenia MR-Scanner 
(Philips Healthcare, Best, The Netherlands). During the scanning session, a series of neuroimaging sequences 
were acquired. During the fMRI sequence, participants completed an adapted, event-related, ANT to evaluate 
attention and its three attentional domains including the alerting, orienting, and executive control  networks76. 
Following the pre-training assessment and scanning (TP1), participants were assigned to either the MMT or 
HT in a pseudo-randomized and single-blinded (subjects-only) manner. Once participants completed their 
assigned 31-day training program, they were asked to complete a post-training assessment (TP2) within two 
weeks following the end of their program. This post-training assessment consisted of the same questionnaires

applied at TP1, and a second scanning session using the same protocol as TP1. During the TP2 assessment, 
participants were additionally asked about their compliance with the training program schedule. All participants 
(in both the MMT and HT groups) needed to complete at least 25 out of the 31 sessions to be included in the 
study. Enrollment in their respective training was confirmed using the training platform website (https:// teach 
able. com).

Training
Both the MMT and HT were available online to study participants via the teaching platform www. teach able. 
com. Participants were given clear instructions on how to create a username to access free of cost their respective 
training. To ensure that only the content of the two training programs differed from one another, the training 
programs were structured in an identical manner, by means that both the MMT and the HT each presented 
a brief, 15-min, video every three days (starting on the first training day), followed by two days of 15-min 
podcasts or audio recordings. This pattern repeated for the duration of the 31-day course. Videos and audios 
were supported with written text providing participants with the most important information from the training 
session of the day. A detailed overview on the structure and content of both the MMT and HT can be found in 
the supplemental materials (S1).

Mindfulness meditation training
The MMT utilized in this study was based on the MBSR program and developed free of charge in close 
cooperation with Dr. Britta Hölzel (BKH), an MBSR instructor and mindfulness researcher, and contains 
guided mindfulness meditations and exercises, in addition to theoretical concepts and explanations provided 
in German by BKH. More specifically, theoretical topics included mindfulness research, mind wandering, 
body awareness, stress physiology, dealing mindfully with pain and difficult emotions, loving kindness, self-
perception, connectedness, and others. Guided meditations instructed participants to focus on various objects 
of attention, such as the breath, body sensations, emotions, thoughts, and walking, in addition to encountering 
these experiences without judgment, with acceptance, and with kindness. Loving kindness and open monitoring 
practice were also included.

Health training
The HT was developed as an active control training program that closely resembled the structure of the MMT 
but instead gave information on topics pertaining to everyday health. It is important to note that the HT did not 
contain any information or active training related to mindfulness meditation or meditation in general. Instead, 
the HT provided participants with health-related topics such as sleep, burn-out, aging, pain, and nutrition.

Attentional network test
The ANT is a paradigm that assesses different forms of attention (i.e., alerting, orienting, and executive control). 
An adapted version of the ANT was used during the event-related fMRI sequence to observe the neuronal acti-
vation patterns of these attentional networks. The ANT consisted of three cue conditions (no cue, center cue, 
spatial cue) and two target conditions (congruent target, and incongruent target). The no cue condition (i.e., the 
baseline condition) consisted of a fixation cross presented in the center of the screen. The center cue condition 
consisted of a fixation cross with an asterisk overlaid in the center of the screen; the function of the center cue 
condition was to alert participants about the onset of the upcoming target stimulus. The spatial cue condition 
consisted of an asterisk displayed on either the left or right side of the side of the screen; the function of the

Vol:.(1234567890)www.nature.com/scientificreports/spatial cue condition was to orient the attention of the participant to the direction of the upcoming target. Each 
cue condition had a duration of 200 ms. The cue condition was then followed by one of two target conditions 
(the congruent or incongruent conditions). The target conditions consisted of a column with 5 horizontal arrows 
pointing either leftward or rightward. The objective of this condition was for the participants to determine the 
direction of the center arrow. In congruent conditions, all arrows pointed in the same direction, whereas in 
the incongruent condition, the center arrow pointed in the opposite direction, thereby introducing a response 
conflict. Reaction times (RTs) to target conditions were measured. Participants were instructed to use either the 
index- or middle finger of their right hand to indicate via a button-press whether the center arrow was pointing 
to the left or right, respectively. The experiment consisted of two runs each comprising of 36 trials. A full trial is 
depicted in Fig. 2. Congruent and incongruent conditions were counterbalanced and randomly generated. The 
ANT paradigm for the fMRI session was programmed and presented to the participants using the  Presentation® 
software (Version 20.1, Neurobehavioral Systems, Inc., Berkeley, CA, United States, www. neuro bs. com).

Acquisition of MRI data
All MR imaging was performed on a 3T Philips Scanner, equipped with a 32-channel head coil at Klinikum 
Rechts der Isar in Munich, Germany. Whole brain functional scans, with 63 anterior commissure—posterior 
commissure (AC-PC) axial slices (0.2 mm interslice gap) were acquired using a T2*-weighted 2D single shot 
gradient-echo echo-planar imaging (GE-EPI) sequence, multi-band (MB) Factor = 3, echo time (TE) = 33 ms, 
repetition time (TR) = 1550 ms, flip angle = 70°, field of view (FOV) = 192 × 192 × 138.4   mm3, and an 8  mm3 
isotropic voxel resolution. The total ANT-fMRI acquisition time was 13 min. To estimate the corresponding field 
maps to correct for EPI-distortions77, two T2*-weighted images were acquired using a gradient echo sequence 
with two different TE lengths (long TE = 10.54 ms, short TE = 6.0 ms); here, the FOV, spatial resolution, and 
number of slices were the same as for the functional scans. Structural scans were acquired, with 230 AC-PC 
axial slices (0.7 mm interslice gap) using a T1-weighted MPRAGE sequence with TE = 5.2 ms, TR = 11 ms, flip 
angle = 8°, FOV = 256 × 240 × 161  mm3, and a voxel resolution of 0.7 ×  0.7 × 0.7  mm3. For DTI, diffusion-weighted 
images (DWI) were acquired with a TR = 5643 ms, TE = 96 ms, FOV = 224 × 256 × 132  mm3, and an isotropic voxel 
resolution of 2 mm. Diffusion-sensitizing gradient echo encoding was applied in 64 directions using a diffusion-
weighting factor (b) of 1400 s/mm2. The total DWI acquisition time was 8 min. The following sequences were 
additionally acquired during the imaging protocol: Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR, for clinical 
purposes), resting-state fMRI, and pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling (pCASL, to evaluate MMT effects on 
cerebral perfusion). Results of the resting-state fMRI and perfusion study are reported  in49  and78, respectively .

Figure 2.   This figure depicts a simplified version of the ANT. Arrows were presented in a column on either the 
right or left side of the screen. Here, it is important to note that the arrangement of the arrows deviated from 
the traditional ANT paradigm, such that the arrows were presented in a vertical column, as opposed to in a 
horizonal row. This was done as in-house pilot experiments indicated a greater effect in the orienting network of 
attention when the arrows were presented in the vertical arrangement. This figure was adapted  from76.

The DTI data was first denoised using the dwidenoise algorithm from  MRtrx379. The ExploreDTI  software80 
was used to conduct signal drift correction, Gibbs ringing correction, Venetian Blinds correction, motion, and 
EPI/eddy current distortion corrections. The preprocessed images were subsequently fitted to the constrained 
spherical deconvolution (CSD) model at each  voxel81,82. FA maps of the white matter tracts of interest were 
calculated and extracted using the automated/atlas-based region of interest (ROI) analysis of Explore DTI. The 
tracts of interest were selected based on the significant activations observed in the group-by-time interaction in 
the fMRI data from the ANT. These tracts included the SLF and the right uncinate fasciculus (rUNC). The atlas 
“JHU ICBM-DTI-81 White-Matter Labels”83 implemented in the ExploreDTI software was used to extract the FA 
values of the tracts of interest. To observe the group-by-time interaction effects, a two-way mixed ANOVA (with 
group as the between-subjects factor and time as the within-subjects factor) was conducted on the FA values of 
the SLF and rUNC. Statistical analyses were conducted using  R84. Multiple comparison corrections were applied 
using the Bonferroni  method85. Statistically significant changes in FA were visualized using raincloud  plots86. 
To visualize an example of the white matter tracts of interest, CSD-tractography in manually selected ROIs was 
done on a control and an experimental participant using Explore DTI.

Analysis of event‑related functional MRI data
Preprocessing and voxel-based analysis of the functional images were conducted using statistical parametric 
mapping (SPM12, The Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging, London, UK). Participants with a framewise 
displacement  (FDmean > 0.25) were  excluded87,88. Our pipeline to preprocess the data was as follows: Realignment 
to the mean functional imaging and unwarping of fMRI time-series, co-registration of anatomical MRI to 
mean functional image, segmentation of anatomical images, creation of a group-specific DARTEL  template89 
for normalization purposes, normalization to MNI space, and smoothing with a 4 mm FWHM Gaussian Kernel. 
Slice time correction was not performed as a multiband sequence was used to acquire the data and the TR used 
was less than 2 s, making the acquisition robust enough to avoid slice timing  problems90.

Based on the general linear model, a canonical hemodynamic response function was convolved on the event 
onset-times within the time series to create a statistical model of the ANT for each subject. Design matrices 
of the first level analysis consisted of five regressors: no cue (i.e., fixation cross), center cue, and spatial cue, in 
addition to the congruent- and incongruent targets. Six additional nuisance regressors pertaining to movement 
translations (x,y,z) and rotations (rx, ry, rz) were added to the design matrix. The second level analysis was 
performed using a two-way repeated measures full factorial ANOVA on the contrasts of interest: alerting network 
(center cue—no cue), orienting network (spatial cue—center cue), and executive attention network (incongruent 
target—congruent target). The height (intensity) threshold was set to uncorrected p = 0.05. Multiple comparison 
correction at p < 0.05 was determined by a Monte Carlo simulation yielding a cluster size threshold of 350 voxels 
(2 × 2 × 2  mm3). The parameters of the simulation were as follows: SPM volume in voxels (x = 64, y = 77, z = 50), 
local p = 0.05, one tail, global p = 0.05, fwhm = 2 voxels, number of iterations = 1500, t-distributed, df = 80, number 
of maps = 3 (https:// github. com/ mbrown/ fmrim ontec luster/ blob/ master/ fMRIM onteC luster.m by Grown, M. 
R. G. 2013). Parameter estimates of the activated clusters were obtained using  MarsBaR91. 3D visualizations of 
fMRI images were created following the  Madan92 Guide.

Behavioral data analyses
Training effects on the attentional networks were assessed using three three-way mixed ANOVAs on the RTs of 
the ANT, as seen  in43, with time (TP1 and TP2) and network conditions as the within-subject factors (i.e., no 
cue and center cue for the ANOVA of the alerting network condition; center cue and spatial cue for the ANOVA 
of the orienting network condition; congruent and incongruent target for the ANOVA of the executive network 
condition), and group (MMT and HT) as the between-subject factor. Effects on anxiety, stress levels, mindfulness, 
flow experience, and physical well-being were assessed by two-way mixed ANOVAs. Data distributions of the 
behavioral questionnaires are visualized in raincloud  plots86. Effect sizes were calculated using Cohen’s d (Eq. (1)).

Correlation between brain activation, ANT, and psychological outcomes
Based on our research interest and on the statistically significant behavioral results (i.e., the observed reduced 
stress and anxiety levels, and increased flow state after the MMT intervention), Pearson’s correlations (r) between 
(a) PSS and ANT-Reaction times, (b) PSS and brain activations, (c) ANT alerting network effect (center cue 
RT—no cue RT) and brain activations, (d) trait anxiety and brain activations, and (e) flow experience and

Results
Standardized questionnaires results
When conducting a two-way mixed ANOVA on trait anxiety we were able to observe a significant group-by-
time interaction (F(1,68) = 5.52, p = 0.02). Post-hoc paired t-tests confirmed a significant decrease in trait anxiety 
(t(35) = 3.29, p = 0.002) with a large effect size (Cohen’s d = − 1.30) in the MMT group; this significant decrease was 
not observed in the HT group (t(34) = 0.80, p = 0.43, Cohen’s d = − 0.28). It is important to note that the baseline 
value for trait anxiety was statistically different between the MMT and HT groups (t(73) = 2.33, p = 0.02) (Fig. 3a).
While the perceived stress questionnaires did not yield significant group-by-time interaction when conducting 
the two-way mixed ANOVA, we were, however, able to observe a significant decrease in stress levels in the MMT 
group at the second time point (TP2) (t(36) = 2.25, p = 0.03, Cohen’s d = 0.46), whereas no significant decrease in 
stress levels were observed in the HT group at TP2 (t(36) = 1.20, p = 0.24, Cohen’s d = 0.06) (Fig. 3b).

Additional behavioral measures of interest were mindfulness and flow. The two-way mixed ANOVA of the 
MAAS did not yield a significant interaction (F(1,71) = 1.120, p = 0.3) (Fig. 3c). A significant group-by-time 
interaction was, however, observed for the two-way mixed ANOVA of flow experience (F(1,51) = 9.254, p = 0.004). 
Post-hoc paired t-tests demonstrated a significant increase in flow experience for the MMT group (t(24) = − 4.56, 
p = 0.0001) with a large effect size (Cohen’s d = 1.46), which was not observed in the HT group (t(27) = − 0.09, 
p = 0.93, Cohen’s d = 0.04). It is important to note that the baseline value for flow experience was statistically 
different between the MMT and HT groups (t(51) = − 3.24 , p = 0.002) (Fig. 3d).

For our final measurement of interest, physical well-being, a moderate effect size (Cohen’s d = 0.52) was 
observed indicating an improvement in perceived physical well-being in the MMT group; however, this result 
was not statistically significant. No effect was observed in the HT group (Cohen’s d = 0.13) (Fig. 3e).

ANT reaction times results
Interestingly, the mean overall RT significantly improved by ~ 48 ms (t(1,19) = 5.07, p = 0.00008) in the MMT 
group at TP2, whereas the mean RT for the HT only decreased by ~ 23 ms, which was not statistically significant 
(t(1,22) = 1.10, p = 0.285) (Fig. 4). These results indicate that there was more than a two-fold RT improvement 
in the MMT group compared to the HT group. Despite these striking results for overall RT, this effect was not 
specific when considering the individual RTs of the three attentional conditions (i.e., the alerting-, orienting-, and 
executive- conditions) and conducting a three-way mixed ANOVA for each of them, with group as a between-
subjects factor, time and condition as within-subject factors, yielded no significant group-by-time-by-condition 
interaction across the different conditions.

In the following, all significant interactions are reported for a complete overview of the finding. A significant 
two-way interaction (F(1,39) = 6.811, p = 0.01) between group (i.e., MMT and HT) and condition (i.e., center 
cue and spatial condition) for the orienting condition of attention was observed. The post-hoc two-way ANOVA 
analysis revealed a significant main effect of group in the spatial cue condition (F(1,163) = 4.84,  p = 0.03), 
indicating that the MMT group demonstrated faster spatial cue RT at baseline and at TP2. As expected, a 
main  effect  of  condition  for  alerting  (no  cue  and  center  cue)  (F(1,39) = 11.097,  p = 0.002)  and  executive 
attention (incongruent and congruent) (F(1,40) = 34.39, p < 0.001) was observed, indicating that, when the 
condition was more cognitively effortful (i.e., complex) the reaction time increased. Furthermore, and not 
surprisingly, main effects of time were observed for each attentional condition (F(1,39)Alerting = 16.469, p < 0.001; 
F(1,39)Orienting = 21.16, p < 0.001; F(1,40)Executive = 15.53, p < 0.001), indicating practice effects from the first to 
second testing timepoints.

As seen by the effect sizes for the change in RT in each group (Table 1), the effects of the intervention were 
not specific to a particular attentional condition, indicating that, the RTs significantly improved for the MMT 
group in all attentional conditions, and did not have an effect on any particular attentional network.

fMRI results
To determine whether there was a significant change in brain activation during the ANT at TP2 as a result of the 
MMT, a whole brain, two-way, repeated measures full factorial ANOVA was conducted (Table 2). This analysis 
demonstrated a significant group-by-time interaction during the alerting condition in which an increase in 
activation in the left superior frontal gyrus (SFG; pFWE = 0.003, pmonte-carlo < 0.001), Brodmann area 31 (BA 31; 
pFWE < 0.001, pmonte-carlo < 0.001), and the right hippocampus  (pFWE = 0.240, pmonte-carlo = 0.001) in the MMT group 
(in comparison to the HT group) was observed. Figure 5 illustrates the significantly activated clusters from the 
group-by-time interaction, and Fig. 6 depicts the change in parameter estimates (β values) of the brain areas 
exhibiting increased activation in the MMT group via boxplot visualizations. Interestingly, we were also able to 
observe decreased activation (also visualized in the boxplots of the parameter estimates) in the HT group. The 
other attentional conditions (i.e., orienting, and executive attention) did not yield significant group-by-time 
interaction results.

DTI results
To determine whether the changes observed in brain activation during the ANT were accompanied with micro-
structural changes in the white matter of the brain, we conducted a DTI analysis on two fiber tracts, namely the 
right uncinate fasciculus (a tract that connects the PFC with the right hippocampus), and the SLF, a tract that 
connects the PCC (i.e., BA31) with the PFC. These fiber tracts were selected as they are associated with the signifi-
cant brain area activations observed during the ANT. The DTI results, through a group-by-time two-way mixed

Correlations: brain activations in the alerting condition, ANT reaction times, and psychologi‑
cal outcomes
An additional aim of this study was to determine the relationship between the neuroplastic and behavioral (i.e., 
psychological) changes upon completing the MMT; correlation analyses between the increased training-related 
brain activations in the ANT during the alerting condition (i.e., SFG, Brodmann Area 31, and right hippocampus) 
and behavioral measures (i.e., PSS, ANT RTs, trait anxiety, and flow experience) were therefore conducted.

The correlation analysis between perceived stress levels and the increased brain activations observed in the 
ANT yielded a significant negative correlation (r = − 0.51, p = 0.02, Fig. 8) between PSS scores and the activa-
tion in the right hippocampus after MMT that marginally survived the Holm’s correction method for multiple 
comparisons. This correlation was not observed in the MMT group before the intervention nor in the HT at any 
of the two time points (Table 3). An additional correlation analysis was conducted to observe whether there was 
an association between the change in PSS scores and the change in mean ANT reaction time in the MMT group 
(TP2 vs TP1). This correlation approached significance (r = 0.36, p = 0.059, one-tailed).

We were also interested in determining whether we could observe a relationship between the alerting effect 
(no cue—center cue) and the significant brain activations, but no significant correlations were found. However,

a trending, positive, correlation (r = 0.4) between the change in activation in the SFG and the change in reaction

Another correlation of interest within the scope of this study was to determine the relationship between 
trait anxiety levels and the observed brain activations. The correlation analysis yielded a significant negative 
correlation (r = − 0.46, p = 0.04) between the trait anxiety scores and the activation in the right hippocampus in 
the MMT group at TP2. Interestingly, we were also able to observe a significant positive correlation in the HT 
group at TP1 (r = 0.52, p = 0.02). No significant correlations were observed in the MMT at TP1 nor were any 
correlations observed in the HT group at TP2. However, it is important to note that the positive correlation 
observed in the HT group at TP1 only marginally survived Holm’s correction for multiple comparisons, while

the negative correlation in the MMT group at TP2 did not. No significant correlations were found between trait 
anxiety and the SFG, nor between trait anxiety scores and the Brodmann Area 31 (Table 3).

Our final correlation of interest was to observe the relationship between flow state and the increased brain 
activations. The correlation analysis yielded significant, positive, correlations in the MMT group at TP2 between 
flow experience and the right hippocampus activation (r = 0.49, p = 0.047), Brodmann area 31 activation (r = 0.64, 
p = 0.006), and SFG activation (r = 0.6, p = 0.01). No significant correlations were observed in the MMT group 
at TP1 nor in the HT group at TP1 or TP2 (Table 3). All significant correlations observed in relation to flow 
experience survived the Holm´s multiple comparison correction.

Discussion
The main aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of a 31-day web-based MMT on attention on both 
the behavioral and neuronal levels and its relationship with changes in perceived stress, trait anxiety, and flow 
experience. Through the use of robust analysis methods, the results of this study demonstrated that a brief web-
based MMT led to improvements in the behavioral measures of mental health (i.e., reductions in trait anxiety and 
stress levels), states of mind (i.e., flow experience), attentional performance (i.e., reaction-time improvements), 
and to significant neuroplastic changes exhibited by an increase in brain activation in the superior frontal gyrus, 
Brodmann area 31 (i.e., PCC), and right hippocampus during the alerting condition of the attentional task. These 
results were corroborated by changes observed in the microstructural integrity between the right hippocampus 
and the superior frontal gyrus (i.e., FA changes in the right uncinate fasciculus). We were able to observe these 
significant changes on both the behavioral and neuronal levels, and to associate the neuronal changes to our 
observed improvements in attention as well as to reductions in stress and trait anxiety. Our findings, therefore, 
contribute to the research conducted on possible interventions for chronic stress, an ever-increasing central 
health issue.

One of our main findings of interest demonstrated significant MMT-elicited improvements in cognitive and 
executive functioning, specifically attentional performance. We were able to demonstrate improvements in the 
overall RT during the ANT and to observe an increase in brain activation in the superior frontal gyrus, PCC, 
and right hippocampus during the alerting condition of the ANT. These neuronal findings are noteworthy given 
their association with cognitive and executive functioning seen in previous literature findings. For example, the 
PCC has been attributed to playing a crucial role in cognitive functioning, specifically with regard to the RT of 
cognitive performance, and it has been associated with the frontoparietal control network as well as the dorsal 
attention network, which are both critically involved in visuospatial  attention96–98. Our results observed in the 
PCC, therefore, continue to support previous findings reported in the literature.

Interestingly, as the PCC has been demonstrated to be a major node in multiple intrinsic connectivity 
networks it is directly associated with the hippocampus, ACC, and  PFC96. Like the PCC, the hippocampus is 
an important brain region involved in visuospatial  attention99. More specifically, the dorsal hippocampus plays 
a role in cognitive functioning, while the ventral hippocampus modulates behavioral adaptation to  stress100. 
Our findings observed in the right hippocampus, therefore, support the findings in the literature, while also 
continuing to emphasize the role the hippocampus plays in cognitive functioning and attention. Similarly, the 
ACC is a brain region involved in executive functioning and has also been implicated in the effects of mindfulness 
 meditation39,43,101. In fact, evidence supports that experienced meditators exhibit increased connectivity between 
the PCC, ACC, and  DLPFC46 which are brain areas attributed to cognitive functioning and are also susceptible 
to the effects of  MMT47,102–104. In addition, MMT studies conducted on naïve-meditators have also shown an 
increased resting-state PCC-DLPFC connectivity. The DLPFC, formed by the lateral part of the SFG and middle 
frontal  gyrus105, plays an important role in focused  attention106. Moreover, our observed activations in the SFG, 
can be linked to previous findings in which the SFG activations were attributed to higher cognitive functioning 
and, more specifically, to attentional shifting and spatial  cognition107,108. In fact, patients with attention-deficit/
hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) have shown abnormal function and structure in the  SFG109. Additionally, a study 
done on an epileptic patient, where activity in the SFG was recorded with subdural electrodes, demonstrated 
via the Flanker Task (an attention task similar in nature to that of the ANT) that the SFG actively participates in 
executive control  tasks110. Therefore, our trending toward significant correlation observed in the MMT group

Vol:.(1234567890)www.nature.com/scientificreports/between the increased SFG activation and faster RTs in the alerting condition of the ANT, is in line with this 
interpretation thus continuing to emphasize the important role MMT can have on improving attention.

Interestingly, we were able to observe both improvements in cognitive functioning as represented in the 
decrease in RTs during the ANT and a significant group-by-time interaction showing an increase in flow 
experience in the MMT. These findings are important as it implies that MMT can have an effect on both 
attentional mechanisms, as well as on the psychological flow state. While the research conducted on flow is still 
considered to be a relatively new line of  research111, the neuroimaging results observed in the present study are 
able to provide initial insight into the association between increased flow and neuroplastic changes through the 
observed correlation between flow-experience and brain activation in the right hippocampus, PCC, and SFG, 
during the ANT. This finding, therefore, emphasizes the important relationship between mindfulness, attentional 
functioning, and flow experience.

Although no significant group-by-time interaction was observed in perceived stress, we were able to 
demonstrate a statistically significant reduction in the MMT group in stress level (observed via the PSS), not 
seen in the HT group. It is important to note, that we may not have been able to observe an interaction for the 
PSS due to the low perceived stress at baseline for both the MMT and HT groups. Therefore, the null result in the 
group-by-time interaction should be considered with caution, especially when previous research demonstrated 
MMT’s ability to elicit greater stress reduction in individuals with higher initial stress than participants with 
lower initial stress  levels112.

We were also able to demonstrate a negative correlation between hippocampal activation and the PSS score in 
the MMT group at TP2 (Fig. 8). This finding is significant given the role of the hippocampus in modulating the 
behavioural adaptation to  stress100. In fact, previous research has been able to demonstrate a decrease in activation 
in brain areas associated with the limbic system (i.e., hippocampus, hypothalamus, medio orbitofrontal cortex, 
and ACC) during acute stress, triggered by an increase of cortisol  levels113, while also demonstrating that MMT 
can have an influence on both the functional and structural changes in the  hippocampus53,57,114,115. Our previous 
study utilizing voxel-based morphometry to observe MMT-elicited neuroplastic changes, demonstrated greater 
gray matter concentration in the right hippocampus of  meditators116, further emphasizing the importance of 
the increase in hippocampal activity observed in our functional imaging data. We were able to demonstrate an 
association between trait anxiety, perceived stress, and hippocampal activity during an attention task, and that 
MMT can have an influence on the white matter microstructure of the brain by means that we observed increased 
FA in the rUNC. These results indicate that MMT strengthened the connection between the hippocampus 
and areas of the frontal lobe. In fact, our findings replicate the results of our previous DTI study in which a 
significant increase in FA in the right UNC following MMT was  detected117. Other studies have also demonstrated 
an increase in FA of white matter tracts surrounding the dorsal part of the  hippocampus118, in addition to 
associating changes in the left UNC with the experience of silence in a different form of  meditation119. Our results 
demonstrating MMT-related activations in the hippocampus and increased FA in the rUNC, taken together with 
the finding in the literature, suggests a close relationship between structural and functional changes in specific 
brain regions and, more specifically, that the hippocampus may be a candidate to mediate the relationship 
between MMT, attention, and stress reduction.

It is, however, important to consider the limitations that accompany the scope of this study. For example, 
while previous studies demonstrated the effectiveness of a brief MMT on behavioral measures, additional studies 
were able to demonstrate that psychological outcomes can be positively moderated by the number of MMT hours 
 conducted2,120. Therefore, as our MMT was one month shorter in comparison to the standard MBSR  program3, 
we expect that by increasing the duration of our web-based MMT, larger effects could be reached. Nevertheless, 
our findings indicate that engaging in brief web-based MMT can also elicit significant behavioral and neuroplastic 
changes and is therefore a significant contribution to the literature.

An additional limitation to consider is the small sample size of our neuroimaging data, as it was challenging 
to find meditation-naïve, MRI suitable participants. And, given the longitudinal nature of this study, we also 
had an attrition rate of 
 10%. Moreover, technical issues with the MRI scanner or excessive motion during the 
scan reduced our sample size. Another disadvantage in our study design was the inability to prove participant 
compliance in the web-based training programs.

∼

Furthermore, the participant sample in this study exhibited a non-normal distribution for age; this, in turn, 
may have influenced the observed results, given the differences between the older and younger participants. In 
fact, previous studies have already reported differences in the impact of MMT between different age  groups121,122. 
Nevertheless, the results of this study ultimately contribute to the understanding of the neural mechanisms of 
MMT on attention, in addition to its impact on psychological outcomes. Future studies should investigate the 
use of the current web-based mindfulness training in clinical populations in an effort to observe similar results 
on stress, anxiety, and cognitive capacities.

Conclusion
This was a complex longitudinal, web-based MMT study involving acquisiton of several MR neuroimaging data, 
including event-related fMRI and DTI, and assessment of psychological outcomes by means of stadardized 
questionnaires. These data combined with the inclusion of an active control group successfully and reliably 
demonstrated that a short web-based mindfulness training has the potential to improve mental health (i.e., by 
reducing anxiety and perceived stress levels), cognitive performance (i.e., attention mechanisms), and state of 
mind (i.e., flow experience), which coincide with alterations in underlying brain structure (i.e., increased FA 
in the rUNC), and brain function (i.e., increased activation in the PCC, right hippocampus, and SFG). These 
findings provide the scientific community with valuable insight into the relationship between mindfulness 
training, mental health, cognitive function, and its corresponding neural correlates. More specifically, we

Vol.:(0123456789)www.nature.com/scientificreports/showed that the decrease in stress and anxiety in our experimental group is presumably a precursor of improved 
hippocampus function, reflected in improvements of alerting attention. And finally, this increase in functionality 
might have caused white matter changes in the rUNC which connects the right hippocampus with frontal areas 
of the brain known to be involved in attentional processes.

We were also able to demonstrate an important link between the mindfulness meditation training-related 
increase in flow experience and the SFG, right hippocampus and PCC, which as previously described are 
important brain areas involved in attentional processes. Furthermore, a recent publication by  Xie123 was able 
to demonstrate an association between flow experience, mindfulness, and team-working abilities. The study 
reported a correlation indicating that productivity was associated with higher mindfulness and flow experience 
levels. Given these findings, our results may indicate that the web-based MMT used in our study may be suitable 
for companies and their employers due to its ability to increase flow experience and attention. Previous literature 
have also suggested a link between mindfulness, flow, and higher workplace  performance124. Web-based MMTs 
could, therefore, be beneficial to companies and their employers by increasing workflow experience, and may 
also help to decrease the stress and anxiety elicited by a stressful workday. As stress and anxiety have been 
demonstrated to impair cognitive performance and  function125, MMTs, by decreasing stress and anxiety levels, 
help to improve overall cognitive function (i.e., attention), thereby improving productivity.

In conclusion, web-based MMT could serve as an important tool to both increase the overall well-being of 
individuals suffering from stress and anxiety and to improve domains of cognitive function such as attention. 
Moreover, our web-based MMTs provide a larger portion of the population with a validated tool to improve their 
overall mental health and physical well-being.

As future directions, we plan to employ the current web-based mindfulness training in clinical populations, 
such as in obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) and ADHD patients, hoping to see similar effects predominantly 
on stress, anxiety, flow experience, and cognitive capacities. As well as to better understand the neurological 
mechanisms of action behind these changes, and how these can help in the treatment and prognosis of psychiatric 
diseases.
