Abstract: The objective of the study was to evaluate the efﬁcacy of an animal-assisted-therapy (AAT)
program in patients diagnosed with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders and substance-use disorders
in residential treatment in order to intervene in the remission of negative and positive symptoms and
improve quality of life and adherence to treatment, favouring the clinical stabilization of patients
who participate in the AAT program, within the context of a mental-illness-treatment device. This
was a quasi-experimental prospective study with intersubject and intrasubject factors. The sample
comprised 36 patients (21 in the experimental group and 15 in the control group) who were evaluated
at three time points (in the 3rd, 6th, and 10th sessions). The program lasted 3 months and consisted
of 10 sessions that were implemented once a week, with a maximum participation of 10 patients
per group. The participants were evaluated with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS)
for schizophrenia and the Life Skills Proﬁle-20 (LSP-20) questionnaire. We observed a decrease in the
positive symptoms of psychosis (F: 27.80, p = 0.001) and an improvement in functionality (F: 26.70,
p < 0.001) as the sessions progressed. On the basis of these results, we concluded that AAT seems to
be valid as a coadjuvant therapy as part of the rehabilitation processes of patients diagnosed with
schizophrenia and addiction-spectrum disorders (dual diagnosis).

1. Introduction

Schizophrenia is considered one of the most challenging mental disorders known to
science due to the complexity of the disease and the presentation of the factors that comprise
it. The National Institute of Mental Health [1] deﬁnes schizophrenia as a chronic, inﬂexible,
and disabling mental illness, in which contact with reality and basic psychological processes
are lost. In addition to the positive and negative symptoms of the illness, the involvement of
other spheres, such as the cognitive and affective domains, tends to limit the functionality of
patients in all areas of their lives (work, family, and leisure, among others). In this context,
the negative symptoms (emotional blockage or the inability to express affection) and the
positive symptoms (hallucinations, delusions, stereotypies, catatonia, and disorganisation
of thought, language, and behaviour) sometimes disable some personal faculties, hindering
emotional expression and the course and performance of thought. All this symptomatology,
in many cases, reduces interpersonal functionality and hinders the favourable evolution

of treatment, and therefore reduces functionality [2,3], and even hinders pharmacological
treatment [4].

The presence of a substance-use disorder (SUD) and another mental illness in the
same patient is called dual diagnosis (DD). DD, this coexistence of a mental disorder with
substance use, makes treatment difﬁcult and challenging due to the worsening of the clinical
manifestations, as well as generates a worse evolution in care for the consumption disorder,
conﬁguring a serious clinical proﬁle that requires continuous and speciﬁc attention, with
problems such as those due to more frequent relapses, more continuous psychiatric care, etc.,
and, according to recent studies, DD is very common in schizophrenia, with a prevalence
of around 48% [5,6]. Patients with schizophrenia who present a DD tend to have more
relapses, a poorer clinical evolution, and more difﬁculties in the rehabilitation process [7,8].
In addition, schizophrenia does not affect patients equally, and its symptomatologic course
is heterogeneous and variable, with this element also determining the therapeutic approach.
Schizophrenia is associated with a high degree of incapacitation, a poor functional prognosis
at work, and inferior levels of social and daily life skills, all of which notably reduce patient
quality of life [9].

Current therapeutic proposals for this disease are multidimensional, but they mainly
consist of combining antipsychotic drugs and psychosocial and psychoeducational interven-
tions, prioritising the goal of achieving greater patient autonomy. In this multidimensional
context, animal-assisted therapy (AAT) can be applied as a complement to standard treat-
ments, thereby helping to provide patients with the skills required for them to develop
everyday life and social functionality [10–14]. AAT is deﬁned as an intervention with a
speciﬁc, structured, and directed goal, which is implemented by professionals in the ﬁeld of
health and education, and which uses an animal as a therapeutic instrument and as another
tool in the rehabilitation process. AAT can be implemented by using different animals,
including dogs, cats, and horses, among others. However, dogs are most often used in this
type of therapy because of the variety of breeds available, their ease of training, and their
commonplace use as positive reinforcements for patients. This intervention is carried out
in different settings, such as schools, nursing homes, prisons, or mental-health-treatment
resources [15–18].

Patients who are diagnosed with a schizophrenia-spectrum disorder and substance use
have impaired levels of activity and social functioning, and reduced social problem-solving
strategies, which can be the object of intervention from the AAT. Patients beneﬁt from this
therapy through the animal interaction. These beneﬁts include socialisation, stress, and
anxiety management, and the enhancement of basic functional skills, which all favour their
motivation and further participation in treatments [15,16,19–21]. However, AAT has not
yet been evaluated as a potential treatment in patients with DD. Therefore, the objective of
the current study was to assess the efﬁcacy of the AAT program in terms of the evolution of
the psychotic symptomatology and functionality of patients with schizophrenia-spectrum
disorder and SUD. We hypothesised that: (1) AAT decreases positive and negative psychotic
symptoms and general psychopathology; (2) AAT increases functionality; and (3) the
positive and negative symptoms mediate how AAT affects functionality.

2. Materials and Methods

This was a quasi-experimental prospective study in patients diagnosed with schizophrenia-
spectrum disorders and SUD in residential treatment, and, specifically, the detoxification pro-
gram in the Therapeutic Community of Project Amigó Castellón. The patients included in the
research were selected through nonprobabilistic nonrandomised consecutive sampling over
24 months. The patients were sequentially allocated to the experimental group (EG) or the
control group (CG), in that order. The definitive sample size was set at 36 patients, of which
21 took part in the AAT program, and the remaining 15 did not. Thus, the study presents an
intersubject factor according to participation in the EG or CG. The inclusion criteria were the
following: both sexes over 18 years old diagnosed with schizophrenia-spectrum disorder and
DD, cooperating with treatment in a residential resource in the province of Castellón de la Plana,

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 6695

having been prescribed psychopharmacological treatment, and the willingness to participate in
the study and having signed the informed consent.

The exclusion criteria were the following: the presence of a mental disorder other
than the object of study, individuals whose functioning may be impaired by factors not
speciﬁcally related to schizophrenia or DD (having received electroconvulsive therapy,
severe cognitive impairment, etc.), not following the indications of the pharmacological
regimen and the guidelines proposed by the centre’s rehabilitation team, and allergy or
phobia to dogs. In the EG, 5 subjects dropped out, and 3 were excluded for not meeting
the inclusion criteria in the study. In the CG, 3 participants dropped out, and 2 were
not accepted because they did not meet the established criteria. There is no signiﬁcant
difference between both groups in the percentage of excluded and dropouts (χ2 = 0.49;
p = 0.976).

The CG received the standard treatment provided at the residential treatment centre
where the participants were undergoing rehabilitation, which consisted of sessions of
psychotherapy, psychoeducation, and a speciﬁc program for the treatment of schizophrenia
and substance use from a cognitive behavioural approach, while the EG received the
standard care and also participated in the AAT as a complementary therapy. The AAT
program was implemented in 10 sessions delivered over a maximum of 3 months. One
session lasting 45 min was delivered per week in groups of a maximum of 10 patients. A
therapy dog, social educator, psychologist, AAT technician, and dog trainer all participated
in delivering the sessions. Each therapy session starts with the presentation and greeting
to the patients, animal, and therapist, who make up the therapy group. The greeting
consists of introducing yourself to the dog and petting it at the beginning of the session.
The warm-up exercise continues, with a very speciﬁc objective: focus the attention of the
patient and the animal on the initiated group. The exercises are simple: introduction,
greeting, brushing, and caressing speciﬁc areas. After the warm-up, the speciﬁc exercise of
the session is given, and dog–patient occurs to achieve the objectives set for the session.
Before the end of the session, a time of sharing experiences, sensations, and emotions is
shared, and the session concludes with the farewell of the dog and therapist patients, and a
call for the next session.

In the session, patients are informed of different aspects of canine behaviour, such
as their care, feeding, and the learning or extinction of behaviours through positive rein-
forcement (prizes in the form of food, caresses, or congratulations), and the behaviour that
should be observed.

The materials used in the sessions were food prizes, clicker, drinker, leash, bib, brush,

mitten, comb, balls, cones, rings, cardboard, envelopes, blackboard, backpack, and table.

The intrasubject factor was the AAT session number (3rd, 6th, and 10th sessions),
when two different questionnaires were completed: The Positive and Negative Syndrome
Scale (PANSS) for schizophrenia (comprising three factors: positive symptoms, negative
symptoms, and general psychopathology). The validity and reliability of the scale has
been demonstrated in people with schizophrenia in Spain. The internal consistency of
the positive scale is moderate (Cronbach’s α = 0.62), high for the negative scale (α = 0.92),
and modest for general psychopathology (α = 0.55). Interobserver reliability is good for
the positive and negative scales (ICC = 0.71 and 0.80, respectively), and moderate for
the general psychopathology scale (ICC = 0.56). Construct validity between positive and
negative scales is good ((r = 0.09), n.s., between the positive and negative scales). The
criterion validity is high, showing a high correlation of the positive and negative scales
with the SAPS and SANS scales (r = 0.70 and r = 0.81, respectively) [22,23]. The Life Skills
Proﬁle-20 (LSP-20). The scale shows an internal consistency of 0.85, which ranges from
0.69 to 0.79 for the ﬁve areas assessed. Interobserver reliability is above 0.60 for all ﬁve
areas [24,25]. To enhance the validity of the data, different people performed the therapy,
data collection, and analysis. The person collecting the data was blind to the group to
which the subjects belonged and was trained in the use of the evaluation instruments. To
standardize the results, we use the PANSS percentile scores.

2.1. Statistical Analysis

Data analysis was performed with SPSS software for Microsoft (version 23.0; IBM
Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). After the exploratory and descriptive analyses, quantitative
descriptive variables were compared using Student t-tests (checking normality with the
Shapiro–Wilk test and equality of variances with the Levene test), and categorical variables
were compared using Pearson chi-squared tests. The dependent variables were subse-
quently compared between the groups and at the three time points by applying mixed
MANOVA tests by using the group as the intersubject factor, and the evaluation time point
as the intrasubject factor. Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons was used. Finally,
the data were modelled using PROCESS v3.4 for SPSS [26] to test our three hypotheses.

2.2. Ethical Factors

This study was designed in accordance with the principles set out in the 2013 Declara-
tion of Helsinki, Spanish Organic Law 3/2018, of December 5 on the Protection of Personal
Data, and the law on the Guarantee of Digital Rights and Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the
European Parliament, and of the European Council of April 27, 2016, on Data Protection
(GDPR). All patients who participated in the study signed their informed consent.

In relation to the therapy dog, all the criteria established in the following laws were
met: (1) the IAHAIO White Paper of 2018; (2) the European Convention on the protection of
companion animals of 1987; (3) the Declaration on Animals, approved on 15 October 1987;
(4) the Valencian regional government (Generalitat) Law 12/2003 of April 10 on Assistance
Dogs for People with Disabilities (DOGV № 4479, of 4 November 2003); (5) Decree 167/2006
of November 3 by the local Valencian council that developed Law 12/2003 of April 10 of the
Generalitat on Assistance Dogs for People with Disabilities (DOGV № 5382 of 7 November
2006); and (6) the Order of 30 May 2007 of the Ministry of Social Welfare that approves
the application model for the procedure used to recognise assistance dogs for people with
disabilities, the minimum content of pet-assisted therapy projects (TAAC in its original
initialism in Spanish; DOCV № 5532, of 6 December 2007), and the pertinent documents
required to request assistance-dog recognition. This study has the report of the Ethics
Committee for Biomedical Research of the CEU Cardenal Herrera University, registry
CEEI21/197, and the relevant registration in the clinical trials, with registry NCT05103865.

3. Results
3.1. Sociodemographic and Clinical Characteristics

No signiﬁcant differences were found between the EG and the CG in terms of age, sex,

marital status, family relationships, or employment status.

The mean age of the sample was 40.3 years (SD = 6.1), with the patients having
received a mean of 2.18 treatments (SD = 0.81), having made a mean 0.65 suicide attempts
(SD = 0.72), and with a mean of 1.3 hospital admissions to emergency mental health services
(SD = 1.52). Most of the patients (86.1%) were male. The most prevalent marital status was
single (72.2%; n = 26), followed by separated or divorced (25%; n = 9), and only 2.8% (n = 1)
of the participants were married; most of them maintained contact with their families
(66.7%; n = 24). See Table 1.

In terms of employment, half of the participants were employed and on temporary sick
leave, and the other half were unemployed or were receiving some type of social beneﬁt.
Regarding the education of the patients, we found that 2.8% (n = 1) had not completed
any studies; 19.4% (n = 7) had started but not completed their primary education; 8.3%
had graduated from school with a basic education; 61.1% (n = 22) had completed the
Uniﬁed Polyvalent Baccalaureate, compulsory secondary education, or level 1 vocational
training; 5.6% (n = 2) had higher vocational training; and only 2.8% (n = 1) of the sample
had completed university-level studies.

Note: CG: control group; EG: experimental group; AAT: animal-assisted therapy.

Regarding substance use, no signiﬁcant differences were found between the CG and
EG, and so they were considered comparable. The participants had been using substances
for a mean of 25.2 years (SD = 6.6). Polydrug use of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) + cocaine
+ alcohol stood out, with a prevalence of 44.4% (n = 16) in the sample groups. In the EG,
the second most consumed substance was alcohol (16.7%; (n = 6)), followed by cocaine
(11.1%%; (n = 4)), heroin + cocaine (5.6%; (n = 2)), and, ﬁnally, THC (2.8%%; (n = 1)). In
the CG, the polydrug use of THC + cocaine + alcohol was followed by the use of cocaine,
alcohol, and heroin + cocaine (5.6%; n = 2 for all of them), and lastly, THC (2.8%; n = 1).

In relation to comorbid medical pathologies, no differences were found between
the groups, which highlights the fact that the majority (63.9%; n = 23) did not present
any organic pathologies. However, 5.6% (n = 2) had hepatitis B and C (HBV + HCV)
coinfection, while 8.3% had human HIV + HBV, 11.1% had human immunodeﬁciency
virus (HIV) + HCV, and 5.6% had a multiple HIV + HBV + HCV infection. Regarding
the psychopharmacological treatment, there were no statistically signiﬁcant differences
between the groups. Of note, after treatment with antipsychotics, the most used drug in
the CG was antidepressants (33.3%; n = 5), followed by anxiolytics (13.3%; n = 2), which
was similar to the EG, in which 19% (n = 4) of the patients used antidepressants, and 28.6%
(n = 6) used anxiolytics.

3.2. Evaluation of Positive and Negative Psychotic Symptomatology and General Psychopathology

The MANOVA analysis found signiﬁcant effects for the group (F: 4.799; p: 0.004;
ˆη2: 0.382; (1 − β): 0.920), the measurement time point (F: 14.266; p < 0.001; ˆη2: 0.809;
(1 − β): 1), and the interaction between both these factors (F: 10.52; p < 0.001; ˆη2: 0.757;
(1 − β): 1). As shown in Table 2 and Figure 1a,d, compared to the CG that only received
standard treatment, the results for the EG indicate that AAT produced a reduction in
positive symptoms and an increase in the skills required for everyday living in patients
with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders who also presented SUDs.

The positive symptoms in both groups were comparable at the beginning of the study
and decreased throughout the treatment period, although they decreased signiﬁcantly more
in the EG, which presented fewer positive symptoms at time points 2 (F: 25.66; p: 0.006) and
3 (F: 27.81; p: 0.002), compared to the CG (Figure 1a). Regarding the negative symptoms
(Figure 1b), there were signiﬁcant differences between the groups at the beginning of the
study (F: −19.14; p: 0.030), with the EG presenting a higher score, and the groups were
not comparable in this variable. Even so, this difference was no longer present by the end
of the study, and so we inferred that the score in the EG had reduced more than the CG
score. The levels of general psychopathology (Figure 1c) decreased in both groups, with no
signiﬁcant differences between them throughout the study. The daily life skills (Figure 1d)
of both groups were comparable at the beginning of the study and increased thereafter, but

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 6695

6 of 11

there was signiﬁcantly more improvement in the EG, which presented more skills at the
end of the AAT compared to the CG (F: −20.44; p: 0.001).

Figure 2 shows the mediation model that was used to evaluate the relationships
between the variables studied. However, the results regarding the negative symptoms were
not reliable because the two groups were not comparable at the beginning of the study. As
shown, the AAT was related to a decrease in the positive symptoms and an increase in
functionality, without the changes in psychotic symptoms appearing to mediate the effect
of AAT on functionality.

4. Discussion

To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst scientiﬁc article to have analysed the
response of patients with a DD (schizophrenia and SUD) to treatment with AAT in terms
of their psychotic symptomatology and daily functionality. On the basis of the results of
this study, there was some evidence that our ﬁrst hypothesis was partially fulﬁlled because
AAT reduced the positive symptomatology of the patients in the EG. In addition, AAT may

have also helped to reduce the negative symptomatology; however, we cannot conclude the
latter because the results were likely masked by the baseline differences in both groups at
the beginning of the intervention. With regard to the second hypothesis, this work conﬁrms
that AAT helped improve the daily life skills of patients with schizophrenia and SUD,
thus improving their everyday functionality. However, the third hypothesis was rejected
because the positive and negative symptoms did not seem to mediate how AAT affected
the functionality of the patients studied.

With regard to the positive psychotic symptomatology, our results were consistent
with those of other authors that have independently studied the response of patients with
schizophrenia or SUD to AAT. There is a lot of heterogeneity in the few studies that have
evaluated the efﬁcacy of AAT on the positive symptoms of schizophrenia. A systematic
review by Hawkins et al. (2019) included seven randomised placebo-controlled clinical
trials, among which only one found a signiﬁcant reduction in the positive and emotional
symptomatology of patients with schizophrenia [27]. A few studies have also analysed
the presence and evolution of psychotic symptoms in patients with SUD after completing
an AAT intervention. Contalbrigo et al. (2017) published a study that carried out an AAT
intervention in men with SUD over a period of 6 months and, in line with our results, they
observed a signiﬁcant reduction in psychoticism and paranoid ideation [28].

Other work has previously shown how the relationship between dogs and humans
improves the social support perceived by patients and facilitates the learning of effective
coping strategies [29]. These two factors, in turn, decrease levels of psychological stress,
which can be measured through a decrease in cortisol levels, heart rate, and blood pres-
sure [30]. An important role for basal cortisol levels in patients at risk of psychosis has
recently been demonstrated, and it has been determined that this factor is directly related
to the appearance of psychotic symptoms [31]. This current work demonstrates, for the
ﬁrst time, how an AAT intervention can reduce positive symptoms in patients with a DD
of schizophrenia and SUD, and it adds to the body of evidence derived from previously
published studies on the role that this type of therapy could play in the future treatment of
patients with schizophrenia and/or SUDs.

With regard to the negative symptomatology, it is worth noting that these symptoms
are usually refractory to treatment with antipsychotics, and they notably affect the quality
of life and functionality of these patients [32]. In the review by Hawkins et al., only one
study found a signiﬁcant reduction in the negative symptomatology in patients with
schizophrenia after an AAT intervention [27]. From a neurobiological point of view, some
mechanisms of action have been hypothesised that could explain why we would expect
AAT to reduce negative symptoms in patients with schizophrenia. One such mechanism,
postulated by Hawkins et al. (2019), is that of oxytocin, a hormone whose intranasal
administration has been shown to decrease the levels of psychotic symptomatology in
patients with schizophrenia [33], and whose levels increase with the interaction of human
beings with dogs [34]. Our own results show how the signiﬁcant differences in negative
symptomatology in the EG and CG at the beginning of the treatment had disappeared by
the end of the intervention, apparently as the result of a decrease in the intensity of these
symptoms in the treatment group. However, although our ﬁndings point in this direction,
we cannot conclude that AAT reduced the negative symptoms in our EG of patients. This
difference in baseline psychopathology may have also masked the detection of signiﬁcant
differences in the general psychopathology of the patients we studied.

In this work, we were also able to objectify how the daily functioning of patients with
a DD (schizophrenia and SUD) treated with AAT signiﬁcantly improved compared to the
CG. According to our results, this was a direct effect of AAT, whereby the improvement
in the psychotic symptoms did not function as a mediator. Of note, the effect of AAT on
daily functioning has previously been studied in different clinical trials, and especially
in patients with schizophrenia. For instance, Barak et al. (2001) studied adaptive social
functioning and the activities of daily living in 20 patients diagnosed with schizophrenia.
The group receiving the AAT showed increased levels of mobility, interpersonal contact,

communication, and activities of daily living, including in relation to personal hygiene
and self-care.

However, contrary to our study, most of the study cohort in the aforementioned study
were women [35]. Another study, also conducted in a sample of patients with schizophrenia,
identiﬁed an improvement in the proﬁle of daily living skills and an increase in the social-
interaction score [36]. Moreover, an improvement in appropriate social behaviours, greater
interaction between patients, and an increase in smiles and satisfaction were also identiﬁed
in a study on patients with both schizophrenia and a history of substance abuse in the group
that received an AAT intervention, compared to the controls [37]. In addition, Uhlmann
et al. (2019) analysed a sample of patients with SUD and concluded that patients perceived
a more pleasant atmosphere when dogs were present, and felt that they had an opportunity
to modify their dysfunctional behaviour patterns by acquiring new personal, social, and
emotional competencies [38].

Thus, all these results, including those presented in this present study, invite us to
think of AAT as a directly effective therapy for promoting and improving the activities of
daily living, regardless of whether it be in patients with or without psychotic symptoms, in
those diagnosed exclusively with schizophrenia, or in patients presenting a dual phenotype.
Within the policies and actions in mental health, it seems appropriate to indicate that this
type of intervention must be considered, since they follow the guidelines of the current
mental health clinical plans. However, before concluding, it is important to mention the
limitations of this work. First of all, this study is considered quasi-experimental because the
groups were not randomized, which may have inﬂuenced our results, and so they should be
interpreted with caution. In addition, we did not consider the gender variable, which may
have inﬂuenced the results [39,40], although there were no signiﬁcant differences between
the groups for this variable at the start of treatment. Another important limitation is that,
due to difﬁculties with the start of the study, the subjects were not evaluated at baseline, but
instead began to be evaluated in the third session. Moreover, as the AAT was not compared
to another complementary therapy, extra time spent in therapy by the AAT group may
have hindered our results. The small sample size and the inequality between the groups
would make it convenient to use a nonparametric test; however, the nonparametric analysis
of the interaction is not incorporated into the statistical packages [41], and so MANOVA
was used. Another problem with MANOVA is that, if a variable has been entered as within
subjects, it is not possible to also enter it as a covariate, which would have been very useful
with the negative PANSS score, since the two groups start at different points. Another
important issue is that, although exclusions and dropouts occurred equally in both groups,
it is not possible to disentangle the effect of the AAT from the clinical characteristics at the
time of dropout or refusal to participate, which may inﬂuence the outcome averages, as
it is a small sample. Finally, this study was conducted in a speciﬁc therapeutic scenario,
which makes it difﬁcult to extrapolate the results to other care resources, such as speciﬁc
centres for people with mental disorders (CEEMs in their Spanish acronym), day hospitals,
etc. [42–44]. Nor did we consider the possible underlying animosity or afﬁnity patients
may have for these animals, which could have altered the effectiveness of the AAT.

5. Conclusions

In summary, this is the ﬁrst study to evaluate the efﬁcacy of AAT on the psychotic
symptomatology and everyday functionality of patients with DD (schizophrenia and
SUD). The implementation of AAT as a complementary approach to the standard therapy
provided at the residential centre where this study was conducted reduced the positive
symptoms and improved the daily functionality of patients with DD. In addition, we
demonstrated that AAT directly affects the daily functioning of patients independently
of psychotic symptomatology. Therefore, this work adds to the body of evidence for the
efﬁcacy of AAT in patients with a DD as one of the most vulnerable patient groups.
