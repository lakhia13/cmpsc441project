Abstract
Objective: Despite the promising results related to intuitive eating, few studies have
attempted to explain the processes encouraging this adaptive eating behaviour. The
focus of the present study was on exploring mechanisms of change in intuitive
eating and weight in acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) interventions.
Mediation provides important information regarding the treatment processes and
theoretical models related to speciﬁc treatment approaches. The study investigates
whether psychological ﬂexibility, mindfulness skills and sense of coherence
mediated the interventions’ effect on intuitive eating and weight.
Design: Secondary analysis of a randomized control
trial. Mediation analysis
compared two ACT interventions – face-to-face (in a group) and mobile
(individually) – with a control group using a latent difference score model.
Settings: Data were collected in three Finnish towns.
Subjects: The participants were overweight or obese (n 219), reporting symptoms
of perceived stress.
Results: The effect of the interventions on participants’ (i) BMI, (ii) intuitive eating
and its subscales, (iii) eating for physical rather than emotional reasons and
(iv) reliance on internal hunger and satiety cues was mediated by changes in
weight-related psychological ﬂexibility in both ACT groups.
Conclusions: These ﬁndings suggest that ACT interventions aiming for lifestyle
changes mediate the intervention effects through the enhanced ability to continue
with valued activities even when confronted with negative emotions and thoughts
related to weight.

Weight-loss programmes based on restricted eating are
becoming more and more popular in social contexts
where being slim is perceived as ideal but being over-
weight has become more common. The long-term beneﬁts
of such programmes are questionable, as the majority of
they lose(1,2).
individuals eventually regain the weight
Previous research examining the success of dieting has
concluded that diets lead to short-term weight loss, usually
5–10 % of body weight, but this weight loss is not main-
tained in the long term by the majority of people(1–3).
It has been estimated that about 20 % of
individuals
with overweight are successful at long-term weight loss,
when deﬁned as losing at least 10 % of one’s initial body
weight and maintaining the loss for at least 1 year(4). Most
weight-loss diets expect people to constantly control

consumption. However, poor long-term results suggest
that the majority of persons who have overweight cannot
sustain rigid control.

In contrast to controlled eating, intuitive eating is a style
of eating that follows the natural contingencies of an
individual’s perception of physical hunger and satiety cues
rather than emotional or environmental cues(5,6). Three
central and interrelated components of intuitive eating
have been identiﬁed: (i) unconditional permission to eat
when hungry and what
lack of
restrictions in eating); (ii) eating for physical rather than
emotional reasons; and (iii) reliance on internal hunger
and satiety cues to determine when and how much to
eat(6). Intuitive eating has found to be related to the
absence of eating disorder symptoms(6) and to better

psychological(6,7) and physical health, such as lower
BMI(6,8,9), cholesterol levels and blood pressure(7). Despite
the promising results related to intuitive eating, few studies
have attempted to explain the processes supporting
intuitive eating regulation. What self-regulation processes
are needed in order to resist eating based on emotional or
external cues?

Overeating in response to emotional experiences and
external cues (e.g. presence of palatable food) can be
understood as a failure in self-regulation(10). Studies have
indicated that persons with obesity who have difﬁculty
losing or keeping off weight more often use food as a
source of comfort and satisfaction(11), eat after difﬁcult
interpersonal situations(12) and eat in response to negative
emotions(13). Consequently,
the function of emotional
eating appears to be experiential avoidance that is an
attempt to avoid negative private experiences (thoughts,
feelings, sensations). Experiential avoidance is a central
process in the development of a range of mental health
including
and
eating-related difﬁculties(16–18). Accordingly, ‘third wave’
behaviour therapies, such as acceptance and commitment
therapy (ACT), focus on avoidance by helping individuals
to relate ﬂexibly to interfering private events and regulate
their behaviour based on personal values and goals
instead of emotional experiences or thoughts(19).

problems(14,15)

health

More precisely, ACT is expected to improve individuals’
functioning and quality of life by increasing their psycho-
logical ﬂexibility including mindfulness skills. Psychological
ﬂexibility and mindfulness are adaptive regulation and
coping processes that can be seen as opposites to experi-
ential avoidance(20). Psychological ﬂexibility is deﬁned as the
ability to act effectively in accordance with one’s personal
values in the presence of interfering thoughts, emotions
and bodily sensations(14). Mindfulness can be described as
an adaptive regulation process involving enhanced attention
and non-judgemental
concerning present-
awareness
moment experiences(21,22). The current state of evidence
suggests that the concepts speciﬁed by the ACT model work
very consistently as mediators across the wide range of
including eating-related issues(18),
targeted by
problems,
ACT. Successful ACT mediators include general or speciﬁc
measures of acceptance and psychological ﬂexibility(23–27),
defusion(25,28,29), values(25) and mindfulness(16).

Psychological ﬂexibility and mindfulness promote the
willingness to approach and experience emotions and are
therefore likely to reduce experiential avoidance, such as
emotional eating. Mindfulness practice has been suggested
to help individuals ‘connect’ with their inner experiences,
such as hunger, thereby attenuating their sensitivity to
external or emotional cues to eat(30,31). On a cognitive
level, mindfulness has been proposed to reduce identiﬁ-
cation with thoughts about food, body and shape, thereby
interrupting dysfunctional thinking patterns(32) that could
predispose someone to emotional or restricted eating.
Thus, psychological ﬂexibility and mindfulness can be

possible self-regulation processes that promote adaptive
eating behaviours, such as intuitive eating, and offer a new
approach to effecting weight management.

The current study is based on a recent randomized
lifestyle
controlled trial comparing three psychological
interventions aimed at
improving the well-being of
adults with overweight experiencing psychological stress:
(i) an ACT-based face-to-face group intervention; (ii) an
ACT-based mobile intervention; and (iii) a web-based edu-
cation intervention (for details of the design, see Lappalainen
et al.(33)). Kolehmainen and colleagues (M Kolehmainen,
E Sairanen, E Järvelä-Reijonen et al., unpublished results)
found that psychological ﬂexibility related to weight issues
improved in ACT intervention groups. The current study
sought to further examine the effects of the ACT interven-
tions on psychological processes and adaptive eating beha-
viour. The aim was to provide a complementary perspective
on the role of acceptance and ﬂexibility in the context
of intuitive eating by evaluating the mediating effects of
mindfulness and psychological ﬂexibility on intuitive eating
and weight in terms of improvements. We were interested to
see if processes speciﬁed by the ACT model worked as
mediators
to non-ACT-related processes.
Accordingly, the mediating effects of psychological ﬂexibility
and mindfulness were investigated in comparison with
sense of coherence, a variable less associated with ACT yet
commonly used to explain how people manage stressful
situations and stay well(34).

in contrast

The speciﬁc aims of the present study were as follows.
First, we investigated the effects of the ACT interventions –
face-to-face (in a group) and mobile (individually) – on
intuitive eating, mindfulness and sense of coherence in
comparison with each other and a control group. The face-
to-face and mobile ACT interventions were expected to
have similar effects on all measurements. Intervention
effects on weight and psychological ﬂexibility have been
reported elsewhere (M Kolehmainen, E Sairanen, E Järvelä-
Reijonen et al., unpublished results) and are presented as
descriptive statistics herein. Second, we examined whether
(i) psychological ﬂexibility (general and weight speciﬁc),
(ii) mindfulness skills and (iii) sense of coherence mediate
the intervention effect on intuitive eating and weight in
ACT interventions. The changes in psychological ﬂexibility
and mindfulness skills were expected to mediate the
intervention effects similarly in both ACT interventions.
Psychological ﬂexibility and mindfulness were expected to
be more important mediators in the ACT interventions
than was sense of coherence.

and general well-being among individuals with over-
weight or obesity experiencing stress. The study design
and interventions of the larger study are described in detail
elsewhere(33) and brieﬂy here. The participants for the
study were recruited through advertisements in local
newspapers and selected based on speciﬁc inclusion
criteria: BMI of 27·0–34·9 kg/m2 (based on self-reported
weight and height), age 25–60 years and reporting
symptoms of perceived psychological stress (scored at
least 3 out of 12 points on the General Health
Questionnaire(35)). The study took place in Finland.

In the larger study, altogether 298 participants com-
pleted the baseline measurements and were randomly
divided into an ACT face-to-face intervention group
(n 70), an ACT mobile intervention group (n 78), a
web-based education intervention group (n 79) and a
non-treatment control group (n 71). The participants of
both ACT interventions (face-to-face and mobile) and the
non-treatment control group comprised the study popu-
lation of the present study (N 219; 15·5 % male; 84·5 %
female). The web-based education group was excluded
from the present study because it could not be compared
with the ACT interventions since it had both different
content and form of the programme. The mean age of the
participants in the present study was 49·5 (SD 7·4) years
(range 26·6–60·8 years) and their mean BMI was 31·3
(SD 2·9) kg/m2 (range 25·7–40·1 kg/m2). About half of the
participants had an upper secondary education (51·6 %)
and 45·7 % had a university degree. All participants were
Caucasian and had Finnish as their native language.

Interventions

ACT face-to-face group intervention
The ACT face-to-face group intervention consisted of six
group sessions during an 8-week period, with each session
lasting about 90 min. The intervention programme aimed to
support
lifestyle changes and to enhance well-being
through committed actions based on personally important
values. The topics of the six sessions were: (i) my life here
and now; (ii) values and mindful living; (iii) value-based
actions and barriers; (iv) the observing self and acceptance;
(v) mindful eating; and (vi) summary and reﬂection. Every
session included experiential exercises based on the ACT
model (such as mindfulness and acceptance exercises and
individual activation through value work), pair and group
discussions, and homework related to the topic of the
session (for a more detailed description of these interven-
tions, see Lappalainen et al.(33)).

ACT mobile intervention
The participants in the ACT mobile intervention were
invited to a group meeting that consisted of a brief over-
view of ACT principles. In the meeting, the participants
were given smartphones that were pre-installed with a
training application(36).

They were instructed to use the application on their own
during the 8-week intervention period. The application
contained short exercises (n 41) that teach ACT skills to be
applied in daily life. The mobile application delivered an
ACT-based intervention programme similar to that of the
face-to-face group.

cipated in all of the measurements but were not part of
any intervention.

Intuitive eating
The Intuitive Eating Scale (IES)(6) is a twenty-one-item
instrument containing three subscales that assess the
components of intuitive eating: (i) Unconditional Permis-
sion to Eat (Permission; nine items, e.g. ‘If I am craving a
certain food, I allow myself to have it’); (ii) Eating for
Physical rather than Emotional Reasons (Reasons; six
‘I stop eating when I feel full (not overly
items, e.g.
stuffed)’); and (iii) Reliance on Internal Hunger and Satiety
Cues (Cues; six items, e.g. ‘I trust my body to tell me how
much to eat’). Participants rated the items on a 5-point
Likert-type scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5
(strongly agree). The subscale items were averaged, with
higher scores indicating higher levels of intuitive eating.
The internal consistency of the IES and its subscales was
high (Cronbach’s α: IES total = 0·80, Permission = 0·70,
Reasons = 0·86, Cues = 0·76).

Mindfulness
The Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ)(37) is a
thirty-nine-item measure of being mindful in daily life. It
measures the following ﬁve elements of mindfulness:
(i) Observing (eight items), which includes noticing or
attending to internal and external experiences such as
sensations, cognitions, emotions,
sounds and
smells;
items), which involves
labelling internal experiences with words; (iii) Acting with
Awareness (ActAware; eight
items), which represents
attending to one’s activities of the moment and can be
contrasted with behaving mechanically or automatically
while attention is focused elsewhere; (iv) Non-judgement
of
items), which
represents taking a non-evaluative stance towards feelings
and thoughts; and (v) Non-reactivity to Inner Experiences
(NonReact; seven items), which is the tendency to allow
thoughts and feelings to come and go without getting

carried away by or caught up in them. The items were
rated on a 5-point Likert-type scale ranging from 1 (never
or very rarely true) to 5 (very often or always true), with
higher scores indicating higher levels of mindfulness. The
internal consistency of the FFMQ and its subscales was
high (Cronbach’s α: FFMQ total = 0·91, Observing = 0·72,
ActAware = 0·89, NonJudge = 0·90,

Psychological ﬂexibility
Psychological ﬂexibility was assessed using the general
Acceptance and Action Questionnaire II (AAQ-II)(38) and
the Acceptance and Action Questionnaire for Weight
(AAQW)(15). The AAQ-II
is a seven-item Likert-type
questionnaire that assesses the ability to accept aversive
internal experiences and to pursue goals in the presence
target emotional
of
acceptance or avoidance while others address
the
tendency to become entangled in thoughts, to take them
literally, or, conversely, to see them simply as thoughts;
still others ask about the ability to take value-based actions
in the presence of difﬁcult thoughts, or about the tendency
to become behaviourally inactive or avoidant. The ques-
tions of the AAQ-II are based on statements like ‘I worry
about not being able to control my worries and feelings’
and ‘My thoughts and feelings do not get in the way of
how I want to live my life’. The items were rated on a
7-point Likert-type scale ranging from 1 (never true) to
7 (always true), with higher scores indicating lower levels
of psychological ﬂexibility and thus higher
levels of
experiential avoidance. The internal consistency for the
AAQ-II was excellent, with a Cronbach’s α of 0·91.

The AAQW(15) is a twenty-two-item Likert-type scale that
measures acceptance levels of weight-related thoughts and
feelings and the degree to which they interfere with valued
‘I try hard to avoid feeling bad about my
actions (e.g.
weight or how I look’). The items were rated on a 7-point
Likert-type scale ranging from 1 (never true/not at all
believable) to 7 (always true/completely believable), with
levels of psychological
higher scores indicating lower
ﬂexibility and thus higher levels of experiential avoidance.
The questions of the AAQW are based on statements like
‘When I evaluate my weight or my appearance negatively,
I am able to recognize that this is just a reaction, not an
objective fact’ and ‘I need to feel better about how I look in
order to live the life I want’. The internal consistency for the
AAQW was excellent, with a Cronbach’s α of 0·90.

Sense of coherence
Sense of coherence (SOC) was measured with the thirteen-
item Orientation to Life Questionnaire (SOC-13)(39,40). The
scale consists of
three dimensions: Comprehensibility
(ﬁve items, e.g. ‘Do you have very mixed-up feelings and
ideas?’), Manageability (four items, e.g. ‘How often do you
have feelings that you’re not sure you can keep under con-
trol?’) and Meaningfulness (four items, e.g. ‘How often do you

E Sairanen et al.

have the feeling that there’s little meaning in the things you
do in your daily life?’). The participants were asked to answer
the questions on a 7-point semantic differential scale from
1 (never) to 7 (always), with the total sum ranging from
13 (lowest SOC) to 91 (highest SOC). The internal consistency
for the SOC-13 was good, with a Cronbach’s α of 0·87.

The measures were written in Finnish. The SOC-13 has
been indicated to have good validity in Finnish
studies(41,42). The IES was translated and back-translated
by experts in nutrition and eating behaviour. AAQ-II,
AAQW and FFMQ scales were translated by a group of
researchers with long experience in acceptance-, mind-
fulness- and value-based interventions. Previous studies
with these measurements have shown comparable results
to studies using the original scales(43,44).

Statistical analysis
The statistical analyses were conducted using the software
Mplus version 7 and the statistical software package IBM
SPSS Statistics version 20. The parameters were estimated
using the full
information maximum likelihood method
(MLR estimation in Mplus). In the data, missing values
(0–12·8 %) were assumed to be missing at random (MAR).
Intervention effects were analysed using the hier-
archical linear model (HLM) and effect sizes. Intervention
effects, as well as indirect effects, were analysed by ﬁrst
comparing the ACT face-to-face and mobile interventions
with each other. If no difference was observed over time
between these two ACT intervention groups, then they
were combined and together compared with the control
group. If the ACT intervention groups showed different
effects,
then they were separately compared with the
control group. The effect sizes were calculated by
comparing the mean difference in change (di−dc) between
the intervention groups (subscript i) and the control group
(subscript c), using the equation:

pooled SD. A between-group effect size of 0·2 was con-
sidered clinically small, 0·5 medium and 0·8 large(45).

The mediation analyses were conducted using the latent

In the measurement model, three parcels (e.g. A1–A3)
were used to estimate the latent factors representing the
true score without measurement error. By constructing
three measured indicators (parcels) for each latent variable
(i.e. psychological ﬂexibility
eating),
we followed the recommendation of Russell et al.(47).

and intuitive

The LDS model was chosen because the focus was on
variance in within-individual changes in true scores and
on mean intervention effects. The LDS approach made it
possible to focus on change (e.g. ΔAAQW) in each con-
struct rather than only on levels (e.g. AAQW). Thus, we
are suggesting that changes in behavioural processes
(psychological ﬂexibility, mindfulness skills and sense
of coherence) are more important

We followed the recommendation of Zhao et al.(48) in
the analysis of mediation. They have presented that the
only requirement to demonstrate mediation is a signiﬁcant
indirect effect (a × b, see Fig. 1). It may be possible to
establish an indirect effect despite no total direct effect(48).
The product of a and b may be signiﬁcant even if the
coefﬁcients on their own are not(49). Mplus allows users to
deﬁne any function of parameters (a × b) as a model
parameter and in addition provides bias-corrected boot-
for such parameters. CI are based on 1000
strap CI

bootstrap resamples. Indirect effects are deemed statisti-
cally signiﬁcant at the 0·05 level if the 95 % CI for the
estimate of indirect effects does not include zero.

The ﬁt of the models was evaluated using the following
goodness-of-ﬁt measures provided by the Mplus pro-
gram(50): RMSEA (root-mean-square error of approxima-
tion, with values of 0·06 or less indicating a good ﬁt); SRMR
(standardized root-mean-square residual, with values less
than 0·08 indicating a good ﬁt); CFI (Bentler’s comparative
ﬁt index, with values of 0·95 or higher indicating a good ﬁt);
and TLI (Tucker–Lewis index, with values higher than 0·95
indicating a good ﬁt)(51).

Results

Intervention effects
Changes in intuitive eating and weight during the inter-
ventions and at the 6-month follow-up measurement point
are described in Table 1. Eating for Physical rather than
Emotional Reasons, a component of
intuitive eating,
increased signiﬁcantly in the ACT face-to-face and mobile
groups compared with the control group (P = 0·003). The
increase was signiﬁcant from the pre- to post-intervention
measurement
from the post-
intervention to follow-up measurement (P = 0·718). The
interventions did not have signiﬁcant effects on the other
two subscales of intuitive eating (Unconditional Permis-

with Awareness and Non-reactivity to Inner Experiences
improved more in the ACT mobile group than in the ACT
face-to-face group (P = 0·018, 0·021 and 0·043, respec-
tively). Accordingly, they were separately compared with
the control group. In the ACT mobile group, the FFMQ total
increased signiﬁcantly more compared with control from
the pre- to the post-intervention measurement (P = 0·002).
Changes in Acting with Awareness and Non-reactivity to
Inner Experiences were not signiﬁcant in either of the ACT
groups compared with the control group.

Mediation analysis
We were interested in whether changes in process variables
(AAQ-II, AAQW, SOC-13, FFMQ and its subscales) during
the active intervention period (from pre to post) mediated
the long-term changes (from pre to follow-up) in intuitive
eating and weight. All LDS mediation models showed an
to the data (RMSEA = 0·000–0·072, SRMR =
excellent ﬁt
0·030–0·072, CFI = 0·974–1·000 and TLI = 0·959–1·014).

The estimates and 95 % CI of standardized indirect
effects (a × b) in the LDS models are described in Table 3
(see Fig. 1). There were no signiﬁcant differences in
indirect effects between the ACT face-to-face group and
the ACT mobile group; subsequently,
the ACT groups
were compared jointly with the control group. The 95 % CI
for indirect effects – via the AAQW – on (i) weight (BMI),
(ii) intuitive eating total and its subscales, (iii) Eating for
Physical rather than Emotional Reasons and (iv) Reliance
on Internal Hunger and Satiety Cues did not include zero.
Thus, the LDS models suggested that the effect of the ACT
interventions on those variables was mediated by the
ﬂexibility
change
(AAQW). The unstandardized regression coefﬁcients
the signiﬁcant mediation models are
(a, b and c) of

Mindfulness skills (FFMQ and its subscales), general
psychological ﬂexibility (AAQ-II) and sense of coherence
(SOC-13) did not mediate any intervention effects on
intuitive eating and weight.

Discussion

related to intuitive eating,

The present study is one of the ﬁrst to examine processes of
change in psychological approaches to adaptive eating
behaviour and weight management. Despite the promising
results
few studies have
attempted to explain the processes encouraging adaptive
eating behaviour and previous studies on intuitive eating
have been mainly observational in nature. Thus, the focus
of the present study was on exploring mechanisms of
in the ACT
change in intuitive eating and weight

intervention groups compared with the control group of
participants having overweight.

First, the present results indicate that Eating for Physical
rather than Emotional Reasons increased in the ACT-based
intervention groups. The present ﬁndings support
the
theoretical assumption that ACT reduces avoidance
behaviour, such as emotional eating. Considering the
association between emotional eating and obesity(13),
these results suggest that ACT-oriented interventions can
have a positive impact on weight management and dis-
ordered eating. These results are in line with previous
studies that have indicated that mindfulness practice
reduces emotional and external eating(31), as well as binge
eating(52). In the present study, the ACT mobile interven-
tion also improved mindfulness skills (FFMQ total) and
both ACT interventions enhanced Observing (subscale
of FFMQ).

Second, the mediation analysis indicated that the inter-
vention effects on weight and intuitive eating behaviours,
Eating for Physical rather than Emotional Reasons and
Reliance on Internal Hunger and Satiety Cues were
mediated by change in weight-related psychological ﬂex-
ibility (AAQW) in the ACT interventions. Thus, the ACT
interventions increased psychological ﬂexibility (AAQW),
which in turn promoted weight loss and eating based on
bodily cues of hunger and satiety. In contrast, weight-
related psychological ﬂexibility was not found to mediate
the interventions’ effect on Unconditional Permission to
Eat. This may be due to the fact that ACT interventions
emphasized more mindful eating than content reﬂected by
the subscale of Unconditional Permission to Eat. More-
over, it could be speculated that ACT-based interventions
might change the impact of emotional reactions to eating
patterns.

The present ﬁndings support the idea that ACT-oriented
interventions for lifestyle changes improve individuals’
ability to continue with valued activities even when con-
fronted with negative emotions and thoughts related to
weight, and this process mediated changes in eating reg-
ulation and weight. In accordance with our ﬁndings,
population-speciﬁc measures of psychological ﬂexibility
have been signiﬁcant mediators in many different areas,

Mediators of change in intuitive eating

including with respect to smoking cessation(23), diabetes
self-care(24), prejudice(27), seizures and quality of life in
epilepsy cases(25), adaptive functioning in chronic pain
patients(53–55) and weight-related issues(18,56).

Mindfulness skills (FFMQ) and sense of coherence
(SOC-13), as well as the general measure of psychological
ﬂexibility (AAQ-II), were not found to mediate changes in
weight or intuitive eating behaviour. These measures
(FFMQ, SOC-13, AAQ-II) are not speciﬁc to weight or to
eating issues. Thus, this might imply that change processes
associated with weight management and eating regulation
are better assessed by speciﬁc measures targeted to
describe weight-related thoughts,
feelings and actions.
Further, the fact that weight-speciﬁc psychological ﬂex-
ibility mediated weight change and intuitive eating might
interventions should target weight-speciﬁc
suggest
behavioural patterns (such as the avoidance of feelings
related to weight and body image) and they should
include speciﬁc exercises or skill training aimed at dealing
with weight-related avoidance.

that

Correspondingly, Webb and Hardin found that body
image ﬂexibility, reﬂecting the willingness to approach
aversive body image-related internal content with mindful
acceptance in order to continue to move in valued life
directions, partially mediated the relationship between
adhering to internalized weight-stigmatizing beliefs and
the likelihood of practising intuitive eating in a weight-
diverse sample of college women(57). Body image
ﬂexibility has also explained the relationship between self-
compassion and intuitive eating(58). Together with our
results,
the willingness to
approach aversive thoughts, emotions and physiological
sensations regarding the body with mindful acceptance
may have an important role in promoting intuitive eating
(i.e. values-driven behaviour).

these ﬁndings suggest

that

The promise of mediation analysis is that it can identify
fundamental processes underlying human behaviour that
are relevant across behaviours and contexts. The present
study found similar intervention effects and mediating
processes for the ACT mobile stand-alone intervention
(minimal contact) as for
the ACT face-to-face group
intervention, which supports the assumption that these
particular behavioural processes are essential in support-
ing adaptive eating attitudes and weight management.
In regard to affecting psychological ﬂexibility and mind-
fulness skills, these results also suggest that skill training
plays a more important role than face-to-face coaching.
This hypothesis needs to be tested in future studies.

Limitations
The most signiﬁcant limitation of the current study is that
the processes were measured partly in parallel. Thus, the
temporal precedence of the mediator cannot be estab-
lished, making it difﬁcult to separate cause and effect.
Unfortunately, a lack of assessment points during the
active treatment phase precluded a detailed examination

1689

of the directionality of change. Moreover, the time periods
of the present study, about 2 months for the process
measurements and 8 months for the outcomes, may have
been too short for some mediation effects to take place.
For example, adopting mindfulness skills and utilizing
them to improve eating behaviours and increase weight
loss more signiﬁcantly may need more time.

Another signiﬁcant limitation of our study is the use of
self-report measures to assess the psychological constructs
of interest. Thus, we cannot be sure that observed changes
in processes actually reﬂect ‘true’ changes in target con-
structs – they may simply reﬂect social demand or
expectations of the treatment. It is also important to note
that intuitive eating is a cognitive construct that may be
related to eating habits, but more studies are needed to
verify that. The present results support this connection by
showing similar mediation effects on both BMI and intui-
tive eating. Still,
future studies should aim to include
behavioural, experimental and observer-rated processes
of acceptance/experiential avoidance and eating beha-
viour. Also, a variety of approaches have been proposed
for the assessment of mindfulness and there have been
debates about the issue of measuring this construct(59,60).
Thus, further research using other validated measures of
mindfulness is recommended.

Moreover, the inclusion of multiple mediation analyses
leads to an increased risk of type 1 error. However, AAQW
mediated intervention effects systemically on all outcome
variables, except
for Unconditional Permission to Eat,
whereas other process variables (AAQ-II, SOC-13, FFMQ
and its subscales) did not have any signiﬁcant indirect
effects. Moreover, it is important to note that the observed
effect sizes of
the intervention effects as well as the
indirect effects were small, and thus the clinical sig-
niﬁcance of the observations is unclear. Further research is
warranted to investigate the effects and mechanisms of
ACT-based interventions on eating behaviours. There are
possibly also other important variables mediating inter-
vention effects on intuitive eating and weight. Finally, it is
important to note that our sample consisted predominantly
of overweight women experiencing psychological stress,
who were willing to make changes to improve their
lifestyle. The participants were also relatively highly
educated. Therefore, the generalizability of the results to
the other populations must be tested in future studies.

Conclusions

In conclusion, our research provides evidence that ACT-
oriented interventions might improve overweight persons’
skills in dealing with emotions related to eating. Our data
also imply that weight-related psychological ﬂexibility
mediates changes in weight and intuitive eating, especially
in eating based on physical reasons and reliance on
hunger and satiety cues, in overweight persons experi-
encing psychological stress. Thus, these ﬁndings support

1690

the idea that ACT-oriented interventions for
lifestyle
changes improve individuals’ ability to continue with
valued activities even when confronted with negative
emotions and thoughts related to weight, and this process
