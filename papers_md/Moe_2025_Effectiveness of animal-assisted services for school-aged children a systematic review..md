Abstract
Animal-assisted services (AAS) have demonstrated potential benefits for children and adolescents, particularly in emotional 
development and educational outcomes. However, existing systematic reviews often focused on specific populations or types 
of animals, and overlook the quality of included studies. This review evaluates the effectiveness of animal-assisted services 
on the well-being and behavior of school-aged children, and assesses the risk of bias of the included studies. Following 
PRISMA Guidelines, a systematic search was conducted in MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycARTICLES, PsycINFO via EBSCO-
host, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Web of Science, from database inception until August 15, 2023. Risk of 
bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 for randomized trials and ROBINS-I for non-randomized studies. Two 
reviewers (IM, PJH) assessed each record, and two additional reviewers (IF, FS) resolved disagreements. Data were synthe-
sized narratively, and presented in tables and figures. From 2,380 initial articles, 30 met the inclusion criteria. Studies were 
primarily randomized controlled trials (n = 21), involving various populations, from children with autism spectrum disorders 
(n = 10) to general population (n = 8). Outcomes were grouped into abilities, attitudes, externalizing behaviors, internalizing 
behaviors, disorder-specific measures, and well-being. AAS showed positive impacts on socio-emotional functioning and 
behavior despite diverse intervention approaches. Nonetheless, all studies had study design problems, which caused high 
risk of bias. AAS appears to enhance cognitive, behavioral, and socio-emotional aspects, as well as learning in school-aged 
children. Further methodologically rigorous research and evidence, such as implementation studies and cost-effectiveness 
analyses comparing AAS to standard practices are needed to support decision-making.

Introduction

In  recent  years,  incorporating  animals  into  educational 
and therapeutic settings for children and adolescents has 
advanced significantly, especially in the United States [1].

Various concepts are used to describe this practice, such as 
animal-assisted interventions, activities, or therapy [2, 3]. 
Due to lack of consistent terminology, Binder et al. [4] have 
proposed an umbrella term called animal-assisted services 
(AAS) which encompasses three categories of interventions: 
animal-assisted treatment (AATx), animal-assisted educa-
tion (AAE), and animal-assisted support programs (AASP) 
[4]. According to Binder et al. [4], AAS involves specially 
trained animals under professional guidance to enhance 
human well-being through therapeutic, educational, or sup-
portive processes. The administration of AAS varies by ani-
mal type (e.g., dogs, dolphins, horses), setting (e.g., schools, 
hospitals, stables), duration, and whether delivered in groups 
or individually [5].

AAS positively impacts the social, emotional, cognitive, 
and physical development of children and adolescents, as 
shown in both theoretical frameworks and several scientific

research [2, 6–8]. A meta-analysis conducted on various 
types of AAS noted positive findings in medical well-being 
and behavioral outcomes, especially when AAS are incor-
porated into established interventions [5]. In the context 
of education, there is ample evidence on animal presence 
enhancing  learning  for  school-aged  children  [9–15].  A 
systematic review by Brelsford et al. [16] found direct and 
indirect positive effects on education, particularly in socio-
emotional areas like emotional regulation, mood, and social 
behaviors [16]. Further supporting this notion that AAS 
can impact learning, Gee et al. [17] presented a theoretical 
framework based on existing research [17]. The framework 
outlines how learning is indirectly influenced through moti-
vation, engagement, self-regulation, and human social inter-
action. AAS is therefore considered to positively enhance 
the learning environment through its impact on motivation 
and engagement as well as social skills.

Moreover, AAS has been shown to benefit various condi-
tions and disorders. Meta-analyses and reviews by O’Haire 
[18], Mapes and Rosén [19], and Dimolareva and Dunn [20] 
found that AAS positively impacts children with autism 
spectrum disorders (ASD), improving social interaction, 
communication, problem behaviors, autistic severity, and 
stress [18–20]. Additionally, AAS has demonstrated sev-
eral positive effects for children with various challenges, 
such as increased school attendance and reduced hospitaliza-
tions in children with acute mental disorders [21], enhanced 
attachment security in children with attachment problems 
[22], reduction in symptoms severity in those with attention 
deficit hyperactivity disorders (ADHD) [23, 24] and Down 
syndrome [25].

Several systematic reviews have attempted to synthesize 
the empirical evidence on AAS for children and adoles-
cents. However, these reviews often focused on children 
with specific conditions, certain type of study designs such 
as within-group studies, or limited settings such as hos-
pitals [18, 26–29]. Only one review summarized the evi-
dence of AAS in educational contexts [16]. Most often, the 
authors did not perform a quality assessment of the studies 
included or meta-analysis, or included studies without con-
trol groups. The latter has been raised extensively in past 
studies as appropriate control groups are needed to estab-
lish that observed changes in outcomes are associated with 
the intervention and not a result of natural occurrences over 
time [30, 31]. Therefore, there is a need for further evidence 
synthesis and a clearer understanding of AAS benefits for 
school-aged children. To address this, we conducted a sys-
tematic review of the existing literature on effects of AAS, 
synthesized the evidence found, and assessed the risk of bias 
of the included studies.

Methods

Search strategy and selection criteria

This systematic review followed the 2020 Preferred Report-
ing  Items  for  Systematic  Reviews  and  Meta-Analysis 
(PRISMA) guideline [32], and was registered in PROSPERO 
(ID CRD42023453110). The electronic databases PubMed/
Medline, PsycARTICLES, PsycINFO, and CINAHL via 
EBSCOHost, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, 
and Web of Science were searched from inception up to 
August 15, 2023. The population, intervention, control, out-
comes, and study design (i.e. PICOS) criteria were used to 
guide the search strategy detailed in Table 1 [33].

The inclusion criteria were studies with animal-assisted 
interventions in non-healthcare settings; randomized control 
trials and observational studies; studies with control groups; 
school-aged children aged 5–18 years; peer-reviewed arti-
cles; published in English, Portuguese, Spanish, Chinese, 
Russian, Italian or French. Previous reviews and literature 
were used to identify relevant keywords [26,  34]. Exclu-
sion criteria were studies with robotic animals; studies in 
healthcare settings such as hospitals; studies without a con-
trol group or control group with animals; grey literatures and 
non-peer-reviewed.

The search terms used were: (child* or kid* or “school 
age*”  or  youth  or  adolescen*  or  “young  people”)  AND 
(“animal assisted” or “dog assisted” or “equine assisted” 
or  “pet  assisted”  or  “canine  assisted”  or  “hippotherap*” 
or  “pet  therap*”  or  “animal  therap*”  or"assistan* 
dog*"or"horseback riding"or"pet facilitated"or"therapeutic 
animal*"or"therapeutic  horse*"or"therapy  with 
animal*"or"dolphin  assisted")  AND  ("school  performa
nce"or"performance"or"school  achievement*"or"school 
outcome*"or"academic achievement*"or"academic perform
ance"or"learning"or"behavio* change"or"behavio*"or"school 
attend*"or “presen*” or “absent*” or “grade*” or “literac*” or 
“social skill*” or"quality of life"or “read*” or “class attend*” 
or “school absen*” or “class performance” or “cognitive 
skill*” or “motivation” or “anxiet*” or “student engag*” 
or “mental health” or “well being”). Using Rayyan, a web-
based tool, two blinded reviewers (IM and PJH) manually 
removed duplicates and independently screened study titles 
and abstracts based on predefined criteria [35]. Disagreements 
were discussed until consensus was reached or referred to 
an additional reviewer (IF or FS). The reviewers'agreement 
indicated strong consensus, with only minor discrepancies 
observed during the screening of titles and abstracts (10%). 
Relevant articles were retrieved, and an open web search was 
conducted for missing full texts.

Data extraction

One  reviewer  (IM)  systematically  extracted  data  from 
all included studies using a standardized Excel template, 
while a second reviewer (PJH) randomly extracted data 
from 16 (52%) of the studies, achieving a 90% consensus. 
Data extracted were: First Author, Year, Study Population 
Characteristics, Sample Size, Intervention Setting, Country, 
Intervention Characteristics, Type of animal, Time Points, 
Comparator Characteristics, Study Outcomes, Measure-
ment Instruments, Study Design, and Effect Sizes. Mean 
and standard deviations of the effect sizes were extracted 
for all relevant outcomes at baseline, post-intervention, and 
any follow-up timepoints. Extraction details are available 
in Table 2. Authors of some included studies (n = 3) were 
contacted via email for missing outcome information.

Risk of bias assessment

Two independent reviewers conducted the bias assessment: 
IM assessed all studies, and PJH randomly reviewed 18 
(64%) of the studies. Discrepancies were resolved through 
discussion.  Two  Cochrane-recommended  tools  were 
employed to assess risk of bias of the included studies— 
Risk of Bias 2 (RoB 2) for RCTs, and the Risk of Bias in 
Non-Randomized Studies of Interventions (ROBINS-I) for 
non-RCTs [36, 37]. RoB 2 evaluates bias in randomization, 
deviations from intended interventions, missing data, out-
come measurement, and selective reporting by rating each 
domain as low, some concerns, or high risk. ROBINS-I 
evaluates bias in confounding, selection of participants, 
classification of interventions, deviations from intended 
interventions,  missing  data,  outcome  measurement,  and 
selective reporting. Each domain was graded as having no 
information, low, moderate, serious, or critical risk. Both 
tools produced summary risk of bias results, based on the 
individual domain risks.

Data synthesis

Given the heterogeneity of studies and outcomes included, 
a meta-analysis was not feasible and the evidence was syn-
thesized narratively. The included studies were classified 
by population characteristics, and outcomes were grouped 
into externalizing behavior, internalizing behavior, abili-
ties, attitudes, well-being, and disorder specific, as shown 
in Table 3. The decision to group the outcomes was done 
after discussions with experts in child development and 
psychology. An additional outcome group named “Com-
posite” was made to separate subscales from total instru-
ment scores. Outcomes not fitting into these categories 
were listed as “Other”. A narrative synthesis was used 
to synthesize the evidence by main study characteristics,

intervention  characteristics  and  outcomes.  Addition-
ally, risk of bias assessment was described and presented 
through tables and graphs.

Results

The search yielded 2,380 citations, of which 734 duplicates 
were excluded. The remaining 1,646 records were screened 
by title and abstract, resulting in 139 eligible studies. As 17 
articles were not accessible, 122 were screened in full text, 
of which 30 were included in the data analysis (Fig. 1).

Table  4  groups  the  main  characteristics  of  the  stud-
ies by study population. Of the 30 articles, one involves 
two studies [41], hence resulting in 31 studies in the data 
extraction. Among them, 22 were RCTs, and 7 were quasi-
experimental. The remaining two were a semi cross-over,

and an observational study [25, 42]. Studies were principally 
conducted in the USA (n = 12), and Europe (Spain, n = 4; 
Italy, n = 3; Germany, n = 2; UK, n = 2; Netherlands, n = 1; 
Norway, n = 1), with a few in Asia (China, n = 2; Turkey, 
n = 1, South Korea, n = 1). Study populations ranged from 
general school-aged children (n = 8) to specific populations, 
such as children with ASD (n = 10) and ADHD (n = 3) as 
shown in Fig. 2.

Many interventions were implemented in riding centers 
or stables (n = 12) and schools (n = 11), with a minority 
in farms (n = 2) and other settings (n = 4). Horses (n = 13) 
and dogs (n = 11) were the most used animals (Fig. 3). In 
terms of children with ASD, horses were the most com-
monly employed, while only one study used dogs [44]. Simi-
larly, studies involving children with ADHD used horses, 
while Schuck et al. [24] included dogs in group cognitive 
behavioral therapy sessions [24]. Most studies in the general 

Abilities
Attitudes

The capacity or skill to do something that benefits the child, such as goal-directed behavior or leadership.
A state of mind, accompanied by feelings and emotions that causes the child to approach or avoid a situation or task 

[38].

Externalizing Behavior

Behaviors that are manifested outwardly and reflect the child negatively acting on the external environment such as 

hyperactivity or rule-breaking [39].

Internalizing Behavior

Behaviors that are directed inwardly and represent an overcontrolled and inner-directed pattern of behavior such as 

social withdrawal and anxiety [39].

Well-being

A positive state experienced by individuals and societies. This encompasses quality of life, as well as the ability to 

contribute to the world in accordance with a sense of meaning and purpose [40].

Disorder Specific
Composite
Other

Measures from instruments pertaining a specific disorder, such as Autistic Symptoms Rating Scale.
A compound score of more than one outcome or instrument total scores based on the instrument employed.
Any outcome that does not belong to the above-mentioned groups.

population employed dogs, while the remaining two studies 
used horses [54, 56]. In other populations, such as children 
with Down syndrome and emotional disturbance, dolphins 
[25] and reptiles [65] were used. Both horses and dogs were 
used for children with psychological trauma [60, 61].

Interventions typically involved multiple sessions last-
ing from 8 days to an academic year [52, 66]. Two studies 
examined immediate effects on cortisol level by inducing 
psychosocial stress (through administering separation anxi-
ety test, and tier social stress test) in children to measure the 
impact of dog interactions [53, 62]. In ADHD populations, 
the intervention duration was consistent at 3 months [24, 58, 
59], while ASD population varied from 7 weeks to 6 months 
[42, 45]. The majority of included studies employed a pas-
sive control (n = 19), such as usual education, waitlist, or no 
treatment. Eleven studies used active controls, with some 
substituting the animal with stuffed animals [46, 47, 49], 
while others used human stand-ins for the control group [11, 
62].

Outcomes measured varied widely across studies as 
shown in Table 5. ADHD and ASD studies mainly meas-
ured abilities, externalizing, and internalizing behaviors, 
with  common  behavioral  outcomes  like  hyperactivity, 
irritability, somatic complaints, withdrawal, social skills, 
attention problems, and communication. Learning abilities 
and attention problems were assessed in children with dys-
lexia, trauma, and general population [11, 55, 56, 60, 61, 

63, 65]. Concerning attitudes, studies reported attitudes 
towards the environment, school, self, or academic and 
recreational reading [11, 52–55, 59–62]. Well-being was 
measured as quality of life [59] or cortisol stress level [41, 
49, 50, 53, 62, 64]. Measuring instruments overlap was 
limited due to diverse outcomes and populations. ASD 
studies frequently used the Aberrant Behavior Checklist 
(ABC; n = 5) [42, 46, 47, 49, 50], while ADHD popula-
tion employed varying instruments, such as Child Behav-
ior Checklist (CBCL), Self-Esteem Scale (SES), Behavior 
Assessment System for Children (BASC), Social Compe-
tence Inventory (SCI), and Social Skills Improvement Sys-
tem Rating Scales (SSIS-RS) [24, 58, 59]. General popula-
tion studies often used the Elementary Reading Attitude 
Survey [11,  55]. Additionally, the studies used various 
outcome assessors. Most outcome measures for children 
with ASD were reported by caregivers or teachers, utiliz-
ing tools such as the ABC checklist, BASC, VABS, and 
SRS. Similarly, in the ADHD population, the commonly 
used measures including the CBCL, BASC, and SSIS-RS 
were primarily reported by caregivers or teachers. In con-
trast, self-reported measures were more prevalent in stud-
ies involving the general population (Table 5).

Twenty-five out of 30 studies reported significant positive 
effects in the AAS group compared to controls, as summa-
rized in Table 6.. For ASD populations, AAS groups showed 
improvements in abilities, externalizing, and internalizing

Study Conclusions

Children with ASD who par(cid:31)cipated in therapeu(cid:31)c horseback riding exhibited higher social func(cid:31)oning with improved social 
mo(cid:31)va(cid:31)on and sensory proﬁle. 

Animal-assisted social skills training could poten(cid:31)ally be more beneﬁcial for improving social skills than tradi(cid:31)onal social skills
training without dogs.

Children who par(cid:31)cipated in equine-assisted therapy showed improvement in social func(cid:31)oning and motor abili(cid:31)es.  

Therapeu(cid:31)c horseback riding group with actual horses showed signiﬁcant improvements in self-regula(cid:31)on behaviors and 
communica(cid:31)on compared to control group with stuﬀed horses.

Children in the therapeu(cid:31)c horse-riding group with actual horses maintained reduc(cid:31)ons in irritability behavior but not in 
hyperac(cid:31)vity behaviors during 6-months follow up assessments compared to control group with stuﬀed horses.

Lower levels of aggressiveness were found in the therapeu(cid:31)c horseback riding group compared to control group.

Signiﬁcant reduc(cid:31)on in severity of ASD symptoms and hyperac(cid:31)vity was found in the horse-riding group compared to control.

The therapeu(cid:31)c horseback riding group with actual horses showed signiﬁcant reduc(cid:31)on in irritability and hyperac(cid:31)vity compared 
to the barn ac(cid:31)vity group with stuﬀed horses.

Occupa(cid:31)onal therapy with horses showed signiﬁcant improvement in social mo(cid:31)va(cid:31)on and decreased irritability compared to 
occupa(cid:31)onal therapy without horses. This ini(cid:31)al evidence suggests integra(cid:31)on of horses into occupa(cid:31)onal therapy can enhance 
social and behavioral skills.
The therapeu(cid:31)c horseback riding group showed a signiﬁcant improvement in sub domains of social interac(cid:31)on and communica(cid:31)on 
skills compared to control group. The interven(cid:31)on may be beneﬁcial in improving social skills, communica(cid:31)on, responsibility and 
self-control.
Presence of a school dog-teacher team has the poten(cid:31)al to support learning due to improvement in posi(cid:31)ve a(cid:28)tude towards 
school and posi(cid:31)ve emo(cid:31)ons related to learning.

Interac(cid:31)ons with dogs boosted posi(cid:31)ve emo(cid:31)ons and reduced anxiety in children.

Signiﬁcant increase in perceived social support was reported in the interven(cid:31)on group compared to control. Adolescents 
par(cid:31)cipa(cid:31)ng in equine-assisted ac(cid:31)vi(cid:31)es within a suppor(cid:31)ve environment may experience posi(cid:31)ve impacts on their psychological 
development.
Class-based dogs assisted therapy group had signiﬁcant long-term posi(cid:31)ve impact on empathy, cogni(cid:31)ve competence, short term 
reduc(cid:31)on of hyperac(cid:31)vity, sugges(cid:31)ng the eﬀec(cid:31)veness of animal assisted interven(cid:31)ons in class-room se(cid:28)ngs.

Study Conclusions

The study demonstrated signiﬁcant eﬀects of equine-facilitated learning on child social competence and behavior.

Emo(cid:29)onal comprehension signiﬁcantly improved in interven(cid:29)on vs control, showing that animal-assisted educa(cid:29)on 
based on the Federico II Model of Healthcare Zooanthropology was eﬀec(cid:29)ve in improving emo(cid:29)on comprehension.

Children showed posi(cid:31)ve improvement in ADHD core symptoms and QoL pre/post interven(cid:31)on although no signiﬁcant 
diﬀerences between interven(cid:31)on and control groups were seen in other outcomes except signiﬁcant decrease in 
thought problem subscales of CBCL.

Treatment group has higher school adjustment, lower hyperac(cid:31)vity, be(cid:28)er social skills, more leadership, and fewer 
a(cid:28)en(cid:31)on problems.

Compared to control, the animal-assisted psychotherapy group showed signiﬁcant reduc(cid:31)on in internalizing symptoms, 
sense of inadequacy and soma(cid:31)za(cid:31)on, improvement in adap(cid:31)ve skills and be(cid:28)er a(cid:27)tude towards teachers.

Children with insecure-avoidant or disorganized a(cid:28)achment showed more signiﬁcant beneﬁts from being in the 
presence of a therapy dog than interac(cid:31)ng with a friendly human in stressful social situa(cid:31)ons.

Donkey-assisted neuropsychological training enhanced language skills recovery, improved self-esteem and learning for 
children with dyslexia compared to tradi(cid:31)onal neuropsychological training without donkey.

Pet therapy reduced stress and social anxiety of physically disabled children.

In comparison to therapy without dolphin, dolphin-assisted therapy improved social and cogni(cid:31)ve func(cid:31)ons by 
improving verbaliza(cid:31)on and recogni(cid:31)on of people, although only the verbaliza(cid:31)on scale con(cid:31)nued to increase in the 6-
months follow up period.
Rep(cid:31)le-assisted therapy showed signiﬁcant posi(cid:31)ve impacts on internalizing and externalizing behaviors, thoughts, 
social and a(cid:28)en(cid:31)on problems of children with emo(cid:31)onal disturbance when compared with ac(cid:31)ve control.

Animal therapy had a signiﬁcant eﬀect on overall anxiety score, and its subscales generalized anxiety, anxiety of 
separa(cid:31)on, social anxiety, agoraphobia. The ﬁndings indicate that animal therapy is eﬀec(cid:31)ve in allevia(cid:31)ng anxiety.

behaviors, such as reduced hyperactivity, irritability, and 
anxiety, and improved social skills, motivation, and self-
control [42–51]. In the general population, AAS led to better 
attitudes toward school, positive emotions, cognitive com-
petence, empathy, social competence, and self-awareness 
[13, 52–54, 56, 57]. Among ADHD populations, only Oh 

et al. [59] reported significant decrease in thought problems, 
such as obsessive thinking, hearing or seeing things, repeti-
tive acts, and strange behaviors, in the horse-riding group 
compared  to  pharmacotherapy  [59],  while  others  found 
no significant group differences but noted time-dependent 
improvements in behavior and social skills [24, 58].

Children with psychological trauma showed better school 
adjustment, social skills, leadership, and reduced hyperac-
tivity and attention problems [60, 61]. Positive effects on 
behaviors and social skills were also observed in children 
with emotional disturbances [65]. Griffioen and Enders-
Slegers  [25]  also  reported  significant  improvements  in 
abilities and externalizing behaviors in children with Down 
syndrome through dolphin-assisted therapy [25]. Corallo 
et al. [63] observed increased learning and self-esteem in 
children participating in donkey-assisted therapy compared 
to traditional neuropsychological groups [63]. Beetz et al. 
[62] found significantly lower cortisol levels in children 
with attachment problems using dogs as social supporters 
compared to human-supporters [62]. Tahan et al. [66] and 
Demiralay and Keser [64] reported significant reductions 
in anxiety in those who underwent AAS compared with the 
controls [64, 66].Detailed results of each included study can 
be found in the supplementary Online Resource.

Among RCTs, 81% (n = 17) were found to have high risk 
of bias overall (Fig. 4). High bias was noted in non-blinded 
outcome  assessors  (n =  13)  and  inadequately  addressed 
missing data (n = 5). Many studies did not report on alloca-
tion concealment, resulting in some concerns of bias associ-
ated with randomization process. However, low risk of bias 
was seen in the domain deviations from intended interven-
tions and selective reporting.

For non-RCTs (n = 9), five studies had high overall risk, 
and four had moderate risk (Fig. 5). Most had moderate or 
serious bias in outcome measurement due to non-blinded 
assessors. Likewise, moderate risk was seen in baseline 
confounding in most studies (n = 8). Low risk was found 

in intervention classification and missing data, indicating 
clearly defined groups and well-handled missing data.

Discussion

The current systematic review provides updated results on 
the effects of AAS on the well-being and socio-emotional 
functioning of school-aged children. A major challenge in 
interpreting the findings is the high heterogeneity across 
study populations, interventions, outcomes, and measurement 
instruments, a common issue in similar research [27–29], and 
pose a problem when trying to draw conclusions about the 
effectiveness of AAS. Even in studies on similar populations, 
such as children with ASD, authors employed a wide array of 
instruments, including Sensory Profile (SP), Vineland Adap-
tive Behavioral Scales (VABS-II), and Systematic Analysis 
of Language Transcripts (SALT). While this review high-
lights improvements in motivation, engagement, and social 
skills, potentially enhancing school attendance and academic 
performance in children, these findings should be interpreted 
with caution due to methodological limitations and the high 
risk of bias present in the included studies.

Similar to previous reviews, therapeutic horse riding is 
the most common intervention in children with ASD [18, 
67]. Improvements were seen in abilities, externalizing and 
internalizing  behaviors;  children  displayed  better  social 
and communication skills, motor skills, sensory profiles, 
and self-regulation in addition to reduced irritability and 
hyperactivity, compared to children who did not partake in 
AAS. However, assessments relied mainly on caregivers

and teachers who were unblinded to the intervention, which 
introduces subjectivity and could inflate the perceived effec-
tiveness of AAS (Table 5).

In the general population, studies employed instruments 
that measured social and emotional competence such as 
Devereux Student Strength Assessment (DESSA) as well as 
instruments that focused on literacy, namely Dynamic Indi-
cators of Basic Early Literacy Skill (DIBELS) and Curricu-
lum Based Measurement (CBM). Overall, children involved 
in AAS showed potential improvements in abilities, attitudes 
towards school and learning, cognitive competence, emotion 
comprehension, and reduced anxiety. This finding is similar 
to Brelsford et al. [16] review of animal-assisted intervention 
in educational settings, which reported positive effects on 
cognitive and socio-emotional behavior [16]. However, not 
all studies recorded significant results [11, 41, 55].

Evidence for the effectiveness of AAS in other popula-
tions was more limited. In children with ADHD, only one 
study found significant improvement in thought problems 
within the AAS group when compared to pharmacotherapy 
[59]. However, nonblinded assessors were involved. Con-
versely, a study with blinded assessors that found positive 
effects was excluded from this review due to the absence of 
an appropriate control [68].

It is noteworthy to discuss the various control groups used 
across the included studies. Passive control groups, where 
children either received no treatment, standard treatment 
or were placed in a waitlist, were more frequent than active 
control groups, where children engaged in similar activities 
as the interventions but without the animal. López-Cepero 
[69] argued that comparing AAS to passive controls allows 
assessment of the overall intervention impact but fails to dis-
tinguish between specific contributions of each intervention 
component [69]. This approach further faces criticism in the 
AAS field as passive controls do not control for non-specific 
treatment effects, compromising internal validity [69, 70]. To 
address this, Kazdin [71] and López-Cepero [69] advocated 
for active control groups to mitigate participant biases and 
control non-specific effects [69, 71]. For example, control 
groups could engage in similar activities as the experiment 
groups but without animals, or AAS could be integrated 
as a supplementary component to existing evidence-based 
interventions [69]. Such designs are critical for isolating the 
unique contributions of human-animal interaction.

In the current review, nine studies employed active con-
trol  groups  and  reported  positive  outcomes  specifically 
attributable to human-animal interactions, highlighting the 
potential efficacy of AAS when compared to similar non-
animal-based interventions. These findings suggest that the 
observed effects in studies using active controls may bet-
ter reflect the specific contributions of animals in AAS, as 
opposed to the passive controls. (Table 4, Table 6.) [25, 44, 
46, 47, 49, 50, 62, 63, 65].

There is a growing trend towards more rigorous research 
in AAS, with most studies being randomized controlled 
trials (RCTs). Increased use of RCTs can reduce bias and 
improve the validity of findings when conducted carefully. 
However, several RCTs had small sample sizes (fewer than 
12 children per group), which can affect study power and 
quality [11,  24, 31, 49, 50, 58, 63, 66]. The risk of bias 
assessment of the included studies showed blinding of out-
come assessors being a common concern. This issue was 
noted in 8 RCTs and 2 non-RCTs with a high risk of bias. 
Although blinding is often challenging in studies involv-
ing children—where assessments frequently rely on reports 
from parents, teachers, or caregivers—approaches such as 
using independent or masked assessors could help limit bias 
in future research. This is particularly important to reduce 
potential influences of subjective expectations on reported 
outcomes [72, 73]. Moreover, 4 RCTs and 4 non-RCTs were 
found to have moderate risk of bias, primarily due to issues 
in the randomization process and outcome measurement 
domain [11, 13, 44, 53–55, 60, 61].

While the methodological limitations of the studies included 
in this review warrant cautious interpretation, there is some 
evidence suggesting that AAS may have potential benefits 
for various behavioral and socio-emotional aspects of school-
aged children. These findings are consistent with the theoretical 
framework proposed by Gee et al. [17], which suggests that 
incorporating animals in interventions enhances learning by 
improving self-efficacy, attention, social interaction, and reduc-
ing anxiety [15]. However, further research with higher meth-
odological rigor is needed to confirm these effects.

In addition to quality, transferability and the ability to 
draw conclusions from studies conducted in different coun-
tries require careful assessment [74, 75]. AAS encompassing 
several areas, coupled with different implementation settings, 
various measurement tools, and diverse study populations in 
our review add to this challenge. However, reporting remains 
a critical issue for transferability of AAS, as sufficient descrip-
tions are needed for comparisons [76]. None of the studies 
in our review reported or discussed the costs associated with 
such interventions, which subsequently hinders the implemen-
tation and transferability to real world settings, as resources 
and costs are typically a principal consideration. The need of 
standardized generic measurement tools, cost transparency and 
economic analyses to better inform decision-making have been 
highlighted by previous studies [26, 29, 69].

Most studies were conducted in high-income settings. This 
prevalence can be explained by factors such as more resources, 
trained professionals, research funding, and social acceptance 
of animals in therapeutic settings [77–79]. While structural 
systems can be detrimental with regards to transferability, they 
arguably play a more subordinate role as AAS regulations con-
tinue to develop [80, 81]. However, the extent at which contex-
tual reasons impact transferability may vary widely.

Lastly, animal welfare is a significant concern, as some 
studies have involved dolphins and reptiles, which IAHAIO 
(International Association of Human-Animal Interaction 
Organizations) advises against in favor of using domesti-
cated animals [25, 65, 82, 83]. Similar considerations have 
been raised by various authors, emphasizing the need for 
familiar environments and strong handler relationships to 
ensure animal well-being [83,  84]. Despite this growing 
emphasis on animal welfare, nearly half of the studies did 
not mention ethical considerations at all, indicating it is 
often overlooked in AAS design. Continuous monitoring 
of animal welfare, standard training protocols of animals 
to be used in interventions, and development of techniques 
to assess fatigue and stress are crucial to ensure optimal 
outcomes for both animals and humans.

This review possesses several strengths. It includes only 
peer-reviewed studies with control groups, most of which 
are RCTs or quasi-experimental designs. The review was 
registered  in  PROSPERO  and  adhered  to  the  PRISMA 
guidelines for clear reporting. A comprehensive search was 
employed across multiple databases. However, the review 
also has limitations. Half of the studies had small sample 
sizes, limiting generalizability. Most studies were conducted 
in high-income countries, reducing applicability to low- and 
middle-income settings. Moreover, heterogeneity across out-
comes and studies did not allow for a meta-analysis, which 
limits the ability to draw definitive conclusions.

Conclusion

While there is evidence supporting the benefits of animal-
assisted services (AAS) for improving the socio-emotional 
and  behavioral  well-being  of  school-aged  children,  the 
inconsistencies and potential bias across the studies reviewed 
demand caution in interpreting these effects. Future research 
must address key study design issues to reduce bias and 
more clearly establish the efficacy of AAS. Another consid-
eration is the costs and cost-effectiveness of implementing 
AAS. Conducting health economic analyses to examine the 
costs and benefits of AAS will be crucial next steps to pro-
vide more concrete evidence for decision-makers. Lastly, 
ensuring the welfare of the animals involved will be essential 
to maintaining ethical integrity in AAS.
