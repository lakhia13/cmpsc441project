neonatal loss: a systematic review and
emerging theoretical model

Abstract

Background: Emotional distress following pregnancy loss and neonatal loss is common, with enduring grief
occurring for many parents. However, little is known about men’s grief, since the majority of existing literature and
subsequent bereavement care guidelines have focused on women. To develop a comprehensive understanding of
men’s grief, this systematic review sought to summarise and appraise the literature focusing on men’s grief
following pregnancy loss and neonatal loss.
Methods: A systematic review was undertaken with searches completed across four databases (PubMed, PsycINFO,
Embase, and CINAHL). These were guided by two research questions: 1) what are men’s experiences of grief following
pregnancy/neonatal loss; and 2) what are the predictors of men’s grief following pregnancy/neonatal loss? Eligible
articles were qualitative, quantitative or mixed methods empirical studies including primary data on men’s grief,
published between 1998 and October 2018. Eligibility for loss type included miscarriage or stillbirth (by any definition),
termination of pregnancy for nonviable foetal anomaly, and neonatal death up to 28 days after a live birth.
Results: A final sample of 46 articles were identified, including 26 qualitative, 19 quantitative, and one mixed methods
paper. Findings indicate that men’s grief experiences are highly varied, and current grief measures may not capture all
of the complexities of grief for men. Qualitative studies identified that in comparison to women, men may face
different challenges including expectations to support female partners, and a lack of social recognition for their grief
and subsequent needs. Men may face double-disenfranchised grief in relation to the pregnancy/neonatal loss
experience.
Conclusion: There is a need to increase the accessibility of support services for men following pregnancy/neonatal
loss, and to provide recognition and validation of their experiences of grief. Cohort studies are required among varied
groups of bereaved men to confirm grief-predictor relationships, and to refine an emerging socio-ecological model of
men’s grief.

Background
The loss of a pregnancy through miscarriage or still-
birth, and the death of a baby within the first 28 days
of life, are typically unexpected and highly distressing
events for parents. In addition to processes of grief
and bereavement, both pregnancy loss and neonatal
loss can be complicated due to the additional loss of
hopes for raising a child, and potential ambiguity re-
garding status as a parent [1–4]. Grief following both
forms of loss can be described as disenfranchised [5].
This is due to a lack of social recognition for the un-
born baby as a living individual, along with an ab-
sence of cultural norms and understanding about how
to mourn the death of a baby [2, 6]. Societal norms
may minimise the loss, particularly in the case of mis-
carriage [7].

Background and context
Global estimates indicate that miscarriage occurs for ap-
proximately one in four recognised pregnancies, while
every year, 2.6 million babies worldwide are stillborn,
and a further 2.8 million die within the first week of life
[8–11]. The majority of these losses occur in low and
middle income countries [11]. However, pregnancy/neo-
loss also remains a significant health burden in
natal
high income countries, where despite advances in med-
ical technologies, rates of stillbirth have remained stag-
nant for over two decades [12–14].

Definitions of pregnancy loss according to gestational
age vary considerably across countries, with over 30 differ-
ent stillbirth classification systems identified across the lit-
erature [10, 15]. The World Health Organization (WHO)
recommends a definition of stillbirth as a loss after 28
weeks’ gestation, whereas in the United Kingdom (UK) a
stillbirth is classified after 24 weeks, and in the United
States of America (USA), Canada, and Australia, after 20
weeks [16–20]. Losses prior to these gestations are consid-
ered a miscarriage. Despite this variability, there is cur-
rently limited evidence to suggest that grief following
pregnancy loss is affected by gestational age [3, 21–25].

Previous literature on grief following pregnancy loss and
neonatal loss
Growing recognition of the impact of pregnancy/neonatal
loss has led to increased research interest into the psycho-
logical and emotional burden on bereaved parents and fam-
ilies [26–28]. There is widespread consensus that grief is a
multifaceted and highly individual process, although there
may be general similarities. For example, early models of
grief described common ‘stages’ of grief, from shock or denial
through to acceptance or recovery [29, 30]. The Dual Process
Model of Coping with Bereavement [31] described an on-
going oscillation between ‘loss-orientated’ (emotional) and
‘restoration-oriented’
(problem-solving) coping strategies.

Specific to bereaved parents, the continuing bonds approach
recognises the need for ongoing connections through sym-
bolic objects, rituals, and sharing memories [32, 33]. Finally,
research on gender and grief has found that due to social ex-
pectations surrounding how men should behave, men are
generally less likely to outwardly display emotional reactions.
Men may also experience more difficulty than women in
seeking or accepting help for mental health concerns, grief,
and adjustment to loss [34–36].

Following pregnancy/neonatal loss, men engage more
frequently than women in compensatory behaviours
(such as increased substance use), score higher on
avoidance scales, and experience difficulty in ap-
proaching or accessing support services [37–41]. Des-
pite these difficulties, the majority of previous research
and subsequent pregnancy/neonatal
loss bereavement
care guidelines have focused primarily on the experi-
ences and needs of heterosexual mothers [42–45].
Fewer studies and recommendations relate to men’s ex-
periences of grief and subsequent support needs. Given
the potential for detrimental health and wellbeing out-
comes among men following pregnancy/neonatal loss,
it is essential to further understand how men grieve,
and the factors that contribute to worsened or im-
proved outcomes [21, 46, 47]. Recently, three reviews
were published in areas relating to men’s experiences of
pregnancy/neonatal
loss. However, two of these were
scoping reviews rather than systematic [48, 49], and the
other thematically synthesised only qualitative studies
on men’s lived experiences of miscarriage [50]. This
systematic review aimed to provide a comprehensive
summary and appraisal of existing qualitative and
quantitative literature on men’s grief, following both
pregnancy loss and neonatal loss. The study objectives
were to identify (1) how men experience grief following
pregnancy loss and neonatal loss, and (2) the factors
and/or predictors that contribute to men’s grief.

Methods
Data sources and search strategy
Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic
Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines [51], a
systematic literature search of
four online databases
(PubMed, PsycINFO, Embase, and CINAHL) was com-
pleted in October 2018. Initially, preliminary searches
were undertaken across the databases to identify poten-
tial subject headings and keywords. Following this, the
final search strategies were developed in collaboration
with an experienced research librarian (see Additional
file 1: for search strategies).

Study selection
Inclusion criteria were qualitative, quantitative, or mixed
methods studies, published between 1998 and October

Obst et al. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth           (2020) 20:11

2018, reporting the results of primary data on men’s
grief and/or predictors of grief following pregnancy loss
or neonatal loss. By definition, this included the death of
a baby at any stage in-utero, or up to 28 days after a live
birth. Exclusion criteria were articles not published in
English, abstracts, editorials or opinion pieces, discussion
or review articles not reporting primary data, and studies
using a comparator (e.g., women) that did not present
the data pertaining to men separately. Studies were also
excluded if they investigated the grief experiences of
men who had experienced an elective abortion or ter-
mination of pregnancy for viable foetal anomaly, as there
is literature to suggest that these types of losses may lead
to different psychological outcomes compared to other
forms of pregnancy loss [52, 53].

Study yield
The database searches identified 1529 potentially eli-
gible studies. A further 23 articles were sourced manu-
ally from database-identified articles and systematic
reviews [27, 37, 38], resulting in a total of 1552 articles.
Following removal of duplicates and screening, a total
of 46 studies were selected for inclusion in the final
analysis and were agreed upon by all authors (See Fig. 1

for the PRISMA flow diagram). A random subset of
10% of potentially eligible studies was co-screened by
all authors. Interrater agreement was high (K = .72–.96,
p < .05) with any discrepancies resolved by consensus
discussion.

Data extraction and study appraisal
The findings of the included articles were extracted by
the first author using a predesigned data extraction
form. The second author then cross-checked this infor-
mation. The table items included research setting/
country, date of publication, study design, number and
characteristics of participants, key findings on men’s
grief experiences, measures of grief, and/or predictors
of grief. Study quality and risk of bias were assessed
using the Critical Appraisal Skills Program (CASP)
quality appraisal checklists [54] for qualitative studies,
cohort studies, and randomised control trials (RCTs)
where appropriate. The first author reviewed and rated
the included studies, and the second author
all of
cross-checked a random sample (5%) of the same stud-
ies. Discrepancies between the reviewers were resolved
through group discussions.

Results
Description of studies
Design
Nineteen papers were quantitative, 26 qualitative, and
one used a mixed methods design [55]. For ease of dis-
cussing results in this paper, the mixed methods study
was classified as qualitative, as the emphasis of reporting
was clearly on this form of data. Thirty-nine studies
were peer-reviewed papers, and seven were unpublished
theses [56–62]. All but one of the included quantitative
studies were variations of cohort designs, most com-
monly using structured questionnaires to assess grief.
The remaining study was a RCT, examining the effect-
iveness of nurse-care and self-care interventions on grief
following miscarriage [63]. Qualitative studies predomin-
antly used individual semi or unstructured interviews.
However, two studies used a postal [55] or online ques-
tionnaire [64], one used focus groups [65], and one was
an autoethnography [66]. Details of each of the 46 stud-
ies can be found in Additional file 2. Table 1 provides an
overview of studies by research design.

Focus
Twenty-one studies investigated grief experiences following
miscarriage (definitions which ranged between ≤20–24
weeks’ gestation), 10 following stillbirth, and 15 following a
combination of loss types. Two papers explored experi-
ences following termination of pregnancy for nonviable (or
lethal) foetal anomalies [67, 68]. No papers focused exclu-
sively on neonatal death. Twenty-three studies (16 quantita-
tive and seven qualitative) focused on grief as a primary
outcome. The remaining included elements of grief second-
ary to general explorations of experiences of loss, including
‘meaning’ [69], ‘impact’ [46] and ‘emotional responses’ [70]
among others [23, 57–59, 64, 65, 68, 71–83]. Two qualita-
tive [73, 74] and two quantitative [24, 84] studies also inves-
tigated grief following pregnancy loss that continued into a
subsequent pregnancy or after the birth of a child.

Participant characteristics
Twenty-two studies were based in the USA and
Canada, 10 in Australia, six in the UK, and seven in
Europe (six Swedish). One study was based in the
Middle East [69], one interviewed African-American
couples [77], and another two interviewed Australian
couples who were born in the Middle East [71, 72].
The majority of participants across remaining studies
were Caucasian, with those including mixed ethnicities
providing little to no discussion on cultural or ethnic
background. All studies were conducted in high-
income countries, and male participants were hetero-
sexual men who experienced pregnancy loss with a fe-
male partner. With the exception of six studies that
did not specify men’s marital status [64, 65, 79, 80, 85,

86], the majority of male participants were in a rela-
tionship with the partner they were with at the time of
loss. Sixteen studies recruited only men [25, 46, 57,
58, 60, 61, 64, 66, 70, 75, 80–83, 85, 87]. The
remaining studies included men as participants in
conjunction with their female partner.

Samples sizes varied widely, from one (an autoethno-
graphy) [66] to 131 men [64] in qualitative studies, and
nine [70] to 341 men [23] in quantitative studies (see
Additional file 2: for details). Thirteen studies reported
age and standard deviations (SDs) for male participants
[23–25, 56, 60, 61, 73, 84, 87–91]. Across these, the
average age of 1052 men was 33 years (pooled SD =
8.74). The remaining studies either did not report male
participant ages [64–66, 68, 71, 72, 78, 79, 82, 92], com-
bined men’s ages with women’s [63, 69, 74, 76, 86, 93],
or provided an average age and/or range [46, 55, 57–59,
62, 67, 70, 75, 77, 80, 81, 83, 85, 94–96]. The youngest
participant was aged 20 years [70], and the oldest 61
years [57] at the time of study participation.

Quality of included studies
An assessment of quality was undertaken for each study
using CASP checklists [54]. Study quality varied, how-
ever the overall standard was acceptable and therefore
no studies were excluded based on poor quality. With
the exception of 12 studies, [25, 55, 68, 81, 86, 88–90,
92, 94–96], almost all studies used convenience, purpos-
ive or snowball sampling to recruit participants. While
ethically justified given the sensitive nature of the re-
search, the results may therefore not be representative of
all men bereaved to pregnancy/neonatal
loss more
broadly. This is further indicated by the narrow range of
variability in participant characteristics. All studies ad-
hered to appropriate ethical standards including obtain-
ing informed consent, protecting participant anonymity
through identification numbers or pseudonyms, and of-
fering contact details of pregnancy/neonatal loss support
services to bereaved parents in case of distress. However,
10 studies did not state whether institutional ethical ap-
proval had been sought or obtained [25, 46, 79, 82, 83,
86, 87, 91, 93, 94]. Two studies also acknowledged po-
tential conflicts of interest relating to the first author be-
ing the developer of the intervention under investigation
[63], and another employed by the bereavement service
being evaluated [92]. Otherwise, no additional conflicts
were declared by study authors or identified as a result
of quality rating.

Qualitative studies were generally of a high standard, with
methodologies and analyses (content [46, 55, 60, 64, 69],
thematic [61, 65, 71, 72], grounded theory [59, 62, 68],
autoethnographic [66], descriptive [83] and phenomeno-
logical [56–58, 73–75, 77–82]) clearly reported and justified
‘exploratory’ or ‘understanding lived

experience’ research aims. Quantitative studies reported ei-
ther correlational and regression analyses [24, 67, 76, 86,
88, 90, 92, 93], or group difference tests [23, 25, 76, 84, 87,
89, 91, 94–96], including significance testing of resulting re-
lationships or differences. However, one small quantitative
study reported only numbers and percentages of partici-
pants who endorsed a particular feeling relating to grief or
service outcome [70], and another reported percentages of
participants who had received certain support services fol-
lowing a loss [95].

the

remaining quantitative

With the exception of one study which employed
author-developed measures of grief and support service
satisfaction [70]
studies
employed standardised and validated measures for both
predictors and grief [23–25, 67, 76, 84, 86–96]. However,
there was an inconsistency in the use of grief measures
and reporting grief. Although 13 studies used the Perinatal
Grief Scale (PGS) as a primary measure of grief, some re-
ported average total grief scores [67, 88, 90, 93, 95], others
average subscale scores [84, 96], both [25, 87, 91], or sub-
scale correlations to predictor variables [24, 89]. Finally,
17 studies also grouped together different types of loss as
part of the investigation of grief (e.g., miscarriage and still-
birth, stillbirth and neonatal death, or all three types to-
gether) [24, 46, 57–61, 73, 77, 80, 83, 84, 86, 88–90, 93].
As a result, outcomes specific to these different loss
groups may have gone unrecognised. Only two studies
specifically discussed differences in support and grief be-
tween miscarriage and stillbirth [46, 61].

Findings relating to the grief experience
Quantitative studies
Thirteen quantitative studies used the PGS as the pri-
mary measure of grief [24, 25, 67, 84, 87–93, 95, 96].
Other grief measures included the Grief Experience
Inventory-Loss Version (GEI-L) [94], the Revised Impact
of Miscarriage Scale (RIMS) [23, 76, 96], the Miscarriage
Grief Inventory [63], and the Texas Revised Inventory of
Grief (TRIG-F) [86]. Although primarily a measure of
stress rather than grief, three studies also used the Im-
pact of Events Scale (IES) [67, 91, 94].

Of

the 12 quantitative studies that provided raw
grief scores for men, outcomes varied considerably
both between studies and within them [23, 25, 67, 76,
84, 87, 88, 91, 93–96]. This was indicated by wide
range and SDs. Average total grief scores for men in
studies using the PGS varied from 36 [93] to 133.19
[95] from a possible range of 33 to 165. However, the
majority of average total PGS scores across remaining
studies were between 73 and 83, with SDs ranging
between values of 16 and 22 [25, 87, 88, 91, 93].
Population norms suggest that total grief scores above
91 for the PGS are reflective of a high degree of grief
[97]. The outcomes reported across studies here (with

the exception of one study [96]) indicate that men
typically are not scoring in the highly significant grief
range. However, they are nevertheless scoring quite
highly in general
(see
Table 2 for a comparison of studies reporting total M
and SD scores for the PGS). Similarly, for three stud-
ies using the RIMS as a measure of grief, outcomes
also varied with subscale scores ranging from 0 to 57
[96], 5 to 24 [76], and subscale SDs up to 4.08 [23].

[25, 67, 84, 87, 88, 91, 93]

This variation in grief scores may be due to inconsist-
encies in the timing of grief measurement. Time since
the loss varied from one week in one study [96], to 32
years in another [67]. Overall, it was not clear whether
increased time since the loss led to reduced grief in men
(see Table 2). However, some studies also noted that
even when the losses had occurred many years in the
past, participants’ grief had not necessarily diminished
with time [55, 67, 79, 83].

In nine of 10 studies which compared men and women,
men’s grief scores were significantly lower or less intense
than those of women [67, 94, 96]. This was indicated by
approximately 20 points of difference on the PGS and IES
[88, 91, 93], and 3 points of difference on the RIMS [23, 76].
Importantly, however, some studies noted that the use of
existing grief measures (including the PGS and RIMS) might
not be valid for measuring men’s grief experiences, particu-
larly in relation to potential differences between internal ver-
sus external grieving styles [23, 84, 89, 95]. There were
mixed findings in terms of overall scale scores across similar
studies looking at grief following miscarriage, with Despair
(internalised grief) scores higher in men than those for Ac-
tive Grief (externalised grief) in two studies [87, 95], and
lower in the remaining two [91, 96]. Across other grief mea-
sures, men scored highly on the Devastating Event (RIMS),
Denial and Social Desirability (GEI-L), and Avoidance (IES)
subscales [23, 76, 91, 94, 96]. This may represent some of
the more inward responses to loss involved in some men’s
grief experiences.

Qualitative studies
In 14 qualitative studies, men reported that the loss of
their baby was a significant life event, regardless of
gestational or neonatal age [46, 57–62, 66, 73, 75, 79,
81, 82, 85]. However, other men in 10 studies (some
overlapping with the above 14 studies) also reported
less intense reactions, including stating that their part-
ners experienced worse grief in comparison to them
[56, 61, 69, 71–75, 78, 79]. Regardless of grief inten-
sity, in 14 studies men seemed to face additional or
unique tasks and challenges that complicated their
experience, or delayed the timing of grief. These
included a sense of helplessness or powerlessness (es-
pecially during labour) [66, 69, 75, 79, 81], and respon-
sibilities such as caring for other children, completing

paperwork, organising a funeral/burial, and informing
family and friends [46, 57, 58, 61, 62, 66, 80–82].

Although the grief experience was highly varied, and
subsequent grieving styles mixed, there was a general
trend among male participants towards instrumental
grieving, which included the use of active or problem-
focused coping strategies [55–62, 65, 66, 70–75, 77–82].
‘Keeping busy’ and ‘moving forward’ were common de-
sires [55, 59, 73, 77, 78, 80], with men seeking out dis-
increased
including sporting activities or
tractions
exercise [58, 59, 62], returning to work [57–61, 72, 74,
79, 80], completing household tasks [58, 61, 73, 81], and
creative, hands-on outlets such as woodworking, paint-
ing or writing [57, 58, 66]. However, men in 10 studies

also reported outward emotional grief expressions such
as crying. Although, these were frequently kept private,
with many men preferring to grieve independently and
alone [46, 56–59, 62, 66, 81, 82, 85].

Findings relating to predictors of men’s grief
Of the included quantitative studies, 16 included an ana-
lysis on predictors of men’s grief and/or correlations to
related factors [23–25, 67, 76, 84, 86–93, 95, 96]. As part
of a wider exploration of grief, all qualitative studies also
discussed factors that contributed (both positively and
negatively) to men’s grief. Overall, a wide range of varied
predictors/factors were considered, which fell broadly
into four domains or levels: (1) individual/person-level

Obst et al. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth           (2020) 20:11 

Page 8 of 17

factors; (2) interpersonal factors; (3) community/socio-
cultural factors; and (4) public policy factors.

Individual factors
Attachment to the baby
One of the strongest factors found to impact upon grief at
the individual level was men’s attachment to the baby. In
11 qualitative studies, men who had developed a bond with
their baby throughout the pregnancy described more in-
tense grief following a subsequent loss [46, 58, 60–62, 73,
75, 79, 81, 82, 85]. However, in five studies some men
stated that they did not feel that they had a relationship
with the developing baby [61, 69, 75, 79], either because it
was an early miscarriage, or they described little involve-
ment during the pregnancy. Others also made a conscious
attempt during pregnancy not to get attached, due to previ-
ous experience of loss or diagnosis of a life-threatening con-
dition [74]. In these cases, grief was reported as less intense.
Actions that increased attachment included spending time
with the baby [66, 85], and attending ultrasound appoint-
ments to ‘see’ the baby and hear the heartbeat [46, 61, 62,
66, 73, 79, 82, 85]. Although estimates of grief were impre-
cise due to a small male sample size, one quantitative study
measuring grief after seeing or holding the stillborn baby
identified worsened grief for men [92]. Similarly, men in six
qualitative studies who held or spent time with their baby
following a stillbirth generally also reported high levels of
grief [58, 62, 66, 77, 81, 85]. Importantly, however, the
cause and effect relationship here is unclear. It may be that
men who spent time with their baby were already more at-
tached, and therefore more likely to experience worsened
grief.

Seven quantitative studies explored men’s attachment
to the developing baby using measures including viewing
an ultrasound [25], vividness of visual imagery [87], in-
creasing gestational age [23–25, 67, 93], and holding or
seeing the baby following stillbirth [92]. Men who
viewed an ultrasound image had an average PGS total
score 23 points higher than those who did not view any
images [25], and men with a strong visual image of their
baby as measured by the Baby Vividness of Visual Im-
agery Questionnaire (“vivid imagers”) had an average
PGS total score 40 points higher than those who did not
[87]. Again, the causal relationship here is unclear.

In five quantitative studies,

a longer pregnancy could result in more opportunities
for bonding.
increasing
gestational age was associated with higher grief scores
[23–25, 67, 93]. However, qualitative studies compli-
cated this picture. In studies inclusive of multiple loss
types, men who had experienced earlier losses did not
describe less intense grief than those with later losses
[46, 57–59, 61]. Studies on miscarriage also noted
that men’s grief responses were not dissimilar to the

grief of men described in studies focused on stillbirth
or neonatal death [62, 75, 82]. As such, the impact of
gestational age on grief remains unclear.

Men’s personality
Two studies on the same sample of bereaved parents in
Australia [88, 90] investigated the relationships between
grief and a general personality proneness to guilt (con-
sidering one’s actions as regretful) and shame (attribut-
ing regretful actions to oneself). Overall, shame and
guilt-proneness were found to explain 63% of the vari-
ance in grief (as measured by the PGS) in men, with
shame-proneness accounting for 56% of the variance in
men’s grief 13 months following a stillbirth or neonatal
death [88]. In the follow-up study [90], which conducted
analysis within the couple, women’s self-conscious emo-
tions and grief tendencies did not appear to influence
men’s emotions and grief tendencies (although men’s
did impact upon women’s). Franche [24] similarly ex-
plored the predictive value of self-criticism on grief after
loss. Considered in combination
pregnancy/neonatal
with other obstetric and demographic variables, higher
levels of self-criticism were significantly associated with
higher scores on all subscales of the PGS in men (p < .01
for the Active Grief subscale, and p < .001 for Despair
and Difficulty Coping subscales).

Demographic factors
Findings relating to the relationship between demo-
graphic factors and grief were mixed. Only one
quantitative study [23] found age to be a significant
predictor of grief
following miscarriage, with men
aged < 35 years scoring higher on the Devastating
Event subscale of the RMIS. The remaining quantita-
tive studies including age as a predictor did not find
a significant association [24, 93, 95], and qualitative
studies did not specifically explore or discuss the im-
pact of age on grief. However, the majority of men
who participated in qualitative studies were generally
aged 28 years or over, with the exception of
two
studies which reported minimum ages of 20 and 21
years [46, 77].

Ethnicity did not emerge as a significant predictor of grief,
but this was rarely explored. One study comparing Swedish
and American couples’ experiences of miscarriage [76] found
differences between the samples on one subscale of the
RMIS (Loss of Baby). However, this difference was attributed
to linguistic understanding and wording of the scale ques-
tions, rather than the grief experience itself. Other quantita-
tive studies including a small number of culturally diverse
participants (e.g., African American, Asian-Australian, His-
panic, Native American) either did not examine differences
[23, 88–90, 93], or did not find any significant differences in
grief [91]. Five qualitative studies had mixed ethnic samples

Obst et al. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth           (2020) 20:11 

Page 9 of 17

(e.g.,
Jamaican, African-American, Hispanic/Latino), but
none reported any differences in grief; although, their aim
was not to do so [57, 60, 62, 73, 82]. Further,
in two
Australian-based studies of the same sample of participants
with Middle-Eastern backgrounds, culture was not discussed
as impacting upon grief [71, 72]. In one qualitative study
based in Israel [69], high drop-out rates were noted due to
(mostly) the husband’s objection to participating, in the con-
text of a typically “closed” religious society. Finally, in a study
of low-income African-American parents, grief for men did
not differ to those in other studies. However, “dealing with
stressful life events”, including economic hardship and other
unrelated family deaths, were found to compound grief for
both parents [77].

In one quantitative study [67], involvement in orga-
nised religious activity was inversely associated with Des-
pair subscale scores on the PGS for men (p = 0.047). In
eight qualitative studies, men who reported religious or
spiritual beliefs also found this to be a source of comfort
in coping with their grief. This was both from a
meaning-making perspective (e.g., “what God does, He
does it for the best”) [69], and from the additional social
support that was received from religious/church com-
munities [58, 59, 62, 73, 77, 81, 82]. However, the ex-
perience of loss for some men in two qualitative studies
also led to questioning or challenging of their religious
beliefs [66, 69].

Recurrent loss and living children
Findings relating to the impact of previous losses and
number of living children on grief were also varied. In one
quantitative study which examined men who had experi-
enced recurrent miscarriage, grief and stress scores were
high on both the PGS (M = 72.23, SD = 16.85), and IES
(M = 26.53, SD = 13.76) [91]. In contrast, men with a his-
tory of loss in nine qualitative studies [46, 61, 62, 68, 71,
72, 78, 82, 83] did not report different or increased levels
of grief. Yet, in four studies, men did report increased
worry about future pregnancies [59, 62, 75, 78].

In two quantitative studies including subsequent preg-
nancy status as an indicator of grief intensity, no significant
relationships were found between a group who were cur-
rently pregnant following a loss, and a group who had not
had a subsequent pregnancy or child [84, 89]. However, in
three qualitative studies examining experiences of grief into
subsequent pregnancies/children, it was clear that men’s grief
did continue, along with added concerns and vigilance due
to the knowledge of potential risks [73, 74, 80]. Similarly, one
of three studies examining the presence of living children at
the time of loss found a relationship to worsened grief in
men [23]. However, for the remaining two studies including
this factor, it was unrelated [86, 89]. Four qualitative studies
described how living children could both enhance the reality
of the developing baby (thus worsening grief), and make

coming to terms with the loss easier. This was attributed to
enhanced appreciation for surviving children, reassurance
about the possibility of successful future pregnancies, or pro-
viding a caring role to focus on [58, 75, 78, 81].

Interpersonal factors
Quality of the partner relationship
In 10 qualitative studies, men noted that the relationship
with their partner could be either a positive or negative
contributor to the grief experience [55, 57, 59–62, 70,
71, 74, 81]. For many participants, a lack of recognition
for their grief from family, friends and healthcare profes-
sionals meant their partner became their main source of
interpersonal support [59, 61, 81]. Although many men
reported supportive relationships with “frank and honest
communication” [81] resulting in a stronger couple bond
that buffered the grief experience, many also experienced
conflict or relationship strain due to incongruent griev-
ing styles [55, 57, 59, 61, 62, 70, 74, 75, 81]. Where dis-
sonant grieving styles or conflict were present, men
reported a sense of alienation or frustration that added
to their grief experience [55, 60, 61, 74]. However, des-
pite early conflict, where couples learned to effectively
navigate one another’s grief, the relationship was ultim-
ately strengthened [59, 62, 74].

The supporter role
Although not a factor quantified for measurement in
any quantitative studies, one of the most consistently
reported and important elements relating to men’s
grief across qualitative studies was being a ‘supporter’
to their
female partner and family. Twenty-three
qualitative studies identified an element of the sup-
porter role from men’s responses [46, 55–59, 61, 62,
65, 68, 69, 71–75, 77–82, 85]. In 21 of these, all male
participants reported their primary role of being the
supporter to their female partner. In the remaining
two, the majority of men (five of nine [62], and 14 of
15 [75]) also reported this role. For men in five stud-
ies, the need to support their partner explicitly came
from a perception that she had a more intense grief
reaction in comparison to themselves [59, 61, 69, 74,
79]. In 15 studies, men described having to suppress
or put aside their own grief to take on this role [46,
57–59, 61, 62, 68, 71, 72, 74, 75, 77, 81, 82, 85]. As a
result, many of these men reported a feeling of being
ignored or unrecognised as grievers,
instead seen
merely as the ‘support person’ [46, 61, 80]. In three
studies, some men reported feeling as though this sup-
porter role was helpful, as it gave them a meaningful
task to focus on [69, 73, 75]. However, for other men
in Hamama Raz et al. [69] and the remaining studies,
this role ultimately served as a hindrance in allowing
them to acknowledge, express and manage their grief

Obst et al. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth           (2020) 20:11

and emotional responses [46, 56–59, 61, 62, 65, 68, 69,
71, 72, 74, 75, 79–82, 85].

Support and acknowledgement from family and friends
In 16 studies looking at support, 10 found family
and/or friends to be a helpful facilitator to men’s cop-
ing following the loss [56, 57, 59, 66, 72, 73, 75, 79,
81, 82]. This was important, since many men expli-
citly reported a preference not to engage in formal
counselling [78] and/or support groups [56, 61]. How-
ever, men’s experiences of support from family and
friends varied greatly. In the one quantitative study
that looked at family and friend support as variables,
‘talking with friends’ was associated with increased
grief scores, along with ‘timing of talking to family’.
However, there is no description of what is meant by
this [93]. In the remaining qualitative studies, the ma-
jority of men also reported talking with either close
family members or
friends post-loss, which they
found meaningful and helpful most of the time [56,
57, 59, 61, 75, 79, 81, 82]. Practical support immedi-
ately following the loss (e.g., making meals) was par-
ticularly appreciated by men in three qualitative
studies [61, 72, 82]. For others “subtle” gestures of
care from other male friends, including sharing their
own stories or
scheduling time/activities post-loss,
were immense comforts [66, 81, 82]. However, seven
qualitative studies also reported negative – or a total
absence of – interactions with family and friends
[59–62, 73, 75, 80]. In two of these studies, men did
not feel the need to discuss their grief with anyone
other than their partners, or avoided talking to others
about the loss, believing this would reduce the impact
[73, 75]. In the remaining five, men desired support
from family and friends, however stated that “no one”

Support and acknowledgement from healthcare
professionals
Similar to support from family and friends, the role of
healthcare professionals was recognised in one quantitative
study [70] and 13 qualitative studies [46, 56, 60–62, 64, 65,
68, 72, 73, 78, 81, 82] as essential to the bereavement
process. However, among studies that examined healthcare
provider support, findings were again mixed. In 10 studies,
some men reported positive experiences with healthcare
staff [46, 60, 61, 64, 68, 73, 75, 78, 81, 82]. Three studies
noted that providers who worked “extra hard” to provide
both medical and practical information to men were valued
[81], and parents who experienced the support of specialist

bereavement care teams, or follow-up telephone calls from
care providers, commented positively on this [68, 78]. How-
ever, men in one quantitative study felt excluded from ser-
they
vices and none were satisfied with the support
received from health professionals [70]. Likewise, other
men in 11 of both the same and different qualitative studies
also reported negative interactions with healthcare staff.
This led to sadness, anger, or distress which worsened or
prevented the grieving process [46, 61, 62, 64, 65, 70, 72,
75, 79, 81, 82]. Common issues included insensitive lan-
guage or confusing medical terminology [79, 81, 82], a lack
of answers or explanations [61, 62], a lack of practical infor-
mation on how they could care for their female partner or
organise a funeral/burial [46, 62, 72], and failing to recog-
nise their distress and role as a father [46, 64, 65, 70, 75,
79]. It should be noted that the majority of studies report-
ing negative experiences with health care providers/the hos-
pital focused on miscarriages as opposed to later-term
losses, with the exception of three which focused exclu-
sively on stillbirth [64, 65, 81]. Two studies exploring
healthcare support following both miscarriage and stillbirth
also noted differences in care between these types of losses,
with miscarriages receiving considerably less support in
comparison to stillbirths [46, 61].

Community factors
Disenfranchisement of grief following pregnancy/neonatal
loss
A lack of community acknowledgement and understand-
ing for grief following pregnancy loss was explicitly iden-
tified by male participants in seven qualitative studies
from the USA [58, 65, 66, 82], Ireland [46, 78] and
Australia [61]. Across these, men discussed widespread
taboo, stigma and silence surrounding miscarriage and/
or stillbirth which worsened their grief. Experiences of
disenfranchisement included questioning their identity
as fathers due to confusion surrounding whether their
pregnancy was understood as a baby or not [46], only
discussing their loss if/when prompted by another be-
reaved parent [78], and hurtful comments from others
which minimised their grief or encouraged them to
“move on” from the loss [61, 82]. Overall, this sense of
disenfranchisement due to a lack of community acknow-
ledgement for pregnancy loss led men to experience in-
creased distress and feelings of isolation [46, 58, 61, 66,
82]. This factor was not explored in quantitative studies.

Male role expectations and attitudes toward men’s grief
Tying in closely with the ‘supporter role’ theme, a pres-
sure to conform to masculine role expectations toward
how men should grieve was expressed in 19 qualitative
studies. These were based in Australia [61, 72, 85], the
UK [79], the USA [55–60, 62, 65, 66, 74, 80, 82], Ireland
[46], Sweden [81] and Israel [69]. No quantitative studies

Obst et al. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth           (2020) 20:11 

Page 11 of 17

explored this factor. In 13 studies, male participants spe-
cifically discussed the need to be “strong”, and a per-
ceived expectation to hide their grief [46, 56–59, 61, 62,
72, 74, 79, 80, 82, 85]. Men reported that these expecta-
tions had a direct negative impact on their grieving
process, as they felt prevented from displaying their
emotions in front of others, seeking support, and/or
working through their grief [46, 57, 61, 65, 66, 74, 80,
82, 85]. This expectation to hide their emotions also
meant that the impact of the loss on these men was fre-
quently disguised from family,
friends and healthcare
professionals. This led to a generalised lack of recogni-
tion for their grief, and a further sense of disenfranchise-
ment, above that which already exists for grief following
pregnancy/neonatal loss generally [60, 61, 82].

Public policy factors
Woman-focused maternity care and support services
A general focus on woman-centred care in the hospital
environment and existing support services was identified
as a factor impacting grief by nine qualitative studies,
but not in quantitative studies [46, 60, 61, 64, 66, 70,
80–82]. A general community attitude that pregnancy
and subsequent loss was primarily a “woman’s experi-
ence” [80] was explicitly expressed by men in three stud-
ies [46, 60, 80]. Men also reported feeling overlooked or
ignored in the context of existing healthcare and support
services. For example, in the hospital environment, both
following loss and during subsequent pregnancies, men
felt “out of place” [81], “marginalised” [46] and some-
times, as though they “barely existed” [61]. Similar senti-
ments were echoed in the context of support services/
groups which were delivered primarily by women and
focused on “‘traditionally feminine’ modes of grieving”
[60, 61, 66, 80]. Men in five studies expressed a desire
for recognition [80–82], as well as a need for increased
male involvement in care and support services [46, 61].
Indeed, in studies where male friends and family were
available to men, or healthcare staff sought to specifically
involve them in pregnancy care and support services,
grief improved [46, 60, 61, 64, 66].

Workplace policies: bereavement leave
Another consistent theme at a policy level was the
availability of paternity or bereavement leave for men
following pregnancy/neonatal loss. Returning to work
following loss was explicitly discussed in 11 qualitative
studies [57–62, 66, 74, 79, 80, 82] and one quantitative
study [86]. For the majority of men, particularly those
who described a more instrumental grieving style, work
provided a distraction from their loss, and was used as
a strategy to cope with their grief [57–60, 74, 79]. How-
ever, four qualitative studies, which examined men’s ex-
perience of returning to work in more depth, identified

varied outcomes [61, 66, 80, 82]. In three of these stud-
ies, men were not provided with the same opportunities
as their female partners to take paid leave from work
following their loss [61, 66, 80]. This led to physical
and emotional exhaustion, along with difficulties in
concentration and keeping up with tasks. In one quan-
titative study [86], men also reported difficulty return-
ing to work. In contrast, the burden of grief was eased
for men in two studies who were offered extended paid
leave or extensions on work-related deadlines [61, 82].

The emerging model: a socio-ecological theory of men’s
grief
Spanning the individual, interpersonal, community and
public policy realms, the factors identified in this review
align with a socio-ecological approach to understanding
grief. We propose a preliminary model of men’s grief,
adapted from Bronfenbrenner’s [98] Ecological Systems
Theory (see Fig. 2). The original theory (focusing more
broadly on development as opposed to grief) purported
that an individual’s development is impacted by four
interacting levels in the environment: the microsystem
(the immediate environment), the mesosystem (settings
in which we actively participate), the exosystem (wider
social setting), and the macrosystem (culture and belief
systems) [98]. Like the original theory, the model of
men’s grief proposed here acknowledges that the grief
experience does not exist
is
shaped by a complex system of interacting factors and
levels. These include those relating to the individual,
their relationships,
the surrounding community, and
governing policies. Each of these levels also interacts
with one another in a bi-directional nature. For example,
cultural norms and beliefs regarding men’s roles – par-
ticularly in pregnancy – may play a vital role in inform-
ing the woman-centred focus of perinatal healthcare and
bereavement leave policies (and vice versa). These norms
can also impact the ways that individuals interact with
one another in response to pregnancy/neonatal loss, as
do these interpersonal interactions serve to support the
overarching cultural norms. At the centre, the individual,
their personality, knowledge, attitudes, and skills are im-
pacted by, and continually interact with, all of these
contributors.

“double disenfranchisement”,

The overarching theme of this model is the concept
introduced by
of
Cacciatore and Raffo [99] in their study on lesbian ma-
ternal bereavement. The authors argued that given an
additional lack of societal recognition for their status as
legitimate mothers, lesbian women can experience an
added level of disenfranchisement following pregnancy
loss [99]. In a similar way, the lack of recognition that
many men cited in the included papers for their pos-
ition as grieving fathers indicates that they may also

following pregnancy/neonatal loss is not viewed entirely
as an individual response to the event, but as part of a

Grief
Both quantitative and qualitative studies revealed the
highly varied and individual nature of men’s grief. Al-
though men’s grief was
intense compared to
women’s in some quantitative studies [23, 67, 76, 88, 91,
93, 94, 96], qualitative studies identified the significant
impact of loss on men. Given grief is a normal and ex-
pected process following a loss, it is unsurprising that
In

contrast to stereotypes that men intellectualise or ration-
alise their grief, studies also found that men do grieve on
an emotional
level. They may also oscillate between
problem-focused coping and emotional expressions of
grief, as reflected in the dual-process model of coping
[31]. However, men’s experiences also appeared to be
consistent with the theory of disenfranchised grief [5],
silence surrounding pregnancy loss
with a general

contributing to feelings of isolation and worsened grief.
Compared to women overall, men may also face differ-
ent challenges that can worsen grief. This finding is con-
sistent with previous research on gender and grieving
which suggests that grief can be impacted by, but is not
dependent on, gender [100].

Predictors of grief
A wide range of factors have the potential to influence
men’s grief. At an individual level there are mixed findings
relating to demographic factors, suggesting that these have
not been well-explored. Similarly, personality constructs
may play a key role in predicting grief [24, 88, 90], al-
though further research is required to confirm causality.
However, in contrast to early assumptions that men only
develop an attachment to the developing baby as gestation
increases, results suggest that attachment at any level is an
important predictor of grief [58, 62, 79, 81, 82].

Men’s interactions with others seem to play a pivotal
role in how they experience grief. The quality of the
couple relationship contributed to either a positive
source of support that helped the grief process, or a
negative source of added stress which increased the im-
pact of the loss [55, 57, 59–62, 70, 71, 74, 81]. Grief was
eased when friends and family were available to support
men, and were understanding of their loss [56, 57, 59,
61, 75, 79, 81, 82]. Furthermore, a positive experience
with the healthcare system led to both reduced grief and
increased support group participation [60], whereas in-
sensitive treatment
led to psychological distress and
worsened grief [64].

to studies

factors are similar

These findings relating to individual and interper-
focused on
sonal
women’s experiences of grief
following pregnancy/
neonatal loss. For example, findings on demographic
factors have also been inconsistent. Involvement in re-
ligious activity and strength of religious faith have
been inversely associated with grief in some studies
[101, 102] but not others [103]. Similarly, maternal
age both has [23, 101], and has not [24, 104], been
found to be a significant predictor of grief. However,
while the impact of cultural diversity is yet to be ex-
plored in men, cross-cultural studies with women
highlight a range of culturally-specific understandings
and practices relating to the loss of a baby that can
impact upon grief [105–109]. Finally, social support
and experiences with the healthcare system have been
linked to both immediate grief and long-term psycho-
logical health for women [1, 110–113].

Alongside the potential

for mixed styles of grieving,
individual-level supports should consider these factors to
provide tailored and appropriate support options to suit
men’s individual needs. For example, individual counselling
or support groups may not be appealing to all men. Rather,
previous research has recommended creative options in-
cluding activity-based supports, evidence-based online sup-
ports, opportunity for peer contact, or including male
support workers in hospitals [21, 46, 47]. Joint couple be-
reavement counselling could also be considered where
necessary. As a minimum, it is important to provide expla-
nations to bereaved parents about incongruent grieving be-
tween partners, and skills to navigate potential
issues.
There is an ongoing need for healthcare professionals to
provide sensitive and empathetic care to both members of
a couple relationship. This includes adopting appropriate,
jargon-free language, providing explanations relating to the
cause of loss when available, and follow-up calls specifically
to men in the weeks or months following a loss. Practical
information on how best to support their partner, alongside
recognising and managing their own grief, was also desired
by men [46, 62, 72].

Community attitudes concerning the legitimacy of
parents’ grief following pregnancy/neonatal loss, along
with gendered expectations
relating to how men
should behave in the face of loss, are important in
shaping men’s experience. A lack of recognition for
grief following pregnancy/neonatal loss resulted in dis-
enfranchisement [5], with men frequently reporting a
feeling of being overlooked as grieving fathers [46, 58,
61, 66, 82]. Policies relating to woman-centred care
and bereavement leave in the workplace also impacted
grief. Where pregnancy was seen as an issue relating
exclusively to women, and men consequently felt ex-
cluded from the loss experience at the hospital, their
grief was worsened [46, 61, 81]. A small number of

studies also suggested that men were frequently not
afforded adequate workplace leave to manage their
grief following a loss [61, 66, 80]. In line with recent
investigations which have highlighted similar social
and economic consequences of stillbirth [27, 114],
there is potential to re-examine current paternity and
bereavement leave policies [66, 80].

These findings imply that beyond individual and interper-
sonal supports, there is also a need to educate the commu-
nity about the impact of pregnancy/neonatal loss on men,
as well as promoting their strengths to seek and accept, ra-
ther than avoid, support. More generally, similar recom-
mendations have been made in the men’s physical and
mental health literature, where stigma surrounding male
help-seeking frequently serves as a barrier to accessing ap-
propriate health-related supports [34–36]. Strategies are
also needed to develop male-inclusive healthcare practices,
and promote the meaningful engagement of men as equal
partners throughout pregnancy and childbirth.
In the
broader postnatal health context, engagement of fathers has
demonstrated improved long-term physical and mental
health outcomes for women, men and babies [115, 116].

Limitations and future research
concerning grief between
Although inconsistencies
quantitative and qualitative studies highlight the varied
nature of men’s experiences, some authors have ques-
tioned the ecological validity of current grief measures
[23, 84, 89, 95]. The PGS, for example, was initially de-
veloped and validated in a sample of mainly bereaved
mothers (women n = 138 and men n = 56) [117]. As
such, some of the items and subscales have been criti-
cised for measuring more traditionally ‘feminine’ (or in-
tuitive) expressions of grief, which may under-recognise
more ‘masculine’ (or instrumental) expressions and re-
sponses. Across included studies that provided separate
subscale analyses of grief, the greatest differences be-
tween men and women occurred on the Active Grief
subscale. This reflects outward expressions of grief and
emotions, which men often display less frequently than
women [25, 91, 95, 96], and may indicate a selection bias
in qualitative studies toward men with more extreme
grief responses. However, some men in qualitative stud-
ies also expressed less extreme reactions to the loss, in-
dicating representation of a range of experiences [56, 61,
69, 71–75, 78, 79]. Given the correlational nature of
findings on viewing an ultrasound [25], it also remains
unclear as to whether viewing an ultrasound results in
more intense grief, or whether men who were already
more attached to their baby were more likely to attend
the ultrasound appointment. This concept requires fur-
ther investigation.

Overall, quantitative studies seem to have captured
part of the picture about grief, focusing predominately

Obst et al. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth           (2020) 20:11 

Page 14 of 17

on individual and interpersonal factors as key contribu-
tors to the grief experience. Further studies are needed
to explore the unique facets of men’s grief following
pregnancy/neonatal loss (e.g., helplessness, marginalisa-
tion, and the expectation to ‘be strong’), as well as the
broader sociocultural and public policy factors. This
might include a more comprehensive measure of attach-
ment to the baby and workplace functioning, or quanti-
tative measures of marginalisation from the healthcare
system, and the expectation to ‘be strong’ and conform
to masculine norms. Once these factors are well under-
stood, there will be scope to develop and validate a grief
measure with increased sensitivity toward these ele-
ments, as well as the more instrumental-orientated grief
styles [23, 80, 84].

None of the included studies focused exclusively on
men’s grief following neonatal loss. Furthermore, those
which did include men experiencing neonatal loss did
not specifically identify disenfranchisement as a contrib-
uting factor. This may be due to increased recognition
for the baby’s life, given survival outside of the womb.
However, in studies on neonatal loss not eligible for in-
clusion [4, 118, 119], parents reported feelings similar to
those following miscarriage or stillbirth. These included
loneliness and isolation from friends and family, as well
as a profound “silence concerning the death” [4]. There
is a need for updated research to explore men’s experi-
ences of grief following neonatal loss, and to identify any
unique factors impacting grief.

Finally, participants in the included studies were pre-
dominately Caucasian, heterosexual males. As ever, there
is a need for research among diverse samples of men.
This includes gay and transgender men whose preg-
nancy and loss experiences may involve unique or added
challenges [120, 121], single and separated men who ex-
perience relationship breakdown following a loss, and
culturally and socio-demographically diverse men. The
emerging socio-ecological model of men’s grief following
pregnancy/neonatal
loss also requires refinement and
confirmation through cohort studies which includes
these diverse populations. A comprehensive longitudinal
study following men throughout pregnancy, and then
during and following a pregnancy/neonatal loss, would
also be useful to explore the causal pathways for risk
and protective factors of grief.

Conclusions
A socio-ecological model of men’s grief implies a need for
multi-level strategies, rather than individual bereavement
supports alone. Tailored support is needed for instrumen-
tal grievers, and to address the unique challenges men
face. Additional strategies may also include community
campaigns to change attitudes toward grief and loss and
than weaknesses, of
promote the strengths,

rather

traditionally normative “masculine” traits including resili-
ence and strength to seek assistance. Appropriate work-
place policies and health systems that validate and engage
men throughout pregnancy, childbirth, and in the event of
loss, are also required. A focus on men’s grief and subse-
quent support does not seek to reduce the significance of
the loss for their female partners. Rather, a lack of valid-
ation as equal partners in the pregnancy and loss process
has led to increased difficulties in coping for men, and be-
ing afforded acknowledgement for their grief [82, 85]. As
such, this review provides a helpful synthesis on the exist-
ing literature for men’s grief following pregnancy/neonatal
loss, and a solid theoretical foundation from which future
research and recommendations can be built.
