ABSTRACT

BACKGROUND:  Improving access to evidence-based 
psychotherapies (EBPs) is a Veterans Health Admin-
istration (VHA) priority. Cognitive behavioral therapy 
(CBT), acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT), and 
mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) are effec-
tive for chronic pain and several mental health condi-
tions. We synthesized evidence on implementation strat-
egies to increase EBP access and use.
METHODS:  We  searched  MEDLINE,  Embase,  Psy-
cINFO, and CINAHL from inception until March 2021 for 
articles on EBP implementation within integrated health 
systems to treat chronic pain or chronic mental health 
conditions. Reviewers independently screened articles, 
extracted results, coded qualitative findings, and rated 
quality using modified criteria from Newcastle–Ottawa 
(quantitative results) or Critical Appraisal Skills Pro-
gramme (qualitative results). We categorized implemen-
tation strategies using the Expert Recommendations for 
Implementing Change (ERIC) framework and classified 
outcomes using RE-AIM domains (Reach, Effectiveness, 
Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance).
RESULTS:  Twelve articles (reporting results from 10 
studies) evaluated CBT (k = 11) and ACT (k = 1) imple-
mentation  strategies  in  large  integrated  healthcare 
systems. No studies evaluated MBSR implementation. 
Eight  articles  evaluated  strategies  within  VHA.  Six 
articles  reported  on  national  VHA  EBP  implementa-
tion programs; all involved training/education, facili-
tation, and audit/feedback. CBT and ACT implemen-
tation demonstrated moderate to large improvements 
in  patient  symptoms  and  quality  of  life.  Trainings

increased mental health provider self-efficacy in deliv-
ering EBPs, improved provider EBP perceptions, and 
increased provider EBP use during programs, but had 
unclear impacts on Reach. It was unclear whether exter-
nal facilitation added benefit. Provider EBP maintenance 
was modest; barriers included competing professional 
time demands and patient barriers.
DISCUSSION:  Multi-faceted CBT and ACT implemen-
tation programs increased provider EBP Adoption but 
had unclear impacts on Reach. Future implementation 
efforts should further evaluate Reach, Adoption, and 
Maintenance; assess the added value of external facilita-
tion; and consider strategies targeting patient barriers. 
Future work should use implementation frameworks to 
guide evaluations of barriers and facilitators, processes 
of change, and outcomes.

INTRODUCTION

Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), acceptance and com-
mitment  therapy  (ACT),  and  mindfulness-based  stress 
reduction  (MBSR)  have  demonstrated  effectiveness  for 
mental health conditions common among US military vet-
erans, including depression and anxiety,1–7 and have more 
recently shown effectiveness for improving chronic pain out-
comes.8,9 Nonetheless, these evidence-based psychotherapies 
(EBPs) remain underutilized and underaccessed in clinical 
settings.10–12 The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) 
has rolled out several national initiatives to  implement13–18 
EBPs for mental health conditions including depression and 
anxiety, as well as for chronic pain.13,14,18 The goal of these

implementation initiatives is to increase uptake of EBPs—
i.e., both access to therapies and use of therapies—for con-
ditions they effectively treat. The results of such efforts 
to improve the uptake of these EBPs in VHA and similar 
clinical settings have not been systematically reviewed using 
implementation science frameworks.19

Implementation science attempts to understand and resolve 
problems by translating evidence-based therapies into real-
world practice so that the greatest number of patients can have 
easy and ready access to gold-standard treatments.20–23 Strate-
gic approaches to implementing EBPs must be responsive to 
existing health care contexts in order to successfully increase 
access to care. Implementation efforts should thus be tailored 
to disparate clinical settings, situated within differing patient 
and provider populations, and evaluated using varying and 
mixed-methods approaches. Synthesizing evidence on results 
of implementation strategies is both challenging and necessary 
to improve access to and use of evidence-based care. Concep-
tual frameworks from implementation science,23–26 such as the 
Expert Recommendations for Implementing Change (ERIC) 
classification of implementation strategies and the RE-AIM 
(Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, Mainte-
nance) classification of outcome domains (Table 1), delineate 
how interventions interact with health system components and 
patient factors to impact patient access to treatments. Apply-
ing these conceptual frameworks can clarify lessons from past 
EBP implementation approaches and inform future efforts to 
improve EBP access and use. For example, Adoption in RE-
AIM refers to the proportion and representativeness of settings 
and staff willing to deliver an intervention, which is a prereq-
uisite for patient access to that intervention. If initial Adoption 
is low in some settings, an implementation strategy such as a 
staff training and education program may increase Adoption 
and thereby facilitate patient access to care.

To identify research gaps and the next steps for improving 
EBP access and use, the VHA Pain/Opioid Consortium of 

Research (CORE) engaged the VHA Evidence Synthesis Pro-
gram (ESP) to conduct a systematic review of factors related to 
the implementation of psychotherapies with evidence of effec-
tiveness for chronic pain and mental health conditions.27 In this 
paper, we present results focusing on implementation strate-
gies for CBT, ACT, and MBSR to treat chronic pain or mental 
health conditions. We summarize outcomes reported by studies 
of various implementation programs, organized by the type(s) 
of implementation strategies employed. We also discuss evi-
dence gaps and provide recommendations for future research.

METHODS

Scope and Key Questions

In collaboration with our key stakeholder, the VA Pain/Opi-
oids CORE, and our expert advisory panel, we developed 
the scope and key questions. Recognizing that there is very 
limited evidence on the implementation of EBPs specifically 
for the treatment of chronic pain, we expanded the scope 
to include implementation studies of EBPs to treat chronic 
mental health conditions such as depression and anxiety. In 
this paper, we focus on results for CBT, ACT, and MBSR, 
three of the most widely used EBPs with the strongest evi-
dence for effectiveness in chronic pain as well as for multi-
ple mental health conditions common among U.S. military 
veterans.8,9 The full ESP report included other EBPs that 
have demonstrated effectiveness in the treatment of chronic 
mental health conditions and are recommended by various 
treatment guidelines.27–30

In this paper, we present results on CBT, ACT, and MBSR 

that addressed the following key questions:

1.  For CBT, ACT, and MBSR used to treat adults with 
chronic pain, what is the effect of implementation strate-
gies to increase the uptake of these treatments?

Table 1   RE-AIM Framework Domains and  Definitionsa

Reach

The absolute number, proportion, and representativeness of individuals who are willing to participate in a given initiative, inter-

vention, or program, and reasons why or why not

How do I reach the targeted population with the intervention?

Effectiveness

The impact of an intervention on important individual outcomes, including potential negative effects, and broader impact includ-

Adoption

ing quality of life and economic outcomes; and variability across subgroups (generalizability or heterogeneity of effects)

How do I know my intervention is effective?
The absolute number, proportion, and representativeness of settings and intervention agents (people who deliver the program) 

who are willing to initiate a program, and why

How do I develop organizational support to deliver my intervention?

Implementation At the setting level, implementation refers to the intervention agents’ fidelity to the various elements of an intervention’s key 

Maintenance

functions or components, including consistency of delivery as intended and the time and cost of the intervention. Importantly, it 
also includes adaptations made to interventions and implementation strategies

How do I ensure the intervention is delivered properly?
At the setting level, the extent to which a program or policy becomes institutionalized or part of the routine organizational prac-

tices and policies. At the individual level, maintenance has been defined as the long-term effects of a program on outcomes after 
a program is completed

How do I incorporate the intervention so that it is delivered over the long term?

2.  For CBT, ACT, and MBSR used in integrated delivery 
systems to treat adults with chronic mental health condi-
tions, what is the effect of implementation strategies to 
increase the uptake of these treatments?

Search Strategy

We searched MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, and CINAHL 
databases from inception through March 2021. Search terms 
included MeSH and free text for EBPs (eg, CBT, ACT, and 
MBSR), chronic pain, integrated delivery systems, and vet-
erans (Appendix A). We sought relevant systematic reviews 
from  the  Agency  for  Healthcare  Research  and  Quality 
(AHRQ) Evidence-based Practice Center (EPC) and VA Evi-
dence Synthesis Program (ESP); we hand-searched relevant 
reviews for potentially eligible studies. Our expert advisory 
panel also provided referrals.

Screening and Selection

Duplicate results were removed and abstracts were screened 
using  DistillerSR  (Evidence  Partners,  Ottawa,  Canada). 
Exclusion of abstracts required the agreement of 2 reviewers. 
Included abstracts underwent full-text review by 2 individu-
als, with eligibility decisions requiring consensus. Eligible 
studies addressed implementation barriers or facilitators, or 
outcomes of implementation strategies, for EBPs used in the 
outpatient treatment of adults with chronic pain or chronic 
mental health conditions. In addition to CBT, ACT, and 
MBSR, eligible EBPs (for key question 2) in the full report 
included other therapies effective for chronic mental health 
conditions common in the VA patient population (e.g., Pro-
longed Exposure Therapy for posttraumatic stress disorder). 
Eligible studies were conducted in the United States (US), 
United Kingdom (UK), Ireland, Canada, and Australia. We 
expanded the setting beyond the US to these other countries 
because of the presence of integrated health systems with 
qualities similar to VHA, and comparable economic, public 
health, and cultural contexts including the dominant English 
language. Finally, we limited eligible studies addressing key 
question 2 to those conducted within large integrated health-
care systems, as these settings may be more similar to VHA, 
compared with small community clinics. For full eligibility 
criteria, see Appendix B.

Quality Assessment and Data Abstraction

Two reviewers independently assessed quality using modi-
fied versions of the Newcastle–Ottawa  Scale31 (for quanti-
tative studies) or the Critical Skills Appraisal Programme 
(CASP)32 Checklist for qualitative studies. For studies using 
mixed methods, we used both sets of criteria as applica-
ble. We rated overall quality as high, moderate, or low; the 

consensus was reached through discussion (see Appendix C 
for detailed quality criteria and ratings for eligible studies).
Eligible studies underwent independent data abstraction 
by 2 individuals for the following: participant characteristics 
and setting (e.g., country and VHA or community clinics); 
EBP; data sources and analytic methods (e.g., semi-structured 
interviews and framework analysis, or surveys and multivari-
ate logistic regression); and outcomes. We extracted demo-
graphic data in categories consistent with the terminology 
used by the authors. We classified implementation strategies 
according to the Expert Recommendations for Implementing 
Change (ERIC) project.23,24 Most studies assessed programs 
that combined various implementation strategies, and their 
study designs did not make it possible to determine which 
outcomes resulted from individual strategies. We grouped 
studies empirically based on specific combinations of ERIC 
strategies, both to describe the relative frequencies of different 
combinations reported in eligible studies and to facilitate out-
come comparisons between similar implementation programs.
All quantitative results were abstracted by one reviewer 
and over-read by a second reviewer. Qualitative results were 
independently coded by at least 2 reviewers, with final codes 
reached by consensus. For implementation outcomes that 
support access to care, a priori codes were generated from 
the RE-AIM framework (Table 1): Reach (reaching the tar-
get population with the intervention), Effectiveness (knowing 
the intervention is effective in context), Adoption (develop-
ing staff and organizational support to deliver the interven-
tion), Implementation (ensuring the intervention is delivered 
consistently and with fidelity), and Maintenance (supporting 
intervention delivery over the long term).26 We used a best-
fit framework synthesis approach to categorize outcomes 
within the framework. For example, we categorized provider 
attitudes and self-efficacy within Adoption; these provider 
factors are important for understanding why some providers 
will (or will not) use certain EBPs.

Qualitative Synthesis

Given the heterogeneity in populations, different EBPs imple-
mented for various health conditions, and a range of study 
designs, we elected to conduct qualitative synthesis. We first 
created tables with detailed results (classified or coded as 
described above). We then grouped results for studies using 
similar ERIC strategies (or combinations thereof), reviewed 
these results within groups and across articles addressing the 
same EBP, and identified implementation outcomes within 
the RE-AIM framework. When describing the magnitude 
of standardized effect sizes (e.g., Cohen’s d or Hedge’s g) 
reported by studies, we used conventional recommendations 
for interpretations: small is less than 0.4, medium is 0.4–0.7, 
and large is greater than 0.7.33 We did not undertake a formal 
assessment of the overall certainty of evidence.

RESULTS

Overview and Characteristics of Eligible 
Studies

We screened 7295 unique citations and reviewed the full 
text of 506 articles (Fig. 1). Among 67 eligible articles, 
10 studies (reported by k = 12 articles) addressed imple-
mentation strategies for CBT (9 studies) and ACT (1 study) 
(Table 2). We did not identify any eligible study on imple-
mentation  strategies  for  MBSR.  Conditions  addressed 
included chronic pain (1 study),14 depression and/or anxiety 
(7 studies),15,18,34–39 insomnia (1 study),16,17, and PTSD (1 
study).40 Most eligible articles described studies conducted 
in the US (k = 11), with the vast majority in VHA settings 
(k = 10). Among VHA-based articles, half evaluated pre-
training to post-training outcomes following national initia-
tives to implement CBT or ACT (k = 5).14–18 Eleven articles 
were high or moderate quality, and most used quantitative 
(k = 10) or mixed methods (k = 1), with the remaining arti-
cle reporting only qualitative results. Evaluations examined 
data for providers (range 5–391) who completed training 
programs and patients (range 113–745) treated by providers 

(Table 2 and see Appendix D for detailed characteristics of 
eligible studies).

Eligible studies fell into 4 distinct groups based on com-
binations or type(s) of implementation strategies used: (1) 
training/education, facilitation, and audit/feedback; (2) 
training/education and audit/feedback; (3) training/educa-
tion; and (4) access to new funding (see Table 2 for studies 
within each group). We applied ERIC definitions to guide 
the classification of individual strategies: training/educa-
tion included workshops and other provider educational 
resources; facilitation was interactive support provided by 
internal or external individuals (e.g., resources and sup-
port provided by centralized VHA training initiatives to 
individual sites); and audit/feedback entailed the collection 
and summary of clinical performance data (e.g., fidelity 
measures, recommendations during consultation) given 
to administrators or clinicians to modify behaviors and 
enhance fidelity.23,24

We summarize evaluation outcomes reported by stud-
ies in each of these 4 groups, with further categoriza-
tion using RE-AIM (Table 3; detailed results are found 
in Appendix D).

Group 1: Training/Education, Facilitation, 
and Audit/Feedback

Six studies (k = 8 articles) evaluated VHA training programs 
for CBT (5 studies, k = 7)14–17,35–37 and ACT (1 study, k = 1),18 
using survey data from trainees and providers who completed 
training, and information about patients treated by providers 
who were trained by these programs. Four studies in this first 
group evaluated VHA national initiatives for CBT and ACT 
(k = 5 articles)14–18 that used training/education, facilitation, and 
audit/feedback (Table 2). VHA provided facilitation through 
centralized resources and support, and all initiatives involved 
structured programs of in-person workshops (2–3 days) fol-
lowed by 6 months of weekly consultation with experts. For 
consultation sessions, trainees were required to submit audio 
recordings of therapy sessions with patients, which were rated 
for fidelity. The vast majority of providers enrolled in national 
VHA training programs for CBT and ACT completed the man-
dated requirements (range 82–93%, 60–334 providers).14–18

This first group also included VHA studies of implemen-
tation efforts that were not national in scale but still involved 
structured training, facilitation, and audit/feedback.35–37 
One study included 28 mental health providers in regional 
implementations of CBT for depression (k = 2 articles).36,37 

Implementation efforts involved a 1.5-day CBT workshop 
and biweekly expert consultation group calls over 12 weeks 
post-workshop. In addition, 12 therapists at 10 sites were 
randomly  assigned  to  receive  external  facilitation,  con-
sisting of monthly meetings for 6 months.36,37 The second 
study involved 9 Primary Care Mental Health Integration 
(PCMHI) providers at 2 VHA sites (4 providers completed 
all training modules).35 This study evaluated the implemen-
tation of brief CBT in primary care for depression and anxi-
ety; online training was followed by feedback from expert 
clinicians. Project staff also engaged providers and clinic 
leadership to facilitate implementation.35

Overall, studies in this first group reported outcomes 
addressing Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and 
Maintenance; none reported on Reach (Table 3 and Appen-
dix D). For Effectiveness, most implementation programs 
led to moderate to large effects on patient symptoms and 
quality of life (Cohen’s d 0.34–2.2; Table 3 and Appendix 
D). Only the VHA study of regional implementation of 
CBT examined the effects of external facilitation inde-
pendently of training/education; this did not show added 
benefit in the use of CBT or improvement in CBT-specific 
knowledge and skills at 3 months post-workshop.37

Group 2: Training/Education and Audit/
Feedback

In  the  second  group,  2  studies  evaluated  the  impact  of 
combined training/education and audit/feedback (Table 2). 
One study randomized 139 VHA mental health providers 
to training approaches in CBT skills for PTSD: 3 internet-
based training modules only (n = 46); internet modules 
combined with 6 weekly telephone consultations (n = 42); 
or no training (n = 51).40 The other study evaluated out-
comes  for  implementing  group  CBT  for  depression  in 
US non-VA community addiction programs and involved 
training community addiction counselors to deliver group 
CBT for depression; counselors received 2 days of didac-
tic training and weekly group supervision over 2.5 years, 
including a review of audiotapes and feedback to improve 
adherence.38

Studies in this group reported outcomes addressing Reach, 
Adoption, and Implementation; neither reported on Effec-
tiveness or Maintenance (Table 3 and Appendix D).

Group 3: Training/Education

One study evaluated only training/education; this involved 
8  VHA  Substance  Use  Disorders  (SUD)  volunteer  pro-
gram counselors (at 7 VHA SUD programs) participat-
ing  in  online  modules  for  CBT  for  depression.34  This 
study reported qualitatively on Reach and Implementation 
(Table 3 and Appendix D).

Group 4: Access to New Funding

One study evaluated the impact of new financial resources 
on access to mental health treatments in primary care; this 
new funding was used differently across clinical sites and 
not associated with structured training programs or facilita-
tion.39 The study reported the experience of 2 primary care 
demonstration sites for the Improving Access to Psychologi-
cal Therapies (IAPT) initiative of the UK National Health 
Service (NHS). We focus on the results for the Newham site, 
which delivered in-person CBT for depression or anxiety

to a majority of referred patients; the other site provided 
mostly self-guided resources.39 This study reported on Reach 
and Effectiveness, indicating large reductions in depression 
and anxiety symptoms (Cohen’s d 1.06–1.26; Table 3 and 
Appendix D).

No studies in any of the four groups reported on the pro-
portions or representativeness of participating patients as 
compared to eligible patient population characteristics (ele-
ments of Reach), or on proportions or representativeness 
of participating staff and settings as compared to potential 
participating staff and settings (elements of Adoption).

DISCUSSION

In this systematic review, we identified 12 eligible stud-
ies evaluating implementation strategies to improve CBT 
and ACT access and use in large integrated healthcare sys-
tems. We found no studies evaluating the implementation of 
MBSR. Most studies were conducted in VHA and involved 
national implementation programs comprising training/edu-
cation, facilitation, and audit/feedback. These VHA studies 
focused on Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and 
Maintenance; they did not address Reach. Evaluated pro-
grams demonstrated moderate to large symptom reduction 
and improvements in quality of life for patients treated by 
trained providers. They also increased provider self-effi-
cacy, improved provider perceptions of CBT and ACT, and 
improved competency, particularly after expert consulta-
tion, suggesting an additional benefit from audit/feedback 
strategies. These national VHA initiatives also provided 
centralized facilitation resources including salary support 
for clinicians, patient-facing EBP materials and tools, and 
coordination and organizational support for training and 
problem-solving. There was very limited evidence, however, 
on whether external facilitation enhanced Adoption beyond 
the effects of training and audit/feedback. Finally, sustained 
effects of VHA national initiatives (i.e., after the consulta-
tion phase) were modest, with continued barriers to ongoing 
access and use (e.g., competing professional time demands 
and patient barriers to attending appointments).

There  is  a  clear  need  for  additional  implementation 
research focusing on MBSR, as well as evaluations of the 
implementation of CBT and ACT in non-VHA settings. In 
addition, while some results indicated that audit/feedback 
may be important for improving provider perceptions and 
skills, there was minimal evidence evaluating the impact of 
external facilitation and feedback. It may be especially cru-
cial to understand the value of these additional strategies for 
healthcare systems that have fewer resources than VHA and 
thus may lack the capacity for audit/feedback and external 
facilitation on the same scale as VHA initiatives.

Despite promising findings on effectiveness and imple-
mentation outcomes, it remains unclear whether trainings 

increased some key components of Reach and Adoption. 
Evaluations of VHA national programs did not address 
Reach (i.e., the proportion and representativeness of appro-
priate patients who initiated or completed CBT and ACT). 
Although these outcomes may be challenging to measure, 
even for large integrated systems such as VHA, it is nev-
ertheless critical to assess how many (and which) patients 
engage in these treatments. The ultimate metric for evalu-
ating implementation strategy success must be whether it 
has increased the Reach of effective treatments, leading to 
better outcomes for target patient populations. Evaluation 
of Reach across a variety of clinical settings should also 
occur in conjunction with further research into provider 
and system-level factors that contribute to differences in 
referral rates and treatment engagement. Additional work 
is needed to comprehensively assess Adoption, particularly 
the proportion or representativeness of clinical settings 
and staff that use EBPs. It will be important to determine 
whether such programs lead to improved access through 
widespread uptake by relevant staff in settings with relevant 
high needs.

While included studies noted logistical barriers to EBP 
practice for both patients and providers, strategies to address 
these were minimally evaluated. Previous work has advo-
cated patient-facing resources tailored to patient needs and 
goals (e.g., educational materials, preparatory groups) or 
additional delivery formats (beyond in-person meetings) 
and options outside the workday (e.g., asynchronous and 
telehealth  modalities).41–45  While  the  COVID-19  pan-
demic has rapidly expanded telehealth and asynchronous 
options for mental health care, additional work is needed 
to establish effectiveness, implementation outcomes, and 
equitable Reach and Adoption for specific therapies and 
conditions.41–48 Similarly, modified brief therapy protocols 
for providing CBT in primary care may increase patient 
access and use, but need additional evaluations to establish 
effects.35,49–51 It will be important to distinguish the “core” 
of essential treatment characteristics from the “adaptable 
periphery” of elements that may be modified without threat-
ening effectiveness.20,21 Given the diversity of resources, 
needs, and priorities across healthcare settings, it will also 
be important to perform local needs assessments and match 
strategies or resources to identified barriers (e.g., strategies 
to enhance leadership engagement, train local champions, 
and facilitate communication across primary care and spe-
cialty clinics).

Finally, few studies utilized comprehensive, theoretical 
frameworks for examining processes of change in imple-
mentation trials and reporting outcomes. Future implemen-
tation work should be guided by theoretical models that 
clearly designate the key domains and conceptual relation-
ships that link access barriers to strategies, thereby allowing 
systematic examination of processes of change and impor-
tant outcomes.

Our study has limitations. For greater applicability to VHA 
settings, we required that implementation studies of CBT, 
ACT, or MBSR were conducted in large integrated healthcare 
systems. Our results thus do not address the implementation of 
these EBPs in smaller community clinics or settings. We also 
limited eligibility to English-language studies conducted in 
the US or in a small set of non-US countries with comparable 
economic, cultural, and public health contexts (Canada, UK, 
Ireland, and Australia). Although implementation evidence 
from excluded countries would likely have been less directly 
applicable to the VHA setting, it is possible that this may have 
provided some relevant information.

In conclusion, this systematic review found that multi-
faceted VHA implementation programs for CBT and ACT 
led to increased provider EBP use during the interventions, 
but had unclear impacts on access and use by target patient 
populations or by key providers in high-need settings, and 
variable maintenance of adoption by providers. Additional 
work is needed to evaluate implementation programs’ Reach 
and Adoption, address maintenance of provider EBP use, 
and assess the added value of external facilitation (on top of 
education/training and audit/feedback). There is a clear need 
for implementation evaluation of MBSR for chronic pain and 
mental health conditions, and for additional research in non-
VHA settings. Future studies should apply implementation 
frameworks to guide evaluations of barriers and facilitators, 
processes of change, and outcomes in key domains.
