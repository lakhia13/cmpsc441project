ABSTRACT
Background:  While  there  are  well-established  treatments  for  post-traumatic  stress  disorder 
(PTSD),  these 
individuals  with  comorbid 
borderline  personality  disorder  (BPD)  symptoms.  Dialectical  Behavior  Therapy  (DBT)  for  PTSD 
and  DBT  Prolonged  Exposure  (PE)  are  both  effective  interventions  for  treating  these  patients, 
but a comprehensive analysis evaluating the efficacy of these two interventions is lacking.
Objective: To determine the effect sizes of PTSD-specific DBT treatments.
Methods:  We  conducted  a  systematic  review  and  pre-registered  meta-analysis  of  the  DBT 
literature  for  treating  PTSD  (osf.io/62rfq).  Eligible  trials  and  treatment  evaluations  published 
before  September  2023  were  searched  in  SCOPUS,  PubMed,  and  the  Cochrane  Library 
databases.  Thirteen  articles  were  identified,  and  data  were  extracted  for  primary  (PTSD 
symptoms)  and  secondary  outcomes  (BPD,  depression,  dissociation,  non-suicidal  self-injury 
[NSSI]).  Treatment  effects  were  calculated  for  randomised  controlled  trials,  controlled  clinical 
trials, and pre-post evaluations.
Results:  Overall,  the  studies  involved  663  participants.  Compared  with  control  groups,  PTSD- 
specific  DBT  treatments  showed  moderate  effects  in  reducing  PTSD  symptom  severity  g =  
−0.69  (95%  CI  −1.03  to  −0.34,  p < .001)  and  depression  g = −0.62  (95%  CI  −1.13  to  −0.12,  p  
= .016).  Moreover,  the  pre-post  changes  showed  an  overall  effect  size  for  dissociative 
symptoms of  g = −0.72 (95%  CI  −1.05 to −0.40, p < .001),  for BPD-associated symptoms of  g =  
−0.82  (95%  CI  −1.06  to  −0.59,  p < .001),  and  for  NSSI  frequency  (g = −0.70,  95%  CI  −1.12  to 
−0.28, p = .001).
Conclusions: Based on the results of our meta-analysis, DBT-PTSD and DBT PE were effective in 
reducing  PTSD  symptom  severity  and  comorbid  depressive  symptoms.  Further  research  on 
stage-based  treatments  should  focus  on  systematically  assessing  NSSI,  BPD  symptoms,  and 
suicidality.

Una  revisión  sistemática  y  metaanálisis  sobre la  eficacia  de  las  variantes 
de  la  terapia  dialéctica  conductual  para  el  tratamiento  del  trastorno  de 
estrés postraumático  

Antecedentes:  Aunque  existen  tratamientos  bien  establecidos  para  el  trastorno  de  estrés 
postraumático  (TEPT),  estas  intervenciones  parecen  ser  menos  efectivas  para  individuos  con 
síntomas  comórbidos  de  trastorno  límite  de  la  personalidad  (TLP).  La  terapia  dialéctica 
conductual  (DBT  por  sus  siglas  en  ingles)  para  el  TEPT  y  la  DBT  con  exposición  prolongada 
(EP)  son  intervenciones  efectivas  para  tratar  a  estos  pacientes,  pero  falta  un  análisis 
exhaustivo que evalúe la eficacia de estas dos intervenciones.
Objetivo: Determinar el tamaño del efecto de los tratamientos de DBT específicos para el TEPT.
Método:  Realizamos  una  revisión  sistemática  y  metaanálisis  pre-registrado  de  la  literatura 
sobre  DBT  para  el  tratamiento  del  TEPT  (osf.io/62rfq).  Los  ensayos  y  evaluaciones  de 
tratamiento  elegibles  publicados  antes  de  septiembre  de  2023  se  buscaron  en  las  bases  de 
datos  SCOPUS,  PubMed  y  Cochrane  Library.  Se  identificaron  trece  artículos  y  se  extrajeron 
datos  para  los  resultados  primarios  (síntomas  de  TEPT)  y  secundarios  (TLP,  depresión, 
disociación,  autolesiones  no  suicidas  [NSSI,  por  sus  siglas  en  inglés]).  Los  efectos  del 
tratamiento  se  calcularon  para  ensayos  controlados  aleatorizados,  ensayos  clínicos 
controlados y evaluaciones pre-post.

Resultados:  En  general,  los  estudios  incluyeron  a  663  participantes.  En  comparación  con  los 
grupos  de  control,  los  tratamientos  de  DBT  específicos  para  el  TEPT  mostraron  efectos 
moderados  en  la  reducción  de  la  gravedad  de  los  síntomas  del  TEPT,  con  un  g = −0,69  (IC 
95%  −1,03  a  −0,34,  p < 0,001)  y  de  la  depresión,  con  un  g = −0,62  (IC  95%  −1,13  a  −0,12,  p  
= 0,016).  Además,  los  cambios  pre-post  mostraron  un  tamaño  del  efecto  general  para  los 
síntomas  disociativos  de  g = −0,72  (IC  95%  −1,05  a  −0,40,  p < 0,001),  para  los  síntomas 
asociados  al  TLP  un g = −0,82  (IC  95% −1,06  a −0,59,  p < 0,001), y  para  la  frecuencia  de  NSSI 
(g = −0,70, IC 95% −1,12 a −0,28, p = 0,001).
Conclusión:  Según  los  resultados  de  nuestro  metaanálisis,  la  DBT-TEPT  y  la  DBT  EP  fueron 
efectivas  para  reducir  la  gravedad  de  los  síntomas  de  TEPT  y  los  síntomas  depresivos 
comórbidos.  Futuras 
investigaciones  sobre  tratamientos  basados  en  etapas  deberían 
centrarse en evaluar de forma sistemática la NSSI, los síntomas del TLP y la suicidalidad.

1.  Introduction

Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), resulting from 
direct  experiencing, witnessing,  or  repeated exposure 
to  distressing  details  of  a  potentially  traumatic  event 
like  combat,  sexual  assault,  or  serious  injury,  is  a 
severe  and  debilitating  mental  condition  with  a  life-
time prevalence of 3.9% across different nations (Koe-
nen  et  al.,  2017;  Martin  et  al.,  2021).  Symptoms 
comprise  re-experiencing,  avoidance,  hyperarousal, 
alterations  in  mood  and  cognition,  and  in  some 
cases symptoms of dissociation, including depersona-
lisation and derealization (World Health Organization 
(WHO),  2021;  American  Psychiatric  Association, 
2013).  In  the  absence  of  successful  interventions, 
PTSD frequently transitions into a chronic condition, 
marked  by  notable  psychiatric  comorbidities  and 
symptoms  (Atwoli  et  al.,  2015;  Cusack  et  al.,  2016), 
such as borderline personality disorder (BPD) (Pagura 
et  al.,  2010),  non-suicidal  self-injury  (NSSI)  (Ford  & 
Gómez, 2015) and major depression (Karatzias et al., 
2019;  Rytwinski  et  al.,  2013).  BPD  in  particular  is  a 
common  comorbidity  with  30–79%  of  patients  with 
BPD  meeting  the  criteria  for  both  disorders  and  22– 
24%  of  patients  with  PTSD  meeting  BPD  criteria 
(Frías  &  Palma,  2015;  Pagura  et  al.,  2010).  A  shared 
risk factor for both disorders is interpersonal trauma, 
although  individuals  with  comorbid  PTSD  and  BPD 
have been found to be exposed to more interpersonal 
trauma in their lifetime than individuals with PTSD or 
BPD  alone (Jowett,  Karatzias, and Albert, 2020). The 
comorbidity of PTSD and BPD presents a severe clini-
cal  condition,  which  is  associated  with  diminished 
quality  of  life,  increased  likelihood  of  depression, 
and  lifetime  suicide  attempts  (Barnicot  &  Priebe, 
2013; Jowett, Karatzias, & Albert, 2020; Pagura et al., 
2010;  Zeifman  et  al.,  2021).  Among  evidence-based 
psychological  treatments  for  PTSD,  trauma-focused 
interventions,  aiming  at  processing  traumatic  mem-
ories and rooted in exposure principles, are considered 
first-line treatments and more efficacious in reducing 
PTSD  symptoms  compared  to  non-trauma-focused 
interventions  (Bennett  et  al.,  2016;  Ehring  et  al., 
2014;  Lewis  et  al.,  2020).  However,  none  of  these 

treatments specifically target the symptoms of comor-
bid  BPD  (Harned  et  al.,  2014)  which  include  intense 
unstable 
insecure 
interpersonal  relationships,  an 
sense of self, intense and volatile emotions, as well as 
self-harm  (Copeland  et  al.,  2014;  Gunderson  et  al., 
2018). Moreover, since acute  suicidality and  insecure 
life  situations  are  contradictions  for  trauma-focused 
treatment, a significant number of patients with BPD 
are  not  recommended  this  treatment  due  to  the 
expected risk of symptom exacerbation regarding sui-
cidality and NSSI (Frías & Palma, 2015; Harned 2014). 
Conversely, an effective treatment for BPD is dialecti-
cal  behaviour  therapy  (DBT)  (Barnicot  &  Crawford, 
2019;  Linehan,  1993)  which  also  effectively  reduces 
self-harm  (DeCou  et  al.,  2019;  Kothgassner  et  al., 
2021) and externalising symptoms (Jakubovic & Dra-
bick,  2023;  Prillinger  et  al.,  2023).  However,  individ-
uals  with  PTSD  and  BPD  tend  to  show  a  reduced 
response to DBT and less reduction in self-harm (Bar-
nicot & Priebe, 2013).

treatments  with  different 

Regarding  this  difficult-to-treat  clinical  presen-
tation  of  PTSD  and  comorbid  BPD  symptoms,  the 
emerging  consensus  in  the  field  recommends  inte-
systematically 
grated 
ordered  symptom-focused  phases  as  the  optimal 
approach,  enabling  concurrent  targeting  of  multiple 
problems  in  the  same  treatment  (Bohus  et  al.,  2019; 
Harned  et  al.,  2021;  Livesley,  2012;  Rozek  et  al., 
2022;  Zeifman  et  al.,  2021).  In  line  with  these  rec-
ommendations  are  two  interventions  based  on  DBT, 
namely  DBT  for  PTSD  (DBT-PTSD)  (Steil  et  al., 
2011)  and  DBT  Prolonged  Exposure  (DBT  PE) 
(Harned, 2022) which represent the empirically most 
supported  modular  staged-based  interventions  for 
PTSD and  comorbid  BPD  symptoms. They  explicitly 
allow the inclusion of patients exhibiting self-injuring 
behaviour  (Bohus  et  al.,  2011,  2020;  Harned  et  al., 
2012,  2021).  When  specific  predetermined  criteria 
are met throughout the treatments, such as the effec-
tive  regulation  of  stressful  emotions  and  gaining 
sufficient control over higher-priority behaviours like 
suicidality,  trauma-focused  treatment  elements  are 
implemented  (Zeifman  et  al.,  2021).  Research  on 

these stage-based treatments suggests their safety and 
efficacy for PTSD and some studies also show efficacy 
in reducing BPD pathology, potentially outperforming 
BPD-specific  or 
for 
comorbid PTSD and  BPD symptoms (Zeifman et al., 
2021).

trauma-focused  approaches 

and 

therapy, 

DBT-PTSD  (Bohus  &  Priebe,  2018;  Steil  et  al., 
2011)  is  a  modification  of  DBT  including  methods 
from  cognitive  behavioural  therapy,  acceptance  and 
compassion-focused 
commitment 
therapy  (Bohus  et  al.,  2019).  Originally  developed  as 
a specialised 12-week residential programme for indi-
viduals with childhood sexual abuse-related PTSD and 
emotion dysregulation (Bohus et al., 2019; Steil et al., 
2011),  DBT-PTSD  has  since  been  adapted  for  use  in 
outpatient  settings,  with  programmes  extending  up 
to 15 months (Bohus et al., 2020). In DBT-PTSD, skills 
learned  during  the  programme  are  integrated  into 
trauma  exposure  interventions  to  address  symptoms 
common  in  BPD,  like  emotional  over-engagement 
and  dissociation  to  increase  effectiveness,  safety,  and 
acceptance of exposure-based strategies. The exposure 
protocol  enables  patients  to  manage  the  intensity  of 
memory  activation  using  these  learned  skills,  both 
during sessions and homework. DBT-PTSD objectives 
comprise  (1)  mitigating  patients’  fear  of  primary 
emotions  associated  with  trauma,  (2)  examining  sec-
ondary  emotions  such  as  guilt  and  shame,  and  (3) 
radically  accepting  trauma  facts.  While  the  termin-
ation  of  non-life-threatening  self-harm  is  not  obliga-
tory 
exposure 
techniques  (Bohus  et  al.,  2013),  priority  is  given  to 
addressing  life-threatening  or  crisis-inducing  behav-
iour whenever it arises, as well as to therapy-interfer-
ing behaviours.

trauma 

before 

The second intervention, DBT PE, was specifically 
developed  for  co-occurring  chronic  PTSD  in  BPD 
patients  (Harned,  2022;  Harned  &  Linehan,  2008).  It 
combines  a  prolonged  exposure  (PE)  protocol  (Foa, 
2011)  with  ongoing  standard  DBT  and  integrates 
methods  tailored  to  the  needs  of  individuals  with 
BPD (Harned et al., 2012). DBT + DBT PE is typically 
implemented as outpatient treatment with a duration 
of  over  a  year  (Harned  et  al.,  2012,  2014,  2021),  but 
also  administered  in  a  shorter  form  with  a  duration 
of 12 weeks (Meyers et al., 2017). PE is a highly effec-
tive and evidence-based trauma treatment programme 
for  PTSD  (Foa,  2011;  Foa  et  al.,  2019)  aiming  to 
enhance the emotional processing of traumatic experi-
ences  by  systematically  and  gradually  confronting 
individuals in vivo and in sensu to trauma-associated 
stimuli (Foa, 2011; Harned et al., 2012). Strategies and 
techniques from DBT were integrated into PE with the 
following objectives: (1) enhance monitoring of poten-
tial  adverse  reactions  to  exposure,  such  as  pre-  and 
post-exposure  ratings  of  suicidal  urges,  (2)  address 
problems  that  may  arise  during  or  as  a  consequence

of  exposure  using  DBT  skills  and  protocols,  and  (3) 
incorporating  DBT  therapist  strategies  tailored  to 
meet  the  specific  needs  of  patients  with  BPD.  The 
PE  protocol  also  outlines  procedures  for  addressing 
higher-priority behaviours that may exacerbate during 
treatment,  including  a  stipulation  that  the  protocol 
should  be  paused,  if  intentional  self-injury  reoccurs 
(Harned et al., 2012).

In  summary,  evidence-based  DBT  interventions 
that incorporate trauma-specific exposure techniques, 
such as DBT-PTSD or DBT PE, appear promising in 
addressing the complex clinical conditions of individ-
uals with comorbid PTSD and BPD. However, a com-
prehensive analysis assessing the efficacy of these two 
interventions is lacking. The current systematic review 
and meta-analysis aim to fill this gap. Considering the 
complexity  of  the  clinical  presentation  in  individuals 
with  PTSD  and  BPD,  we  evaluate  the  efficacy  of 
DBT  modifications  in  reducing  symptoms  of  PTSD 
(primary  outcome),  as  well  as  BPD,  dissociation, 
NSSI frequency, and depression (secondary outcomes) 
in  randomised  controlled  trials  (RCTs),  controlled 
clinical trials (CCTs), and pre-post-evaluation studies.

2. Method

2.1.  Search  strategy

This  meta-analysis  was  preregistered  with  the  Open 
Science  Framework  (https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF. 
IO/62RFQ) and followed the PRISMA 2020 guidelines 
for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (Page et al., 
2021)  (see  Supplement  1  for  the  PRISMA  checklist). 
We  searched  SCOPUS,  PubMed,  and  the  Cochrane 
Library  using  the  keywords:  ‘Dialectical  Behavioral 
Therapy’  OR  ‘DBT’  AND  ‘Post-traumatic  stress*’ 
from the beginning of database records until Septem-
ber  2023.  Studies  were  eligible  to  be  included  in  the 
meta-analysis  if  they  (1)  were  classified  as  RCTs, 
CCTs, or pre-post evaluations of DBT-PTSD or DBT 
PE  protocols,  (2)  reported  symptom  severity  scores 
for  PTSD  at  baseline  and  post-treatment,  and  (3) 
included  clinical  samples.  No  limitations  on  partici-
pant age, publication status, or language were applied 
while searching for literature.

2.2.  Data  extraction  and  coding

Data  from  the  included  articles  were  entered  into  a 
spreadsheet  independently  by  three  authors  (ODK, 
KP, and CHG), who discussed and resolved any differ-
ences  after  completing  the  coding  process.  Study 
characteristics  for  each  study,  including  descriptions 
of the samples (e.g. sample size, age, gender, and drop-
outs for the DBT and control groups) were noted. We 
then aimed to extract treatment completer data for our 
primary  outcome’s  (PTSD  symptoms)  means  and

standard deviations and secondary outcomes (i.e. BPD 
symptoms  and  depressive  symptoms,  dissociative 
symptoms,  and  NSSI  frequency)  whenever  they  were 
assessed and reported. Data from one article (Harned 
et al., 2018) was extracted using plot digitiser software 
(PlotDigitizer: Version 3.1.5, 2024).

2.3.  Data  analysis

All  analyses  were  conducted  using  the  R  package 
metafor  (Viechtbauer,  2010).  To evaluate  the  efficacy 
of  DBT  variants in reducing the primary  outcome as 
well  as  secondary  outcomes  in  contrast  to  control 
treatments,  we  calculated  the  standardised  mean 
difference (Hedge’s g) using post-intervention scores. 
These  calculations  were  derived  from  the  means  and 
standard  deviations  of  DBT  and  control  groups.  For 
our analysis of the pre-to-post effects, we again calcu-
lated  Hedge’s  g  for  each  intervention.  This  was  done 
by  comparing  the  means  and  standard  deviations 
before  and  after  DBT-specific  interventions  by  using 
the  formula  g = (MPost  –  MPre)/SDpooled,  where  MPost 
represents  the  post-intervention  mean  score,  MPre  is 
the  pre-intervention  mean  score,  and  SDpooled  is  the 
pooled  standard  deviation  of  both  time  points. 
The  SDpooled  was  determined  using  the  formula 
2)/2) (Lakens, 2013). 
2 + SDPost
SDpooled = SQRT((SDPre
Additionally, we conducted subgroup analyses separ-
ately for DBT-PTSD and DBT PE studies.

We subsequently utilised random-effects models to 
synthesise aggregated effect sizes and following estab-
lished benchmarks (Cohen, 1988), an effect size of 0.20 
was  classified  as  small,  0.50  as  medium,  and  0.80  as 
large.  To  quantify  the  variability  in  study  results,  we 
reported  heterogeneity  using  I2  values,  interpreting 
25%  as  low  heterogeneity,  50%  as  moderate,  and 
75%  as  high  heterogeneity  (Higgins  et  al.,  2003).  All 
data  and  codes  are  stored  in  a  repository  of  the 
Open  Science  Framework  (doi:10.17605/OSF.IO/ 
RX35A).

2.4.  Risk  of  bias  assessments

The risk of bias for each study was assessed using pre-
defined  criteria  based  on  the  Agency  for  Healthcare 
Research and Quality method guide (see Supplement 
1; Viswanathan et al. [2018]). Each study was assessed 
regarding randomisation, selection and attrition bias, 
confounding  bias,  measurement  bias,  and  statistical 
problems,  and  received  a  rating  of  low,  moderate,  or 
high risk of bias. A low risk of bias indicates that the 
study was judged to be valid, moderate risk indicates 
concerns  that  probably  do  not  invalidate  the  study’s 
results,  and  a  high  risk  of  bias  indicates  significant 
concerns  that  likely  invalidate  the  study’s  results. 
independently 
Two 

investigators  (SF  and  AM) 

assessed  the  studies,  and  differences  were  reviewed 
until a consensus was reached.

3. Results

The  literature  search  initially  identified  253  articles 
from  databases  and  two  articles  from  other  sources. 
After  removing  duplicates,  224  articles  were  found. 
The  title,  abstract,  and  main  text  of  each  study  were 
independently  examined  by  two  authors  (ODK  and 
CHG) (see supplement for details of reasons for exclu-
sion).  After  the  screening,  13  articles  were  identified 
and included in the present study, 11 original studies 
and  2  secondary  analyses  with  unpublished  data  (see 
Figure 1).

3.1.  Study  characteristics

Overall  and  at  enrolment,  the  11  original  studies 
included  a  total  of  N = 663,  which  comprised  N =  
403  participants  with  PTSD  who  received  DBT- 
PTSD (n = 327) or DBT PE (n = 76) and N = 260 par-
ticipants  with  PTSD  in  control  conditions  (n = 28 
regular  DBT,  n = 135  treatment  as  usual  [TAU],  and 
n = 97  cognitive  processing  therapy).  The  completer 
rate  was  71%  in  PTSD-specific  DBT  interventions; 
this  resulted  in  a  final  sample  size  of  N = 287  (n =  
241  DBT-PTSD,  n = 46  DBT  PE).  For  control  con-
ditions,  the  completer  rate  was  relatively  similar 
(64%), and N = 166 was the final sample size for con-
trols  (n = 19  regular  DBT,  n = 89  TAU,  n = 58  cogni-
tive  processing  therapy).  Five  studies  conducted 
control  groups:  in  two  studies  the  control  group 
received  regular  DBT  (Harned  et  al.,  2014,  2021);  in 
two  studies  the  control  group  received  TAU,  which 
included  6  months  of  any  treatment  of  their  choice 
except  for  DBT-PTSD  (Bohus  et  al.,  2013)  or  a  high 
variety  of  trauma-specific  therapies  depending  on 
patient  and  type  of  trauma  (Oppenauer  et  al.,  2023), 
and in one study the control group received cognitive 
processing  therapy  (Bohus  et  al.,  2020).  Participants 
were diagnosed with PTSD after experiencing various 
forms  of  trauma,  such  as  sexual  abuse  or  physical 
abuse in childhood, partner violence, adult rape, wit-
nessing  family  violence,  the  suicide  of  a  parent,  and 
veteran trauma. However, ten of the included studies 
encompassed  samples  who  primarily  experienced 
childhood  trauma  (sexual,  physical,  or  both).  One 
study  (Meyers  et  al.,  2017)  investigated  veteran 
trauma. Participants were required to have a diagnosis 
of PTSD based on DSM-IV or DSM-V criteria. A large 
proportion of the participants had experienced several 
traumas  over  a  longer  period.  All  studies  were  pub-
lished  in  peer-reviewed  journals  in  English  or  Ger-
man,  and  involved  participants  between  the  ages  of 
12–60;  whereas  adolescents  were  included  in  two 
studies  (Cornelisse  et  al.,  2021;  Harned  et  al.,  2021).

2021), the effect size  was g = −0.80 (95% CI  −1.48 to 
−0.12).  Regarding  within-subject  changes,  we  also 
computed  pre-post  changes  in  PTSD-specific  DBT 
treatments  alone  to  have  another  indicator  of  the 
efficacy  magnitude.  This  meta-analysis  of  pre-post 
comparisons  revealed  that  PTSD  symptom  severity 
was reduced by g = −1.30 (95% CI −1.53 to −1.08, p  
< .001)  in  all  PTSD-specific  DBT  treatments  (see 
Figure  2B).  In  DBT-PTSD  specifically,  the  pre-post 
reduction  was  g = −1.23  (95%  CI  −1.47  to  −1.00), 
and  in  DBT  PE,  the  decline  was  g = −1.84  (95%  CI 
−2.51 to −1.17).

Five therapies were conducted in an outpatient setting 
(Cohen, 1988; Harned et al., 2012, 2014; Lakens, 2013; 
Viswanathan et al., 2018), four in an inpatient setting 
(Bohus et al., 2013; Görg et al., 2019; Oppenauer et al., 
2023; Steil et al., 2011), one in a partial hospitalisation 
setting (Cornelisse et al., 2021), and one included out-
patient  and  inpatient  agencies  (Harned  et  al.,  2021). 
The  studies  using  DBT-PTSD  were  conducted  in 
Germany  and  Austria  and  the  studies  using  DBT  PE 
were  conducted  in  the  United  States  of  America.  See

PTSD  symptom  severity

3.3.  Efficacy  of  PTSD-specific  DBT  regarding 
borderline-personality  disorder  symptoms

Three  RCTs  (Bohus  et  al.,  2013,  2020;  Harned  et  al., 
2014) and two CCTs (Harned et al., 2021; Oppenauer 
et al., 2023) were analysed to compare the efficacy of 
PTSD-specific  DBT  regarding PTSD symptom  sever-
ity. The meta-analysis yielded an overall effect of g =  
−0.69 (95% CI  −1.03 to −0.34, p < .001) in favour  of 
both  trauma-focused  DBT  treatments  over  control 
conditions  (see  Figure  2A  for  forest  plot).  For  DBT- 
PTSD  (Bohus  et  al.,  2013,  2020;  Oppenauer  et  al., 
2023), the  effect size was g = −0.67 (95% CI −1.13 to 
−0.22),  whereas  for  DBT  PE  (Harned  et  al.,  2014, 

Similarly,  we  analysed  two  RCTs  (Bohus  et  al.,  2013, 
2020) and two CCTs (Harned et al., 2018; Oppenauer 
et al., 2023) to compare the efficacy of PTSD-specific 
DBT regarding BPD symptoms. Meta-analysis yielded 
an overall effect of g = −0.61 (95% CI −1.38 to 0.17, p  
= .126)  favouring  both  trauma-focused  DBT  treat-
ments over control conditions (see Figure 3A for for-
est  plot).  For  DBT-PTSD  (Bohus  et  al.,  2013,  2020; 
Oppenauer  et  al.,  2023),  the  effect  size  was  g = −0.32 
(95%  CI  −0.97  to  0.33),  and  for  DBT-PE  (Harned 
et  al.,  2018),  the  effect  size  was  g = −1.73  (95%  CI

thus, trauma-focused DBT-treatments were not more 
effective  in  reducing  BPD  symptoms  than  control 
treatments.  However,  the  meta-analysis  of  pre-post 
comparisons showed that BPD symptoms were signifi-
cantly reduced by g = −0.82 (95% CI −1.06 to −0.58, p  
< .001) (see Figure 3B). In DBT-PTSD specifically, the 
pre-post  reduction  was  g = −0.82  (95%  CI  −1.06  to 
−0.57),  and  in  DBT  PE,  the  reduction  was  g = −0.89 
(95%  CI  −1.65  to  −0.13).  Please  note  that  N  for  this 
analysis varied slightly because the secondary analysis 
publication  providing  BPD  outcomes  (Harned  et  al., 

2018) employed different criteria for defining partici-
pants  as  completers  compared  to  the  original  studies 
(Harned et al., 2012, 2014).

3.4.  Efficacy  of  PTSD-specific  DBT  regarding 
depressive  symptoms

Three  RCTs  (Bohus  et  al.,  2013,  2020;  Harned  et  al., 
2014) and one CCT (Oppenauer et al., 2023) were ana-
lysed  to  compare  the  efficacy  of  PTSD-specific  DBT 
compared  to  control  conditions  regarding  depressive 
symptoms  (see  also  Table  2).  This  meta-analysis

yielded an overall effect of g = −0.62 (95% CI −1.13 to 
−0.12, p = .016) in favour of both DBT-specific treat-
ments  over  control  conditions.  For  DBT-PTSD 
(Bohus  et  al.,  2013,  2020;  Oppenauer  et  al.,  2023), 
the  effect  size  was  g = −0.57  (95%  CI  −1.15  to  0.01), 
whereas  for  DBT  PE  (Harned  et  al.,  2014),  the  effect 
size  was  g = −1.03  (95%  CI  −2.29  to  0.23).  We  again 
also  computed  pre-post  changes  in  PTSD-specific 
DBT treatments for depressive symptoms. The meta- 
analysis  of  pre-post  comparisons  revealed 
that 
depressive  symptoms  were  reduced  by  g = −1.02

(95% CI −3.02 to −0.13).

3.5.  Efficacy  of  PTSD-specific  DBT  regarding 
dissociative  symptoms

Two RCTs (Bohus et al., 2013; Harned et al., 2014) and 
two CCTs (Harned et al., 2021; Oppenauer et al., 2023) 
were scrutinised to assess the efficacy of PTSD-specific 
DBT about dissociative symptoms (refer to Table 2 for 
further  details).  This  meta-analysis  unveiled  an 
insignificant  overall  effect  size  of  g = −0.17  (95%  CI

−0.49  to  0.15,  p = .303).  When  focusing  on  DBT- 
PTSD  (Bohus  et  al.,  2013;  Oppenauer  et  al.,  2023), 
the  effect  size  amounted  to  g = −0.10  (95%  CI  −0.46 
to  0.26),  while  DBT  PE  (Harned et  al.,  2014;  Harned 
et  al.,  2021)  exhibited  an  effect  size  of  g = −0.38 
(95%  CI  −1.05  to  0.28).  Thus,  both  DBT  variants 
were not more effective in reducing dissociative symp-
toms  than  control  treatments.  The  meta-analysis  of 
pre-post  comparisons,  in  contrast,  showed  a  signifi-
cant  reduction  in  dissociative  symptoms  with  an 
effect  size  of  g = −0.72  (95%  CI  −1.05  to  −0.39,  p  
< .001)  across  all  PTSD-specific  DBT  treatments.  For 
DBT-PTSD  the  pre–post  reduction  effect  size  was  g  
= −0.62  (95%  CI  −1.00  to  −0.25),  while  for  DBT  PE 
the reduction yielded an effect size of g = −1.05 (95% 
CI −1.73 to −0.37).

3.6.  Efficacy  of  PTSD-specific  DBT  regarding 
NSSI  frequency

One RCT (Harned et al., 2014) and one CCT (Harned 
et  al.,  2021)  were  analysed  to  assess  the  efficacy  of 
PTSD-specific  DBT  in  relation  to  NSSI  frequency 
(see Table 2 for details). These studies showed an over-
all effect size of g = −0.91 (95% CI −1.60 to −0.22, p  
= .010),  which  suggests  that  DBT  PE  might  signifi-
cantly  reduce  NSSI  frequency  when  compared  to

control  conditions,  considering  the  limitation  of  the 
available data. The meta-analysis of pre–post compari-
sons  revealed  a  reduction  in  NSSI  frequency  with  an 
effect  size  g = −0.70  (95%  CI  −1.12  to  −0.28,  p  
= .0018). Three studies included in this pre–post com-
parison were DBT PE treatments specifically (Harned 
et  al.,  2012,  2014,  2021),  which  showed  a  pre–post 
effect  of  g = −0.89  (95%  CI  −1.55  to  −0.23),  while 
one  DBT-PTSD  intervention  (Krüger  et  al.,  2014) 
had an effect of g = −0.57 (95% CI −1.12 to −0.02).

3.7.  Risk  of  bias

The risk of bias assessment revealed that ten of the ele-
ven included studies (91%) were classified as having a 
moderate  overall  risk  of  bias,  while  the  remaining 
study  (9%)  was  rated  as  high  (see  Table  S3).  Among 
the  three  RCTs  included  in  the  analysis,  randomis-
ation  bias  was  noted  to  be  moderate  in  two  studies 
(67%)  and  low  in  one  study  (33%).  Selection  bias 
was identified as high in two studies (18%), moderate 
in seven studies (64%), and low in two studies (18%). 
Confounding bias was generally low across the studies, 
with one study (9%) rated as high, three studies (27%) 
as moderate, and seven studies (64%) as low. Measure-
ment bias was found to be low, with two studies (18%) 
rated as moderate and nine (82%) rated as low, due to 
the common use of standardised measurement instru-
ments.  However,  statistical  problems  were  more 
prevalent, as some of the included studies were under-
powered.  Two  studies  (18%)  were  rated  as  having  a 
high risk of bias and eight (73%) as moderate, leaving 
only one study (9%) rated as low in this regard.

4. Discussion

Given  the  existing  research  gap  regarding  a  compre-
hensive  analysis  of  the  efficacy  of  trauma-specific 
DBT  interventions  in  reducing  PTSD  symptoms  and 
comorbid  psychopathology  in  patients  with  PTSD 
and  BPD,  we  conducted  a  systematic  review  and 
meta-analysis 
to  guide  evidence-based  clinical 
decision-making.  Our  meta-analysis,  which  includes 
13  studies  involving  663  participants,  provides  evi-
dence  supporting  the  efficacy  of  both  interventions, 
DBT-PTSD  and  DBT  PE,  in  reducing  PTSD  severity 
and  depression  with  moderate  effects  compared  to 
control  interventions.  While  the  efficacy  of  the  two 
trauma-specific DBT treatments showed no significant 
difference, we report large within-group reductions in 
PTSD symptoms across DBT variants, with Hedge’s g 
averaging −1.30. However, when compared to control 
conditions,  the  effect  size  is  smaller  (g = −0.69).  This 
effect  size  is  also  smaller  compared  to  results  from 
meta-analyses  on  trauma-focused  treatments,  which 
report  standardised  mean  differences  of  −1.46  for 
trauma-focused  CBT,  −1.22  for  non-trauma-focused 

10

CBT,  and  −1.19  for  interpersonal  psychotherapy,  all 
compared  to  a  waitlist  control  group  (Mavranezouli 
et  al.,  2020)  and  −1.22  for  CBT  without  a  trauma 
focus  versus  supportive  counselling  (Lewis  et  al., 
2020). The observed smaller effect size could be attrib-
uted to the comparison with guideline-recommended 
treatments,  which  are  effective  and  thus  set  a  higher 
bar for demonstrating additional benefits. This discre-
pancy  might  also  be  attributed  to  the  high  levels  of 
impairment  and  problematic  clinical  features  associ-
ated  with  co-occurring  PTSD  and  BPD  symptoms  of 
the  included  samples,  which  render  the  treatment 
more complex (Cackowski et al., 2016; Harned et al., 
2010;  Krause-Utz,  2021;  Marshall-Berenz  et  al., 
2011).  Moreover,  individuals  with  comorbid  PTSD 
and BPD are more likely to report a history of child-
hood abuse, neglect, and extensive poly-victimization, 
compared  to  those  with  a  PTSD  diagnosis,  which 
additionally influences treatment approaches and out-
comes (Ford & Courtois, 2021; Frost et al., 2020).

Our  findings  highlight  the  potential  of  PTSD- 
specific  DBT  to  simultaneously  improve  PTSD  and 
depressive  symptoms.  This  is  in  line  with  existing 
meta-analyses  which 
that  evidence-based 
found 
PTSD  treatments  and  DBT  interventions  for  adoles-
cents  are effective  in  alleviating comorbid  depression 
(Cook & Gorraiz, 2016; Ronconi et al., 2015). Future 
research  should  examine 
interplay  among 
depression, PTSD, and BPD symptoms in influencing 
treatment  outcomes  to  inform  tailored  therapeutic 
approaches.

the 

Further,  our  results  showed  that  trauma-specific 
DBT  reduced  BPD  symptoms  with  a  large  effect  size 
(g = −0.82),  however,  it  was  not  more  effective  than 
control  treatments.  This  aligns  with  a  recent  meta- 
analysis  evaluating  psychotherapeutic  PTSD  treat-
ments for patients with personality disorders (Slotema 
et  al.,  2020), which  reported no  significant change  in 
BPD symptoms when compared to control conditions. 
However, when including nonrandomized-controlled 
and  uncontrolled  studies,  significant  improvements 
for  all  outcomes  (including  depression,  anxiety,  bor-
derline  symptoms,  and  PTSD)  were  found.  Notably, 
studies  with  patients  having  diverse  personality  dis-
orders  reported  higher  PTSD  symptom  reduction 
than  those  focusing  solely  on  BPD  (Slotema  et  al., 
2020).  Our  results  differ  from  the  moderate  effect 
size  obtained  in  a  meta-analysis  comparing  DBT  to 
control  conditions  in  reducing  BPD  symptoms  (Oud 
et  al.,  2018).  One  explanation  could  be  the  complex 
symptomatology of the included samples, comprising 
individuals  with  both  BPD  and  PTSD,  which  show  a 
tendency for more severe BPD symptoms throughout 
treatment than patients without comorbid PTSD (Bar-
nicot  &  Priebe,  2013).  Additionally,  some  studies 
included participants without a formal BPD diagnosis 
(Bohus et al., 2020; Görg et al., 2019; Steil et al., 2011). 

Our  meta-analysis  could  also  include  patients  with 
complex  PTSD,  who  share  some  BPD  symptoms  but 
exhibit treatment-relevant differences that could con-
tribute  to  limited  improvement  in  BPD  symptoms 
(Cloitre,  2020;  Ford  &  Courtois,  2021;  Jowett,  Karat-
zias,  Shevlin,  et  al.,  2020).  This  variability  in  patient 
profiles could significantly impact treatment outcomes 
and  the  interpretation  of  results.  Further,  emotional 
numbing,  commonly  observed  in  individuals  with 
PTSD,  can  potentially  present  added  difficulties  for 
patients  with  comorbid  PTSD  and  BPD  in  terms  of 
recognising emotional distress and effectively employ-
ing DBT skills which are integral components of DBT 
and  crucial  for  the  improvement  of  BPD  symptoms 
(Barnicot & Priebe, 2013).

Similarly,  our  examination  of  dissociative  symp-
toms,  in  contrast  to  control  conditions,  yielded  non- 
significant  effects  whereas  in  pre-post  comparisons 
PTSD-specific  DBT  treatments  revealed  moderate  to 
high  effect  sizes.  This  constitutes  a  notable  finding 
considering  discourse  positing  that  individuals  with 
dissociation  may  derive  the  most  benefit  from  stage- 
based  treatments  (Cloitre  et  al.,  2012;  Steele  et  al., 
2005).  While  no  direct  comparison  of  the  two 
PTSD-specific  DBT  interventions  exists,  DBT-PTSD 
has  been  compared  with  guideline-recommended 
PTSD  interventions,  specifically  cognitive  processing 
therapy  (Bohus  et  al.,  2020)  and  various  trauma- 
specific  therapies  (Oppenauer  et  al.,  2023),  whereas 
DBT  PE  has  been  compared  with  DBT  (Harned 
et  al.,  2014,  2021),  the  first-line  treatment  for  BPD. 
Both  interventions  showed  efficacy  over  their  com-
parators,  highlighting  the  stage-based  treatments’ 
superiority. The lack of significant differences in out-
comes  related  to  BPD  and  dissociation  symptoms 
when comparing PTSD-specific DBT variants to con-
trols could be attributed to the efficacy of the compari-
son  treatments.  Given  that  DBT-PTSD  and  DBT  PE 
include either standard or a modification of DBT, an 
improvement  in  BPD-related  symptoms  is  expected 
(Bagley,  2022;  Dimeff  &  Linehan,  2001).  Similarly, 
reductions in dissociation symptoms have been docu-
mented  with  both  standard  DBT  and  various  PTSD 
interventions (Atchley & Bedford, 2021; Bohus et al., 
2000),  providing  a  possible  explanation  for  the  non- 
significant  differences  observed  with  PTSD-specific 
DBT variants.

Regarding  NSSI  frequency,  two  DBT  PE  studies 
found  a  significant  and  large  reduction  (g = −0.91) 
when  compared  to  the  control  group.  This  indicates 
the intervention’s efficacy in diminishing NSSI symp-
toms and underscores its safety for patients with PTSD 
and  comorbid  BPD  symptoms.  Our  observed  effect 
size  for  reducing  NSSI  was  notably  higher  than  that 
reported  in  a  meta-analysis  (g = 0.32)  (Cristea  et  al., 
2017),  which  compared  psychotherapies  and  control 
conditions  for  adults  with  BPD,  and  superior  to  a 

study on EMDR in patients with BPD, which reported 
no  changes  in  NSSI  outcomes  (Slotema  et  al.,  2019). 
For  DBT-PTSD,  a  medium  pre-post  reduction  in 
NSSI frequency was found. It needs to be mentioned 
that the studies analysed in the current meta-analysis 
used  different  inclusion  criteria  regarding  self-harm 
and  suicidality.  Some  focused solely  on  patients  with 
recent  or  imminent  suicidal  behaviour  or  severe 
NSSI (Harned et al., 2012, 2014), but required specific 
criteria for starting the DBT PE part, such as no immi-
nent risk of suicide or ability to control self-injurious 
behaviour urges when confronted  with cues (Harned 
et  al.,  2012,  2014,  2021).  Further,  certain  studies 
included individuals with ongoing self-harm or other 
high-risk  behaviours  but  excluded  those  with  life- 
threatening  behaviour 
in  the  preceding  months 
(Bohus  et  al.,  2013,  2020;  Oppenauer  et  al.,  2023; 
Steil et al., 2018). These differences limit the compar-
ability  of  the  results  and  might  make  treatments  less 
accessible  for  some  severely  ill  individuals  with 
PTSD and BPD symptoms.

Apart from the included interventions, other treat-
ments  such  as  brief  intensive  trauma-focused  treat-
ment  programmes  including  EMDR  and  PE  therapy 
showed  feasibility  and  safety  for  PTSD  patients  with 
BPD symptoms (De Jongh et al., 2020; Van Wouden-
berg  et  al.,  2018).  An  eight-day  intervention  without 
any  form  of  stabilisation  before  the  trauma-focused 
elements showed a decrease in PTSD and BPD symp-
toms in individuals with PTSD and BPD alongside low 
dropout rates (De Jongh et al., 2020). However, a com-
parative  study  in  patients  with  complex  PTSD  invol-
ving  a  stage-based  treatment  that  combined  skills 
training  with  narrative  therapy  did  not  demonstrate 
superiority  over  non-stage-based  interventions  such 
as PE and skills training alone (Sele et al., 2023). Simi-
lar  findings  were  observed  in  patients  with  PTSD 
related  to  childhood  abuse  when  comparing  a  stage- 
based  treatment  including  skills  training  and  PE  to 
PE  and  intensified  PE  (Oprel  et  al.,  2021).  These 
results  underscore  the  necessity  for  future  research 
to 
investigate  which  patient  populations  might 
benefit  most  from  stage-based  versus  non-stage- 
based  therapeutic  approaches,  enhancing  our  under-
standing of personalised treatment efficacy.

Our  meta-analysis  of  PTSD-specific  DBT  treat-
ments  revealed heterogeneous  dropout  rates between 
12.8% (Cornelisse et al., 2021) at a part-stationary ado-
lescent treatment centre and 48.7% (Oppenauer et al., 
2023) in a clinical setting at a residential mental health 
centre, whereas one study (Steil et al., 2011) at a PTSD 
residential treatment unit reported no dropouts. Over-
all,  the  studies  have  comparable  dropout  rates  for 
DBT-PTSD  (0–48.7%)  and  DBT  PE  (23.1–41.2%) 
with  some  studies  specifically  reporting  no  dropouts 
during  the  exposure  intervention  (Harned  et  al., 
2012; Meyers et al., 2017; Steil et al., 2018). However,

on  average,  DBT-PTSD  treatments  were  shorter  and 
had a lower dropout rate.

Upcoming studies on these stage-based treatments 
should investigate the effects of self-harm, suicidality, 
and BPD symptom severity on treatment outcomes as 
well as self-harm urges after trauma exposure sessions. 
This is of particular interest as this patient group fre-
quently faces challenges in accessing PTSD treatment 
due to self-harming behaviour and suicidality (Frías & 
Palma, 2015; Harned 2014). An additional restraint is 
that the number of individuals with BPD included in 
the study samples varies. While some studies required 
a  formal  diagnosis  of  BPD  as  an  inclusion  criterion, 
for example (Harned et al., 2012, 2014), other studies 
included  patients  who  met  varying  numbers  of  BPD 
criteria,  for  example  (Oppenauer  et  al.,  2023;  Steil 
et al., 2018).

Further limitations comprise the uneven number of 
included  studies  and  patients  that  have  either  exam-
ined the efficacy of DBT-PTSD or DBT PE as well as 
the diverse designs of these studies, which may affect 
the reliability of comparative analyses. It is also impor-
tant to note that effect sizes derived from pre-post out-
comes could be inflated.

Furthermore,  research  groups  responsible 
for 
developing  the  interventions  have  undertaken  the 
majority of studies incorporated in this meta-analysis 
and  the  sample  sizes  of  the  included  studies  range 
from 13 to 98 individuals with some trials only includ-
female  participants.  The  resource-intensive 
ing 
implementation of DBT-PTSD and DBT PE regarding 
the required training of clinicians in DBT and trauma- 
focused techniques constitutes  a further limitation of 
these  approaches.  In  addition,  we  did  not  conduct  a 
meta-regression  analysis  to  examine  potential  con-
founders,  and  non-specific  variables  may  have  had  a 
significant  impact  on  the  results.  Due  to  the  small 
number  of  available  studies,  it  was  not  possible  to 
examine  the  impact  of  potential  moderators  and 
there  was  evidence  of  a  moderate  risk  of  bias.  These 
factors  warrant  careful  interpretation  of  the  results 
and highlight the need for future research with larger 
and  more  balanced  sample  sizes  to  validate  these 
findings.

Despite these limitations, the present meta-analysis 
substantially  contributes  to  the  existing  scientific  lit-
erature  by  systematically  investigating  the  efficacy  of 
two  distinct  trauma-specific  DBT  interventions  for 
difficult-to-treat  individuals  with  PTSD  and  BPD 
symptoms.  Our  findings  emphasize  the  efficacy  of 
DBT-PTSD  and  DBT  PE  for  the  reduction  of  PTSD 
and comorbid depressive symptoms. These evidence- 
based approaches address the unique needs and com-
plex clinical conditions of individuals with a dual diag-
nosis  of  PTSD  and  BPD.  Additionally,  both 
approaches seem to be promising in the treatment of 
complex  PTSD.  There  remains  a  need  for  future
