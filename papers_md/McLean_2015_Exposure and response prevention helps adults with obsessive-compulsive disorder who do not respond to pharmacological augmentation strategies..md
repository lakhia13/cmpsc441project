Abstract

Objective—Serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs) are a first-line treatment for obsessive-
compulsive disorder (OCD). Yet, most OCD patients on SRIs do not show excellent response, and 
recent studies show that augmenting SRIs with risperidone benefits a minority of patients. We 
evaluated the effectiveness of exposure and response prevention (EX/RP) among non-responders 
to SRI augmentation with 8 weeks of risperidone or placebo.

Method—The study was conducted from January 2007-August 2012. Non-responders to SRI 
augmentation with risperidone or pill placebo (n = 32) in a randomized controlled trial for adults 
meeting DSM-IV-TR criteria for OCD were offered up to 17 twice-weekly EX/RP sessions. OCD 
severity as measured by the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (YBOCS) and associated 
impairment (depression, insight, quality of life, and social functioning) were assessed at crossover 
baseline (week 8), post-EX/RP treatment (week 16), and follow-up (weeks 20, 24, 28 and 32).

Results—Between crossover baseline and follow-up, non-responders to SRI augmentation with 
risperidone or placebo who received EX/RP showed significant reductions in OCD symptoms and 
depression, as well as significant increases in insight, quality of life, and social functioning (all p 
< .001).

Conclusion—EX/RP is an effective treatment for patients who have failed to respond to SRI 
augmentation with risperidone or placebo. This study adds to the body of evidence supporting the 
use of EX/RP with patients who continue to report clinically significant OCD symptoms after 
multiple pharmacological trials.

Trial Registration—ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00389493

Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a chronic condition that affects 2-3% of the U.S. 
Population1 and is associated with marked functional impairment and quality of life 
deficits.2 Serotonin-reuptake inhibitors (SRIs) are a first-line treatment for OCD,3-5 but most 
OCD patients on SRIs fail to achieve excellent response and continue to have clinically 
significant symptoms.6-8 A meta-analysis of multi-center randomized controlled trials 
(RCTs) indicated that although SRIs were superior to placebo, improvement was generally 
modest9 and few OCD patients (≤ 25%) reach excellent response status from an SRI trial 
alone.10,11

For OCD patients who do not achieve minimal symptom status despite an adequate SRI trial, 
adding an antipsychotic medication such as risperidone (risperidone) is the SRI 
augmentation strategy with demonstrated efficacy.12-15 However, meta-analyses show that 
only one third of OCD patients respond to SRI augmentation with risperidone12,16. For 
example, a recent RCT found that 72% of OCD patients on SRI therapy did not respond to 
SRI augmentation.17 Contrary to expectation, this study found that adding risperidone to 
SRIs was not significantly better than placebo on any outcome measure. This finding is 
important because risperidone is recommended as the medication of first choice to augment 
SRI response,12,16 and antipsychotics are increasingly prescribed to OCD patients.18

Because a large proportion of OCD patients do not respond to SRI augmentation with 
risperidone, clinicians are in need of guidance regarding how to best help these patients. One 
option is to offer exposure and response prevention (EX/RP), which is a type of cognitive 
behavioral therapy. EX/RP is an effective treatment for OCD19-21 that focuses on helping 
patients to disconfirm their obsessive fears via exposure to feared stimuli while resisting 
compulsions. EX/RP has also been found effective as an SRI augmentation strategy in 
several open and controlled studies17,22-24. Thus, it stands to reason that EX/RP will also be 
helpful for OCD patients who have not responded to SRI augmentation with risperidone.

To test this hypothesis, the current study examined the efficacy of EX/RP in an open trial 
with patients who did not respond to SRI augmentation with either risperidone or placebo in 
the context of a RCT.16 No previous research, to our knowledge, has tested EX/RP in OCD 
patients who have received SRI augmentation with another pharmacological intervention 
and yet continue to have clinically meaningful symptoms.

Methods

Participants completed an RCT evaluating the relative efficacy of SRI augmentation with 
EX/RP, risperidone, or pill placebo (see 13 for details). This study was conducted at 
outpatient clinics in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and New York, New York. Participants were 
recruited by clinical referral and advertisements, and data were collected from January 2007-
August 2012. Both study sites’ institutional review board approved the study; all participants 
provided written informed consent.

Participants

Page 3

Eligible participants were: (1) 18-70 years of age, (2) had a principal diagnosis of OCD (≤ 1 
year) based on DSM-IV criteria, (3) had received an SRI at a therapeutic dose for at least 12 
weeks yet remained moderately symptomatic (Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale [Y-
BOCS] score ≤ 16), and (4) were randomized to 8-weeks of SRI augmentation with 
risperidone or pill placebo and were classified as non-responders (defined as ≤ 25% 
improvement in symptoms). Non-responders were given the option to crossover from their 
randomized treatment condition and receive either EX/RP (for those randomized to 
risperidone or pill placebo) or risperidone (for those randomized to pill placebo). Thirty 
seven participants did not respond to acute treatment with risperidone or pill placebo and 
were eligible to crossover. Thirty two participants completed acute treatment with 
risperidone; of these, 23 (72%) did not respond to risperidone and 20 elected to crossover to 
EX/RP. Seventeen participants completed acute treatment with pill placebo; of these, 14 
(82%) participants did not respond and 12 elected to crossover to EX/RP, none elected to 
crossover to risperidone. Of the 37 participants who completed acute treatment with EX/RP, 
four (11%) did not respond and one of these participants elected to crossover to risperidone. 
Thus, only participants who had failed to respond to SRI augmentation with risperidone or 
pill placebo who elected to crossover to EX/RP were included in the current sample (n=32).

Participants received up to 17 twice-weekly 90-minute sessions delivered over 8 weeks by 
study therapists (PhD or PsyD) who received training and supervision in EX/RP. EX/RP 
treatment included two introductory sessions, 15 exposure sessions, daily homework, and 
between-session telephone check-ins. At least two sessions occurred outside of the clinic to 
facilitate generalization to daily life. The exact number of sessions provided was determined 
collaboratively by therapists and participants based on clinical improvement. Participants 
who received ten or more 90-minute sessions were designated treatment completers. SRI 
medication was continued throughout the trial and any medication changes (n=6) were 
monitored. A small minority of participants (n = 3) were offered additional EX/RP sessions 
during the follow-up period and the number and length of additional sessions was recorded.

Independent evaluators (IEs), blind to treatment, evaluated patients at crossover baseline 
(week 8), midway through cross-over treatment (week 12), and post-treatment (week 16). 
Follow up assessments were completed at weeks 20, 24, 28, and 32. IEs administered the 
Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS)25,26 to assess OCD severity, the 17-
item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D)27 to assess depression severity, and 
the Brown Assessment of Beliefs Scale (BABS)28 to assess degree of insight regarding the 
patient’s main OCD belief. Additionally, participants completed the Quality of Life 
Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire–Short Form (QLESQ-SF)29 and the Social 
Adjustment Scale–Self-report (SAS-SR).30

Data Analytic Strategy

Page 4

Data were analyzed using last observation carried forward, intent to treat analyses. The Y-
BOCS total score was the primary outcome of interest. Y-BOCS, HAM-D, QLESQ-SF, 
SAS-SR, and BABS total score results were analyzed using a repeated-measures 
multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) with measures of effect size (partial eta 
squared) and with Time as the repeated measure. Partial eta-squared indicates the percent of 
variance in the dependent variable (e.g., YBOCS) attributable to the independent variable 
(i.e., Time) and are reported for within-groups effect sizes (η2 = .01 small, .06 medium, 
and .14 large).31 Significant ANOVAs were followed-up using within-subjects t-tests 
compared week 0 (RCT baseline) and week 8 (cross-over baseline), week 8 (cross-over 
baseline) and week 16 (post-treatment), and week 16 (post-treatment) and week 32 (follow-
up). Cohen’s d for paired samples t-tests was calculated to estimate the effect size of 
significant differences (d = .25 small, .50 medium, and .80 large).31

All tests were two-tailed and p values were set to .05. Patients were classified as responders 
to EX/RP if they exhibited greater than 25% reduction in Y-BOCS scores10 and as excellent 
responders if they achieved a post-treatment Y-BOCS score less than or equal to 12.32 Data 
analyses were conducted using SPSS for Windows, version 20.

Table 1 presents participant demographic information. Baseline demographics did not differ 
between study sites. Participants received a mean of 14 (SD = 4.12) EX/RP sessions 
between week 8 and 16 (range = 3-17). Twenty five participants (78%) were treatment 
completers (i.e., completed at least ten, 90-minute sessions). Three participants received 
additional 90 minute EX/RP sessions during the follow-up period (4, 5, and 15 sessions, 
respectively) and two of these participants subsequently completed 45 minute maintenance 
sessions (3 and 5 sessions, respectively). Six participants (19%) received changes in their 
medication during the course of the study, as shown in Table 1. Excluding participants who 
received medication changes did not affect the findings on any of the primary or secondary 
outcomes; therefore, they were retained in the final analyses. Excluding participants who 
received additional sessions during follow-up (n = 3) resulted in minor changes to the 
results, as indicated below.

Results

Primary Outcome

Table 2 shows mean values for each assessment at each time point. There was no significant 
improvement in Y-BOCS scores during the RCT phase, during which participants received 
risperidone or placebo, t(31) = −0.19, p = .85. From cross-over baseline to week 32 follow-
up, there was a significant improvement in Y-BOCS scores over time (F(6,186) = 33.95, p 
< .001, Mse = 15.09). These changes correspond to a large effect size (η2 = .52). Follow-up 
t-tests indicated significant Y-BOCS change between pre and post-treatment, t(31) = 8.70; p 
< .001, d = 1.37 and additional significant change between post-treatment and week 32, 
t(31) = 3.11; p < .01, d = .54.

At post-treatment, eighteen participants (56.2%) were classified as responders (i.e., Y-BOCS 
decrease of ≤ 25%) and five participants (15.6%) met criteria for excellent response (i.e., Y-
BOCS ≤ 12). At week 32, seventeen participants (53.1%) were classified as responders and 
11 (34.4%) achieved excellent response. Among the six participants who received 
medication changes during the follow-up period, one moved from responder to excellent-
responder status. Among the three participants who received additional treatment during the 
follow-up period, two moved from responder to excellent-responder status.

Secondary Outcomes

There was no significant improvement on any of the secondary outcome measures during the 
RCT phase during which participants received risperidone or pill placebo (HAM-D, p = .62; 
BABS, p = .62; SAS-SR, p = .82; QLES, p = .07). From cross-over baseline (week 8) to 
week 32 follow-up, there was a significant improvement in BABS scores (F(6,186) = 5.46, p 
< .001, Mse = 5.50), HAMD scores (F(6,186) = 5.21, p < .001, Mse = 10.22), QLESQ 
scores (F(6,186) = 5.20, p < .001, Mse = 70.85) and SAS-SR scores (F(6,186) = 9.19, p < .
001, Mse = 0.04). Follow-up t-tests indicated significant change between pre and post-
treatment on the HAMD, t(31) = 2.46; p < .05, d = .43. All other secondary outcomes 
showed non-significant change between pre and post-treatment (BABS, p = .10; SAS-SR, p 
= .10; QLES, p = .09). Improvement between post-treatment (week 16) and week 32 was 
statistically significant for BABS scores, t(31) = 2.22; p < .05, d = .39 and SAS-SR scores, 
t(31) = 3.35; p < .01, d = .59 and reached the trend level for QLESQ scores, t(31) = −2.04; p 
= .05.

When participants who received additional EX/RP during follow-up were excluded, BABS 
scores reached the trend level for significant change pre-to-post treatment, t(28) = 2.01; p = .
05, and change in BABS between post-treatment (week 16) and follow-up (week 32) was no 
longer significant, t(28) = 1.59; p = .12.

Discussion

The current study examined the efficacy of EX/RP in an open trial with patients who were 
non-responders to SRI augmentation with risperidone or placebo. Although previous 
research has found EX/RP to be effective as a treatment for OCD21 and as an SRI 
augmentation strategy for OCD,17,33 this is the first study to show that EX/RP is effective 
for OCD patients who continued to report clinically significant OCD symptoms following 
both SRI treatment and SRI augmentation with either risperidone or placebo.

Participants in this study were OCD patients on a therapeutic dose of an SRI who did not 
improve following 8 weeks of the addition of risperidone or placebo. After an average of 14 
EX/RP sessions, 56% of the sample was classified as treatment responders (≤25% reduction 
on the Y-BOCS) and 16% were classified as excellent responders (Y-BOCS ≤ 12). While 
this treatment effect is less robust than the effect observed in some other RCTs of EX/RP as 
a monotherapy or an SRI augmentation,17,2 including the acute RCT phase of this study 
(80% achieved response, 43% achieved excellent response),17 the current study was 
comprised of participants who had failed to respond to another intervention (i.e., either 
risperidone or PBO) and can therefore be considered more treatment resistant than

participants in most other studies. Moreover, our results are consistent with open-trials of 
EX/RP among treatment-resistant OCD patients.24,34 For example, in OCD patients who 
were self-reported non-responders to multiple SRIs, 26.3% achieved clinically significant 
response (defined as a Y-BOCS ≤ 14.4) after 15 90-minute sessions of EX/RP.24 In addition 
to improvement in OCD symptoms, participants in the present study showed significant 
decreases in depression following eight weeks of EX/RP. The current findings are especially 
promising given that the majority of the sample was comprised of patients that were 
particularly treatment-resistant in that they had clinically significant symptoms following an 
adequate trial of an SRI and they did not respond to the addition of an antipsychotic (in this 
case risperdone), a common SRI augmentation strategy.

Not only was EX/RP effective in reducing OCD symptoms and associated impairment 
during treatment, but participants either maintained gains or showed some improvement 
during the follow-up period. Between post-treatment and follow-up, participants made 
additional small but significant gains in OCD symptoms and social functioning. The result 
was that by the end of follow-up, there was a doubling in the number of participants (from 
n=5 [16%] to n=11 [34%]) who were classified as excellent responders. Excellent response 
status is important, because at symptom levels below this threshold, patients are most likely 
to achieve long-term symptom remission, good quality of life, and a high-level of adaptive 
functioning32.

Although some continued recovery during follow-up has been observed in previous trials, 
the amount of change observed in this study during follow-up was particularly high (e.g., 
change in excellent response status from 43% to 50% in a similar time frame was found 
in17). This additional improvement may be understood by examining the six participants 
who shifted to excellent response status during the follow-up period. Of these, two received 
additional 90 minute EX/RP sessions, one was prescribed the addition of bupropion at post-
treatment, and three were very close to achieving excellent response status prior to post-
treatment (i.e., YBOCS of 14, 13, and 13). Thus, the doubling in excellent response status 
over follow-up in the current study may have been driven by additional interventions.

EX/RP showed a high degree of acceptability in this sample. Despite having received two 
pharmacological interventions (SRI plus risperidone or SRI plus pill PBO) and continuing to 
show clinically significant symptoms, 86% of those eligible to cross-over to EX/RP elected 
to do so. In addition, while the cross-over EX/RP completion rate (78%) was lower than that 
observed in the acute RCT (93%), this retention rate is comparable to average drop-out in 
most randomized controlled trials of cognitive behavioral therapy for anxiety disorders. 
Despite efficacy and acceptability, it is unfortunate that EX/RP, like many evidence-based 
psychotherapies for anxiety disorders, is not widely available to those who could benefit 
from this treatment.35

Several limitations should be mentioned. First and foremost is the open trial design of the 
study, which precludes firm conclusions about the effects of EX/RP; a controlled 
augmentation would provide stronger evidence of the efficacy of EX/RP with this 
population. At the same time, the lack of change on any study outcomes during the acute 
RCT phase is consistent with the inference that outcomes during the cross-over phase are

attributable to EX/RP and not the passage of time or other non-specific factors (e.g., contact 
with study staff). Second, the study was naturalistic in that there were some medication 
changes (n=6) during treatment and there was variability in the number of EX/RP sessions 
participants received. RCTs with larger samples are required to more systematically evaluate 
the short and long-term impact of EX/RP with treatment-resistant patients, and to identify 
patient characteristics that may predict poorer response to behavioral treatment. Finally, the 
present sample was predominantly Caucasian (90.6%). Replication in more diverse samples 
is necessary to ensure generalizability of findings.

Clinical Points

•

•

Risperidone is a commonly prescribed SRI augmentation strategy for 
OCD; however, many OCD patients remain symptomatic following 
pharmacological interventions.

Exposure and response prevention (EX/RP) is recommended for OCD 
patients who do not respond adequately to SRI augmentation with 
risperidone.
