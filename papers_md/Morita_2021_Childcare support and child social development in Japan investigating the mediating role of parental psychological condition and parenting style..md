In humans, support from partners and alloparents is crucial for successful
the complex
child-rearing and optimal child development. However,
relationships among childcare support, children’s outcomes and parental
characteristics have not been fully examined. We investigate how three
sources of partner and alloparental support—partner’s childcare partici-
pation, support from children’s grandparents and support from non-kin—
can be associated with child social development. We hypothesize that the
associations between childcare support
from partners/alloparents and
child social development are partly mediated by parental psychological con-
dition and parenting style. To test this, we conducted path analyses on
online survey data collected in 2016 from parents of 3- to 5-year-old children
in Japan. We found no evidence that childcare support had direct positive
effects on child social development. Rather, the benefit of childcare support
was mediated by its effects on parental psychological condition and parent-
ing style, which in turn improved children’s outcomes. At the same time, we
found some evidence that greater availability of childcare support was
directly associated with more behavioural difficulties in children. Our find-
ings reveal the complex pathways between childcare support, parental
characteristics and children’s outcomes in Japan, showing potential mechan-
isms behind parental and alloparental effects in industrialized populations.
This article is part of the theme issue ‘Multidisciplinary perspectives on

social support and maternal–child health’.

1. Introduction
(a) Background
In humans, children are often cared for by parents as well as other individuals,
known as alloparents. Alloparents can include a broad range of individuals,
such as grandparents, elder siblings, relatives and non-kin, who may provide
childcare support (i.e. investment that will improve children’s outcomes and par-
ental characteristics). This communal way of raising children has been termed
cooperative breeding ([1–3], see also [4]). Across non-industrialized, small-scale
societies (i.e. hunter–gatherers, horticulturalists, and historical and contemporary
nation states in pre-industrial socioeconomic contexts), the presence of kin,
particularly grandmothers and older siblings, has been associated with greater
child survival [5,6]. However, there is notable variation across populations, with
kin presence also associated with null or negative effects on child survival [6],
suggesting that kin support and its effects may be context-dependent and diverse.
While literature from non-industrialized societies focuses on child survival
and mortality, in contemporary industrialized, high-income societies, research-
ers have paid increasing attention to the potential effects of alloparents on child

cognitive, emotional and behavioural development [7–13].
This is partly because improved hygiene, nutrition states
and medical services have raised the standard of children’s
physical health, making alloparental care less relevant for sur-
vival. Furthermore,
low-
fertility-low-mortality societies, parental investment strategies
prioritize quality rather than the quantity of children (i.e.
prioritizing child capital over a number of children) [14–16].
In these settings, alloparenting may have more salient effects
on child quality (over survival), including on social develop-
ment which broadly captures children’s cognitive and
language ability, educational outcomes, emotional stability,
and social behaviour and adjustment. These traits are known
determinants of future outcomes including better health and
greater income (e.g. [17–19]), indicating that it captures aspects
of child quality/capital. Sadruddin et al.’s [12] systematic
cross-cultural review has found that multigenerational care
involving parents and grandparents is positively associated
with child cognitive development and educational attainment
in several cases, suggesting that kin support, particularly from
grandparents, continues to be an important determinant of
successful child-rearing in industrialized populations.

Understanding alloparental support in industrialized set-
tings is complicated by the fact that parents also receive a
variety of formal childcare support from professionals and
institutionalized services [2], along with informal support
from the wider community. While evolutionary theory pre-
dicts that, all being equal, kin are more likely to help
(leading to much focus on kin as important caregivers),
some studies highlighted the importance of non-kin support
in non-industrialized populations (e.g. [20,21]), suggesting
that support from non-kin may continue to be important in
industrialized contexts. Indeed, Yamaguchi et al. [13] found
that the use of childcare centres (such as nurseries) was associ-
ated with improved child developmental outcomes, such
as better language development and reduced tendency of
inattention, hyperactivity and aggression, among Japanese
mothers especially with lower education levels.

When considering how parents and alloparents impact
child quality, one must be mindful of the indirect effects:
how childcare support influences parental condition (proxy
of parent quality) and parenting style ( proxy of parenting
strategies), which then goes on to affect children’s outcomes
[2,22]. It can be expected that better parental condition gives
people the ability to meet local cultural norms of parenting,
and adjusting their parenting style (i.e. quality and quantity
of parental investment) to the norms may be associated with
successful child-rearing, higher child quality and higher fit-
ness. While ‘good’ or ‘bad’ parenting style is subjective and
depends on each sociocultural environment, the mediating
role of parenting style should exist across different norms.
Numerous studies have investigated associations between
social support and parental psychological condition and/or
parenting style in contemporary industrialized societies
(e.g. [10,13,23–26]). For example, Yamaguchi et al. [13] found
that parental subjective well-being and parenting quality
(measured here as parenting style with greater warmth and
fewer abusive attitudes) were higher with the use of childcare
facilities among Japanese mothers especially with lower levels
of education. Given the known effects of parental psychologi-
cal condition and parenting style on children’s outcomes
[10,27–29], the indirect effects of childcare support may be sig-
nificant determinants of child development and quality. For a

of maternal postpartum depression on children’s emotional
warmth and invasive behaviour towards mothers were
weakened with greater perceived social support [10].

(b) Hypothesis and scope
We hypothesize that
the association between partner/
alloparental childcare support and child social development
is partly mediated by parental psychological condition and
parenting style (figure 1; see also the electronic supplemen-
tary material for the directions of pathways). Specifically,
we predict that childcare support is associated with better
parental psychological conditions (lower parental stress and
depression), parenting style adjusted to local
cultural
norms, and higher social development in children (more pro-
social behaviour and fewer behavioural difficulties). For the
current study, we focus on three sources of childcare support:
partner’s childcare participation; availability of support from
children’s grandparents (actual/potential practical/emotion-
from children’s grandparents) and
al/financial support
availability of support from non-kin including community
networks and professional care supporters (actual/potential
practical/emotional support from non-kin). As socio-cogni-
tive ability dramatically develops in early childhood (e.g.
executive function: [30]; theory of mind: [31]) along with
increases in prosocial behaviour [32], we focus our analysis
on parents of 3- to 5-year-old children.

We test these associations by conducting path analyses on
online survey data from Japan, collected in 2016. Previous
studies on childcare support and its effects on children’s
outcomes and parental characteristics have tended to focus
on Western populations. Japanese household compositions
are similar to those of
the European Union and other
high-income countries [33], with decreasing numbers of
three-generation households and ‘nuclear families’ being the
norm [34]. However, gender norms around childcare being
in the female domain remain strong partly evidenced by nota-
bly lower childcare participation by fathers (e.g. [35,36]).
In a recent national survey, 35.0% of respondents agreed that
husbands should work in employment and wives should
take care of the household, and of these respondents who
agreed to the gender role, 55.2% thought that households
managed by wives will be better for child development [37].

Unsurprisingly, many mothers in Japan struggle to manage
household chores and childcare alone, even if they work out-
side the home (e.g. [38]). Consequently, the hypothesized
pathways among childcare support, child social development,
parental psychological condition and parenting style could
vary between mothers and fathers.

Extensive sociological studies on childcare support in
Japan have outlined the importance of social support in the
child-rearing system (e.g. [11,39–45]). For example, Matsuda
[11] found that the size and composition of mothers’ social net-
works were associated with child social development (e.g. self-
control and language ability), both directly and indirectly,
where the effects were mediated by maternal child-rearing
anxiety. In another study, Matsuda [42] showed that a moder-
ate level of diversity in childcare networks involving kin and
non-kin was associated with better well-being among Japanese
mothers, suggesting that childcare support from within and
beyond the family remains important
in contemporary
Japan. In Japanese law and policy, however, childcare has tra-
ditionally been considered to be a private matter for each
from the
family (e.g.
government and non-kin may have been still underdeveloped.
indicate that partners and
alloparents are key determinants of
child quality in
Japan. However, researchers have not fully examined the
hypothesized causal pathways between childcare support,
children’s outcomes and parental characteristics. Here, we
build on previous evidence by examining how childcare
support from partners and alloparents is directly and/or
indirectly associated with child social development (a proxy
of child quality), parental psychological condition (a proxy
of parent quality) and parenting style (a proxy of parenting
strategies in the environment). Overall, our study will provide
further details on the mechanisms underpinning parental
and alloparental effects in a non-Western, contemporary
industrialized population.

2. Subjects and methods
(a) Data
We analysed data from an online questionnaire survey con-
ducted by two of the authors (AS and MN) in Japan, in March
2016. The participants were registered as possible respondents
at Macromill, Inc., a public marketing research company in
Japan (https://monitor.macromill.com). Parents living with at
least one child aged from 3 to 5 years old were invited to take
part via notification from the company (such as through e-mail
and the website) which included survey information. The
survey had a broad purpose to exploratorily obtain basic infor-
mation on childcare support and its effects on parents’ and
children’s outcomes in Japan. For the present study, we selected
available variables relating to childcare support, child social
development, parental psychological condition and parenting
style, and build on previous analyses using the same data;
Saito & Nozaki
[47] previously examined the association
between maternal employment and their availability of childcare
support, and Saito & Nozaki
[48] explored the association
between paternal childcare participation and maternal employ-
ment, and the correlation between maternal and paternal
availability of childcare support.

The participants of the survey were 618 heterosexual couples
(mothers and fathers) who had at least one child aged 2 to 6
years old, although our survey was advertised for parents with
3- to 5-year-old children. Each couple received a single online

questionnaire composed of two sections, one for the mother
and the other for the father, which had the same set of questions.
Mothers and fathers were requested to answer separately. We
explained to them the aim and contents of the survey and
obtained their permission before they began to respond to the
questions. This survey was approved by the ethical committees
at the University of Tokyo (no. 306) and Musashino University
(no. 29001). The dataset that we analysed in this paper and the
questionnaire (in Japanese) are available in the electronic
supplementary material (see Data accessibility).

(b) Variables
(i) Childcare support
The following three variables were designed by the authors with
reference to previous social surveys in Japan [42,49–53]. Partner’s
childcare participation was derived based on the frequency of var-
ious caregiving activities, measured through information such as
‘How often do you give your child a bath?’ and ‘How often do
you help your child to eat?’, with a possible minimum score of
9 and a maximum score of 36. We take these measures to capture
partner’s direct investment levels into the child, where higher
scores indicate higher practical participation in childcare by the
partner. Mothers and fathers provided information about their
own participation by themselves respectively. Support from chil-
dren’s grandparents was measured via both actual and potential
grandparental childcare involvement, through questions such
as ‘How often does your child meet with his/her grandparents?’
and ‘Can you rely on your child’s grandparents regarding child-
care?’, with a possible minimum score of 0 and a maximum score
of 88. We take these measures to capture grandparents’ direct
and indirect investment levels into the child and parent, where
higher scores reflect greater availability of practical, emotional
and financial childcare support from children’s grandparents.
Support from non-kin was measured via both actual and potential
parental involvement in a broad range of childcare support from
across the parental social networks, including formal and infor-
mal sources. Examples of questions are ‘How often do you use
childcare centres?’ and ‘How many persons can you talk about
childcare concerns with?’, with a possible minimum score of 0
and a maximum score of 32. We take these measures to capture
non-kin’s direct and indirect investment levels into the child and
parent, where higher scores reflect greater availability of practical
and emotional childcare support from parent’s social networks
and professional services. Further information on survey items
are available in the electronic supplementary material.

(ii) Child social development
We used the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ; [54], see
[55] for the Japanese version) to measure child social develop-
ment. The SDQ measures two components of child social
behaviour and adjustment, where prosocial behaviour scores
(PBS; possible minimum score 0 and a maximum score 10) cap-
ture children’s prosocial tendencies, and total difficulties scores
(TDS; possible minimum score 0 and a maximum score 40) cap-
ture
conduct problems,
hyperactivity/inattention and peer problems. Higher SDQ-PBS
are assumed to indicate higher social development, and higher
SDQ-TDS are assumed to indicate lower social development in
children. The SDQ is based on parent reports and the correlations
(Pearson’s r) of the scores assessed by the mother and father
within each couple were relatively high (0.68344 in SDQ-PBS
and 0.77225 in the SDQ-TDS).

Index based on 36 items (PSI; [56], see also [57] for the related
Japanese version) to assess parenting stress. The PSI measu-
res parental distress (PD), along with child difficulty and
through the parent’s
parent–child dysfunctional
self-assessment. The present study used the PSI-PD only (see
the electronic supplementary material). With a possible mini-
mum score of 12 and a maximum score of 60, we take higher
scores to indicate a higher parenting stress. Parenting stress in
the context of child-rearing will be partly associated with broader
components of general psychological condition of parents. We
used a form of the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II; [58], see
[59,60] for the Japanese version) to assess parental depression
and to analyse it as a continuous condition (see the electronic
supplementary material). With a possible minimum score of 0
and a maximum score of 63, we take higher scores to indicate
higher parental depression. The BDI-II is based on parent’s
self-assessment.

(iv) Parenting style
We focused on measures of parental care and child abuse.
We used the Parental Bonding Inventory (PBI; [61]; see [62] for
the Japanese version) to capture parental care. The PBI measures
Care (warmth) and over-protection in terms of the parent–child
bonding, as per the parent’s self-assessment. The present study
used the PBI-Care only (see the electronic supplementary
material). With a possible minimum score of 0 and a maximum
score of 30, we take higher scores to indicate greater parental
care. We used a validated measure of potential risk for child abuse
made in Japan [63]. This assesses risk for physical and psycho-
logical abuse that will be associated with poor parenting
practices. The current measure includes questions such as ‘I do
not spank my child’, ‘I often play with my child’ and ‘I do not
obey my child when he/she complains’ (we translated the orig-
inal questions of [63] in Japanese). These items capture parental
child-rearing attitudes that (i) do not rely on power, (ii) nurture
children’s high self-esteem, and (iii) teach children self-control;
parents’ violent behaviour, cold attitudes and obeying children’s
selfish behaviour are considered as potential risk factors for child
abuse. Each item is assessed by the parents on a five-point scale.
In our analysis, with a possible minimum score of 15 and a maxi-
mum score of 75, we take higher scores to indicate higher
potential risk of child abuse.

(v) Control variables
We used information of household income ( parents’ combined
personal income within a couple; 27 levels possible, from low
to high; ordinal), parents’ education level (five levels possible,
from low to high; ordinal), employment status (0 = none includ-
ing homemaker; 1 = temporary; 2 = full-time; ordinal), age (years
old; integer), children’s age (numerical, days after birth divided
by 365), sex (1 = male; 2 = female) and the number of siblings
of the child in question ( persons, up to five). These variables
were included to control the effects of possible confounding fac-
tors for parental psychological condition and child social
development
supplementary material).
The mothers and fathers provided information on the variables
individually. The variable selection was performed before
conducting the analysis.

(see the electronic

(c) Statistical analyses
We conducted path analyses and generalized linear models to
test the hypothesized causal pathways by using R version 3.5.1
[64] for macOS Sierra mainly. We excluded the couples who
had at least one not applicable (N/A) items among the aforemen-
tioned variables. N/A items included missing or ‘unreliable’
data (e.g. the age difference between mothers and children/
siblings was less than 14 or more than 49 years old; parents

responded that there was a first and third child but no second
child; and/or the provided sibling’s birth date was a future
date from the date of response). We also excluded the couples
none of whose children were between 3- to 5-years old, because
they were out of the subjects of the original survey. The number
of N/A samples was 95 couples in total. Therefore, the final
sample size for analyses was 523 couples. We analysed the
mothers’ and fathers’ data separately, except for the childcare
participation of one’s partner; when we analysed the mothers’
data, fathers’ (their partners’) childcare participation (this infor-
mation was provided by fathers themselves) was included in the
statistical models to investigate its effects on mothers’ perceived out-
comes. More details of the analyses including model selection
procedures are provided in the electronic supplementary material.

3. Results
We show the descriptive statistics of participants used in the
analyses (n = 523 couples) in table 1. The distributions of vari-
ables on childcare support, parental psychological condition,
parenting style and child social development are shown in the
electronic supplementary material, figure S1. The correlations
(r) between the above variables are also shown in the electronic
supplementary material, table S1. Note that the following
analyses have estimated the strengths of possible effects
between variables within the assumed causal framework.

Key results from our path analyses are summarized in
figure 2 and table 2. For mothers, the direct path from partner’s
childcare participation to SDQ-TDS was statistically significant
( p = 0.03358, standardized estimate = 0.08077, s.e. = 0.03092).
However, against our prediction (i.e. childcare support will
improve children’s outcomes), the estimate was positive in
value, meaning there was an association between higher child-
care participation by fathers and greater behavioural difficulties
in children. Greater availability of support from children’s
grandparents was related to lower potential risk of maternal
abuse ( p = 0.03066, standardized estimate = –0.09063, s.e. =
0.02264). Greater availability of support from non-kin was
associated with lower levels of maternal stress and depression
(lower PSI-PD and BDI-II scores; table 2). In turn,
lower
maternal stress and depression were related to higher social
development in children (higher SDQ-PBS and lower SDQ-
TDS; table 2). These associations were both direct and indirect
via maternal parenting style (PBI-Care) for maternal stress,
while indirect only (via PBI-Care and abuse) for maternal
depression. Overall, there were no significant direct paths that
would support our prediction between the availability of
childcare support provided to mothers and child social devel-
opment, whereas there were some indirect paths mediated by
maternal psychological condition and parenting style.

For fathers, availability of support from non-kin had a
significant direct effect on SDQ-TDS, but in the opposite direc-
tion to our prediction, with greater non-kin support associated
with more behavioural difficulties in children ( p = 0.03188, stan-
dardized estimate = 0.08344, s.e. = 0.03657). Greater availability
of non-kin support was related to higher paternal depression
(higher BDI-II; p = 0.00204, standardized estimate = 0.13389,
s.e. = 0.05905), though the non-kin support was associated
with lower depression among mothers. There were no signifi-
cant direct paths that would support our prediction from
childcare support to child social development as with mothers,
while there were some indirect paths through paternal parent-
ing style (e.g. mothers’ greater participation in childcare was

related to lower risk of paternal abuse, predicting greater behav-
ioural difficulties in children). Among fathers, our analysis
found no significant effects of grandparent support on both
children’s outcomes and parental characteristics; among
mothers, however, greater availability of grandparent support
predicted a lower risk of maternal abuse.

4. Discussion
We have estimated the effects of several childcare variables
on both children and parents, and shown their possible
relationships (figure 2). In line with our hypothesis, we
found that positive associations between childcare support
and child social development were mediated by parental
psychological condition and parenting style. For example,
among mothers, greater availability of support from non-kin
was associated with lower levels of maternal stress and
depression, which were related to parenting style with greater
parental care and the lower potential risk of abuse, and
ultimately predicting more prosocial behaviour and fewer

behavioural difficulties in children. This suggests that the avail-
ability of partner and alloparental childcare support influences
parent quality and parenting strategies, which in turn affects
child quality in a specific sample in contemporary Japan.
This means that the indirect positive associations between
childcare support and child social development may be stron-
ger, than the direct associations, in industrialized populations
with nuclear family structures, where child-rearing practices
tend to centre on parenting. This is also in line with previous
studies finding positive effects of alloparents on children’s out-
comes [6,12] and reveals the potential mechanisms behind how
partner and alloparental childcare support impacts child social
development. In our analysis, greater parental care and lower
risk of abuse were associated with higher social development
in children. This result may indicate that these traits are
components of a ‘good’ parenting style in a Japanese context.
Contrary to our prediction, we found evidence of direct
effects between childcare support and increased behavioural
difficulties in children. If this association is causal, this indicates
that certain kinds of support may negatively impact children’s
outcomes. Indeed, some previous studies have found that

non-maternal caregiving, such as the use of formal childcare and
grandparenting, was associated with lower social development
in children. However, the results are varied and inconsistent and
may depend on the quality of care [7–9,12,13]. As child-rearing
norms in Japan are still predominantly focused on mothers as
caregivers (e.g. [38]), it might be that the quality of non-maternal
childcare support does not adequately substitute maternal care
in the environment (see also below), thereby leading to chil-
dren’s negative outcomes. Alternatively, our findings indicate
reverse-causal associations, where more behavioural difficulties
induce greater childcare support (see also [65,66]). The results
may also reflect difficult environments for childcare in contem-
porary Japan, where parents in nuclear families tend to be
overburdened with parenting responsibilities, and young chil-
dren have few opportunities to interact with adults other than
their parents or staff at childcare facilities (see also [67]).
In such difficult situations, support may be associated with
negative impacts on children’s outcomes because help may be
provided when families are under stress and greater support
is needed (see also [20]).

Next, we note some differences in the pathways between
mothers and fathers. As an example, childcare support from
non-kin was associated with lower depression among mothers,
whereas non-kin support predicted higher depression among
fathers. This may reflect gender differences in the sociocultural
conditions of childcare in Japan. As cultural norms and social
structures tend to assume mothers to be principal caregivers,
fathers may experience greater barriers and stress when acces-
sing childcare support (e.g. diaper changing beds have often
not been installed in toilets for men, see [68]), and this may
be connected to lower childcare participation by fathers in
childcare (see also [35,36]). Under this sociocultural context,
providing childcare support may worsen paternal mental
health and children’s outcomes, which may partly explain
why higher fathers’ participation in childcare was associated
with greater behavioural difficulties in the mother model
(but fathers’ childcare participation did not take account of
paternal psychological condition). Extensive investigations on
fatherhood in Japan and the effects of fathers’ characteristics

on maternal condition and behaviour are required to fully
understand the relationship.

the hypothesized causal pathways,

Although our study has revealed the complex pathways
between childcare support, parental psychological condition,
there are
parenting style and child social development,
several limitations. First, maternal and paternal models were
run separately, meaning we did not explore how broader
maternal and paternal characteristics and experiences affect
each other (e.g. how paternal condition and behaviour affect
mothers’ perception of child social development, or how
mothers’ perceived childcare support influences paternal con-
dition and behaviour). Second, as a cross-sectional survey, we
do not know if the current associations would vary over time
as children age (see also [69,70]). Third, while our findings sup-
port
the associations
identified in our models may represent reverse-causal mechan-
isms, or alternative causal paths may be assumed by other
theoretical frameworks (e.g. [27,71]). Fourth, we need to keep
in mind that family dynamics can vary even within countries
depending on the local environment. In Japan, nuclear family
households are more common in urban compared to rural
areas [44,72], which may alter the associations among vari-
ables. Finally, our aggregated measures of childcare support
are relatively blunt, lacking information on the specific natures
of support (i.e. what kind of contribution was actually made by
whom and to whom?). Factors, such as the quality of childcare
support, or conflict among potential caregivers (e.g. [73]) were
not carefully considered within this study. While our study
was designed to test broad associations between childcare sup-
port and both children’s outcomes and parental characteristics,
future studies should examine both cooperation and conflict
within the family, different alloparental effects by maternal/
paternal grandmothers/grandfathers (e.g. [74]), and different
impacts of practical/emotional/financial support on children
and parents (e.g. [23,26]).

Despite these limitations, our study has provided insight
into the complex mechanisms behind a partner and allopar-
ental childcare support and child social development in
contemporary Japan, a non-Western industrialized context.

The results indicate that alloparenting remains important but
can be mediated by its effects on parental psychological con-
dition and parenting style. We hope that our findings will
enhance cross-cultural understanding of alloparenting and
social support.

Ethics. Our questionnaire survey was approved by the ethical commit-
tees at the University of Tokyo (no. 306) and Musashino University
(no. 29001).
Data accessibility. The dataset that we analysed in this paper and the
questionnaire (in Japanese) are available on the journal’s website.
The English translation of our original questions about childcare sup-
port and some R codes for statistical analyses are also provided in the
electronic supplementary material.
Authors’ contributions. M.M., A.S., M.N. and Y.I. developed the theoreti-
cal framework. A.S. and M.N. designed the original questionnaire
survey and collected the data. M.M., A.S. and M.N. prepared the
dataset for statistical analyses. M.M. and M.N. carried out the

statistical analyses with crucial advice from Y.I. M.M., A.S., N.M.
and Y.I. contributed to the interpretation of the results. M.M. drafted
the manuscript. M.M., A.S., M.N. and Y.I. revised the manuscript. All
authors gave final approval for publication and agree to be held
accountable for the work performed therein.
Competing interests. We declare that we have no competing interests.
