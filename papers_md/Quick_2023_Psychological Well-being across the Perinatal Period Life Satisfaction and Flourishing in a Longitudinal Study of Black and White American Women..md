Abstract

Psychological well-being (life satisfaction and flourishing) during the perinatal period has 
implications for both maternal and child health. However, few studies have investigated the 
extent to which psychological well-being changes from preconception to postpartum periods, 
particularly among diverse samples of women. Using prospectively collected data from an ongoing 
longitudinal study, we investigated changes in two dimensions of psychological well-being from 
preconception to postpartum among 173 Black and White American women. Results showed that 
changes in life satisfaction (i.e., global quality of life) and flourishing (e.g., self-acceptance, sense 
of purpose) over the perinatal period were moderated by race. For life satisfaction, White women 
reported an increase from preconception to pregnancy with increased life satisfaction levels 
remaining stable from pregnancy to postpartum. However, Black women reported no changes 
in life satisfaction across these timepoints. In contrast, both Black and White women reported an 
increase in flourishing levels across the perinatal period, although the timing of these changes 
differed. Findings highlight a need for greater clinical and empirical attention to the way in 
which psychological well-being changes during the perinatal period to optimize health and inform 
strengths-based intervention targets.

Psychological well-being during the perinatal period is a central component of health 
during pregnancy, with significant implications for a wide range of maternal and offspring 
outcomes. Although research on perinatal health has disproportionately focused on physical 
indicators of health, a growing body of evidence points to the importance of monitoring 
and promoting psychological health during this critical life stage (Alves et al., 2021; Law 
et al., 2021; B. L. Taylor et al., 2016). Indeed, psychological well-being during pregnancy,

such as high levels of self-reported life satisfaction and a sense of ‘flourishing’, is associated 
with decreased risk for perinatal depression and anxiety (Strine et al., 2008; Wood & 
Joseph, 2010), decreased risk for adverse birth outcomes (Orr et al., 2012) and a reduction 
in risky perinatal behaviours (e.g., substance use) (Blake et al., 2007). Importantly, while 
pregnancy is often portrayed as and/or expected to be a happy time in a woman’s life 
(Staneva & Wigginton, 2018), the prenatal and postpartum periods are also associated with 
dramatic biological changes and stressors (e.g., physical changes, morning sickness, breast 
tenderness, etc.) as well as changes in a women’s psychosocial role (e.g., potential changes 
in workplace roles and family responsibilities) (Bjelica et al., 2018; Schaffir, 2016). Thus, 
to help inform the timing and targets for perinatal care, there is a need to better understand 
the ways in which psychological well-being changes during this important transitional 
period. Investigating factors associated with increases or decreases in psychological well-
being during the perinatal period is a key step to promoting health and informing early 
preventative interventions during the pregnancy and postpartum periods.

Components of Psychological Well-being

Two major aspects of psychological well-being are satisfaction with life and a sense of 
flourishing (Diener, 1984; Diener et al., 2010; Steptoe et al., 2015). Satisfaction with life is 
evaluative well-being, reflecting the extent to which an individual positively evaluates the 
overall quality of their life (Diener, 1984; Kahneman et al., 1999; Steptoe et al., 2015). This 
includes how much a woman perceives that the current conditions of her life are excellent or 
ideal, and how much a woman favourably assesses the quality of her life as a whole (Pavot 
& Diener, 2009). In contrast, eudaimonia is achieved by living life to its fullest potential, 
with flourishing representing the major aspects of eudaimonic well-being, including positive 
relationships, feelings of competence, having meaning and purpose in life, and feelings of 
optimism (Diener et al., 2010; Ryan & Deci, 2001).

Evaluative and eudaimonic well-being are moderately correlated in prior studies (e.g., 
r = .58), but factor analyses show they represent distinct constructs (Compton et al., 
1996; McGregor & Little, 1998). In general, both life satisfaction and flourishing are 
important predictors of physical health (Krause, 2009; Siahpush et al., 2008) and mental 
health problems including depression and anxiety (Keyes & Simoes, 2012; Strine et al., 
2008). However, some evidence also suggests that life satisfaction and flourishing may 
differentially predict specific health outcomes. For example flourishing is more strongly 
associated with overall subjective health compared with life satisfaction (Joshanloo & 
Jovanović, 2018). Thus, life satisfaction and flourishing may have some unique associations 
with health outcomes, highlighting the importance of examining both factors across the 
perinatal period.

Changes in Well-being in the Perinatal Period

Few studies have directly investigated the extent to which psychological well-being changes 
during and after pregnancy. Results from a few European studies suggest that psychological 
well-being may increase from pregnancy to postpartum. Gebuza et al. (2014) found that 
satisfaction with life significantly increased from the third trimester to the postpartum

period. Dyrdal et al. (2011) reported comparable results, showing an increase in life 
satisfaction from pregnancy to 6-months postpartum. Further, Bassi et al. (2017) found that, 
among primiparous women, measures related to flourishing (e.g., self-acceptance, personal 
growth) increased significantly from mid-pregnancy (22–32 weeks’ gestation) to 3–6 months 
postpartum.

However, several gaps remain in our understanding of changes in psychological well-being 
across the peripartum period. First, few studies have reported on psychological well-being 
before pregnancy, and so it remains unclear whether changes occur in the transition to 
parenthood or whether, in fact, they are a function of becoming pregnant. For example, 
we do not know if the increase in well-being from pregnancy to postpartum represents 
an elevated level of well-being after having a child, or if a women’s well-being is simply 
lower during pregnancy and returns to similar preconception levels after giving birth. In one 
notable study, Dyrdal & Lucas (2013) reported that change in life satisfaction followed a 
quadratic pattern starting with an increase from preconception to pregnancy followed by 
a return to baseline early in the postpartum period. In this study, however, no measure 
of flourishing was included, and only a single question measured life satisfaction, raising 
questions about the validity of the measure. Hence, additional longitudinal studies are 
needed that begin in preconception and include rigorous measures of multiple types of 
well-being.

In addition, most existing research reflects the experiences of relatively homogenous 
samples that have typically comprised White and economically privileged women from 
European countries. Participants included in prior studies have typically had a mean 
age of approximately 30 years, with few studies including younger mothers. Hence, 
additional work is needed within younger samples, especially since pregnant women 
may have additional vulnerabilities that could directly impact levels of psychological 
well-being including elevated risk for experiencing stressful life events, financial strain or 
resource needs, and vulnerability to perinatal mental health problems including postpartum 
depression (Estrin et al., 2019; Kingston et al., 2012). Altogether, this limited focus in 
demographics, a longstanding problem in psychological science, has severely limited the 
generalizability of findings to the broader population (Henrich et al., 2010; Roberts et al., 
2020).

Racial Disparities in Well-being During Pregnancy

The lack of generalizability of prior findings is particularly problematic in the context 
of stark racial inequities in maternal health and perinatal health outcomes in the United 
States. Specifically, compared to pregnant White women in the U.S., Black women are 
at higher risk for eclampsia, pre-term birth, and pregnancy related mortality (DeSisto et 
al., 2018; Gold et al., 2014; Petersen et al., 2019). Further, in addition to a wide range 
of known disparities in perinatal physical health and health outcomes, racial inequities in 
mental health such as depression and anxiety during pregnancy have also repeatedly been 
reported (Ponting et al., 2020; Rich-Edwards et al., 2006). A number of systemically-rooted 
factors have been theorized to explain these disparities in health during pregnancy, including 
differential exposure to chronic stress, as well as structural and gendered racism, and

mistreatment in prenatal care (Kramer et al., 2011; Mehra et al., 2020; J. K. Taylor, 2020; 
Vedam et al., 2019; Wallace et al., 2017). Studies comparing the experiences of Black and 
White women in the United States support this framework. For example, Black American 
women experience higher levels of discrimination than White women in pregnant samples 
(Seng et al., 2012), and Black women who experience more racial discrimination report 
lower levels of psychological well-being (Giurgescu et al., 2017). Further, pregnant Black 
women are twice as likely as pregnant White women to experience financial and relationship 
stressors in addition to acute (e.g., involved in a car accident) and traumatic (e.g., death 
of a family member) stress (Zhao et al., 2015). Heightened levels of stress related to 
socioeconomic inequities in exposure may lead to lower perinatal psychological well-being 
among Black than White women. For example, differences in financial strain partially 
explained why Black women reported lower feelings of happiness related to pregnancy 
compared to White women (Hartnett & Brantley, 2020).

While no known studies have considered patterns of psychological well-being change 
across the perinatal period in Black American women, recent cross-sectional work has 
provided evidence that Black American women face disparities in psychological well-being 
during pregnancy, specifically disparities in life satisfaction. For example, Hartnett and 
Brantley (2020) found that among 6,163 women (34% Black American), Black American 
women were less happy about their pregnancies than White American women. In addition, 
in a cross-sectional study of 367,339 women (11% Black American), Hagstrom & Wu 
(2016) reported that being pregnant was positively associated with life satisfaction for 
White American women, but not for Black American women. Importantly, the different 
levels of well-being reported by White and Black women could not be explained by 
sociodemographic factors, including age, income, physical health, marital status, number 
of prior children, and education attainment suggesting a role for other explanatory factors. 
In contrast, while we know of no work during pregnancy, some evidence suggests that 
flourishing levels may not follow the same patterns as life satisfaction with respect to racial 
disparities. For example, Keyes (2009) suggests that individuals who identify as Black may 
have greater resilience, leading to higher levels of flourishing levels compared to individuals 
who identify as White.

Present Study

In the current study, we measured life satisfaction and flourishing before, during, and after 
pregnancy in a sample of young Black and White women living in an urban area of the 
United States. We used a within-person, longitudinal approach so that each woman served 
as her own ‘control,’ in order to examine changes in well-being over the perinatal period 
relative to preconception levels. In addition, we investigated whether patterns of perinatal 
change in well-being differed between Black American and White American women 
and examined the potential role of differences in life stress and perceived discrimination/
unfair treatment during pregnancy. We hypothesized that, for the sample as a whole, 1) 
psychological well-being (i.e., life satisfaction and flourishing) would increase over the 
perinatal period, from preconception to postpartum; 2) changes in life satisfaction, but not 
flourishing, would vary by race such that White American women would report increases 
in life satisfaction over the perinatal period, whereas Black American women would report

stable levels of life satisfaction across all three periods; and 3) the association between race 
and changes in well-being during the perinatal period would be partially mediated by group 
differences in changes in life stress and perceptions of discrimination/unfair treatment from 
preconception to pregnancy.

Methods

Sample and Procedure

The sample consisted of 173 pregnant women recruited from the Pittsburgh Girls Study, a 
community-based, longitudinal study that began in 1999–2000 (Keenan et al., 2010). The 
original sample of 2,450 girls was identified using a stratified, random household sampling 
of 103,238 city households with an oversampling of low-income neighbourhoods. The girls 
were aged 5–8 years in assessment wave 1 and have been followed annually for the past 
19 years with high retention (average 89%). The Pittsburgh Girls Study sample is racially 
diverse (52% Black, 41% White, 7% multiracial or other) and at the start of the study 39% 
of households received public assistance.

The Pittsburgh Girls Study began collecting data on psychological well-being at age 18 
(wave 14); thus, Black and White American participants for the present analysis were 
included if they were 18 years or older at the time of preconception (T0) and had 
completed repeated measures of psychological well-being at T0, at pregnancy (T1), and 
in the postpartum period (T2). We identified 205 participants that completed a Pittsburgh 
Girls Study interview during both pregnancy (T1) and in the postpartum period (T2). Of 
these 205 identified participants, 17 were then excluded due to missing data. Hence there 
were 188 participants with complete data at T0, T1 and T2. Among this sample, 173 women 
identified as Black or White, with 131 (76%) identifying as Black (1 of whom also identified 
as Latinx) and 42 (24%) women as non-Hispanic White.

The 173 women included in analyses did not significantly differ from the 17 participants 
excluded due to missing data with regards to age at conception (t(188)=, p=.74) or race 
(χ2 (1)=2.85 p=.09). However, excluded participants were more likely to be multiparous 
(χ2(1)=5.27, p=.02). All study procedures were approved by the University’s Institutional 
Review Board (IRB) and written informed consent was obtained prior to any data collection.

Life satisfaction.—The Satisfaction with Life Scale (SLS; Larsen, Diener, & Emmons, 
1985) was administered at preconception (T0), pregnancy (T1) and postpartum (T2) to 
assess global life satisfaction. Five items (e.g., “In most ways my life is close to ideal”) were 
rated on 7-point scales (1=strongly disagree to 7=strongly agree) and summed to form a total 
life satisfaction score (α = .884 at T0, .885 at T1, and .881 at T2). The SLS scale has shown 
good convergent validity with other measures of life satisfaction and good temporal stability, 
while still being sensitive to changes in life satisfaction over time (Pavot & Diener, 2009). 
It also has shown strong internal reliability as well as discriminant validity from emotional 
well-being measures, such as positive/negative affect questionnaires (Pavot & Diener, 2009).

Flourishing.—The Flourishing Life Scale (FLS; Diener et al., 2010) administered at T0, 
T1 and T2, is an 8-item questionnaire that assesses positive self-regard and functioning in 
several aspects of life. Participants used a 7-point scale (ranging from 1=strongly disagree 
to 7=strongly agree) to rate the degree to which they thought a phrase related to them 
(e.g., “I lead a purposeful and meaningful life”; “My social relationships are supportive 
and rewarding”). Item scores were summed to form a total flourishing score (α = .818 at 
T0, .880 at T1, and .899 at T2). The FLS has demonstrated high reliability and convergent 
validity with other measure of psychological well-being (Diener et al., 2010).

Life Stress.—The Difficult Life Circumstances Scale (DLC; Barnard et al., 1994) is a 
measure designed to assess problems faced by women with children who are living in 
low-resourced environments. The scale was administered at T0 and T1 to assess stressful life 
events. The DLC is a 28-item checklist of stressful experiences encompassing problems with 
romantic partners, finances, housing, health, crime, and abuse. Each item is answered 0=no 
and 1=yes and is used to create a total score ranging from 0–28 (α = .649 at T0 and .591 at 
T1).

Perceived discrimination or unfair treatment.—The Everyday Discrimination Scale 
(EDS; Williams, Yu, Jackson, & Anderson, 1997) was completed at T0 and T1. The 
EDS comprises 9-items that assess perceptions of discrimination or unfair treatment. The 
questions posed by this measure are open-ended to allow individuals to report on any 
perceptions of unfair treatment regardless of the perceived reason (e.g., race, gender, body 
size). Items (e.g., “How often were you treated with less respect than other people?”) are 
scored on 4-point Likert scales (ranging from 0=never to 4=often) and summed to form a 
total score (α = .855 at T0 and .874 at T1). Within other studies, the EDS has shown good 
reliability and validity (Clark et al., 2004).

Covariates.—At time T0, participants reported on employment, cohabitation status, and 
whether they received public assistance (e.g., The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program 
for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC)). Severity of depressive symptoms at T0 were 
assessed using the Adult Self-Report Inventory-4 (ASRI-4; (Gadow et al., 2004), a scale 
with high convergent and discriminant validity (Gadow et al., 2004). The 11 items on 
this sub-scale included 9 DSM-IV symptoms plus two additional related symptoms: low 
self-esteem and hopelessness. Each item was assessed on a 4-point scale (0 = never, 3 = 
all the time). At T2, participants reported on parity (0=nulliparous, 1=parous), and date 
of their child’s birth, which was used to determine weeks postpartum and to estimate 
the participant’s age at conception as well as gestational age at T1, based on a 40-week 
pregnancy.

Data Analytic Plan

Prior to analyses, data were screened for outliers, which were handled using the 
winsorization method to reduce bias (Kwak & Kim, 2017). We then examined bivariate 
correlations between eight potential covariates and satisfaction with life, flourishing, and 
race. Covariates comprised employment status, receipt of public assistance, cohabitation, 
and depression severity each assessed at T0, as well as maternal age at conception,

parity, gestational age at T1, and weeks postpartum at T2. Variables that were statistically 
associated with satisfaction with life, flourishing, and/or race were retained in final models.

Repeated measure MANOVAs were computed to examine the effect of race and time 
on life satisfaction and flourishing. To test the hypothesis that changes in life stress and 
discrimination from preconception to pregnancy mediated the association between race and 
changes in life satisfaction/flourishing across the peripartum period, the PROCESS macro 
for SPSS (Preacher & Hayes, 2008) was used to assess two multiple mediation models 
using bootstrapping with 5,000 resamples. Race was entered as the independent variable, 
and T1 life stress and perceived discrimination/unfair treatment were simultaneously entered 
as mediators with T0 life stress and discrimination as additional covariates. We examined 
four dependent variables (i.e., total of four mediation models): (1) change in life satisfaction 
from preconception to pregnancy (T1-T0) (2) changes in life satisfaction from pregnancy 
to postpartum (T2-T1) (3) changes in flourishing from preconception to pregnancy (T1-T0) 
and (4) changes in flourishing from pregnancy to postpartum (T2-T1).

Descriptive statistics are shown in Table 1. Participants had a mean age of 22 years at time 
of conception (SD = 1.68, range = 18–26). On average, the T1 assessment was completed 
at 21.71 weeks’ gestation (SD=8.89, range = 6–39) and the T2 assessment was completed 
at 7.46 months (32.41 weeks) postpartum (SD = 11.15, range = 3–58). More than half of 
the sample (58%) were nulliparous at T0 and 13% reported living with a spouse or domestic 
partner. Approximately 71% were employed and 23% were receiving public assistance.

Bivariate correlations are shown in Table 2. Severity of depression symptoms, living with a 
partner, maternal age at conception, primiparity, and gestational age at T1 were all related to 
life satisfaction, flourishing, and/or race and thus were included as covariates in subsequent 
models.

Results

Change in Well-being Across the Peripartum Period

Overall MANOVA results showed a significant main effect of time (Λ = .965, F(4, 662) = 
2 = .018) and a significant interaction of time x race (Λ = .921, F(4, 662) = 
3.02, p =.02, ƞp
6.97, p < .001, ƞp

2 = .04) after controlling for covariates.

As shown in Table 3, after adjusting for covariates, there was no significant effect of race or 
time on life satisfaction. However, a significant interaction of race x time on life satisfaction 
was revealed. Post-hoc analyses suggest that life satisfaction significantly increased from T0 
to T1, remaining elevated from T1 to T2 for White women but not Black women (Figure 1).

Also in Table 3, after controlling for covariates, there was a main effect of time flourishing. 
Flourishing levels did not vary by race but there was a significant interaction of race x 
time on flourishing (Figure 2). Examining year-to-year changes for Black and White women 
separately revealed an increase in flourishing from T0 to T1 for Black but not White women 
and an increase in flourishing from T1 to T2 for White but not for Black women (Figure 2).

Multiple Mediation Models for Psychological Well-being

Life Satisfaction: Preconception (T0) to Pregnancy (T1).—As shown in Figure 3, 
the total effect of race on change in life satisfaction from preconception (T0) to pregnancy 
(T1) was significant, such that White women reported greater increases in life satisfaction 
than Black women after adjusting for covariates. After adjusting for life stress at T0, race 
was not associated with T1 life stress nor perceived discrimination/unfair treatment. Further, 
the proposed mediators were not associated with changes in life satisfaction. There were no 
significant indirect effects of race on changes in life satisfaction from T0 to T1 via life stress 
(B = −.23, SE = .19, 95% CI [−.69, .02]) or perceived discrimination/unfair treatment (B 
=−.07, SE = .14, 95% CI [−.42, .16]).

Life Satisfaction: Pregnancy (T1) to postpartum (T2).—Figure 3 shows that the 
effect of race on change in life satisfaction from T1 to T2 was not significant after 
controlling for covariates. Race did not predict changes in life stress nor perceived 
discrimination/ unfair treatment from T0 to T1 nor did the proposed mediators predict 
changes in life satisfaction from T1 to T2. The indirect effect of race on changes in life 
satisfaction from T1 to T2 through life stress (B = −.10, SE = .18, 95% CI [−.50, .23]) 
and perceived discrimination/unfair treatment (B =.05, SE = .13, 95% CI [−.18, .37]) were 
nonsignificant.

Flourishing: Preconception (T0) to Pregnancy (T1).—As shown in Figure 4, the 
total effect of race on flourishing was not significant from T0 to T1 after adjusting for 
covariates. Race was not associated with T1 life stress nor perceived discrimination/unfair 
treatment after accounting for T0 levels. Neither life stress nor perceived discrimination/
unfair treatment were associated with flourishing from T0 to T1. None of the indirect 
effects through life stress (B = −.14, SE = .15, 95% CI [−.49, .12]) or discrimination/unfair 
treatment (B = .00, SE = .07, 95% CI [−.11, .19]) were significant when predicting changes 
in flourishing from T0 to T1.

Flourishing: Pregnancy (T1) to postpartum (T2).—Figure 4 shows that when 
predicting changes in flourishing from T1 to T2, the total effect of race was significant 
after controlling for covariates: Black mothers showed less increase in flourishing from 
T1 to T2. However, race was not associated with life stress nor perceived discrimination/
unfair treatment after controlling for all covariates. None of the proposed mediators were 
associated with changes in flourishing from T1 to T2. The indirect effect of race on changes 
in flourishing from T1 to T2 through life stress (B = −.17, SE = .21, 95% CI [−.69, .17]) 
and perceived discrimination/unfair treatment (B =.04, SE = .16, 95% CI [−.28, .38]) were 
nonsignificant.

Discussion

The primary aims of this study were to investigate changes in psychological well-being 
(i.e., life satisfaction and flourishing) across the perinatal period and to consider how these 
changes in well-being differed between young (mean age = 22 years) Black and White 
American women. The main strengths of our study included the ability to leverage unique

data collected from a longitudinal study that began prior to the target pregnancy. The current 
study used a within-person analytic approach to examine changes spanning the period from 
preconception through postpartum to fully capture the transition to parenthood. In addition, 
the study extended prior research with the goal of increasing generalizability of findings by 
utilizing data from a racially and economically diverse community sample of young Black 
and White American women.

Overall, our findings highlight the importance of considering the socio-demographic 
characteristics of women included in perinatal research studies, given that patterns of change 
in psychological well-being across the perinatal period were moderated by race. Several 
key findings emerged: 1) Satisfaction with life increased over the perinatal period for 
White but not Black American women. 2) Flourishing levels showed different patterns of 
change, increasing from preconception to pregnancy for Black American women and from 
pregnancy to postpartum for White American women. However, no change in flourishing 
was observed from preconception to postpartum for Black or White women. 3) None of 
these changes were explained by our proposed mediators: life stress nor discrimination/
unfair treatment. Below, we discuss each of these findings in the context of prior research 
and highlight directions for future research.

Most participants in this study reported a ‘high’ score on the Satisfaction with Life Scale 
throughout the entirety of the perinatal period, which is consistent with a review study 
showing that people generally report high levels of life satisfaction during pregnancy 
(Battulga et al., 2021; Diener, n.d.). Thus, despite being a younger sample with relatively 
higher socioeconomic strain, most of the young pregnant women in our study generally felt 
that things were going well in their lives, and that life was enjoyable (Diener et al., 1985).

Black and White American women differed in their patterns of life satisfaction across 
the perinatal period. White women in our study reported an increase in life satisfaction 
from preconception to pregnancy; this elevation in life satisfaction remained stable from 
pregnancy to postpartum. The increase reported by White women in our study over the 
perinatal period is consistent with findings from prior studies conducted in European 
countries. In contrast, Black American women reported stable life satisfaction levels across 
all timepoints, which is consistent with a prior cross-sectional study that showed a positive 
association between pregnancy and life satisfaction for White but not Black American 
women (Hagstrom & Wu, 2016). Our findings suggest that these racial disparities in life 
satisfaction during pregnancy are specifically driven by differences in how life satisfaction 
changes from preconception to pregnancy for Black vs. White American women, differences 
that then persist into the postpartum period.

Further, while past work drawn primarily from pregnant women in their late 20s-30s has 
shown an increase in life satisfaction from pregnancy to postpartum periods, our study 
showed stable levels from pregnancy to postpartum for both White and Black American 
women. Hence, it may be helpful for future studies to investigate why some women may 
see an increase in life satisfaction from pregnancy to postpartum, while others do not. One 
potential explanatory factor could be that our sample is comprised of younger women, who 
may face additional challenges after birth that may impact their levels of life satisfaction

during the postpartum period, including increased experiences of postpartum depression 
symptoms (Estrin et al., 2019; Kingston et al., 2012). Additionally, much of prior work has 
been with European samples, thus policy differences between European countries and the 
U.S. (e.g., parental leave, health insurance, etc.) may also explain this differential finding.

Of note, although there were significant race differences in the pattern of life satisfaction 
change, overall levels of life satisfaction remained in the “high” category for both Black 
and White American women. These findings suggest that while Black women may not 
experience a significant increase in satisfaction across the perinatal period, they continue to 
report overall high levels of life satisfaction. Although we observed no group differences 
in preconception or prenatal levels, future work could consider person-centered analytic 
approaches, as this may reveal that those with a lower life satisfaction at preconception show 
greater increases by virtue of having more room for improvement, and therefore a greater 
likelihood of growth in satisfaction from preconception to pregnancy.

Further, our results highlight the importance of considering different aspects of well-being 
given that, compared to life satisfaction, levels of flourishing followed a different pattern 
of change across the perinatal period. Again, for White American women, self-reported 
levels of flourishing remained stable from preconception to pregnancy; flourishing levels 
then increased from pregnancy to postpartum. In contrast, for Black American women, 
flourishing levels increased from preconception to pregnancy but did not significantly 
change from pregnancy to postpartum. Notably, postpartum levels of flourishing did 
not differ significantly from preconception levels for White or Black American women. 
Further, although the increase in flourishing from pregnancy to postpartum among White 
American women has been reported in prior work (Bassi et al., 2017), no studies to our 
knowledge have contextualized these findings relative to preconception levels or probed race 
differences in a U.S. sample. Our study suggests that although White American mothers 
may report increases in flourishing from pregnancy to postpartum, levels of flourishing in 
the postpartum period do not appear to be significantly higher than preconception levels. 
In addition, our results indicate that while overall levels of flourishing across the perinatal 
period did not differ between Black and White American women, the developmental pattern 
did vary by race. Given this, future research should explore potential mechanisms that may 
account for the race differences in patterns of life satisfaction and flourishing changes across 
the perinatal period.

Our third hypothesis stated that life stress and discrimination/unfair treatment would act 
as explanatory factors for the relationship between race and perinatal well-being change. 
We found that changes in discrimination/unfair treatment did not mediate the relationship 
between race and changes in perinatal well-being. In addition, race did not predict changes 
in perceived discrimination/unfair treatment across the perinatal period. These findings 
may have been influenced by how the specific measure of discrimination was used in 
this study. Indeed, a few recent studies have highlighted potential limitations of the 
Everyday Discrimination Scale for group comparisons due to the way that items are 
worded (Harnois et al., 2019). In addition, when our study implemented this measure, 
the measure asked questions about perceived mistreatment in a broad context, without 
specifying discriminating behaviour or considering attribution of the mistreatment (i.e., race,

gender, age, etc.). Hence, these results may limit the ability to compare discrimination 
experiences between White and Black American women. Further, past work suggests there 
are many predictors of perceived discrimination levels that are relevant for our sample 
of young mothers. Some predictors of discrimination include cohabitation status, lifetime 
number of lifetime sexual partners, and birth control use (Hall et al., 2015). While we 
were able to control for multiple socio-demographic and health variables (i.e., receipt of 
public assistance, employment, age at conception, parity, and cohabitation status), other 
unmeasured factors may have influenced levels of perceived discrimination in this study. In 
addition, a proportion of the included participants were over-sampled from lower-resourced 
neighbourhoods, and past work shows that unfair treatment is differently associated with 
socioeconomic status (SES) for Black vs. White Americans. Specifically, evidence suggests 
that SES is negatively associated with discrimination for White Americans, but positively 
associated with discrimination for Black Americans (Hudson et al., 2012; Lewis et al., 
2015). The lack of variability in income levels for the Black women in our sample may have 
impacted the range of discrimination experiences.

Several additional study limitations are important to mention. First, because data were drawn 
from a longitudinal study that administered annual assessments, the timing of the prenatal 
and postpartum assessments varied substantially. Although we covaried for the time at which 
T1 and T2 measures were assessed (i.e., weeks gestation and postpartum), future studies 
with multiple assessments within each life stage are needed to examine the extent to which 
well-being changes over the course of pregnancy (i.e., from one trimester to the next) or over 
the course of the first year postpartum. Second, while this study elucidated differences in 
well-being between young, Black and White American women over the perinatal period, the 
sample comprised young mothers who identified as one of these two races and who were 
mostly single and from lower-resourced neighbourhoods. Thus, future work should consider 
how well-being changes over the perinatal period among a broader sample of reproductive 
aged women, representing other race/ethnicities and the continuum of SES. Third, some of 
the proposed mediators were measured at the same time as some of the outcome variables 
(T0 to T1), precluding interpretations about the directionality of effects. Finally, our sample 
size was relatively modest (n=173), with unequal samples between White (n=42) and Black 
(n=131) participants; future work would benefit from a larger sample with more equal 
distributions among racial groups to increase statistical power.

Altogether, our findings point to a need for further research as well as several potential 
policy and clinical implications. Given that maternal psychological well-being has been 
linked to the health of both the mother and the child (Blake et al., 2007; Orr et al., 2012), 
and that Black American women experience significant health-related disparities in both 
prenatal health (Gold et al., 2014) and birth outcomes (Schaaf et al., 2013), it may be 
important to target the causes of psychological well-being disparities, specifically within life 
satisfaction. Our findings suggest that, on average, young Black American women may not 
experience the same increase in life satisfaction that White American women report over the 
perinatal period. However neither our measure for life stress nor unfair treatment explained 
these disparities. Hence, additional work to elucidate the causes of the racial differences 
in life satisfaction change is clearly warranted. Given the limitations of our discrimination 
scale, and the well documented effects of racial discrimination for Black women in the U.S.,

the disparities within psychological well-being documented in our paper suggest the need 
to further explore the relationship between gendered racism and changes in psychological 
well-being from preconception to postpartum (Forson-Dare et al., 2021; Giscombé & Lobel, 
2005; Mehra et al., 2020; Rosenthal & Lobel, 2011). In addition to this, future work should 
also consider other factors that could bolster changes in life satisfaction for Black American 
women. One such factor may be social support; a review study found that social support 
is positively related to life satisfaction during pregnancy (Battulga et al., 2021) and a close 
mother-daughter relationship during pregnancy can help to support positive emotions linked 
to well-being during pregnancy among young Black pregnant women (Tung et al., 2021).

Clinically, our results suggest it may also be helpful to screen for low life satisfaction 
levels during pregnancy. While many of the mothers in this study did report high levels 
of life satisfaction, for mothers who report low life satisfaction levels, emerging evidence 
suggests positive psychology interventions, conducted in-person by midwifes or online, is 
effective in improving well-being during the perinatal period (Corno et al., 2018; Zhang 
& Emory, 2015). Further, recent research shows that when women are provided additional 
support before and after birth by a doula, measures related to psychological well-being (i.e., 
self-esteem, self-efficacy, social support) increase (McLeish & Redshaw, 2019). Given the 
potential positive effects of both positive intervention therapy as well as doula support, our 
current analyses suggest a need for greater access to therapy and doulas during the perinatal 
period as a means of increasing support for young Black American mothers during and after 
pregnancy.

Conclusions:

Our study investigated changes in psychological well-being (life satisfaction and flourishing) 
over the perinatal period among a sample of young Black and White American women. The 
perinatal period appeared to have a positive effect on satisfaction with life levels for White 
but not Black American women. In contrast, flourishing showed slightly different pattern of 
change for Black and White women. Given that women who are very satisfied with their life 
are at a lower risk for pre-term birth (Orr et al., 2012), additional effort is needed to promote 
levels of life satisfaction during the perinatal period for young Black American women with 
the ultimate goal of reducing racial disparities in perinatal health.
