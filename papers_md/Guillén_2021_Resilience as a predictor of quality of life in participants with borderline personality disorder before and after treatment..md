Abstract

Background: Studies have suggested that psychotherapy improves the Quality of Life (QoL) of participants with
Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD). However, there are no studies on the differential efficacy of treatments on the
QoL of participants with BPD. Moreover, the relationship between QoL and resilience has rarely been studied in
participants with BPD. Objectives: a) to examine whether people with BPD have worse QoL than the non-clinical
population; b) to examine whether there are statistically significant differences between Dialectical Behavioural
Therapy (DBT), Systems Training for Emotional Predictability and Problem Solving (STEPPS), or Cognitive Behavioural
Therapy-Treatment at Usual (CBT-TAU) in the improvement of QoL; c) to examine whether participants show
clinically significant improvements in QoL after treatment; d) to analyse whether resilience is associated with QoL
before and after the BPD treatment; e) to analyse whether resilience is a predictor of QoL at pre-treatment and
posttreatment.
Method: The sample comprised 403 participants (n = 202 participants diagnosed with BPD and n = 201 non-
clinical). Participants filled out the Quality of Life Index, Resilience Scale, and Beck Depression Inventory. The clinical
participants received one of these possible treatments, DBT, STEPPS, or CBT-TAU. MANOVA and regression analyses
were performed.
Results: a) participants diagnosed with BPD had statistically significant lower resilience than the non-clinical
population; b) all three forms of psychotherapy statistically improved QoL, but there were no statistically significant
differences between DBT, STEPPS, and CBT-TAU in the improvement of QoL; c) participants did not show clinically
significant improvements in QoL after treatment; d) resilience was associated with QoL before and after treatment;
and e) resilience was a predictor of QoL before and after treatment.

Conclusion: It is necessary to assess QoL and Resilience in studies on psychotherapy with BPD patients.

Background
There is a broad consensus in the research that Quality
of life (QoL) is a multidimensional construct that can be
defined as “an overall general well-being that comprises
objective descriptors and subjective evaluations of phys-
ical, material, social, and emotional wellbeing together
with the extent of personal development and purposeful
activity, all weighted by a personal set of values” [1].

Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is characterized
by instability in interpersonal relationships, self-image,
affects, and impulse control, severe functional
impair-
ment, and a high risk of suicide [2]. Moreover, BPD is
associated with high comorbidity with other mental dis-
orders, such as eating disorders, post-traumatic stress
disorders, mood disorders, anxiety disorders, and other
personality disorders [3, 4].

Perseius, Andersson, Asberg and Samuelsson [5] found
that QoL scores in Swedish participants with BPD were
more than one standard deviation below the scores of
the non-clinical population. Lawford and Eiser [6] sug-
gest that when patients rate their QoL, they place greater
emphasis on mental functioning than on physical func-
tioning. Therefore, BPD clinical features could affect and
worsen QoL in individuals with a BPD diagnosis. Indeed,
Cramer, Torgersen and Kringlen [7] found that people
with BPD (along with avoidant, schizotypal, schizoid,
and paranoid personality disorders) had poorer QoL
compared to those with no BPD, and low QoL was asso-
ciated with lower subjective well-being and more nega-
tive life events. Other studies found that QoL declines
due to: the symptomatology of the disorder, comorbidi-
ties with other mental conditions [8], suicide attempts
and self-harm [9], hospitalizations [10], physical illnesses
[11], shame, low self-esteem, anger, and hostility [12].
However, Thompson et al., [13] in a recent study with
young participants with BPD,
found that depression
symptoms were the best predictor of worse QoL, and
that frequency of hospitalizations, suicide attempts, and
non-suicidal self-injuries (NSSI) were not associated
with QoL. Despite results suggesting that QoL is highly
impaired in people with BPD, the research on QoL in
BPD is scarce.

QoL is an important indicator of the outcome of treat-
ment interventions in several mental disorders, such as
bipolar [14] or panic disorders [15]. However, QoL is
rarely assessed as an outcome measure in efficacy treat-
ment studies of BPD [16]. Treatment effectiveness in
BPD has usually been measured as a change in the
symptomatology (i.e. improvement or reduction), such
as NSSI, suicide attempts and frequency of hospitaliza-
tions, and social
functioning. Nonetheless, many pa-
tients’ needs are not met [17], and symptom reduction
does not always translate into restoration of QoL to nor-
mal levels.

Schema-focused

In the case of Dialectical Behavioural Therapy (DBT),
only two randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have ana-
lysed the effectiveness of DBT for QoL, finding that QoL
improved after DBT. McMain et al. [18] found that DBT
had similar effects on QoL improvement as general psy-
chiatric management, and Carter et al. [19] found that
DBT more significantly improved QoL, compared to
treatment as usual (TAU). In addition, Systems training
for emotional predictability and problem solving (STEP
PS) was found to be more effective than TAU in improv-
ing QoL [20]. In the case of Cognitive-behavioural ther-
apy (CBT), three RCTs analysed the effects of CBT on
QoL and found that CBT groups had sustained QoL im-
provement, but not significantly different from TAU
[21] or Rogerian supportive therapy [22]. Finally, two
RCTs
to
Transference-focused therapy [23], and both groups im-
proved their QoL, with differences between the two con-
ditions depending on the QoL outcome measure [24,
25]. Nadort et al. [26] found that Schema-Focused Ther-
independently of
apy was effective in improving QoL,
telephone therapist availability during crises. Finally [27],
a meta-analysis of the efficacy of BPD psychotherapy on
QoL found that psychotherapy produced improvements
in QoL, with a moderate effect size of d = 0.32 (95% CI
[0.17, 0.48]. Thus, the aforementioned studies suggest
that all the forms of psychotherapy improved QoL, but
none of the treatment studies examined whether the im-
provements in QoL represented clinically significant
changes [28] in the participants’ QoL [16]. To find out
whether the treatment resulted in clinically significant
change,
first, analyse
whether reliable change was achieved; and second, com-
pare the difference between post-treatment clinical
scores and the scores of healthy populations on the mea-
sures utilized. The change can only be considered clinic-
ally significant when the treatment brings about a
reliable change and the outcomes become similar to
those found in healthy populations [28].

two conditions are necessary:

Resilience can generally be defined as ‘the capacity of a
dynamic system to withstand or recover from significant
challenges that threaten its stability, viability, or develop-
ment’ [29], and it is a dynamic process that leads to suc-
cessful
individual adjustment in the face of adversity
[30]. The relationship between QoL and resilience has
been widely studied in chronic disease [6], the human
immunodeficiency virus [31], multiple sclerosis,
[32],
and cancer [33]. In mental disorders, several studies
found that resilience was a significant predictor of QoL
in individuals with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and
healthy controls, such that higher resilience led to higher
QoL [34–36].

Resilience has rarely been studied in participants with
BPD (e.g., [37]). Several authors [38] suggest that the

Guillén et al. BMC Psychiatry          (2021) 21:305

absence of resilience is a core characteristic of BPD, and
it results from inflexibility in the human capacity for so-
cial communication and difficulties with reappraisal
when facing negative experiences in social interactions.
Thus, all the effective treatments are effective because
they open up the patient to social learning experiences,
and therapeutic change is probably due to the way pa-
tients come to use their social environment. One conse-
quence of this theory is that effective treatment would
improve the resilience of participants with BPD and be
associated with a reduction in patients’ symptoms and
an increase in QoL.

Nevertheless, as far as we know, there are no studies
that explore the association between resilience and QoL
in participants with BPD. Thus, the objectives of the
study are: a) to examine whether people with BPD have
worse QoL than the non-clinical population; b) to exam-
ine whether there are statistically significant differences
between DBT, STEPPS, and TAU-CBT in the improve-
ment in QoL; c) to examine whether participants show
clinically significant improvements in QoL after treat-
ment; d) to analyse whether resilience is associated with
QoL before and after the BPD treatment; and e) to ana-
lyse whether resilience is a predictor of QoL at pre-
treatment and posttreatment.

Based on previous studies, we hypothesize that: a)
people with BPD will have worse QoL than the non-
clinical population; b) all the types of psychotherapy will
improve QoL; c) after treatment, participants will not
show clinically significant improvements in QoL; d) re-
silience will be strongly associated with QoL before and
after the BPD treatment; e) resilience will be a predictor
of QoL before and after the BPD treatment.

Method
Participants
The clinical sample comprised 202 Spanish participants
diagnosed with BPD, 80.7%, n = 163, of whom were fe-
male. The mean age was 28.93 years (SD = 9.40). Regard-
ing their marital status, 46.5%, n = 94, were married or
had a partner, and 53.46%, n = 108, were single, di-
level,
vorced, or widowed. Regarding the educational
2.5%, n = 5, had no studies; 27.7%, n = 56, had primary
school level studies; 48%, n = 97, had a high school edu-
cation; and 21.8%, n = 44, had university level studies.
Regarding the participants’ psychiatric comorbidity,
78.2%, n = 158, matched the criteria for another mental
disorder. Of them, 62.5%, n = 127, met eating disorder
criteria; 6.5%, n = 13, met abuse substance disorder cri-
teria; 3.6%, n = 7, met obsessive compulsive disorder cri-
teria; 2.9%, n = 6, met anxiety disorder criteria; and 2.7%,
n = 5, met mood disorder criteria. The mean score on
the Global assessment of functioning from the DSM-IV
was 56.18 (SD = 33.69). The number of
inpatient

hospitalizations in the past year was 0.84 (SD = 1.87),
the frequency of suicide attempts in the past year was
0.41 (SD = 0.98), and the frequency of non-suicidal self-
injuries (NSSI) in the past year was 2.89 (SD = 7.63).
Moreover, 34.2% presented a physical illness.

The inclusion criterion was: patients who met the full
DSM-IV [39] criteria for BPD. The exclusion criteria in-
cluded moderate or severe intellectual disability and
meeting the criteria for schizophrenia or another psych-
otic disorder. Participants were European Whites. They
were recruited consecutively. Participants were volun-
teers who did not receive any compensation for their
participation, and they signed an informed consent form.
Ethical approval to carry out this study was granted by
the University Ethics Committee of Clinical Studies.

The non-clinical sample comprised 201 Spanish uni-
versity students without mental disorder diagnoses;
72.6%, n = 146, were female. Regarding their marital sta-
tus, 38.3%, n = 71, were married or had a partner, and
61.7%, n = 124, were single. Participants ranged in age
from 18 to 60 years, with a mean age of 22.37 years
(SD = 5.42). Participation was voluntary, and they did
not receive any compensation. Informed consent was
obtained from all participants.

Instruments
Structured clinical interview for DSM-IV axis I disorders
(SCID I) [40]. This is an interview for making the major
DSM-IV-TR [39] Axis I diagnoses. It offers good psy-
chometric properties: Kappa .66, demonstrating reliabil-
ity [41]. The Spanish version shows psychometric
properties similar to those of the original scale [42].

Structured clinical interview for DSM-IV axis II per-
sonality disorders (SCID II) [43]. This is an interview for
making DSM-IV-TR [39] Axis II Personality Disorder
diagnoses. It includes 119 questions and has a Kappa of
.74, demonstrating reliability for admitted patients [43].
The Spanish version shows psychometric properties
similar to those of the original scale [44].

Relevant clinical information inventory
Created ad hoc for this research, it collects the frequency
of NSSI (from 0 to the maximum number of NSSI).
NSSI were conceptualized as self-injurious behaviours
that were not intended to be an attempt to end one’s
life. The number of NSSI in the year prior to the initial
assessment was assessed through an open question:
Have you ever caused yourself any self-directed and de-
liberate injuries, such as cutting, hitting, scratching etc.,
with no suicidal intent? (yes/no). How many times/days
have you caused yourself such injuries in the past year?
Suicidal Attempts were conceptualized as self-inflicted,
potentially injurious behaviours with a non-fatal out-
come, but with evidence of the intention to die [45]. The

Guillén et al. BMC Psychiatry          (2021) 21:305

number of suicide behaviours in the past year was
assessed with the following question, created ad hoc for
this research: Have you ever tried to end your life? (yes/
no). How many times have you attempted suicide in the
past year? The responses related to methods were catego-
rized by clinical psychologists. Moreover, we collected the
frequency of inpatient hospitalizations in the past year.

Quality of life index (QLI) [46]. QoL was assessed by
the Spanish version [47] of the QLI, which consists of 10
items that can be rated from 0 (poor) to 10 (excellent).
Each item represents one relevant dimension of QoL:
Physical Well-being, Psychological/Emotional Well-
being, Self-care and Independent Functioning, Occupa-
tional Functioning,
Interpersonal Functioning, Social
Emotional Support, Community and Services Support,
Personal Fulfilment, Spiritual Fulfilment, and Overall
Quality of Life. Each dimension contains a brief explan-
ation in parentheses, designed to allow flexibility in the
interpretation depending on the individual’s cultural and
experiential background [48]. The final score ranges
from 1 to 10 and is obtained by calculating the average
of the scores on all the items. The translation of this
scale has shown satisfactory test-retest reliability (Cron-
bach’s α = 0.89) and validity properties, and in our sam-
ple, the reliability was adequate (α = 0.88).

Resilience Scale (RS-15) [49] Resilience was measured
by the short form of the Spanish version of the Resilience
Scale [50], which was originally developed by Wagnild and
Young [51]. The Spanish version replicated the bi-factorial
structure of the original scale (“personal competence” and
“acceptance of self and life”). Cronbach’s α for the total
scale was .93 for the general population and .94 for pa-
tients with eating disorders. The RS-15 is a 15-item self-
report measure of resilience, defined by the authors as a
positive personality trait that promotes adaptability amid
adversity. Each item is rated by the participant using a 7-
point Likert scale ranging from disagree [1] to agree [7].
Possible scores range from 15 to 105, with higher scores
indicating higher perceived resilience. Psychometric prop-
erties and internal consistency are adequate and similar to
the original scale [49]. In our sample, the reliability was
adequate (α = 0.93).

Beck depression inventory-II (BDI-II) [52]
This inventory consists of 21 items with four response
options (0–4) that rate depressive symptomatology. Its
Spanish version offers good psychometric properties
[53]. It has presented adequate reliability (Cronbach’s
α = 0.90) in Spanish participants. In our sample, the reli-
ability was adequate (α = 0.91).

Procedure
The clinical
seeking patients

sample was collected from treatment-
in
in three Specialized services

personality disorders in Spain between 2011 and 2018.
All participants were informed about the study and gave
their written informed consent. Several expert clinical
psychologists with more than 10 years of experience with
BPD treatment conducted the assessment to ensure that
patients met the inclusion criteria. The participants re-
ceived one of these possible treatments, depending on
their clinical situation and the study underway in the
clinical centres at the time of recruitment: DBT [54],
STEPPS [55], or TAU-CBT. DBT is a treatment with
broad empirical support for BPD [56]. It draws on dia-
lectical tensions of the behaviours, which can be func-
tional and dysfunctional at the same time, and it targets
a balance between acceptance and change [57]. It con-
sists of a combination of
individual psychotherapy,
group skills training, telephone coaching, and a therapist
consultation team [58]. STEPPS is a cognitive behav-
ioural model
in group format that incorporates skills
training and creates a common language for the patients
and their system [55]. In this treatment, maladaptive
schemas are confronted, and BPD is reframed as an
emotional
intensity disorder [59]. TAU-CBT is the
standard treatment protocol in clinical centres; namely,
it is a cognitive behavioural program focused on treating
the symptomatology by using CBT strategies. In our
study, it consisted of one hour of individual therapy – in
which personality psychopathology symptoms were also
addressed – and one two-hour group session per week.
The TAU-CBT group format was adapted by the clinical
team and included psychoeducation, cognitive restruc-
turing, and consolidation of achievements. All these pro-
grams lasted about 6 months, and patients completed
self-reports on resilience and QoL both before and after
the treatment. All the psychotherapeutic groups received
a similar number of psychotherapy sessions.

For the nonclinical sample, a convenience sample of
university students was recruited. The samples were
matched on age. They completed the questionnaires
during their normal day at the university.

Data analysis
Means and standard deviations and zero-order correla-
tions were calculated for all the variables at baseline
(T1) and at post-treatment
to calculate
whether there were differences in QoL between the non-
clinical population and the participants with a diagnosis
of BPD, a t-test was performed. Second, to examine
whether there were statistically significant differences
between DBT, STEPPS, and TAU in the improvement in
QoL after treatment, a MANOVA was performed, and
the effect sizes were calculated (Cohen’s d). Moreover,
we analysed whether the treatments produced a clinic-
ally significant change in QoL Three conditions are ne-
cessary to consider a change clinically significant [28]: a)

Guillén et al. BMC Psychiatry          (2021) 21:305 

Page 5 of 10

the Reliable change index (RCI) is calculated; RCI is a
methodology that indicates whether the change detected
after a treatment represents a real modification in the
patient’s clinical condition, or if
it simply reflects a
measurement error surrounding test-retest difference
scores. If there is a reliable change, the assumption can
be made that changes are due to treatment and not to a
measurement error; b) after treatment, the QoL scores
should be situated in the mean range of the normal
population (+/− SD) to interpret the functional direction
[60]; and c) the effect size is calculated using Hedge’s g
with the range of a normal population to confirm that
there are no statistically significant differences in QoL
after the treatment [61].

Finally, we performed two linear regression analyses.
In the first model, we took Resilience before treatment
(RS T1) as the predictor variable and QoL pre-treatment
(QoL T1) as the dependent variable. In the second linear
regression analysis, we took Resilience after treatment

(RS T2) as
the predictor variable and QoL post-
treatment (QoL T2) as the dependent variable. In the
two prediction models, Type of psychotherapy, Gender,
Age, and depression (BDI-II) were controlled. Potential
multicollinearity
between prediction variables was
rejected due to tolerance values and a variance inflation
factor between 0.9 and 1.3, respectively, which meet
good statistical criteria [62]. Data were analysed using
SPSS 24 [63].

Results
Participants’ flow
Figure 1 displays the participant flow diagram during
treatment. There were 202 participants assessed at pre-
treatment. In the initial sessions, six participants who
chose not to attend the therapy groups were excluded
from further treatment. Finally, 196 participants received
psychotherapy: n = 121 received DBT, n = 32 received
STEPPS, and n = 47 received TAU-CBT. During the

treatment, in the DBT group, 17.35% (n = 21) dropped
out, in the STEPPS group, 28.12% (n = 12) dropped out,
and in the TAU-CBT group, 27.91% (n = 12) dropped
out. Thus, the percentage of overall treatment dropout
was 23.46% (n = 46). The clinical sample was older than
the non-clinical sample (t(391) = 8.26, p < .001) (Cohen’s
d = 0.9).

Differences in QoL between the clinical and non-clinical
samples
Before beginning treatment, participants diagnosed with
BPD had a statistically significant lower QoL (QoL T1)
(M = 4.31, SD = 1.74) than the non-clinical population
(M = 7.86, SD = 1.24) (t(352.44) = 23.34, p < .001), with a
large effect size (Cohen’s d = 2.37) [64]. In the same way,
participants diagnosed with BPD had statistically signifi-
cant lower resilience (RS T1) (M = 51.76, SD = 18.93)
than the non-clinical population (M = 86.61, SD = 11.19)
(t(267.15) = 21.10, p < .001), with a
size
(Cohen’s d = 2.24).

Change during psychotherapy
As Table 1 shows, after the treatment, all the partici-
pants significantly increased their QoL scores (F(1,144) =
11.81, p < .001). However, there were no statistically sig-
nificant differences between DBT, STEPPS, and TAU in
the improvement in QoL after treatment (F(1,144) = 0.31,
p = .73). Moreover, participants did not show clinically
significant improvements in QoL at post-treatment be-
cause no reliable changes occurred (Reliable change
index = 1.53, p > .05), and the scores were not similar to
those of the non-clinical population (range 6.62 to 9.1),
with a moderate effect size (Hedges’ g = 0.39). Thus, the
participants diagnosed with BPD still had lower QoL
than the non-clinical sample (t(239,06), p < .001) after the
treatment.

After the treatment, the participants significantly in-
creased their resilience (t(118) = − 4.35; p < .001) and sig-
nificantly
depression (t(118) = 5.08;
p < .001). As Table 1 reveals, all the effect sizes were
moderate (range Cohen’s d = 0.35–0.41).

and positively

Moreover, resilience at pre-treatment (RS T1) was mod-
erately
correlated with QoL post-
treatment (QoL T2) and moderately and negatively cor-
related with depression post-treatment (BDI-II T2). Re-
silience at post-treatment
(RS T2) was highly and
positively correlated with QoL (QoL T2) and highly and
negatively correlated with depression (BDI-II T2). Table
2 presents the rest of the correlations.

As Table 3 shows, the model composed of resilience be-
fore the treatment (RS T1), Type of psychotherapy, Gen-
der, Age, and depression (BDI-II T1) predicted QoL pre-
treatment (T1) (R2 adjusted = .64; F(5.153) = 71.94, p < .001).
After entering Type of psychotherapy, Gender, Age, and
depression (BDI-II T1), Resilience before the treatment
(RS T1) predicted QoL pre-treatment (T1) (ΔR2 = .16). As
Table 3 shows, when analysing the individual contribution
of each predictor variable, the variables that significantly
predicted QoL (T1) were Resilience pre-treatment (RS
T1) (t = 8.48; p = .01) and depression pre-treatment (BDI-
II T1) (t = − 5.26; p = .01).

As Table 4 shows, the model composed of Resilience
after the treatment (RS T2), Type of psychotherapy, Gen-
der, Age, and depression (BDI-II T2) predicted QoL post-
treatment (T2) (R2 adjusted = .58; F(5.118) = 59.89, p < .001).
After entering Type of psychotherapy, Gender, Age, and
depression (BDI-II T2), Resilience after the treatment (RS
T2) predicted QoL posttreatment (T2) (ΔR2 = .21). As
Table 4 shows, when analysing the individual contribution
of each predictor variable, the variables that significantly
predicted QoL (T2) were Resilience posttreatment (RS
(t = 7.73; p = .001) and depression post-treatment
T2)
(BDI-II T2) (t = − 2.47; p = .01).

Discussion
The objectives of the study were: a) to examine whether
people with BPD had worse QoL than the non-clinical
population; b) to examine whether there were statisti-
cally significant differences between DBT, STEPPS, and
TAU in the improvement of QoL; c) to examine whether
participants showed clinically significant improvements
in QoL after treatment, and whether the scores were
within the range of the non-clinical population; d) to
analyse whether resilience was associated with QoL be-
fore and after the treatment for BPD; and e) to analyse

whether resilience was a predictor of the QoL at pre-
treatment and posttreatment.

Regarding the first aim, we found that participants di-
agnosed with BPD had lower QoL than the non-clinical
population. Spanish participants with BPD were more
than one standard deviation below the non-clinical
population. This result is consistent with several previ-
ous studies [5, 7, 12, 65, 66] that found that participants
with BPD had low QoL. Moreover, participants diag-
nosed with BPD had lower resilience than the non-
clinical population. Spanish participants with BPD were
more than one standard deviation below the non-clinical
population.

Regarding the second aim, our results indicated that
all three forms of psychotherapy (DBT, STEPPS, and
TAU-CBT) improved QoL. These results are congruent
with a previous review study on QoL [16]. However, in
our study, we compared the effects of three different
types of psychotherapy on improving QoL, and we found
that there were no differences between the different
psychotherapies.

Regarding the third aim, our results suggest that, al-
though the improvement in QoL after treatment was
it was certainly small, and the
statistically significant,
treatments did not raise it to normal levels; thus, there
was no clinical change in QoL after the treatments. This
result points out how critical it is to intervene and allo-
cate resources to improving the QoL of BPD patients.
Even though treatments improve their QoL, the current
treatments for BPD are not effective in making a clinical
change in QoL (see [16]).

Regarding the fourth aim, our results support the hy-
pothesis that higher resilience is associated with higher
QoL. A positive relationship was found between resilience
and QoL in BPD patients before and after the psychother-
apy. Finally, resilience was a predictor of QoL before and
after the treatment, controlling for the type of psychother-
apy, gender, age, and the change in depression.

Our results are consistent with previous research on
the relationship between QoL and resilience in other dis-
orders. For instance, Rainone et al. [32] investigated the
role of resilience in improving the QoL of young adults
with multiple sclerosis. They found that their measure of
resilience as a process moderated the relationship be-
tween depression and QoL. The introduction of resili-
ence in their model decreased the negative effect of
depression on affective functioning. The positive rela-
tionship between resilience and QoL has also been re-
ported in other mental disorders [34, 36], and resilience
has already emerged as a predictor of QoL [35].

Our study could support the theory of Fonagy et al.
[38], who suggest that the absence of resilience is a core
characteristic of BPD, and that therapy helps because re-
silience improves during treatment. This change in re-
silience has an impact on QoL as well, which suggests
that by targeting the improvement in resilience in BPD
patients, clinical psychologists will help them to have
better QoL. This reaffirms our conceptualization of re-
silience as a dynamic process – sensitive to change –
and should encourage the scientific community to begin
to more thoroughly investigate the relationship between
resilience and QoL in BPD patients. It would be interest-
ing to study which specific components of resilience in-
fluence each dimension of QoL because both constructs
are multidimensional.

Our study has some limitations. First, different oper-
ational definitions of QoL and resilience make it harder
to compare our study with other studies. There is a need
for unification, which many authors have tried (e.g.
[67]), but there is still no consensus among the scientific
community. Second, the sample sizes in the different
treatment conditions were not similar, and so it is pos-
sible that with larger sample sizes that are similar across
the conditions, we could find statistically significant dif-
future
ferences between treatment conditions. Thus,

studies should replicate our study with larger and more
similar sample sizes between conditions. Moreover, the
non-clinical sample was significantly younger, and the
percentage of women was higher than in the non-
clinical sample. Thus, future research should compare
BPD samples with non-clinical samples matched on age
and gender to confirm our results. Third, our study is
not a randomized controlled trial, and so we only can
suggest associative relationships between the variables
analysed, and never causal relationships. Fourth, in our
sample, 62.5% of the participants had a comorbid diag-
nosis of an eating disorder. Therefore,
these results
would only be generalizable to samples of participants
with BPD and comorbid ED. Moreover, we did not as-
sess the severity of BPD with a validated instrument, and
it is very important to assess BPD severity because it
may indicate both resilience and quality of life. Finally,
another limitation is that we did not use a scale to assess
NSSI, and we cannot confirm the reliability of this meas-
ure in our sample. However, a review study [68] found
that the type of NSSI assessment, whether with a single
item or with self-report questionnaires, did not influence
the assessment. Our results suggest that resilience plays
a key role in predicting the QoL of BPD patients. Thus,
it is recommended to further explore resilience in the
BPD community, especially in treatment contexts, and
investigate the impact of these interventions in the long
term. In this regard, three primary questions would need
attention: 1) What strategies improve resilience skills?;
2) How does implementing resilience skills in therapy
influence treatment effectiveness?; and 3) Are these re-
sults clinically relevant as well as statistically relevant?
As far as we know, this is the first study to explore the
relationship between resilience and QoL in BPD pa-
tients. Our study is just preliminary. It would be inter-
esting to see if future research replicates our results. In
addition, taking into account that the concept of QoL is
quite broad, future research should investigate subdo-
mains of resilience and their impact on the different di-
mensions of QoL.

Conclusions
In summary, our study suggests that it is necessary to
evaluate QoL in studies on treatments for people with

BPD. Future research should also analyse the reasons
for this slight improvement in QoL after treatment.
These results indicate that resilience plays an import-
ant role as a predictor of QoL in BPD patients. Be-
cause both resilience and QoL tend to be low,
working on resilience and QoL should be two thera-
peutic targets of intervention programs. Future studies
should address more specific questions and expand
our knowledge about resilience and QoL in partici-
pants with BPD.
