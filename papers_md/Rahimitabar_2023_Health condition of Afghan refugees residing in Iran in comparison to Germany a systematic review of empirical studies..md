Abstract 
Background  The re-emerging dominance of the Taliban in Afghanistan in 2021 caused a new wave of Afghan 
refugees heading Iran and neighboring countries. Iran in the Middle East and Germany in Europe are two major host 
countries to the largest populations of Afghan refugees. In both countries, several studies have been done to assess 
the health condition of refugees.

Objectives  To systematically review the existing literature to identify similarities and differences of health conditions 
of Afghan refugees living in the two countries, and to synthesize evidence on the health status and health care access 
of these populations.

Methods  Related electronic databases and grey literature of Iran and Germany on the health of Afghan refugees 
were scanned and searched up for the period 2000–2020. Key terms were formed by combining “Afghan refugees or 
immigrants or populations or asylum seekers”, “Physical or mental health”, “Healthcare service or access or use”, “Iran or 
Germany”. Empirical studies were considered if they contained samples of Afghan refugees with particular outcomes 
for Afghans. Results were categorized for both countries in the three main areas of physical health, mental health, and 
access/use of healthcare services.

Results  Nine hundred twenty-two documents were extracted, of which 75 full-texts were finally reviewed. 60 
documents belonged to the health condition of Afghan refugees residing in Iran including 43 in physical health, 6 
in mental health, 8 in healthcare access and use, and 3 in multiple aspects of health, and 15 belonged to Germany 
including 7 in physical health, 4 in mental health, 2 in healthcare access and use, and 2 in multiple aspects of health. 
A less explicit evaluation of the overall health condition of Afghan refugees was observable, particularly for Germany. 
While matches on the study subject exist for both countries, in comparison to Germany, we extracted more quantita-
tive and qualitative health studies on Afghan refugees of the mentioned areas from Iran. German health studies were 
rare, less qualitative, and more on the health condition of diverse refugee groups in general.

Conclusions  Wide gaps and unanswered questions related to mental health and overall health status of the 
Afghan refugee population are observable, especially in Germany. Our systematic review identified the gap in 
evidence, which we would recommend to bridge using a wider lens to comprehensively assess the overall condi-
tion of refugees considering associations between health and socio-economic and cultural determinants instead of

a one-dimensional approach. Further, within health studies on refugee populations, we recommend stratification 
of results by the country of origin to capture the within-group diversity among refugees with different countries of 
origin.

Keywords  Health, Afghan refugees, Systematic review, Mixed-method, Germany, Iran

Background
Afghanistan  is  located  in  the  south  center  of  Asia  and 
borders  Iran  with  a  population  of  more  than  39  mil-
lion. The country has been suffering from various issues 
including  weak  governance,  established  terrorism,  civil 
war,  inequal  resources  distribution,  a  high  proportion 
of the population living below the poverty line, lack of a 
comprehensive social protection system, and illegal pro-
duction  and  trade  of  opium  products  [1],  all  of  which 
have  compromised  the  health  condition  of  Afghans. 
For  instance,  Afghanistan  is  one  of  the  most  dangerous 
places  for  children  and  mothers,  access  to  a  hospital  or 
health  facilities  is  difficult,  has  one  of  the  highest  infant 
mortality  rates  in  the  world,  and  many  Afghan  females 
die  from  preventable  pregnancy-related  causes  [2].  As  a 
result, for the period of over four decades, it has been one 
of  the  major  epicenters  of  producing  refugees  and  dis-
placed people worldwide. The re-emerging dominance of 
the Taliban in Afghanistan in 2021 caused a new wave of 
Afghans  heading  Iran  and  neighboring  countries.  Alone 
in 2021, 667,903 Afghans have been internally displaced 
in  Afghanistan.  Current  situation  caused  a  new  wave  of 
Afghan  asylum  seekers  heading  Iran  and  neighboring 
countries. While most Afghan refugees and asylum seek-
ers have settled in Iran [3, 4], Germany has been one of 
the major European countries of their destination [5, 6].

Since  the  beginning  of  the  year  2021,  the  United 
Nations  High  Commissioner  for  Refugees  (UNHCR) 
identified  22,086  Afghans  who  newly  arrived  in  Iran 
[4].  Short-term  and  periodic  migration  of  Afghans  to 
Iran was common before the 1979 Iranian Islamic revo-
lution  and  it  was  mainly  due  to  poverty,  drought,  and 
economic  reasons.  However,  large-scale  migration  of 
Afghan  refugees  during  the  last  three  decades  was  the 
consequence  of  political  crisis  and  war  in  Afghanistan 
[3].  Today  (November  2021),  almost  1  million  regis-
tered  Afghan  refugees  and  approximately  2.6  million 
unregistered  Afghans  live  in  Iran  who  are  given  dif-
ferent  levels  of  protection  and  access  to  basic  services 
depending on their registration [4]. For decades, Iran’s 
Ministry  of  Health  &  Medical  Education  (MoHME) 
together  with  domestic  and  foreign  donors,  Non-Gov-
ernmental  Organizations  (NGOs),  the  UNHCR,  and 
Iran’s Bureau for Aliens and Foreign Immigrants Affairs 
(BAFIA)  have  been  planning  and  combining  finan-
cial  resources  to  provide  educational  and  healthcare 

services with the priority given to the registered Afghan 
refugees  and  more  vulnerable  Afghans  [7].  How-
ever,  healthcare  needs  are  high,  and  resources  are  not 
enough to cover each of the most vulnerable registered 
refugees.

Germany is the fifth largest host country of refugees 
in  the  world  hosting  1.2  million  refugees  [8].  It  has 
experienced  various  forms  of  immigration  over  the 
decades.  The  continuous  migration  of  asylum  seek-
ers and refugees increased to a peak in the early 1990s 
as  well  as  in  the  years  2015  and  2016.  The  majority  of 
recent  refugees  and  asylum-seekers  in  Germany  come 
from  Syria,  Afghanistan,  and  Iraq  and  they  are  rela-
tively young and predominantly male [8, 9]. According 
to  UNHCR,  around  148,000  Afghan  refugees  are  cur-
rently  residing  in  Germany  [8].  The  refugee  migration 
has  brought  several  challenges  to  this  country  includ-
ing  responding  to  the  needs  for  emergency  housing, 
handling the language barrier, and facilitating refugees’ 
longer-term  integration  [10].  In  addition,  it  has  also 
affected  the  German  health  system,  public  health,  and 
health promotion. The health system is under pressure 
to  provide  asylum-seekers  and  refugees  with  access  to 
necessary medical care and services [11].

In Iran and Germany, as refugees’ major hosts in Asia 
and  Europe,  several  studies  have  been  done  to  assess 
the  health  condition  of  refugee  populations  residing 
in  the  two  countries.  The  current  review  questioned 
the types and approaches of the so far performed refu-
gees’ health studies on the Afghan population residing 
in  both  countries  to  assess  the  studies’  performances 
and success in estimating the overall health conditions 
of  these  vulnerable  populations.  Further,  it  aimed  to 
review the existing literature for similarities and differ-
ences  of  Afghan  refugees’  health  conditions  as  one  of 
the  main  refugee  populations  living  in  the  two  coun-
tries, and to assess and contrast the physical and men-
tal health conditions and healthcare access and use.

Methods
We  followed  the  PRISMA  guidelines  to  conduct  this 
mixed-method  systematic  review  [12].  To  answer  the 
questions a structured review of the relevant literature 
was  undertaken  by  following  the  search  strategy  and 
selection criteria below.

Search strategy

Literature  on  the  health  condition  of  Afghan  refugees 
residing in Iran and Germany was searched and extracted 
from  web-based  databases  including  PubMed,  EBSCO, 
Emerald,  Elsevier,  ProQuest,  EMBASE,  Science  Direct, 
Scopus, Cochrane Library, and Google scholar from the 
year  2000  until  the  end  of  2020.  Most  of  the  empirical 
studies  that  contained  samples  of  Afghan  refugees  with 
particular  outcomes  for  Afghans  had  been  conducted 
over  the  last  twenty  years  in  the  two  countries.  Further, 
the  Iranian  databases  including  SID,  Magiran,  IranMe-
dex, and Irandoc were searched for relevant locally pub-
lished  articles.  Key  terms  were  formed  by  combining 
“Afghan refugees or immigrants or populations or asylum 
seekers”,  “Physical  or  mental  health”,  “Healthcare  service 
or access or use”, “Iran or Germany”. Based on our search 
strategy,  only  peer-reviewed  articles  with  one  of  the 
searched keywords either in their title or in their abstract 
were extracted.

Study inclusion and exclusion criteria

Articles  were  included  if  at  least  an  area  of    physical  or 
mental  health  or  healthcare  access  or  utilization  were 
addressed and if the articles were written in English, Ger-
man, or Persian (Farsi) language. We defined Afghan ref-
ugees  as  all  individuals  from  Afghanistan  who  migrated 
to Iran or Germany in search of legal protection regard-
less of the motives of seeking protection. All original and 
review  articles  were  included  in  this  systematic  review 
including  systematic,  narrative,  and  literature  reviews, 
mixed-method,  quantitative 
(cohorts,  case–control, 
cross-sectional,  surveys,  studies  using  secondary  data, 
longitudinal,  experimental),  qualitative  (in-depth  or 
semi-structured interviews, focus groups, ethnographies, 
participatory  action  research),  empirical  and  epidemio-
logical  studies,  and  reports.  This  approach  of  inclusion 
is suggested by a published protocol for conducting sys-
tematic  reviews  on  the  health  status  of  and  healthcare 
provision  to  asylum  seekers  in  Germany  [13].  Letters  to 
the  editor,  editorials,  policy  documents,  book  chapters, 
and dissertations were excluded. Studies that reported on 
Afghan  refugees  residing  in  countries  other  than  either 
Iran  or  Germany  or  studies  addressing  refugee  health 
in  general  with  unclear  population  ethnicity  were  not 
included.  The  size  of  the  sample  population,  their  legal 
status  (registered/unregistered),  gender,  and  age  specifi-
cations were not considered as selection criteria.

Study quality assessment

As the current review considered a wide range of study 
designs  for  inclusion,  several  quality  appraisal  tools 
were used to assess and evaluate the eligible articles for 

the  final  review.  For  this  intention,  the  Public  Health 
Practice  Project  (EPHPP)  appraisal  tool  was  used  for 
the  articles  with  quantitative  methods,  the  Critical 
Appraisal Skills Program (CASP) checklist for the qual-
itative  ones,  A  MeaSurement  Tool  to  Assess  system-
atic Reviews (AMSTAR) for normal systematic reviews 
and  the  Mixed  Methods  Appraisal  Tool  (MMAT)  was 
applied  to  assess  systematic  reviews  that  were  includ-
ing  mixed  method  studies.  Articles  that  did  not  meet 
the quality appraisal tools requirements were excluded 
from the final review.

Results
Following our developed search strategy, 922 results were 
extracted,  imported  to  the  Zotero  software,  and  catego-
rized  based  on  all  inclusion  and  exclusion  criteria.  All 
potentially  relevant  titles  were  screened  for  inclusion. 
Two  raters   (PR1  and   FE4)  then  independently  reviewed 
the  abstracts  of  retained  articles  to  further  ensure  the 
proper  inclusion.  Discrepancies  in  decisions  related  to 
the  inclusion  or  exclusion  of  studies  were  reconciled 
through mutual agreement. After initial assessments, 175 
duplications,  letters  to  the  editor,  editorials,  interviews, 
policy  documents,  book  chapters,  and  dissertations 
were  excluded  and  then  the  abstracts  and  titles  of  the 
remaining  747  articles  were  reviewed.  In  the  next  stage, 
618 studies were excluded as they were unrelated to the 
purpose  of  this  study.  Besides,  23  more  studies  were 
excluded  due  to  the  lack  of  full-text  availability.  There-
fore, 106 studies were subjected to a full-text review. The 
full-texts of the 106 articles were evaluated and again 31 
studies that either did not match the aim of this system-
atic  review  or  did  not  fulfill  the  quality  appraisal  stand-
ards,  were  excluded.  Finally,  75  eligible  articles  with 
various study approaches were reviewed among which 60 
studies  were  related  to  Iran  and  15  studies  were  related 
to  Germany.  Figure  1  shows  the  PRISMA  diagram  of 
this review which provides an outlay for the study selec-
tion  process.  Table  1  summarizes  the  characteristics  of 
Afghan  refugees  residing  in  Iran  and  Germany.  Table  2 
reports  the  areas  of  the  reviewed  studies  and  numbers 
for both Iran and Germany, and Table 3 summarizes the 
characteristics of the reviewed studies.

Health condition of Afghan refugees in Iran

Results of the current systematic review revealed that of 
the  60  health  studies  on  Afghan  refugee  population  in 
Iran,  the  majority  of  studies  was  in  the  area  of  physical 
health  whereas  studies  of  mental  health  and  healthcare 
access/use were less. According to the results, both gen-
ders,  all  types  of  ethnicities,  adults,  and  children,  were 
subject to the studies.

Physical health

In  case  of  Iran,  forty-three  eligible  physical  health  stud-
ies  were  reviewed  mainly  covering  the  areas  of  commu-
nicable  and  non-communicable  diseases  (NCDs),  food 
security,  and  reproductive  health  including  the  period 
of 2004–2020. Sample sizes of the reviewed studies were 
ranging from 4 up to 23,167 Afghans.

Communicable  diseases:  According  to  our  review  and 
the  other  Iranian  systematic  reviews  and  meta-analysis 

[31, 71–73], the major infectious diseases among Afghan 
population  were  Tuberculosis  (TB)  [44–52],  Malaria 
[42],  Cholera  [32],  Crimean-Congo  hemorrhagic  fever 
[34],  Leishmaniosis  [22,  23],  and  Hepatitis  B  [35,  36]. 
In  addition,  several  HIV-  and  drug  use-  related  stud-
ies  had  been  done  [41].  According  to  a  cross-sectional 
study, among identified HIV-positive Afghans who were 
mostly  male,  young,  and  unemployed,  use  of  Heroin 
Crack  was  prevalent  and  they  were  likely  to  be  engaged

with  high-risk  behaviors  (e.g.  shared  injection  materials 
or  having  unprotected  sex)  compared  to  the  other  drug 
users  [38].  Peer  education  seems  to  have  been  an  effec-
tive and easy-to-apply method to increase knowledge and 
improve  attitudes  about  HIV  at  least  among  street  chil-
dren, while it seemed to be less efficient concerning the 
long-term  reduction  in  risky  sexual  behavior  [39].  Via  a 
mixed-method exploratory study on substance use, it was 
observed  that  Afghan  households  had  at  least  one  adult 
member  using  illegal  drugs  (4.2%  out  of  2,034  Afghans) 
and  substance  use  had  notable  statistical  associations 
with illiteracy, being undocumented, living in slum areas, 
and poverty [37].

Non-communicable  diseases:  Kidney  diseases  [54] 
and transplantation [53], cancers [55], Multiple Sclerosis 
(MS) [56], Food insecurity, and nutritional status [25–29] 
were  mostly  studied  in  this  area.  In  general,  the  referral 
rate  to  hospitals  for  female  Afghans  and  Afghans  over 
60 years old was higher (compared to male and younger 
Afghans)  and  mainly  due  to  ophthalmic  diseases,  neo-
plasms,  and  nephropathies  [24].  Two  retrospective 
cross-sectional studies were done on kidney diseases and 
transplantation.  According  to  one  study,  both  graft  and 

patient survival rates for Afghan patients were good and 
comparable to Iranian patients [53], another one showed 
that  the  most  common  referral  for  females  and  males 
was end-stage renal disease [54]. According to one study, 
cancer  diagnoses  were  the  cause  for  3,083  of  23,152 
total referrals and the most common referral for females 
and  males  were  malignant  neoplasms  of  lymphatic  and 
hematopoietic  tissue  (34.2%)  [55].  MS  disease  was  of 
lower prevalence among Afghans residents compared to 
the overall prevalence of the respective province [56].

Five cross-sectional studies on food security and nutri-
tional  status  were  reviewed  with  samples  ranging  from 
150  to  606  including  females  and  children  [25–29]. 
Three  studies  showed  a  high  prevalence  of  food  insecu-
rity  specifically  for  females.  The  income  of  the  families’ 
heads  and  the  number  of  male  children  were  associated 
with  food  security  and  diet  diversity.  Food  insecurity 
was not only significantly more prevalent among female-
headed households [26], but also in those families whose 
head  had  a  lower  level  of  education  and  socioeconomic 
status,  belonged  to  the  Sunni  section,  and  those  with-
out  legal  residential  status  [28].  Two  studies  were  done 
regarding  underweight/obesity;  one  showed  that  among 
606  Afghan  children,16%  were  underweight  and  2.8% 
were  overweight  [89],  the  other  study  that  showed  that) 
the prevalence of underweight and wasting was remark-
able  among  children,  indicating  malnutrition  [27]  while 
about 58% of females were overweight/obese (among 414 
registered  Afghan  refugee  households).  Several  mostly 
quantitative  studies  had  been  done  assessing  reproduc-
tive health of Afghan females and infants’ health [14–20]. 
Some  demonstrated  a  high  prevalence  of  preterm  birth 
and low birth weight of infants. According to one study, 
race and different factors including lack of proper insur-
ance, availability of health services and a lower socioeco-
nomic status seemed to be connected with preterm birth 
increase [17]. Suboptimal care (in comparison to Iranian 
mothers) and Maternal Near Miss (MNM) were reported 
as well. MNM seemed to be mainly caused by late recog-
nition, misdiagnosis, unfitting care plan, postponements 
in care-seeking and expensive care services [15]. Accord-
ing to one study, reducing unnecessary cesarean sections 
and providing insurance coverage for emergency obstet-
ric care might improve maternal and perinatal outcomes 
[16].  Regarding  pregnancy,  some  Sunni  Afghan  males 
seemed to be against using contraception due to religious 
thoughts [21].

Mental health

Of  the  sixty  reviewed  health  studies,  only  six  merely 
quantitative studies [57, 62] were done on mental health 
of Afghan refugees with samples ranging from 29 to 453 
Afghans.  According  to  one,  the  prevalence  of  mental

disorders  in  Tehran  as  the  capital  of  Iran  was  high  and 
mainly  females  were  suffering  from  mental  disorders. 
Prevalences  of  social  dysfunction,  anxiety,  and  somatic 

symptoms  were  higher  than  depression  [60].  Further, 
severe  depression  was  reported  as  the  most  common 
sign  of  mental  disorders  among  Afghan  refugees  in 

Rahimitabar et al. International Journal for Equity in Health           (2023) 22:16 

Page 9 of 14

Tehran [58]. A significant correlation was found between 
mental  disorders  and  characteristics  like  social  support 
[57]  or  type  of  residence  [60]  but  not  age  [61],  mari-
tal  status  [61,  62],  or  family  size  [60].  According  to  an 
empirical study, a group intervention program was effec-
tive  for  bereaved  children  and  adolescents  after  experi-
encing disasters [60].

Healthcare access and use

Studies  in  this  area,  like  the  mental  health  studies, 
were  rare  (eight  studies)  with  a  sample  range  of  14  to 
316  Afghans  [63–70].  According  to  an  ethnographic 
study,  healthcare  management  for  female  Afghan  refu-
gees  carried  several  obstacles  many  of  which  referred 
the traditions, patriarchy and culture [65]. Two qualita-
tive studies explored the experience of receiving mater-
nal care among Afghan mothers. According to one, the 
main  experiences  of  Afghan  mothers  were  maltreat-
ment  in  the  form  of  discrimination  and  inadequate 
medical  attention.  Poor  communication  with  caregiv-
ers,  financial  restrictions,  lack  of  health  insurance,  and 
low  literacy  were  other  barriers  [66]. The  second  study 
addressed  the  importance  of  health  education  and  its 
positive  changes  in  raising  awareness  of  refugees  on 
high-risk behaviors reduction as well as increasing HIV 
testing and identification of patients, and referring them 
to treatment centers [69].

Afghan  refugees  had  several  challenges  in  every  stage 
of  PHC  delivery  including  high  service  cost  and  lack  of 
insurance coverage, language barriers, healthcare provid-
er’s behavior, delay in getting service in PHC centers [63, 
64].  In  addition,  documented  Afghan  families  who  were 
served by local health clinics usually did not have medical 
records  in  these  clinics  caused  by  continuing  migration 
behavior  due  to  job-seeking  purposes  or  illegal  status. 
Afghan  patients  who  are  illegal  may  be  treated,  but  no 
records  are  kept  for  them  [21].  According  to  a  cross-
sectional  study  on  Afghan  children,  vaccine  coverage  of 
BCG, Polio (at birth and round 3), DTP and Hepatitis B 
(both round 3) and MMR (round 1), was more than 95% 
which is not different from the coverage of Iranian chil-
dren but significantly higher than that of Afghan children 
living in Afghanistan [70].

Health condition of Afghan refugees in Germany

Results  of  the  current  study  showed  that  refugee  health 
studies in Germany were less compared to Iran. Besides, 
the health status of the Afghan refugee population resid-
ing in Germany had mostly been studied including refu-
gees and migrants from a wide range of countries. Hence 
in the current systematic review, we tried to stay focused 
on  reviewing  the  related  literature  with  the  identifiable 
share of Afghan refugees in the samples and findings.

Physical health

The reviewed physical health studies on Afghan refugees 
residing in Germany were mostly quantitative and mainly 
in  the  areas  of  TB,  antibiotics  and  drug  resistance,  der-
matologic care, and the assessment of the overall health 
condition with samples ranging from 16 to 6,206 Afghan 
cases.

Communicable diseases: According to a study in a pri-
mary care refugee clinic (with 402 Afghan patients), the 
most  frequent  diagnoses  were  respiratory,  miscellane-
ous  symptoms  and  otherwise  not  classified  ailments, 
infection,  musculoskeletal  or  connective  tissue  disease 
or gastrointestinal symptoms, and injuries [75]. Another 
descriptive  study  in  a  temporary  emergency  refugee 
camp  (with  165  Afghans)  indicated  that  the  majority  of 
patients attended the clinic with communicable diseases 
such as bacterial or viral infections. Wounds and chronic 
inflammatory  diseases  were  rather  uncommon  [79]. 
Besides,  Gram-negative  bacteria  colonized  60.8%  of  143 
refugee  patients  (including  29  Afghans)  admitted  to  a 
hospital exceeding that of German resident patients four-
fold [78]. In the case of multidrug-resistant and antibiotic 
resistance, the fecal microbiota of refugees (500 refugees, 
23%  Afghans  and  100  German  controls)  was  substan-
tially different from that of German residents. The major-
ity  of  refugees  carried  five  or  more  antibiotic  resistance 
genes  whereas  the  majority  of  German  controls  carried 
three or fewer [76]. Only a minority of TB cases among 
foreign-born  individuals  were  identified  by  screening 
of  asylum  seekers  [80].  Of  412  refugees  (including  80 
Afghans) long-lasting limitations, bad or very bad overall 
health, pain, and chronic illness were reported in adults. 
In 12 months, 52% used primary care and 37% specialist 
care with 31% unmet needs for primary and 32% for spe-
cialist care [87].

Non-communicable  diseases:  Of  102  unaccompanied 
asylum-seeking  adolescents  (including  19  Afghans)  a 
high  prevalence  of  infections,  mental  illness  and  iron 
deficiency  anemia  and  a  very  low  prevalence  of  NCDs 
were  found  [88].  Of  133  young  refugees  (including  27 
Afghans)  who  were  screened  in  another  study,  42.8% 
had  more  than  three  risk  factors.  According  to  this 
study,  young  refugees  arriving  in  hosting  countries  with 
alarming  risk  burden  may  be  highly  vulnerable  towards 
development  of  neuropsychiatric  disorder,  behavioral 
abnormalities, and global functional deficits [74].

Mental health

Compared  to  Iran,  almost  the  same  number  of  studies 
addressed  the  mental  health  status  of  Afghan  refugees 
in  Germany.  However,  only  few  studies  had  a  clear  and 
independent  sample  size  of  refugees  from  Afghanistan, 
and  most  were  emphasizing  on  depression  and  anxiety 

 Rahimitabar et al. International Journal for Equity in Health           (2023) 22:16 

Page 10 of 14

issues.  A  qualitative  study  explored  the  relationship 
between  perceived  causes  of  depression  and  desire  for 
social  distance.  According  to  it,  for  depressed  individu-
als  there  were  a  desire  for  a  social  distance.  However,  a 
higher  number  of  years  spent  in  Germany  was  associ-
ated  with  less  desire  for  social  distance  [81].  According 
to a large screening (2,639 adult refugees, 323 Afghans), 
almost half of the population was affected by psychologi-
cal  distress,  10.9%  were  positive  for  severe  distress  and 
the risk of distress was particularly high for Afghans [84]. 
Another  survey  (98  individuals,  53  Afghans)  reported  a 
high  level  of  psychological  distress  and  large  numbers 
of  potentially  traumatic  events.  The  total  number  of 
traumatic  experiences  was  identified  to  be  the  strong-
est predictor for depression, anxiety, and Post Traumatic 
Stress Disorder. Lower individual resources, lower social 
support  in  the  destination  country,  and  poorer  German 
language skills were associated with a higher level of psy-
chological distress [83].

Healthcare access and use

Likewise  Iran’s  health  studies  on  healthcare  access  and 
utilization  by  Afghan  refugees,  studies  on  this  category 
were rare in Germany. Performed studies recommended 
more  health  screenings,  prevention,  and  the  leverage  of 
barriers  to  health  service  access  for  refugees  and  unac-
companied asylum-seekers. A dental screening evaluated 
the oral health of refugees and estimated the costs of oral 
care among 102 refugees (including 19 Afghans). Around 
half  of  the  study  sample  suffered  from  toothache.  The 
average cost of conservative treatment was calculated to 
be 205.86 EUR per person, and the average price of pros-
thetic  treatment  was  calculated  to  be  588.00  EUR  [90]. 
According to a study on morbidity, utilization, and costs 
of care of 3,639 asylum-seekers (including 669 Afghans), 
refugees  had  more  hospital  and  emergency  department 
admissions including admissions which could have been 
avoided by prevention or good outpatient care. The aver-
age costs were 10% higher than for the normally insured 
individuals.  However,  there  was  considerable  dissimilar-
ity in costs by country of origin [86].

Discussion
Afghans are the main refugee population in Iran who first 
took  asylum  in  the  country  over  50  years  ago.  In  Ger-
many, the majority of recent refugees and asylum-seekers 
come  from  Syria,  Afghanistan,  and  Iraq.  This  system-
atic  review  focused  on  those  refugee  health  studies  that 
were  mainly  done  on  Afghan  refugee  populations—the 
common refugee group between the two countries. Sev-
eral  studies  in  Iran  and  Germany  had  been  performed 
to  evaluate  the  health  condition  of  Afghan  refugees. 
In  Germany,  since  2014,  health  studies  on  refugees  and 

migrants  received  more  attention  due  to  a  high  wave  of 
asylum-seekers  entering  mainly  from  the  Middle  East, 
particularly  from  Syria,  to  take  asylum  in  the  country 
[91, 92]. Despite several studies on the health of Afghan 
refugees, the overall health status of this population was 
not  clearly  systematically  researched  neither  in  Iran  nor 
in Germany. The findings of our systematic review of the 
past studies revealed health research gaps for this popu-
lation  and  provides  an  overview  of  the  current  health 
condition  of  Afghan  refugees  as  well  as  some  evidence-
based  recommendations  for  improving  this  population’s 
health. Concerning both countries, gaps in the so far per-
formed  studies  of  mental  health,  healthcare  access/use 
were  observed  with  such  insufficiencies  particularly  for 
Germany.  A  systematic  review  of  migrants’  health  from 
the  perspective  of  social  justice  in  Iran  confirmed  these 
shortages as well [73]. In addition, among German refu-
gee  health  studies,  qualitative  studies  in  the  mentioned 
areas  were  rare.  However,  based  on  the  chosen  search 
strategy,  some  relevant  studies  might  have  been  missed. 
For  instance,  there  might  be  a  range  of  studies  without 
mentioning  “Afghan”  refugees  but  reporting  health  data 
for this population especially in case of Germany.

German  health  studies  principally  explored  the  health 
condition of all groups of refugees and asylum-seekers to 
find certain physical or mental diseases rather than using 
a  stratification  of  results  by  country  of  origin  to  capture 
the within-group diversity of refugees. This issue was also 
criticized by a study mentioned before [93]. According to 
this  study,  distinction  within  the  immigrant  population 
(e.g., social and legal status, country of origin, and dura-
tion of stay) is essential. To stay focused on the frame of 
the purpose of the current study, we examined those Ger-
man  health  studies  merely  with  the  samples  of  Afghans 
and  at  least  with  independent  outcomes  for  Afghans. 
However,  results  were  limited  and  rare.  Contrary  to  the 
Iranian health studies on Afghan refugees’ physical health, 
German  health  studies  in  this  area  were  fewer  and  less 
comprehensive.  Our  findings  showed  that  several  repro-
ductive  health  studies  of  female  Afghan  refugees  existed 
in Iran, but no specific study on the reproductive health of 
female Afghan refugees in Germany. In Iranian studies in 
the area of communicable diseases, TB, malaria, cholera, 
Crimean-Congo  hemorrhagic  fever,  leishmaniosis,  and 
hepatitis B seemed to be the major infectious diseases for 
the  Afghan  population.  Substance  use  and  related  infec-
tious  diseases  are  other  issues.  In  Germany,  the  preva-
lence  of  TB  did  not  seem  to  be  high  among  all  refugees 
including Afghans. However, the prevalence of iron defi-
ciency  anemia,  some  other  infectious  diseases  (e.g.,  der-
matologic  infections),  and  general  antibiotic  multidrug 
resistance were found to be high. In Iran, food insecurity 
and specific types of cancers (e.g., malignant neoplasms of 

Rahimitabar et al. International Journal for Equity in Health           (2023) 22:16 

Page 11 of 14

lymphatic and hematopoietic tissue and the digestive sys-
tem) were prevalent while in Germany no studies on such 
diseases were found, neither for other communicable dis-
eases such as HBV and HIV/AIDS.

In  the  area  of  mental  health,  the  prevalence  of  men-
tal  disorders  varied  for  Afghan  refugees  living  in  differ-
ent  cities  of  Iran,  but  in  general  was  found  to  be  high. 
German  studies  confirmed  both  high  psychological  dis-
tress  and  depression  among  Afghan  refugees.  The  Ira-
nian studies on the area of healthcare access and use by 
Afghan  refugees  demonstrated  poor  communication 
with healthcare providers, difficulties with recording ref-
ugees’ health data, tradition and culturally related aspects 
of healthcare-seeking behavior, and some language barri-
ers. German studies primarily were focused on the costs 
of  healthcare  and  expenditure.  In  general,  the  language 
similarities and cultural closeness to the Iranian popula-
tion  seemed  to  be  an  important  factor  for  employment, 
access,  and  use  of  healthcare  and  the  integration  of 
Afghan refugees into the Iranian society.

Recommendations to improve the health of the Afghan 
refugee population

Based  on  the  reviewed  studies,  in  the  case  of  TB,  early 
case  detection  efforts  focusing  on  migrant  populations 
are  recommended  [51].  Regarding  HIV/AIDS  among 
Afghan  refugees,  studies  suggest  drug  treatment,  thera-
peutic  community  services,  programs  such  as  condom 
education  and  distribution,  HIV/AIDS  education,  vol-
untary  counseling  and  testing,  and  needle  and  syringe 
programs  [33,  38,  39,  41].  Another  approach  would  be 
screening  strategies  against  diseases  like  HBV  [35].  Fur-
thermore,  due  to  the  high  prevalence  of  certain  can-
cer  diagnoses  among  refugees,  implementing  effective 
screenings  and  prevention  as  well  as  improved  health 
record-keeping  of  refugees  and  provision  of  sustainable 
funding  sources  in  collaboration  with  global  humanitar-
ian agencies are essential measures [55].

To  promote  Afghan  refugees’  nutritional  health  and 
food  security,  interventional  and  educational  programs, 
facilitating  Afghan  refugees’  employment,  and  improv-
ing  access  to  welfare  facilities  especially  for  females  and 
children, are recommended [25, 29]. In the case of repro-
ductive  health  of  Afghan  females,  improving  obstetric 
practice  and  targeting  exact  needs  during  pregnancy 
may  prevent  MNM  consequences  [15].  Another  appar-
ent measure would be providing the refugees with health 
insurance  coverage  which  facilitates  financial  access  to 
healthcare [54, 93–96]. Further strategies are to improve 
the  level  of  literacy  and  awareness  in  the  refugee  popu-
lation  and  to  empower  them,  with  special  attention 
towards females [33].

In  general,  recommendations  for  Afghan  refugees 
in  both  studied  countries  were  comparatively  simi-
lar.  However,  due  to  the  different  discussed  settings 
(Table 1) and slightly different health issues of Afghans 
in Iran compared to Germany, some recommendations 
may  quite  vary  for  each  of  the  countries.  For  instance, 
culture  and  language-related  barriers  are  important 
aspects in Germany whereas in Iran they are not a chal-
lenge as both are relatively similar among Iranians and 
Afghans.

Conclusions
Finally,  on  the  basis  of  the  current  systematic  review, 
future  refugee  empirical  health  studies  are  recom-
mended  using  a  wider  lens  to  comprehensively  assess 
the  overall  condition  of  refugees  considering  associa-
tions  between  health  and  socio-economic  and  cultural 
determinants  instead  of  a  one-dimensional  approach. 
This  comprehensive  approach  can  be  a  fundament  for 
future health policies and related measures to improve 
health care services, quality of living and thus a better 
integration  of  refugees  in  hosting  countries.  Assisting 
refugees with language learning, informing and educat-
ing them (including health education), facilitating their 
employment  process,  and  supporting  them  with  psy-
chological services, are recommended.

Further, the authors recommend to appropriately con-
sider the diversity between groups of refugees like coun-
try of origin and so on. For instance, Afghans and Syrian 
refugees  both  come  from  a  similar  geographical  loca-
tion  –  the  Middle  East.  However,  Afghan  populations 
experience  living  conditions  dissimilar  and  often  worse 
compared  to  other  Middle  Eastern  countries  adversely 
affecting  their  health.  In  refugees’  countries  of  origin, 
patterns  of  diseases,  health  behaviors  and  habits  (e.g., 
smoking,  nutrition,  etc.),  cultural  habits,  and  in  general 
living  conditions  are  different  exposing  people  to  differ-
ent  and  different  degrees  of  health  threats.  This  should 
be  a  challenge  for  the  host  countries  to  respond  to  the 
diverse  health  needs  of  various  groups  of  refugees  and 
thus facilitate their integration to a new living condition.
