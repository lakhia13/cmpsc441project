Abstract

Meditation training can improve mood and emotion regulation, yet the neural mechanisms of these 
affective changes have yet to be fully elucidated. We evaluated the impact of long- and short-term 
mindfulness meditation training on the amygdala response to emotional pictures in a healthy, non-
clinical population of adults using blood-oxygen level dependent functional magnetic resonance 
imaging. Long-term meditators (N=30, 16 female) had 9,081 hours of lifetime practice on average, 
primarily in mindfulness meditation. Short-term training consisted of an 8-week Mindfulness-
Based Stress Reduction course (N=32, 22 female), which was compared to an active control 
condition (N=35, 19 female) in a randomized controlled trial. Meditation training was associated 
with less amygdala reactivity to positive pictures relative to controls, but there were no group 
differences in response to negative pictures. Reductions in reactivity to negative stimuli may 
require more practice experience or concentrated practice, as hours of retreat practice in long-term 
meditators was associated with lower amygdala reactivity to negative pictures – yet we did not see 
this relationship for practice time with MBSR. Short-term training, compared to the control 
intervention, also led to increased functional connectivity between the amygdala and a region 
implicated in emotion regulation – ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC) – during affective

reactivity, and heightened amygdala–VMPFC connectivity during affective stimuli may reflect a 
potential mechanism by which MBSR exerts salutary effects on emotion regulation ability.

Introduction

Mindfulness meditation practices, which aim to cultivate an accepting awareness of the 
present moment (Bishop et al., 2004; Brown and Ryan, 2003; Kabat-Zinn, 1990) can 
improve emotion regulation, ameliorate symptoms underlying anxiety and depression and 
boost positive mood (Goyal et al., 2014; Hofmann et al., 2010; Jain et al., 2007). 
Mindfulness based stress reduction (MBSR) is a widely used form of meditation practice 
taught by a trained professional that involves didactics, individual and group practices 
including: breath awareness meditation, body scans, walking meditation and yoga. Each of 
the practices involves focusing attention on presentmoment experience (Kabat-Zinn, 1990). 
MBSR has been shown to lead to reduced negative experience (Goldin and Gross, 2010; 
Kaviani et al., 2011) and quicker recovery from a negative challenge (Britton et al., 2012; 
Raes et al., 2009). Improvements in affective responses following mindfulness meditation 
training have also been shown in non-clinical populations, including reductions in emotional 
interference (Ortner et al., 2007) and decreased negative mood (Jha et al., 2010). Research 
on the neural mechanisms underlying these affective changes that utilizes active control 
conditions is sparse, and systematic examination of the impact of mindfulness meditation 
training on functional connectivity in emotion regulation networks has not been investigated.

Allen et al. provide initial evidence that mindfulness meditation alters neural processing to 
affective stimuli following a short-term intervention – participants who practiced longer had 
more insula activation during negative pictures in a whole-brain analysis (Allen et al., 2012). 
The current study investigated a greater range of practice by including long- and short-term 
practitioners and expands upon prior work by probing the neural response to positive 
pictures – in addition to negative pictures – in an important emotion regulation circuit using 
a-priori amygdala and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC) regions of interest (ROIs). 
Research using a similar approach demonstrated decreased amygdala activation during 
positive affective pictures following short-term mindfulness meditation training, however it 
was limited to 12 participants per group (Desbordes et al., 2012). Precisely how 
mindfulness-based meditation impacts the neural circuitry of emotion regulation remains 
unclear.

The amygdala is central to emotion generation (Phelps and LeDoux, 2005) and regulation 
(Buhle et al., 2014), and VMPFC is implicated in automatic emotion regulation (Phelps et 
al., 2004; Urry et al., 2006), possibly through functional coupling with the amygdala (Banks 
et al., 2007; Lee et al., 2012). Automatic, or implicit emotion regulation consists of 
processes that alter the course of affective experience outside explicit, conscious attempts to

do so. Affect labeling is a process which may engage automatic emotion regulation even 
absent an intention to volitionally regulate emotion, as affect labeling has been shown to 
dampen the amygdala response (Lieberman et al., 2007). Extinction learning is another 
example of and automatic emotion regulation process and involves both amygdala and 
VMPFC (Phelps et al., 2004). Non-human primate research reveals a specific mechanism for 
these effects whereby monosynaptic input to basolateral amygdala from MPFC inhibits 
activity from the central nucleus of the amygdala (Kim et al., 2011). Moreover, research in 
non-human primates indicates functional specificity of VMPFC for value updating 
(Rudebeck et al., 2013), providing evidence that VMPFC automatically processes 
information regarding the changing salience of stimuli. Recent studies in humans have also 
found converging support for the role of VMPFC in value updating (Levy and Glimcher, 
2012).

We systematically examined the impact of mindfulness meditation training on affective 
processing by assessing amygdala activation and amygdala-VMPFC functional connectivity 
during an automatic emotion regulation task in a non-clinical, healthy population of adults 
who were in a normal state, not explicitly practicing any form of meditation. Brain activation 
was assessed using blood-oxygen level dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging 
(BOLD fMRI). We employed a rigorous design combining cross-sectional analysis of long-
term meditators (LTM) compared to meditation-naïve participants (MNP), and a randomized 
controlled trial (RCT) in which a subset of MNP completed either an 8-week intervention 
with MBSR or a validated, active control condition (the health enhancement program; HEP) 
that was matched for intervention effects non-specific to mindfulness meditation (MacCoon 
et al., 2012). The LTM had a daily sitting meditation practice of at least 30 minutes for at 
least three years, and the primary type of meditation practice was most similar to that taught 
in MBSR — Vipassana (i.e. open monitoring; OM). In this form of meditation, practitioners 
cultivate sustained awareness to experience without attempting to control the focus of 
attention, but rather maintaining openness to any feelings that arise in awareness (Lutz et al., 
2015).

We hypothesized that mindfulness meditation training would decrease reactivity to affective 
stimuli, as assessed by amygdala activation to positive and negative pictures (relative to 
neutral). We further hypothesized that mindfulness meditation training would enhance 
automatic emotion regulation, as reflected by greater amygdala-VMPFC functional 
connectivity during affective pictures (negative, positive) relative to neutral. First, we tested 
for differences in LTM compared to MNP, and then we tested for a similar pattern of effects 
following training with MBSR compared to HEP, while controlling for pre-treatment 
baseline (i.e. data collected prior to randomization). Using RCT data to follow up on cross-
sectional analyses allowed us to rigorously control for influential factors that may have 
systematically differed between LTM and MNP. Finally, we assessed the length and type of 
meditation practice to test how variations in practice predicted differences in the brain and 
behavior.

2.  Methods

2.1.  Participants

Page 4

We recruited 158 healthy human subjects from a non-clinical population, comprised of 127 
meditation-naive participants (MNP) and 31 long-term meditators (LTM). The MNP 
(average age 48.1±10.7 years, 81 female) comprised a much larger group as they 
participated in both the RCT and cross-sectional arms of the study, and were recruited within 
Madison, WI and the surrounding community using flyers, online advertisements, and 
advertisements in local media. Recruitment materials requested participation in a study of 
“health and well-being” or the “benefits of health wellness classes.” Following baseline data 
collection, a sub-set of MNPs who participated in the cross-sectional arm of the study were 
randomly assigned to mindfulness meditation training or an active control intervention for 
the RCT: Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR; N=43, average age 48.2 ± 10.0 
years, 27 female) or the Health Enhancement Program (HEP; N=43, average age 48.0 ± 12.2 
years, 27 female), which has been validated in a separate study (MacCoon et al., 2012). The 
intervention and randomization procedures were identical to that detailed by MacCoon et al. 
(2012) Four participants did not complete the fMRI task following the intervention, and an 
additional 15 participants left the study prior to post-intervention data collection due to 
logistical reasons, resulting in 32 participants who completed MBSR (average age 50.8 ± 8.8 
years, 22 female) and 35 participants who completed HEP (average age 48.1 ± 12.6 years, 
19 female).

The LTM (average age 50.7±10.1 years, 17 female) were recruited at meditation centers and 
through related mailing lists throughout the United States, in addition to flyers and 
advertisements in newspapers similar to the recruitment strategy for MNP. The LTM did not 
differ from the MNP in terms of age, gender, motion during the fMRI task, level of 
education, or socio-economic status measured with the Hollingshead index (Hollingshead, 
1975), nor were there statistically significant effects of any of these demographic factors on 
any of the outcome variables, except in 2 cases as described in the Results section. 
Meditation recruitment criteria include at least three years of daily practice (at least 30 
minutes per day of sitting meditation), experience with Vipassana, concentration and 
compassion/loving-kindness meditations, and at least 3 intensive retreats lasting 5 or more 
days. LTM had an average of 9,081 lifetime hours of meditation practice, ranging from 
1,439 to 32,612 total hours, and which primarily consisted of mindfulness-based practices 
(focused attention and OM; 86 % of daily practice hours), in addition to some practice with 
compassion/loving kindness meditations (14% of daily practice hours). Lifetime hours of 
practice were calculated based on subjects reports of their average hours of formal 
meditation practice per week and their total years of practice. Participants in either group 
were excluded if they had used medication for anxiety, depression, or other psychological 
issues, or had a psychiatric diagnosis in the past year. Participants were also excluded if they 
had any history of bipolar or schizophrenic disorders, brain damage or seizures.

The automatic emotion regulation task was one of a number of tasks administered during a 
24-hour lab visit as part of a larger, multi-session study. Meditation-naïve participants 
completed one lab visit prior to randomization, and then following the 8-week MBSR or

HEP intervention participants returned for a post-training visit during which the same 
measures were collected. Experimenters were blind to the group assignment of meditation-
naïve participants during data collection for the RCT. Subjects also completed a series of 
questionnaires, including the Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ; Baer et al., 
2006), which includes a sub-scale that was used as a self-report measure of non-reactivity. 
Example items from the non-reactivity scale include: “When I have distressing thoughts or 
images, I just notice them and let them go”, and “I watch my feelings without getting lost in 
them”. A panel of other domain-specific questionnaires was included to address hypotheses 
from aspects of the larger study that were focused on relationships between meditation and 
sleep, health, response to social stress and pain processing, and which were irrelevant to the 
current analysis. UW-Madison’s Health Sciences Institutional Review Board approved the 
protocol, and all participants provided consent and were given monetary compensation for 
their participation. Two MNPs were excluded due to brain abnormalities, one dropped out of 
the study before the task was completed, and three were unable to complete the task due to 
technical difficulties. This left a total of 121 MNP’s (78 female, 119 right-handed) with 
average age of 48.3 ± 10.8 years, and an age range of 26 – 66 years. One LTM was excluded 
due to a dental implant which distorted the functional fMRI data, leaving a total of 30 
LTM’s (16 female, 29 right-handed) with an average age of 50.5 ± 10.2 years and an age 
range of 28–62 years. We recruited a larger sample of MNP than LTM, due to the unique 
study design that incorporated an RCT for which we needed at least 30 MNP participants 
per group following randomization. The MNP in the RCT were a subset of the participants 
whose pre-randomization baseline data were included in the cross-sectional arm of this 
study.

2.2.  Automatic Emotion Regulation Task

Seventy-two pictures selected from the International Affective Picture Set (Lang et al., 2008) 
were presented during fMRI scanning, and evenly split between negative, neutral, and 
positive pictures. This resulted in 24 pictures in each of the three valence categories, and 
each picture was presented for 4 seconds. The average normative valence (V) and arousal 
(A) ratings of the pictures in the three categories were negative (V = 2.87±0.87, A = 
5.51±0.47), neutral (V = 5.08±0.60, A = 3.86±0.63) and positive (V = 7.10±0.47, A = 
5.36±0.37), where both valence and arousal are measured on 9-point scales (1 = most 
unpleasant or least arousing and 9 = most pleasant or most arousing, respectively). Valence 
order was pseudo-randomized and picture order was completely randomized within the task. 
The positive pictures did not include erotic images from the IAPS set, and all the pictures in 
this task were evenly split between social and non-social categories. The task also included 
the presentation of neutral (male and female) faces from the Extended Multimodal Face 
Database (“The XM2VTS Database,” n.d.), which were presented for 500 ms after the offset 
of the picture in two-thirds of the trials, and appeared either 1 s (8x per valence) or 3 s (8x 
per valence) post-picture offset.

There were also eight trials in which a face did not follow the image. The faces were 
included as a way to probe emotional spillover from the preceding IAPS stimuli, however 
there were no differences in BOLD activation to faces following negative and positive

pictures compared to faces following neutral pictures. Thus, we focused solely on the picture 
presentation period.

Automatic emotion regulation is assumed to be a process that occurs in the absence of 
volitional attention and without explicit instructions. Thus, the task used in the current study 
entailed examining automatic emotion regulation processes in response to emotional pictures 
in the absence of an explicit request to voluntarily regulate emotion. Participants were 
instructed to press a button indicating the valence category of the picture (either negative, 
neutral, or positive) to ensure they were paying attention. Button order was counterbalanced 
across subjects. Participants were instructed to passively view the faces following the 
images. All stimuli were presented using E-Prime software (E-Prime, 2012) and participants 
viewed these images with a fiber-optic goggle system (Avotec, Inc., Stuart, FL) while inside 
the MRI scanner. Due to a technical error the button box response was not recorded for 85 
participants (19 LTM), in which case they were sent a link to complete the picture 
categorizations online at home following the scan. Sixty-one participants (11 LTM) 
completed the online task at home to categorize the pictures. The task consisted of 4 runs of 
approximately 5 minutes each. In order to familiarize participants with the task and the 
scanning environment, they completed 6 practice trials (with a separate set of pictures not 
included in the scanner task) in a mock scanner prior to beginning the experiment.

2.3 

Image Acquisition

Images were acquired on a GE X750–3.0 Tesla MRI scanner device with an 8-channel head 
coil. Anatomical scans consisted of a high-resolution 3D T1-weighted inversion recovery 
fast gradient echo image (inversion time = 450 msec, 256×256 in-plane resolution, 256 mm 
FOV, 124×1.0 mm axial slices). Four functional scan runs were acquired for the Automatic 
Emotion Regulation Paradigm using a gradient echo EPI sequence (64×64 in-plane 
resolution, 240 mm FOV, TR/TE/Flip = 2000 ms/25 ms/60°, 40×4 mm interleaved sagittal 
slices, and 159 3D volumes per run).

2.4 

Image Processing

Functional images were processed using FEAT (FMRI Expert Analysis Tool) Version 6.00, 
part of FSL (FMRIB’s Software Library) including a high pass temporal filter of 100 s, 
motion correction with MCFLIRT (Jenkinson et al., 2002), BET (Smith, 2002) brain 
extraction, spatial smoothing at 5 mm FWHM, and FILM prewhitening (Woolrich et al., 
2001). Transformation matrices for registration were computed at the first level (within scan 
run) and applied at the second level using FSL in a two stage process where the Boundary 
Based Registration (BBR) approach (Greve and Fischl, 2009) was used to register the 
subject’s time series data to their anatomical template, and a 12 DOF affine transformation 
was used to register the subject’s anatomical scans to Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) 
space using FLIRT (Jenkinson et al., 2002).

2.5  Experimental Design and Statistical Analysis

The functional data from individual subjects were analyzed using a General Linear Model 
(GLM) in 3 levels, where the first level (within-scan) modeled stimulus presentation with a 
double-gamma hemodynamic response function as defined in FSL. Each trial type was

modeled with up to two regressors for each of two events; the 4 s presentation period of the 
IAPS image, and the 0.5 s presentation of the neutral face on the 2/3 of trials in which a face 
was presented (1/3 of trials did not have a face) for a total of 9 regressors (trials with faces 
were modeled separately but were collapsed together in the higher level analysis). 
Additional regressors of no interest were included to model the 24 total motion-related 
parameters (the standard plus extended parameters, which include the squares, derivatives, 
and squares of derivatives). To further address motion, high motion time points with a 
framewise displacement larger than 0.9 mm (Siegel et al., 2014) were modeled out of the 
data with an individual regressor. There were no scans with greater than 25% of the data 
censored for motion, and thus no participants or scans were excluded for excessive motion. 
The second level combined data within subject and across scans using a fixed effects 
modeling approach. Group analysis to check for whole-brain, voxelwise effects was done at 
the third level in which we modeled data across subjects using the Flame1 mixed effects 
model estimation. Z (Gaussianised T/F) statistic images were thresholded using clusters 
determined by Z>3.1 and a (family-wise error corrected) cluster significance threshold of 
p=0.05 (Worsley, 2001) for the voxelwise, whole-brain analyses.

Functional amygdala ROIs were identified from the contrast of Negative>Neutral IAPS 
pictures during a 4 s picture presentation period (analogous to the task used in the current 
study except participants did not make a button press response) and using data from an 
independent sample of 90 participants enrolled in a separate study (mean 
age(SD)=45.1(10.0) years, 52 female) (Grupe et al., 2017). The right and left functional 
amygdala ROIs were then masked with anatomical amygdala ROIs from the Harvard-Oxford 
Atlas (Desikan et al., 2006) with a threshold at 50% probability to remove any non-
amygdala voxels, resulting in a left and right amygdala ROIs of 104 and 164 voxels, 
respectively. Mean percent signal change across each amygdala ROI was extracted for all 
participants from the output of the second level model.

The functional ROI for the right amygdala was used to extract the timeseries, which was 
deconvolved (Gitelman et al., 2003) prior to computing the psychophysiological interaction 
(PPI) for the connectivity analysis. We then ran a second model to examine right amygdala-
VMPFC connectivity, which included (in this order) all the regressors as the basic task 
model described above (9 task regressors and 24 motion regressors), a PPI regressor for each 
of the 3 task conditions (negative, neutral and positive IAPS), as well as the right amygdala 
seed timeseries, otherwise known as the gPPI approach (McLaren et al., 2012). The 
regressors were not orthogonalized. We computed contrasts for negative versus neutral and 
positive versus neutral PPIs, which were then used for a group level connectivity analysis 
from which we extracted values from a MPFC ROI based on the Harvard-Oxford Atlas 
containing 976 voxels (depicted in purple in Figure 2a). We used an anatomical mask for 
MPFC as we did not have an independent, functional localizer for this region. We also did 
not want to restrict the ROI based on a different task or analysis, which may not include 
regions of VMPFC that are differentially connected to amygdala due to training in 
mindfulness meditation. Statistical analysis for regions of interest was done using the lm 
function from the stats package in the statistical analysis software R (R Core Team, 2015; 
version 3.2.2), and p-value computation used the modelSummary function of the lmSupport 
package (Curtin, 2015).

All results are reported after removing outliers based on Cook’s D using a cutoff threshold 
of 4/(N-P) for data points disconnected from the distribution, where N and P correspond to 
the sample size and number of model parameters, respectively. When outliers were removed 
from the analysis they were also removed from the corresponding figure(s). Across all tests, 
4 model outliers had extreme motion and 2 model outliers had extreme values in change in 
FFMQ non-reactivity, where points greater than 3 standard deviations (SD) from the mean 
are considered extreme. Thirty-seven percent of model outliers were outliers in multiple 
statistical tests. All findings remain consistent when outliers are included in the model, 
except in 3 cases as noted in the text. When comparing model outliers from all tests (N=38) 
we found that the outlier participants had significantly more motion (p=0.02) and lower non-
reactivity (p=0.003) compared to participants who never appear as outliers (N=117). 
Descriptive statistics for all variables are available in Table 1.

3.10  Mindfulness meditation practice and amygdala reactivity: Analytic strategy.

We tested for group differences in amygdala reactivity to affective pictures, as assessed via 
BOLD fMRI signal for the contrast of negative (NEG) and positive (POS) picture trials 
minus neutral (NEU) picture trials (hereafter referred to as NEGPOS > NEU). As our 
hypotheses were specific to the amygdala (and its connectivity with VMPFC), we focused 
on the ROI analysis. However, a whole-brain, voxelwise analysis did not reveal any regions 
in which there were differences between groups (neither for LTM versus MNP, nor MBSR 
versus HEP post-intervention controlling for baseline). Significant clusters for LTM and 
MNP for each contrast of interest are presented in Table 3, and for MBSR and HEP 
participants at T2 (controlling for T1) in Table 4. Un-thresholded statistical maps for each 
group for these contrasts are also available at NeuroVault: https://neurovault.org/collections/
PFXOLGSS/.

3.11  Long-term mindfulness meditation practice and amygdala reactivity.

Long-term meditators had significantly lower right amygdala activation than meditation-
naïve participants for the contrast NEGPOS > NEU (t(145)=2.66, b=0.09, p=0.01, 
CI=[0.02,0.15], 1 LTM and 3 MNP outliers removed, partial r = 0.20). In order to 
decompose this effect, we conducted separate analyses on the negative and positive picture 
trials. Long-term meditators had significantly lower right amygdala activation for POS > 
NEU than meditation-naïve participants (t(147)=3.86, b=0.13, p=0.001, CI=[0.06,0.21], 2 
MNP outliers removed, partial r = 0.26; Figure 1b), however there was only a marginal, non-
significant difference for the contrast NEG > NEU (t(145)=1.65, b=0.06, p=0.10, 
CI=[−0.01,0.14], 1 LTM and 3 MNP outliers removed, partial r = 0.11; Figure 1a). When 
outliers were included in the model the group difference for NEG > NEU was significant 
(p=0.05). Results of all statistical tests, including non-significant results for the left 
amygdala, are reported in Table 2.

While participants’ valence categorization of the pictures was intended to keep their 
attention on-task, rather than as a behavioral assay of emotion regulation or reactivity, we 
examined these behavioral responses in an exploratory fashion. Due to a technical error,

button presses for 84 participants were not recorded during the scan: 23 participants (5 
LTM) were completely missing the categorization data, and 61 participants (11 LTM) 
categorized the pictures online after the scan. We included a covariate to control for whether 
participants’ behavioral data was collected concurrently in the scanner, or online afterward, 
and the results are consistent whether or not this covariate is included. Including all the 
available data, LTM categorized a significantly higher proportion of the pictures as neutral 
compared to MNP (t(122)=−2.52, b=−0.07, p=0.01, CI=[−0.12, −0.02]). Upon further 
inspection of this group difference broken down by the standardized IAPS valence 
categories, we found that the LTM categorized significantly more pictures as neutral than 
MNP for the negative IAPS pictures (t(119)=- 2.18, b=−0.04, p=0.03, CI=[−0.08, −0.004], 2 
MNP and 1 LTM outliers removed), and positive IAPS pictures (t(122)=−3.77, b=−0.14, 
p<0.001, CI=[−0.22, −0.07]). There was no difference between groups in the percentage of 
neutral IAPS pictures categorized as neutral (t(120)=−0.45, b=−0.02, p=0.65, CI=[−0.11, 
0.07], 2 LTM outliers removed). The percent of negative and positive pictures that LTM 
categorized as neutral did not relate to the intensity of amygdala activation for NEGPOS > 
NEU (t(20)=0.87, b=0.15, p=0.39, CI=[−0.21, 0.52]).

3.12  Short-term mindfulness meditation practice and amygdala reactivity.

In order to determine whether short-term meditation training would lead to similar 
reductions in amygdala reactivity to affective pictures as seen with long-term training, we 
compared post-training right amygdala activation in participants randomized to MBSR with 
the active control condition (HEP), while controlling for pre-treatment baseline activation 
(i.e. an analysis of covariance approach - ANCOVA). Since participants were randomized to 
either MBSR or HEP subsequent to pre-treatment (i.e. baseline) data collection we were able 
to leverage this more powerful, and more statistically appropriate, ANCOVA analytical 
approach as opposed to a repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) (Van Breukelen, 
2006). We computed the contrast NEGPOS > NEU to examine the impact of MBSR on 
emotional reactivity, and there was no post-intervention group difference in right amygdala 
activation between MBSR and HEP (t(64)=−1.45, b=−0.06, p=0.15, CI=[−0.01,0.47], partial 
r = 0.23; controlling for pre-treatment baseline). In light of the differences between long-
term meditators and meditation-naïve participants specific to positive pictures, we also 
conducted analyses separately for each valence contrast. Participants who trained in MBSR 
had significantly lower right amygdala activation for the contrast POS > NEU compared to 
participants who trained in HEP (t(58)=−2.65, b=−0.10, p=0.01, CI=[−0.18,−0.02], 3 MBSR 
and 3 HEP outliers removed], partial r = 0.31; Figure 2b), while controlling for pre-
treatment baseline. There were no baseline differences in right amygdala activation for POS 
> NEU in the same set of participants (t(59)=−0.38, b=- 0.01, p=0.71, CI=[−0.09,0.06]). 
Similar to the results for long-term practice, participants who trained in MBSR had only 
marginally, and non-significantly lower right amygdala activation to the contrast NEG > 
NEU compared to HEP training (t(57)=−1.84, b=−0.06, p=0.07, CI=[−0.13,0.01], 4 MBSR 
and 3 HEP outliers removed], partial r = 0.37), while controlling for pre-treatment baseline. 
When outliers were included in the model the group difference for NEG > NEU was non-
significant (p=0.46). There were no significant differences in activation for the left amygdala 
(Table 2). We were unable to compare post-training differences in behavioral categorizations

while controlling for baseline, due to a technical error by which many of the button presses 
were not recorded, and most participants are lacking data at both time-points.

All subsequent analyses focused on the right amygdala, since the group differences in 
amygdala reactivity were limited to the right side, and the contrasts were kept separate by 
valence due to differential effects by valence.

3.2  Practice duration and amygdala reactivity.

The long-term meditator group had considerable variability in self-reported total lifetime 
daily practice (mean=4,281(2,817) hours, range=954 – 13,605 hours) and in total lifetime 
retreat practice (mean=4,658 hours, range=258 – 29,710 hours), which allowed us to test 
whether the amount of self-reported practice accounted for significant variance in amygdala 
activation. The distribution of lifetime hours of practice was skewed, so all practice variables 
were log-transformed prior to analysis. We controlled for age in the following analyses, as it 
was correlated with log total practice time (r=0.30 with daily practice, and r=0.15 with 
retreat practice), and 2 outliers were removed from all of the analyses with practice hours. 
One of the two model outliers was also an extreme point (greater than 3 SD from the mean) 
with regard to amygdala activation for NEG > NEU.

Long-term meditators with greater total lifetime hours of retreat practice had the lowest 
amygdala activation for the contrast NEG > NEU (t(25)=−2.10, b=−0.03, p=0.05, 
CI=[−0.07,−0.001]). Due to the heterogeneous nature of meditation practices employed on 
retreats, we also conducted post-hoc analysis to test whether this relationship was true 
specifically for the type of meditation practice that is most similar to that taught in MBSR 
— Vipassana (i.e. OM) retreat practice. Greater total lifetime hours of OM retreat practice 
was negatively associated with amygdala activation for the contrast NEG > NEU (t(23)=
−2.62, b=−0.04, p=0.02, partial r=−0.47, CI=[−0.06,−0.01]; Figure 1c)*. This relationship 
was not significant for total lifetime hours of daily practice (t(25)=−0.48, b=−0.02, p=0.64, 
CI=[−0.09,0.05]). There were no significant relationships between amygdala activation for 
the contrast POS > NEU and any of the measures of lifetime practice (Table 2). All the 
results remained the same when age was not included as a covariate.

The total minutes of MBSR training (during class and at home) was not associated with 
amygdala activation for NEG > NEU following training (t(26)=−1.19, b<0.01, p=0.24, 
CI=[0.00,0.00], 3 outliers removed), nor with amygdala activation for POS > NEU 
(t(28)=0.17, b<0.01, p=0.87, CI=[0.00,0.00], 1 outlier removed), while controlling for pre-
treatment baseline.

3.3  Relation between amygdala activation and self-reported reactivity

We tested whether amygdala activation was associated with a self-report measure of 
emotional reactivity – the non-reactivity sub-scale of FFMQ (Baer et al., 2006). Example 
items from the non-reactivity scale include: “When I have distressing thoughts or images, I 
just notice them and let them go”, and “I watch my feelings without getting lost in them”.

*Two participants did not report retreat hours specific to OM practice, and so the degrees of freedom are different for models that 
include this variable.

Participants (across LTM and MNP groups) with greater self-reported emotional non-
reactivity had lower amygdala activation for the contrast POS > NEU (t(148)=−3.20, b=
−5.38, p<0.01, CI=[−8.70,−2.06], partial r = 0.24), and this relationship remained significant 
when controlling for social desirability as measured with the Marlowe-Crowne Social 
Desirability questionnaire (MCSD; Figure 3a; t(147)=−3.05, b=−4.79, p<0.01, CI=[- 
7.88,−1.69]). This relationship was specific to the non-reactivity sub-scale, as total FFMQ 
scores, which served as a measure of “mindfulness”, were not associated with amygdala 
activation for the contrast POS > NEU (t(148)=−1.57, b=−9.70, p=0.12, CI=[- 21.9,2.54]). 
There was no relationship between amygdala activation for NEG > NEU with FFMQ non-
reactivity (t(148)=−1.33, b=−2.19, p=0.19, CI=[−5.43,1.06]), nor with total FFMQ scores 
(t(148)=−0.33, b=−1.92, p=0.74, CI=[−13.44, 9.60]). One MNP model outlier was removed 
from each of these analyses, and this participant was also an extreme point with regard to 
self-reported non-reactivity. In line with the group differences in emotional reactivity as 
measured by amygdala activation, the long-term meditators reported greater non-reactivity 
on the FFMQ than the meditation naïve participants while controlling for social desirability 
from MCSD (Figure 3b; t(151)=−7.25, b=−5.36, p<0.001, CI=[−6.83,−3.90], 1 LTM outlier 
removed, partial r = 0.53).

The post-training amygdala activation for the contrast POS > NEU in MBSR and HEP 
participants did not predict post-training self-reported non-reactivity (FFMQ; t(53)=1.67, 
b=2.81, p=0.10, CI=[−0.57,6.20], 4 MBSR and 5 HEP outliers removed), nor for NEG > 
NEU (t(60)=1.51, b=3.10, p=0.14, CI=[−0.99,7.00], 1 MBSR and 1 HEP outlier removed), 
while controlling for baseline activation and baseline self-reported non-reactivity. Nor was 
there a group difference between MBSR and HEP in self-reported non-reactivity following 
training while controlling for baseline (t(57)=−0.28, b=−0.28, p=0.64, CI=[−1.48,0.91 ], 3 
MBSR and 3 HEP outliers removed).

3.40  Amygdala–VMPFC functional connectivity during affective pictures: Analytic 
strategy.

We tested for group differences in amygdala functional connectivity with an anatomically 
defined VMPFC ROI in order to understand the potential impact of mindfulness meditation 
practice on amygdala reactivity in the context of functional networks associated with 
emotion regulation. We used the same functionally defined amygdala ROI as a seed for a 
psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analysis to compare the relationship of the seed 
activation during negative versus neutral images, and positive versus neutral images by 
extracting the mean Z-values from VMPFC ROI for each PPI. A positive PPI result implies 
the slope between the BOLD response in the amygdala and the target voxels in VMPFC was 
larger during negative than neutral pictures (or during positive versus neutral pictures).

3.41  Long-term practice and amygdala functional connectivity.

Long-term meditators had a significantly positive right amygdala-VMPFC PPI during NEG 
> NEU (t(27)=2.17, b=0.13, p=0.04, CI=[0.01,0.24], 2 outliers removed), while for MNPs 
the right amygdala-VMPFC PPI for this contrast was not significant (t(118)=1. 17, b=0.04, 
p=0.25, CI=[−0.03,0.10], 2 outliers removed), though the difference between the groups was 
not significant (t(145)=−1.29, b=−0.09, p=0.20, CI=[−0.23,0.05], 2 LTM and 2 MNP

outliers removed). When outliers were included in the model the group difference for PPI 
effect of NEG > NEU was significant (p=0.05). One LTM and one MNP model outlier in 
were also extreme points with regard to the NEG > NEU PPI effect. There was also no 
group difference in amygdala-VMPFC PPI for the contrast of POS > NEU (t(149)=−0.71, 
b=−0.05, p=0.48, CI=[−0.17,0.08]), nor was there significant amygdala-VMPFC PPI for this 
contrast for either LTM (t(29)=0.04, b=0.002, p=0.97, CI=[−0.10,0.10]), nor MNP (t(120)=
−1.47, b=−0.04, p=0.14, CI=[−0.10,0.02]). Since there was a significant difference in the 
POS > NEU PPI effect by gender we also tested for group differences controlling for gender, 
and there were no changes in the result. There was no relationship between long-term 
meditators’ amygdala-VMPFC PPI and any of the measures of lifetime practice (Table 2). 
We examined the association between amygdala-VMPFC connectivity and the behavioral 
categorization of affective stimuli. There was no relationship between the percentage of 
positive IAPS categorized as neutral and the amygdala-VMPFC PPI effect for POS > NEU 
(t(20)=−1.05, b=−0.13, p=0.31, CI=[−0.37,0.13]), and there was only a trend-level effect for 
percentage of negative IAPS categorized as neutral and the PPI effect for NEG > NEU 
(t(19)=1.73, b=0.12, p=0.099, CI=[−0. 02,0.27]; 1 outlier removed).

3.42  Short-term practice and amygdala functional connectivity.

We also investigated amygdala-VMPFC functional connectivity to determine if MBSR 
training enhanced connectivity of this emotion regulation circuit. These analyses utilized the 
identical VMPFC ROI used in the analyses with the LTM. Participants randomly assigned to 
MBSR had greater post-treatment amygdala-VMPFC PPI than HEP participants during 
NEG > NEU (t(62)=3.99, b=0.29, p<0.001, CI=[0.15,0.44], 2 MBSR outliers removed, 
partial r = 0.42; Figure 2b), as well as for POS > NEU (t(58)=2.57, b=0.16, p=0.01, 
CI=[0.04,0.29], 4 MBSR and 2 HEP outliers removed, partial r = 0.30; Figure 2c), while 
controlling for pre-treatment baseline. Since there was a significant difference in the POS > 
NEU PPI effect by gender (at baseline), and a significant difference in change in the NEG > 
NEU PPI effect by age, we also tested for group differences controlling for these variables in 
each model (respectively), and there were no changes in the results. There was no 
relationship between amygdala-VMPFC PPI connectivity and total practice with MBSR 
(Table 2). There were no significant differences in baseline PPI measures between groups in 
the same sample of participants for NEG > NEU (t(63)=−.53, b=−0.05, p=0.60, 
CI=[−0.23,0.13]), or for POS > NEU (t(59)=−1.92, b=−0.14, p=0.06, CI=[−0.28,0.01]).

4.  Discussion

We rigorously tested the relationship between mindfulness meditation training and affective 
processing by combining a cross-sectional design comparing long-term mediators to non-
mediators with an RCT comparing MBSR and HEP. We were able to examine mechanisms 
underlying changes in affective processing by examining both amygdala reactivity and 
connectivity with VMPFC during automatic emotion regulation, and in a much larger 
sample size than has been previously reported in the literature on the effect of mindfulness 
meditation on automatic emotion regulation (Desbordes et al., 2012). The automatic emotion 
regulation task used in this study was designed to specifically probe participants’ automatic 
response to emotional pictures, whereby the degree to which emotion regulation processes

were automatically engaged would be reflected by individual differences in the amygdala 
response to affective stimuli. We have argued in other contexts that this form of emotion 
regulation is ubiquitous and is likely the most common form of emotion regulation in 
everyday life (Lapate et al., 2014). The current study was limited to inferring that regulation 
occurred, as there were no measures of participants’ emotional experience or regulation 
strategies during the task. Inclusion of trial-by-trial questions about regulation strategy 
and/or affective experience may have altered subsequent responses or primed participants to 
use an emotion regulation strategy, which we wanted to avoid in order to measure 
participants’ natural response.

Emotional reactivity, as assessed via right amygdala activation to affective pictures 
(combined across positive and negative), was lower in participants who engaged in long-
term mindfulness meditation training compared to controls. We tested separately by valence 
to decompose this effect and found that LTM had lower amygdala activation than MNP 
specifically to positive pictures, but not negative pictures (for which there was only a 
marginal difference between groups). The LTM also reported less emotional reactivity than 
MNP on a questionnaire measure (FFMQ), however we did not find a difference in self-
reported emotional reactivity following MBSR compared to HEP. It is possible that it 
requires more practice or practice over a longer period of time to see movement on self-
report measures of emotional reactivity in healthy, non-clinical populations, particularly in 
comparison to a well-matched active control intervention.

In an exploratory analysis we also found that the LTM categorized more affective pictures as 
neutral compared to MNP. This pattern of behavioral results mirrors the pattern of results in 
the fMRI data and lends further support to the hypothesis that longterm mindfulness 
meditation training improves emotion regulation through a reduction in emotional reactivity. 
However, we did not find a relationship between the percent of negative and positive pictures 
that LTM categorized as neutral and the amygdala activation, and there was only a trend-
level relationship with amygdala-VMPFC connectivity during negative versus neutral 
pictures. The exploratory nature of our behavioral analysis, and the technical difficulties 
with recording button responses in the scanner, greatly limited inference from these results, 
as well as our power to detect an effect. Future research should follow up to more carefully 
examine whether (and how) behavioral changes in valence categorization are associated with 
mindfulness training- related changes in self-report and neurobiological measures of 
emotion regulation.

Participants naïve to meditation who were randomly assigned to short-term mindfulness 
training showed a similar pattern: a reduction in amygdala reactivity specifically in response 
to positive images but not negative images when compared to HEP and controlling for the 
pre-treatment baseline activation. These results are consistent with prior work that 
meditation training decreased amygdala reactivity to positive pictures (Desbordes et al., 
2012). Mindfulness meditation provides training in paying attention to thoughts and 
emotions as they unfold naturally and allowing them to pass without trying to avoid 
discomfort or to grasp onto pleasant experiences. One mechanism that could lead to 
decreased emotional reactivity with practice in mindfulness meditation is through increased 
exposure to the arising and passing of emotions accompanied by this new habit of attending

to the experience non-reactively. Recent evidence that behavioral measures of mindfulness 
were associated with decreased attentional capture to rewarding stimuli provide additional 
evidence for this interpretation (Levinson et al., 2014). Importantly, decreased non-reactivity 
of the amygdala to positive stimuli does not preclude increased pleasure or liking of positive 
stimuli, similar to that found in prior work showing increased positive mood with 
mindfulness training (Jain et al., 2007). Prior research has dissociated the neural basis of 
pleasure from that of the “wanting” associated with approach behavior (Smith et al., 2011). 
It is likely that the amygdala, a key node in the salience network, marks wanting more than 
liking whereas the work of Berridge and colleagues suggests that local circuitry within the 
ventral pallidum is uniquely associated with liking (Smith et al., 2011). Therefore, our 
findings of decreased amygdala activation to positive stimuli are most consistent with a 
decreased desire to approach (or grasp at) a stimulus rather than a change in pleasure or 
appreciation.

Over time the practice of observing thoughts non-reactively may lead to greater automatic 
emotion regulation similar to extinction processes that recruit VMPFC (Phelps et al., 2004; 
Hölzel et al., 2011). The process strengthened by mindfulness meditation is not a specific 
decrease in reactivity to negative stimuli but rather may impact emotional responding more 
generally and is consistent with the view from contemplative traditions that this practice 
decreases “stickiness” – the power of emotions to linger and alter subsequent experience – 
by reducing the propensity to avoid unpleasant and grasp at pleasant experiences. This is 
summarized nicely by Hölzel: “nonreactivity leads to unlearning of previous connections 
(extinction and reconsolidation) and thereby to liberation from being bound to habitual 
emotional reactions” (2011). The fact that MBSR significantly increased the amygdala-
VMPFC PPI effect relative to HEP training for both negative versus neutral pictures and 
positive versus neutral pictures lends further support to this explanation, and implies a 
similar emotion regulatory mechanism for reducing reactivity to affective stimuli 
independent of valence.

While prior research has provided evidence that amygdala-VMPFC functional connectivity 
correlates with improvements in emotion regulation, the current had no direct, objective 
measures of emotion regulation behavior. Future research would benefit from including such 
behavioral measures. The paradigm used in the current study could also be improved in 
future research by including more naturalistic stimuli personally relevant to participants, as 
the small-to-medium effect sizes seen in the current study may in part reflect the generic 
nature of the stimuli and less likelihood to elicit strong, self-relevant affective experiences.

The fact that short-term MBSR training affected amygdala-VMPFC functional connectivity 
in ways that we did not detect in participants with long-term training is revealing and implies 
a curvilinear trajectory in the neural changes required for learning the skill of non-reactivity. 
On this view, with long-term training the reduction in reactivity to affective stimuli becomes 
more automatic such that VMPFC recruitment is less necessary. This explanation aligns with 
subjective reports from practitioners, and with the goals and expectations of mindfulness 
meditation practice: to practice being aware and accepting of (affective) experience so that 
over time this process becomes more automatic. The fact that we found a relationship 
between hours of retreat practice and reduced amygdala reactivity, but not with amygdala-

VMPFC connectivity lends further support to the idea that increased connectivity may only 
occur at earlier stages of practice, and fits with the nonlinear dosage-response curve of 
mindfulness meditation training (Brefczynski-Lewis et al., 2007). Moreover, the lack of 
relationships between individual differences in amygdala reactivity and the amount of 
MBSR practice (e.g. variation in the degree to which participants engaged in at-home 
practice, or ‘homework’ during MBSR) may also indicate an important distinction between 
short- and long-term practice: it may be that there is a more “all-or-nothing” effect of 
exposure to MBSR in terms of short-term effects while long-term changes may be more 
dependent upon practice dosage. Longitudinal research that follows practitioners as they 
progress from initial, to intermediate, and more advanced practice will be critical to provide 
insight into the trajectory of affective change with mindfulness meditation.

Of course, the fact that short-term MBSR training produced alterations in amygdala-
VMPFC connectivity not seen among the LTM can also be due to other factors. All 
participants in the MBSR group received the same intervention and were recruited from the 
same geographic community (in Madison, WI), whereas the LTM had larger variation in 
practice type, duration and geographic location. The LTM likely also had greater variability 
in their motivations for engaging in practice. We attempted to minimize such variation by 
recruiting LTM who had similar practice that included primarily mindfulness-based 
meditation.

Interestingly, long term meditators’ total lifetime practice while on retreat predicted reduced 
amygdala activation to negative pictures, while total hours of non-retreat practice (i.e. totally 
daily practice hours over the lifetime) was not associated with amygdala reactivity. This 
effect was stronger when looking specifically at retreat practice in OM meditation. All the 
long-term meditators had a daily practice that included OM meditation, and so engaging in 
this style of practice while on retreat appears to be particularly beneficial. The inverse 
relationship between OM retreat practice and reactivity to negative IAPS, combined with 
non-significant group differences in amygdala reactivity to negative IAPS implies that 
altering the response to negative affect may require more intense practice over time 
(specifically in OM meditation). Retreats tend to differ from daily practice in many ways; 
the duration of practice is longer, the context promotes a continual focus on the goals of the 
training with fewer distractions than is typical for daily life, there is usually greater social 
support or accountability, and there is a release from daily work or family expectations. Any 
one or a combination of these and other factors that allow for a more intense focus on OM 
practice may facilitate change. Additionally, individual differences in factors relating to 
participants’ choice and ability to go on retreat may be important to consider in relation to 
their emotional reactivity, though all the LTMs in this study by design were required to have 
participated in at least a few retreats. Future research could better assess the impact of retreat 
practice by assessing the different components of retreat practice, and by measuring 
responses before and after meditation retreats, as well as longitudinally across the 
development of participants’ meditation practice from novice to expert.

We had also planned to test the impact of mindfulness meditation training on amygdala 
recovery to affective stimuli, as assessed by the intensity of amygdala activation during 
neutral faces following positive and negative pictures compared to neutral pictures.

However, none of the groups had amygdala activation for the contrast NEGPOS > NEU 
during the face period with which we could examine group differences. There are a couple 
potential reasons why we failed to find a main effect of the preceding IAPS valence during 
the face period (i.e. emotional spillover from the affective stimuli onto the neutral faces that 
immediately followed). A subsequent study in our lab has shown that conscious awareness 
of affective stimuli dampens affective spillover onto subsequent neutral stimuli (Lapate et 
al., 2014). Since participants in this study were instructed to make a button press to indicate 
the valence of the IAPS, this brought awareness to the source of affective information very 
explicitly. Thus, the affective experience induced from the IAPS was less likely to be 
misattributed to the neutral face stimuli. Furthermore, research has shown that affect labeling 
can serve as a form of implicit emotion regulation and result in dampening of the amygdala 
response, which was associated with increased ventrolateral PFC activation mediated by 
VMPFC (Lieberman et al., 2007). While the valence labeling aspect of the task likely 
contributed to the lack of a valence effect on the subsequent neutral face response, it also 
likely allowed us to more easily assess individual differences in the ability to engage with 
automatic (i.e. implicit) emotion regulation processes during the IAPS presentations.

Labeling experiences – including affective experiences – is also a component of mindfulness 
mediation training, and has been previously proposed as one possible mechanism by which 
such practices train emotion regulation (Lutz et al., 2008). Prior research has found 
associations between self-reported dispositional mindfulness and reduced amygdala 
activation during affect labeling tasks (Creswell et al., 2007). Therefore, participants with 
mindfulness meditation training may have more easily or robustly engaged this automatic 
form of emotion regulation due to the affect labeling component of the task, possibly leading 
to lower amygdala reactivity. The results of the current study extend this literature in novel 
ways by demonstrating similar effects with a much stronger, RCT design combined with 
cross-sectional data from LTM.

The present study provides evidence that long and short-term training in mindfulness 
meditation improves automatic emotion regulation and elucidates the neural correlates of 
this improvement. Long and short-term mindfulness meditation training were associated 
with lower amygdala activation while viewing affective pictures. Short-term mindfulness 
meditation training with MBSR was also associated with a stronger amygdala-VMPFC PPI 
effect during negative and positive pictures (versus neutral) compared to the active control 
condition (HEP), while controlling for pre-treatment baseline. These findings are consistent 
with other evidence in suggesting that engagement of prefrontal regulatory resources may be 
more pronounced in the earlier stages of mindfulness training and dissipate with longer-term 
practice. Taken together, these findings provide novel evidence that training in mindfulness 
meditation alters the neural circuitry of automatic emotion regulation, which may be 
instantiated early on by modulating connectivity between the VMPFC and amygdala.

Figure 1. 
Long-term meditation training is associated with lower right amygdala reactivity to 
emotional pictures. Long-term meditators (LTM) had lower right amygdala activation for the 
negative versus neutral pictures at a trend level (a), and significantly lower activation for 
positive versus neutral pictures than mediation-naive participants (MNP; b). Greater lifetime 
hours of open monitoring (OM) retreat practice predicted lower right amygdala activation 
for negative versus neutral pictures, controlling for age (c). The independently defined right 
amygdala region of interest from which mean percent signal change data were extracted is 
inset in each panel. Circles represent raw data points in a and b, and the raw data are 
adjusted for age in c. Error bars and envelopes are 95% confidence intervals around the point 
estimates.

Figure 2. 
Short-term meditation training causes less right amygdala reactivity and greater connectivity 
with VMPFC in response to emotional pictures. The ventral medial prefrontal cortex 
(VMPFC) region of interest (purple) from which we extracted mean psychophysiological 
interaction (PPI) weights (represented by the dashed line) with the right amygdala ROI 
(green) is inset in panel b. Participants had lower right amygdala activation following 
Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) compared to the Health Enhancement 
Program (HEP) for positive versus neutral pictures (a), and increased right amygdala-
VMPFC PPI for negative versus neutral pictures (b), and for positive versus neutral pictures 
(c). Analyses and data points are adjusted for pre-treatment baseline activation, and error 
bars are 95% confidence intervals around the point estimates.

Figure 3. 
Reactivity in self-report and in right amygdala. Higher self-reported non-reactivity on the 
Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ) predicted lower right amygdala activation for 
negative versus neutral pictures (a). The independently defined right amygdala region of 
interest from which mean percent signal change data were extracted is inset in panel a. 
Long-term meditators (LTM) had overall higher self-reported non-reactivity than 
meditation-naive participants (MNP) (b). Example items from the non-reactivity scale 
include: “When I have distressing thoughts or images, I just notice them and let them go”, 
and “I watch my feelings without getting lost in them”. Error bars and envelopes are 95% 
confidence intervals around the point estimates.
