Background

A B S T R A C T

Most tobacco control programmes for adolescents are based around prevention of uptake, but teenage smoking is still common. It is
unclear if interventions that are effective for adults can also help adolescents to quit. This is the update of a Cochrane Review first published
in 2006.

Objectives

To evaluate the effectiveness of strategies that help young people to stop smoking tobacco.

Search methods

We  searched  the  Cochrane  Tobacco  Addiction  Group's  Specialized  Register  in  June  2017.  This  includes  reports  for  trials  identified  in
CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and PsyclNFO.

Selection criteria

We included individually and cluster-randomized controlled trials recruiting young people, aged under 20 years, who were regular tobacco
smokers. We included any interventions for smoking cessation; these could include pharmacotherapy, psycho-social interventions and
complex programmes targeting families, schools or communities. We excluded programmes primarily aimed at prevention of uptake. The
primary outcome was smoking status after at least six months' follow-up among those who smoked at baseline.

Data collection and analysis

Two review authors independently assessed the eligibility of candidate trials and extracted data. We evaluated included studies for risk
of bias using standard Cochrane methodology and grouped them by intervention type and by the theoretical basis of the intervention.
Where meta-analysis was appropriate, we estimated pooled risk ratios using a Mantel-Haenszel fixed-effect method, based on the quit
rates at six months' follow-up.

Main results

Forty-one trials involving more than 13,000 young people met our inclusion criteria (26 individually randomized controlled trials and 15
cluster-randomized trials). We judged the majority of studies to be at high or unclear risk of bias in at least one domain. Interventions
were varied, with the majority adopting forms of individual or group counselling, with or without additional self-help materials to form
complex interventions. Eight studies used primarily computer or messaging interventions, and four small studies used pharmacological
interventions (nicotine patch or gum, or bupropion). There was evidence of an intervention effect for group counselling (9 studies, risk
ratio (RR) 1.35, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.03 to 1.77), but not for individual counselling (7 studies, RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.39), mixed
delivery methods (8 studies, RR 1.26, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.66) or the computer or messaging interventions (pooled RRs between 0.79 and 1.18,
9 studies in total). There was no clear evidence for the effectiveness of pharmacological interventions, although confidence intervals were

wide (nicotine replacement therapy 3 studies, RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.48 to 2.58; bupropion 1 study RR 1.49, 95% CI 0.55 to 4.02). No subgroup
precluded the possibility of a clinically important effect. Studies of pharmacotherapies reported some adverse events considered related
to study treatment, though most were mild, whereas no adverse events were reported in studies of behavioural interventions. Our certainty
in the findings for all comparisons is low or very low, mainly because of the clinical heterogeneity of the interventions, imprecision in the
effect size estimates, and issues with risk of bias.

Authors' conclusions

There is limited evidence that either behavioural support or smoking cessation medication increases the proportion of young people that
stop smoking in the long-term. Findings are most promising for group-based behavioural interventions, but evidence remains limited for
all intervention types. There continues to be a need for well-designed, adequately powered, randomized controlled trials of interventions
for this population of smokers.

P L A I N   L A N G U A G E   S U M M A R Y

Are there any smoking cessation programmes that can help adolescents to stop smoking?

Background

Worldwide, between 80,000 and 100,000 young people start smoking every day. Many adolescent tobacco programmes focus on preventing
teenagers from starting to smoke, but some programmes have been aimed at helping those teenagers who are already smoking to quit.
We set out to investigate whether these programmes can help young people quit smoking for six months or longer. Searches are up to
date as of June 2017.

Study characteristics

We identified 41 studies (around 13,000 participants) that researched ways of helping teenagers to quit smoking. These studies were of
mixed quality and looked at various methods for stopping smoking, including one-to-one counselling, counselling as part of a group,
methods using computers or text messaging, or a combination of these. Four studies used drug treatments such as nicotine patches. Most
studies recruited participants from schools, and 29 of the studies were carried out in North America.

Key results

Although  some  programmes  showed  promise,  especially  those  that  used  group  counselling  and  those  that  combined  a  variety  of
approaches, there was no strong evidence that any particular method was effective in helping young people to stop smoking. Trials differed
in  how  they  measured  whether  a  person  had  quit  smoking,  and  many  trials  did  not  have  enough  participants  for  us  to  be  confident
about wider application of the results. Medications such as nicotine replacement and bupropion were not shown to be successful with
adolescents, and some adverse events were reported, although these events were generally mild and findings were based on studies with
small numbers of participants. Based on these findings we cannot currently identify a programme for helping adolescents to stop smoking
that is more successful than trying to stop unaided.

Quality of the evidence

The quality of evidence was low or very low for all of the outcomes in this review. This is because of issues with the quality of some of the
studies, the small number of studies and participants for some outcomes, and the differences between the studies.

B A C K G R O U N D

In  much  of  the  developed  world,  the  prevalence  of  smoking
amongst  young  people  has  been  falling  over  the  last  20  years.
Recent  figures  from  the  UK  show  that  for  children  under  the  age
of  16  years,  18%  have  tried  smoking  at  least  once  and  3%  are
regular  smokers,  but  that  regular  cigarette  smoking  has  fallen
from  a  peak  of  around  12%  of  children  aged  11  to  15  years  in
the  mid-1990s  (CRUK  2017).    A  similar  decline  has  been  noted
in  the  USA;  in  2016,  13.8%  of  high  school  students  and  4.3%
of  middle  school  students  reported  current  use  of  combustible
tobacco (MMWR 2017), compared with a prevalence of more than
30% 20 years earlier (USDHHS 2012). In developing economies the
picture is less clear cut, with wide variation and often higher rates
of smoking in young people, including rates of up to 50% in some
countries (Eriksen 2015). The incidence of the initiation of smoking
first  becomes  measurable  in  the  10-  to  12-year  age  range  (ONS
2000), and smoking in teenage years is strongly predictive of adult
smoking (HSCIC 2012).

Although  the  major  burden  of  disease  caused  by  smoking  falls
on  the  adult  population,  there  are  several  reasons  why  smoking
cessation interventions that are effective in younger smokers are
particularly valuable. Firstly, many adult smokers started smoking
in  childhood  (in  the  UK,  40%  of  regular  smokers  began  smoking
before  the  age  of  16  years  (CRUK  2017)).  However,  many  of  the
adverse  health  effects  associated  with  smoking  are  preventable
with  cessation  at  a  young  age  (USDHHS  2004),  and  there  is  little
loss  in  life  expectancy  provided  cessation  occurs  early  enough
(Jha  2014).  There  are  therefore  substantial  cumulative  potential
health benefits to be gained from successful interventions in this
age  group,  as  well  as  the  prospect  of  reducing  the  demand  for
cessation services among adult smokers who have been smoking
since childhood.

Secondly,  there  is  evidence  that  those  who  start  earliest  and
continue  to  smoke  may  be  more  susceptible  to  disease  in
adulthood  than  smokers  who  start  later  in  life,  facing  increased
risks  of  lung  damage,  bowel  cancer,  and  cervical  pre-cancerous
lesions  (CRUK  2017).  There  is  also  evidence  that,  although  levels
of dependence may be lower in young smokers than in the adult
population  (Rubinstein  2007),  addiction  to  nicotine  can  develop
very rapidly in young smokers, making unassisted quitting difficult
even among those without a long smoking history (DiFranza 2008a;
DiFranza 2008b).

Thirdly, there is evidence that within a short time of commencing,
many  teenage  smokers  want  to  quit  (Burt  1998;  Hu  1998;  MMWR
2009;  Stanton  2001;  Sussman  1998).  Frequent  quit  attempts  are
reported in this population (MMWR 2009; Stanton 2001), with many
studies reporting more than 50% of teenage smokers making a quit
attempt within six months, although many of these attempts are
unsuccessful (Bancej 2007; Mermelstein 2003).

Fourthly,  smoking  may  be  a  particular  problem  in  young  people
with  mental  health  or  behavioural  problems.  In  the  UK,  smoking
rates among 11- to 15-year-olds were 30% in those with conduct
disorder, 19% in those with emotional disorder, and 15% in those
with  attention  deficit  hyperactivity  disorder  (ADHD)  compared
to  5%  in  those  without  such  disorders  (Green  2004;  Thakur
2012).There is now strong evidence that the relationship is causal
with respect to depression (Boden 2010), whilst for ADHD molecular
genetics would seem to play a role.

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

There  is  now  a  large  literature  on  smoking  cessation  services  for
adults. This is reflected in a number of Cochrane Reviews examining
several  aspects  of  the  subject  in  detail.  Many  countries  have
developed  appropriate  services  for  adults.  However,  whilst  some
have suggested that similar services, suitably modified, should be
considered for young people (Raw 1998), this assertion is open to
challenge in view of the difference in smoking pattern, lifestyle and
attitudes to services in this age group (TAG 2000). Previous reviews
of adolescent smoking cessation have been published, comprising
randomized controlled (experimental) trials and non-randomized,
'quasi-experimental'  or  observational  studies  (McDonald  2003;
Patnode 2013; Sussman 1999; Sussman 2002; Sussman 2006). This
update, restricted to evidence from randomized controlled trials,
is  the  third  version  of  a  Cochrane  Review  to  focus  on  smoking
cessation  in  young  people  under  20  years.  A  further  systematic
review has looked at strategies for smoking cessation for university-
age  smokers  (Villanti  2010).  The  paucity  of  high-quality  research
evidence  to  answer  important  clinical  questions  is  a  recurrent
theme of reviews in this area.

Other  Cochrane  Reviews  of  interventions  relevant  to  tobacco
addiction  amongst  young  people  have  mainly  focused  on
primary  prevention.  These  include  a  review  of  school-based
prevention  programmes  (Thomas  2012),  and  reviews  of  mass
media  interventions  (Carson  2017),  community  interventions
(Carson  2011),  interventions  for  reducing  access  by  preventing
illegal sale of tobacco (Stead 2005), prevention in indigenous youth
(Carson  2012),  and  school  smoking  policies  (Coppo  2012).  This
review looks at strategies for smoking cessation in young people
and, more specifically, at the context in which the interventions are
offered, and how young people are enrolled into quit attempts.

Criteria for considering studies for this review

Types of studies

Eligible study designs are randomized controlled trials, including:

1.

individually randomized controlled trials, that is, trials in which
individuals  were  randomized  to  either  the  intervention  or
the  control  arm  of  the  experiment,  or  randomized  to  receive
different interventions;

2. cluster-randomized controlled trials, that is, trials that have as
the unit of randomization a school, group or organization level,
or where clusters of professionals or groups of professionals are
implementing interventions.

Types of participants

Participants  were  young  people,  aged  under  20  years,  who  were
regular, current tobacco smokers. As there is evidence that some
young  people  have  an  irregular  pattern  of  smoking  (Grimshaw
2003; O'Loughlin 2003), we have defined a regular smoker in this
review as a young person who smokes an average of at least one
cigarette  a  week,  and  has  done  so  for  at  least  six  months.  Trials
did not always specify smoking status to this level of detail, but we
excluded trials known to target young people who smoked less than

this or known to include as 'smokers' people who did not currently
smoke, but had smoked in the past.

We  also  included  studies  that  compared  two  different  cessation
interventions or combinations of interventions.

If  a  study  included  participants  beyond  their  20th  birthday  (for
example,  16-  to  21-year-olds),  we  have  included  the  study  if  the
majority of participants were aged under 20, and if the design of the
programme specifically considered the needs of young people.

Exclusions

We  have  excluded  from  this  review  interventions  specifically
targeting young women in pregnancy, since this topic is covered by
the Pregnancy and Childbirth Group (Chamberlain 2017; Coleman
2015). We have also excluded any programme aimed primarily at
the adult population, and have contacted investigators where there
was a lack of clarity on this issue.

Types of interventions

Interventions could be specifically designed to meet the needs of
young  people  aged  under  20  years,  or  could  also  be  applicable
to  adults.  Interventions  could  range  from  simple  ones  such  as
pharmacotherapy,  targeting  individual  young  people,  through
strategic programmes targeting people or organizations associated
with  young  people  (for  example,  their  families  or  schools),  to
complex  programmes  targeting  the  community  in  which  young
people study or live, provided the study reported outcomes related
to the individual smoker.

To  be  included,  all  interventions  had  to  be  aimed  at  helping
young  people  to  stop  smoking  tobacco.  We  included  cessation
programmes  and  strategies  that  also  targeted  relapse.  We
included  programmes  or  strategies  that  targeted  psycho-social
determinants  (for  example,  enhancing  self-efficacy  for  refusing
tobacco), or that focused on developing life skills in order to stay
abstinent, if the study design was appropriate. We did not place any
restrictions on the setting in which the intervention was offered, for
example, school, hospital, doctor's surgery, or dentist.

We  excluded  smoking  prevention  programmes,  even  if  they
reported  cessation  data,  as  they  have  been  the  subject  of
previous reviews (Carson 2011; Carson 2017; Thomas 2012). Within
large-scale, community primary prevention interventions, health-
education  programmes/curricula  or  mass  media  campaigns  that
targeted  young  people,  we  only  considered  for  inclusion  the
cessation  component  of  those  programmes,  where  the  following
three  criteria  were  met:  that  part  of  the  intervention  had  been
specifically  designed  to  target  cessation;  that  the  interventions
could be separately assessed; and that the interventions explicitly
met the criteria of this review for study design and recruitment.

Control conditions

Interventions in the control arm of the study could be one of the
following:

1. no intervention;
2. delayed  intervention  beyond  the  last  date  of  data  acquisition

3.

including follow-up;
information on stopping smoking either delivered to individuals
in control groups or as literature (indicated in Characteristics of
included studies as 'brief Intervention');

4. general tobacco education given to all participants in trial.

We  have  not 
programmes aimed solely at relapse prevention.

included  primary  prevention  strategies  or

Types of outcome measures

Measures of quitting

The primary outcome of interest was change in smoking behaviour
(being a smoker at baseline and becoming an ex-smoker at follow-
up)  at  six  months'  follow-up  or  longer.  We  excluded  trials  with
follow-up  of  less  than  six  months.  In  trials  that  reported  data  at
multiple  follow-up  times,  we  chose  for  the  primary  analysis  the
shortest follow-up of at least six months that used the most rigorous
available  definition  of  abstinence.  We  have  not  included  relapse
rates in the review.

We  have  reported  the  definition  of  cessation  used  in  each  trial,
for example abstinence during a particular period, such as in the
past  seven  or  30  days  (point  prevalence),  abstinence  from  the
start  of  the  programme  (continuous  abstinence),  or  abstinence
following  occasional  relapse  in  the  two-week,  post-treatment
grace  period  (prolonged  abstinence)  (Hughes  2003).  If  studies
reported  cessation  using  more  than  one  definition  of  abstinence
we  used  the  most  rigorous  outcome.  Biochemical  confirmation
of  self-reported  non-smoking  is  generally  taken  to  be  the  gold
standard  for  reporting  of  quit  rates  (West  2005).  This  tests  for
the  presence  of  smoking-related  substances  in  exhaled  breath,
saliva, urine or blood, and is the preferred verification method for
reported outcomes where this is available. It should be noted that
biochemical  validation  may  not  be  a  very  sensitive  measure  of
change in smoking status for irregular smokers; it is possible that
some studies may have recruited participants on the basis of self-
reported  smoking  status  who  would  not  have  been  identified  as
smokers at baseline if biochemical validation had been used.

Adverse events

We extracted data on adverse events where reported.

Search methods for identification of studies

We used the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group search strategies
to 
identify  randomized  controlled  trials,  cluster-randomized
controlled  trials,  and  controlled  trials  of  smoking  cessation  and
prevention  interventions.  Trials  relevant  to  the  review  were
identified using the free text and keywords 'Child' or 'adolescent*'
or  'adolescence'.  We  searched  the  Cochrane  Tobacco  Addiction
Group  Specialized  Register  on  8  June  2017.  At  the  time  of  the
search the Register included the results of searches of the Cochrane
Central  Register  of  Controlled  trials  (CENTRAL;  2016,  issue  11);
MEDLINE  (via  OVID)  to  update  20170526;  Embase  (via  OVID)  to
week  201724;  PsycINFO  (via  OVID)  to  update  20170529.  See  the
Tobacco  Addiction  Group  Module  in  the  Cochrane  Library  for
full  search  strategies  and  a  list  of  other  resources  searched.  We
have  also  searched  the  'grey  literature'  (unpublished  resources
and  conference  proceedings)  and  the  reference  lists  of  identified
studies.

Where necessary, we have contacted the authors of existing trials
and  other  experts  for  ongoing  trials,  and  for  unpublished  results
pertaining  to  completed  trials,  subject  to  the  availability  of  peer
review.

For  previous  updates,  we  also  contacted  smoking  cessation  e-
networks  with  a  list  of  the  references  to  extracted  studies,  to
request verification and any additional information, and contacted
manufacturers of smoking cessation products.

Data collection and analysis

Selection of studies

We drew up a prospective list of eligibility criteria with two levels
of  priority:  essential  and  desirable.  For  the  initial  review,  two
original  authors  (GG  and  AS;  see  Acknowledgements)  assessed
the  retrieved  abstracts  against  this  list  for  possible  inclusion,  to
measure the feasibility of each criterion.

After piloting, we applied the agreed criteria to the abstracts of all
studies extracted from the databases. We then categorized studies
into three groups:

1. both authors agree on inclusion based on the abstract;
2. one author suggests inclusion based on the abstract;
3. both authors agree on exclusion based on the abstract.

We  retrieved  full-text  articles  for  groups  1  and  2.  We  used  the
processes outlined here and later for all updates.

Two  authors  independently  assessed  each  full  article,  using
the  agreed  inclusion  criteria.  For  studies  where  there  was
disagreement,  the  editorial  base  or  a  third  author  was  consulted
to reach a consensus. Where there was ambiguity in trial reporting
or lack of data, we contacted investigators for clarification where
possible. If we could not retrieve missing data, a study may have
been excluded on that basis.

Data extraction and management

We extracted and reported the following information, where it was
available, concerning each study.

1. Country and study setting
2. Theoretical  framework  (including  a  brief  description  of  the

intervention)

3. Focus of the intervention
4. Type  of  intervention,  its  duration,  intensity,  delivery  format,

gatekeeper

5. Length of follow-up
6. Size of eligible population
7. Recruitment rate
8. Number of participants or number of clusters and participants
9. Definition of the study population
10.Age range, gender, and ethnicity of participants
11.Definition of smoking status used at baseline
12.Definition of abstinence
13.Biochemical validation
14.Adverse effects of intervention

We  have  reported  any  threats  to  validity  or  other  limitations
described  by  the  studies,  and  where  we  have  contacted  study
authors for discrete data in the 'notes' section (see Characteristics
of included studies).

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

A  selection  of  potentially  relevant  studies,  which  were  ultimately
excluded, are listed in the Characteristics of excluded studies table.

Assessment of risk of bias in included studies

We rated each included study as being at low, unclear, or high risk
of bias in five domains.

1. Random sequence generation
2. Concealment  of  allocation.  For  cluster-randomized  controlled
trials, which recruited after allocation to intervention or control
status,  we  took  account  of  whether  individuals  may  have
been selectively recruited or may have differentially refused to
participate in the light of the known allocation, where this could
be ascertained (Campbell 2004a; Campbell 2004b; Hahn 2005).
3. Performance  bias  (blinding  of  participants  and  personnel,  if

applicable)

4. Detection  bias  (blinding  of  outcome  assessment,  biochemical

validation)

5. Attrition

We also recorded any other risks of bias that did not fit in the above
categories (Higgins 2011).

Measures of treatment effect

We summarized the effect size for each individual study as a risk
ratio  (RR)  with  95%  confidence  interval  (CI).  The  RR  is  calculated
as  (number  quit  in  intervention  group/number  randomized  to
intervention)/(number quit in control group/number randomized
to  control),  with  participants  randomized  but  lost  to  follow-up
regarded as non-abstinent.

Unit of analysis issues

Outcomes  of  all  cluster  randomized  trials  were  given  at  the
participant level, that is, the unit of analysis was different from that
used  for  randomization.  We  checked  whether  the  study  authors'
analysis used a method to account for clustering effects, such as
multi-level  modelling.  If  the  analysis  clearly  stated  that  they  had
made an allowance for clustering, or had examined the clustering
effect  but  found  it  to  be  negligible,  we  extracted  the  effect  size
and  standard  error  (or  95%  CI)  reported  in  the  paper,  converting
odds  ratios  to  approximate  RRs  if  necessary.  Otherwise,  if  a  trial
was  cluster-randomized  but  the  study  authors  had  not  allowed
for this in the published analysis, we extracted the log-RR and its
standard error and the average cluster size, and adjusted it using
an assumed inter-cluster correlation (ICC) of 0.03, a similar value to
that estimated in several of the included studies.

Dealing with missing data

It is a frequent feature of analysis of smoking cessation studies that
cases  lost  to  follow-up  are  assumed  to  be  still  smoking.  Several
authors discussed this issue and made adjustments in the analysis
(e.g. Haug 2013; Hollis 2005; Joffe 2009) and/or analysed their data
on  an  intention-to-treat  basis,  that  is,  including  all  participants
in  the  groups  to  which  they  were  originally  randomized,  and
classifying  those  lost  to  follow-up  as  continuing  smokers.  In  this
review we also counted cases lost to follow-up as current smokers,
even if the primary studies had not explicitly done this. One other
reason for data being unavailable for the review was a tendency for
study authors to report results as percentages, sometimes without
any  particular  clarity  as  to  the  denominator.  Some  of  the  results

of  our  analysis  have  therefore  been  imputed  from  percentages,
assuming  the  denominator  to  be  the  number  of  participants
randomized. Where possible, we have contacted study authors to
ask  for  verification  of  the  calculations  (Brown  2003;  Colby  2005;
Killen 2004; Lipkus 2004; Project EX-1 2001).

Description of studies

Results of the search

Data synthesis

We  pooled  groups  of  studies  that  we  consider  to  be  sufficiently
similar  in  their  interventions,  comparison  groups,  setting,  and
participants,  provided  that  there  was  no  evidence  of  substantial
statistical  heterogeneity  as  assessed  by  the  I2  statistic  (Higgins
2003). Specifically, we have presented results for groups of studies
characterized  by  the  mode  of  delivery  of  the  intervention,  the
theoretical  basis  underpinning  the  intervention,  and  according
to  the  pharmacotherapy  used  (where  applicable).  We  estimated
a  pooled  RR  using  the  Mantel-Haenszel  fixed-effect  model,
based  on  the  quit  rates  at  follow-up.  Where  meta-analysis  was
not  appropriate,  we  have  presented  summary  and  descriptive
statistics. For studies for which we were unable to obtain reliable
numerical data, we have reported the main results narratively.

Sensitivity analysis

In sensitivity analyses we assumed values for the ICC of 0 and 0.05
(in addition to the value of 0.03 assumed for the main analysis) in
making the adjustment to the standard errors for clustering.

Figure 1.   Study flow diagram

For this update, we identified 247 references, from which 15 new
trials  (Bailey  2013;  Colby  2012;  Dalum  2012;  Gungormus  2012;
Guo 2014; Haug 2013; Mason 2016; Pbert 2011; Pérez-Milena 2012;
Prochaska 2015; Project EX Spain 2015a; Project EX Spain 2015b;
Redding  2015;  Scherphof  2014;  Skov-Ettrup  2014)  were  added  to
the list of included studies. A reassessment of previously excluded
studies based on the new inclusion criteria identified four further
studies  (Abroms  2008;  Harris  2010;  O'Neill  2000;  Project  EX-4
2007) (see Differences between protocol and review). The previous
update  of  this  review  contained  28  studies.  The  new  inclusion
criteria  resulted  in  six  of  these  studies  (Chan  1988;  Myers  2005;
NoT  AL  2008;  NoT  FL  2001;  NoT  NC  2005;  NoT  WV  2004)  being
excluded as they are not randomized trials. This update therefore
contains  41  studies  (26  individually  randomized  and  15  cluster-
randomized), which included a total of 13,292 participants. Figure
1 displays the numbers of records screened and studies included
in previous versions of the review, as well as the study flow for this
update.  Trials  excluded  at  the  full-text  screening  stage  are  listed
in  the  Characteristics  of  excluded  studies  table  with  reasons  for
their exclusion, and the characteristics of six ongoing studies can be
found in the Characteristics of ongoing studies table.

Included studies

We  have  given  full  details  of  the  included  studies  in  the
Characteristics  of  included  studies  table,  where  new  trials  are
identified  in  the  notes  as  "New  for  2017  update".    Trials  are
identified  by  the  first  author  and  the  publication  year  of  the
main  report,  except  for  a  group  of  studies  reporting  the  Not  on
Tobacco (NoT) programme and the Project EX programme, which
are  identified  by  programme  type,  trial  location  and  publication
year of the main report.

Delivery method

We  classified  studies  that  used  person-to-person  counselling
interventions  as  those  that  used  individual  counselling  (eight
studies:  Bailey  2013;  Colby  2005;  Colby  2012;  Harris  2010;
Pbert  2011;  Pérez-Milena  2012;  Robinson  2003;  Sherbot  2005)
and  those  that  used  group  counselling  (10  studies:  Greenberg
1978;  Hoffman  2008;  Joffe  2009;  NoT  MD  2009;  NoT  WV  2011;
Project  EX-1  2001;  Project  EX-4  2007;  Project  EX  Russia  2013;
Project  EX  Spain  2015a;  Project  EX  Spain  2015b).  The  individual
counselling  sessions  were  delivered  by  trained  interventionists,
therapists, health educators, general practitioners, or nurses (see
Characteristics of included studies). Nine studies used computer-
based or messaging interventions, possibly also including a face-
to-face  counselling  component  (Aveyard  2001;  Haug  2013;  Hollis
2005; Mason 2016; O'Neill 2000; Patten 2006; Redding 2015; Skov-
Ettrup  2014;  Woodruff  2007).  Eight  studies,  whose  interventions
explicitly  comprised  multiple  delivery  methods,  including  the
provision  of  self-help  materials,  form  a  separate  subcategory
(Abroms  2008;  Dalum  2012;  Gungormus  2012;  Guo  2014;  Horn
2007;  Kelly  2006;  Lipkus  2004;  Peterson  2009).  Of  the  remaining
six studies, four used a purely pharmacological intervention (Killen
2004; Moolchan 2005; Muramoto 2007; Scherphof 2014), described
separately below, and two used a combination of counselling and
a pharmacological intervention (Bailey 2013; Prochaska 2015).

Theoretical basis of intervention

It  was  difficult  to  stratify  many  of  the  studies  into  categories
corresponding  to  a  single  theoretical  model  that  formed  the
basis  of  the  intervention,  and  for  some  studies  no  relevant
information  was  available.  One  intervention,  conducted  in  1978,
used  the  health  promotion  strategies  of  that  period  (Greenberg
1978).  However,  many  interventions  were  complex  and  used
combinations  of  psycho-social  theories  (see  Sheppard  2009  for
discussion  of  management  of  reviews  of  complex  interventions).
Constructs  relating  to  motivational  enhancement  and  strategies
for resisting cultural and social pressures were the most common.
Studies of this type included those using motivational interviewing
(Brown 2003; Colby 2005; Colby 2012; Harris 2010; Horn 2007; Kelly
2006; Lipkus 2004; Mason 2016; Pérez-Milena 2012; Sherbot 2005)
sometimes combined with some form of relapse prevention advice
and ongoing support. Other studies tested interventions based on
the  Transtheoretical  Model  of  Stages  of  Change  for  adolescents
(Prochaska 2000; Redding 2015), either alone (Aveyard 2001; Dalum
2012; Gungormus 2012; Haug 2013; O'Neill 2000; Redding 2015) or
in  combination  with  other  modalities,  including  brief  advice  and
motivational enhancement (Guo 2014; Hoffman 2008; Hollis 2005;
Peterson  2009;  Robinson  2003;  Woodruff  2007)  or,  in  the  case  of
the Project EX suite of studies, a more eclectic mix, including yoga
and  meditation  (Project  EX-1  2001;  Project  EX-4  2007;  Project  EX
Russia 2013; Project EX Spain 2015a; Project EX Spain 2015b). Six
studies based their intervention design on social cognitive theory

2011; Skov-Ettrup 2014).

Pharmacological interventions

interventions,  one
Of  the  four  studies  of  pharmacological 
compared  a  nicotine  patch  with  placebo  after  all  participants
received  a  short  behavioural  intervention  (Scherphof  2014).  One
randomized  participants  to  receive  either  a  nicotine  patch  with
placebo  gum,  nicotine  gum  with  a  placebo  patch,  or  a  placebo
patch  and  placebo  gum,  with  all  participants  receiving  a  short
group  cognitive  behavioural  therapy  (CBT)  session  and  self-help
materials (Moolchan 2005). One used bupropion versus a placebo
tablet, with all participants receiving brief counselling (Muramoto
2007),  and  one  compared  a  combination  treatment  of  nicotine
patch plus bupropion to nicotine patch plus a placebo tablet, with
all participants receiving group skills training (Killen 2004).

Recruitment and settings

The majority of trials were based in North America - one in Canada
(Sherbot 2005) and 28 in the USA. Of the remainder, one took place
in the UK (Aveyard 2001), two in Denmark (Dalum 2012; Skov-Ettrup
2014),  one  in  Switzerland  (Haug  2013),  one  in  the  Netherlands
(Scherphof  2014),  three  in  Spain  (Pérez-Milena  2012;  Project  EX
Spain  2015a;  Project  EX  Spain  2015b),  one  in  Russia  (Project  EX
Russia  2013),  one  in  Turkey  (Gungormus  2012),  one  in  Australia
(Kelly 2006) and one in Taiwan (Guo 2014).

As  can  be  expected  from  a  cohort  where  most  participants  were
in  formal  education,  recruitment  for  studies  mainly  occurred
within  schools  (Aveyard  2001;  Bailey  2013;  Colby  2012;  Dalum
2012;  Greenberg  1978;  Gungormus  2012;  Guo  2014;  Haug  2013;
Hoffman  2008;  Joffe  2009;  Kelly  2006;  Killen  2004;  Mason  2016;
Moolchan  2005;  NoT  MD  2009;  NoT  WV  2011;  Pbert  2011;  Pérez-
Milena 2012; Peterson 2009; Project EX-1 2001; Project EX-4 2007;
Project  EX  Spain  2015a;  Project  EX  Spain  2015b;  Robinson  2003;
Scherphof 2014; Woodruff 2007), universities (Abroms 2008; Harris
2010;  O'Neill  2000)  or  summer  camps  (Project  EX  Russia  2013).
Educational  settings  have  the  advantage  of  easier  recruitment
and minimization of contamination. Nine studies recruited wholly
or partially from the healthcare environment (Brown 2003; Colby
2005; Colby 2012; Hollis 2005; Horn 2007; Mason 2016; Prochaska
2015;  Redding  2015;  Sherbot  2005)  and  one  further  study  via  a
website  aimed  at  smoking  cessation  (Skov-Ettrup  2014).  Three
studies  (Lipkus  2004;  Muramoto  2007;  Patten  2006)  recruited
directly  from  the  community.  Where  a  school  or  college  was  the
base,  trials  were  often  cluster-randomized,  with  the  intervention
delivered  to  all  students  in  one  school,  with  matched  schools
used  for  control  (e.g.  Aveyard  2001;  Guo  2014;  Woodruff  2007),
although  there  were  also  examples  of  individually  randomized
trials in educational settings (e.g. Bailey 2013; Joffe 2009).

The  rate  of  recruitment  was  commented  on  by  several  trialists.
Where  schools  were  recruited  and  matched  or  randomized,  and
attendance in the programme was not compulsory, typically fewer
than half of the students who smoked showed interest in enrolling
(Greenberg 1978; NoT studies; Project EX-1 2001; Project EX Russia
2013). Some trials that recruited from healthcare settings reported
recruitment  rates  higher  than  50%  of  eligible  participants  (e.g.
Colby  2012;  Horn  2007),  substantially  so  in  the  case  of  one  trial
based  in  a  mental-health  setting  (Prochaska  2015).  Recent  trials
of text messaging interventions have achieved participation rates
of  above  70%  when  recruitment  took  place  in  a  school-based,

cluster-randomized  trial  (Haug  2013)  or  when  the  intervention
was  supplemented  with  peer  support  (Mason  2016),  but  lower
recruitment rates when participants were recruited online (Skov-
Ettrup 2014).

For many studies with lower recruitment rates, parental permission
was  a  requirement.  Inducements  to  enrol  or  remain  in  the  study
(money,  gift  cards  or  class  credits)  were  also  a  feature  of  many
trials  (Abroms  2008;  Bailey  2013;  Brown  2003;  Colby  2005;  Colby
2012; Greenberg 1978; Guo 2014; Haug 2013; Joffe 2009; Killen 2004;
Lipkus  2004;  Mason  2016;  Moolchan  2005;  NoT  MD  2009;  Patten
2006; Peterson 2009; Prochaska 2015; Project EX-1 2001; Redding
2015;  Robinson  2003;  Scherphof  2014;  Sherbot  2005;  Woodruff
2007). In some trials an element of compulsion was present, either
with  attendance  as  a  consequence  of  a  smoking  policy  violation
(Robinson  2003)  or  as  a  controlled  regimen  in  a  hospital  setting
(Brown  2003).  Intention  to  quit  smoking  was  a  pre-requisite  of
many trials but was not required for inclusion in this review.

Definition of smoking

One of the crucial issues for smoking cessation research for young
people  is  how  smoking  is  defined,  and  how  cessation  is  defined
and verified. The cessation issues are described in the subsection
following, in the Risk of bias in included studies section and in the
Discussion.

There  was  variation  among  the  included  studies  concerning  the
definition  of  smoking  status,  with  most  relying  on  self-reported
smoking  status  at  recruitment  (see  Characteristics  of  included
studies). In general, at least one cigarette per week (cpw) was used
as  a  definition  of  being  a  smoker.  Studies  used  many  different
definitions  (e.g.  one  cigarette  per  day  at  recruitment,  or  ten
cigarettes in the previous 30 days) and it is likely that some studies
with  less  stringent  inclusion  criteria  recruited  some  participants
who  smoked  less  frequently  than  one  cpw  at  the  time  of
recruitment. Where there was doubt, we assured compatibility with
our criteria through discussion with study authors, where possible.
Hollis  2005  differentiated  between  smokers  and  'experimenters',
but  no  studies  explicitly  took  account  of  the  episodic  nature  of
adolescent  smoking  (Corby  2000;  Grimshaw  2003).  Many  studies
estimated  nicotine  dependence  using  some  form  of  scale,  most
commonly  the  modified  Fagerström  Questionnaire  (e.g.  Killen
2004;  Mason  2016),  alongside  self-reported  measures.  Other
studies used cotinine or exhaled carbon monoxide in the baseline
smoking status assessment or as part of the inclusion criteria (e.g.
Muramoto 2007; see Characteristics of included studies for details).

Measurement of outcomes

The primary outcome was individual-level smoking cessation. Just
as a wide variety of definitions of smoking was used, so there were
several definitions of cessation.

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

The gold standard outcome of continuous abstinence (West 2005)
was  used  by  three  studies  (O'Neill  2000;  Pérez-Milena  2012;
Peterson 2009). Other continuous measures included "prolonged
abstinence", defined as continuous abstinence following an initial
two-week grace period (Moolchan 2005), and "sustained cessation",
defined  as  two  sequential  reports  of  seven-day  point  prevalence
abstinence at four months and eight months from the start of the
intervention (Lipkus 2004). One study used a self-reported measure
based  solely  on  the  participant's  categorization  in  the  Stages  of
Change model (Redding 2015).

Point prevalence measures were in the majority and these ranged
from  cessation  for  one  day  (Hoffman  2008)  to  30-day  cessation
(Aveyard  2001;  Dalum  2012;  Guo  2014;  Harris  2010;  Haug  2013;
Hollis  2005;  Joffe  2009;  Kelly  2006;  Mason  2016;  NoT  MD  2009;
Patten  2006;  Pbert  2011;  Project  EX-1  2001;  Project  EX-4  2007;
Project  EX  Russia  2013;  Project  EX  Spain  2015a;  Project  EX
Spain 2015b; Scherphof 2014; Skov-Ettrup 2014). Another common
outcome  measure  was  seven-day  point  prevalence  abstinence
(Abroms 2008; Aveyard 2001; Bailey 2013; Brown 2003; Colby 2005;
Colby 2012; Haug 2013; Killen 2004; Lipkus 2004; Moolchan 2005;
Muramoto  2007;  NoT  WV  2011;  Prochaska  2015;  Robinson  2003;
Woodruff 2007).

Verification of smoking status

Of the 41 studies that satisfied the inclusion criteria for this review,
23  used  or  attempted  some  form  of  biochemical  verification  of
self-reports of smoking status for the whole cohort or for the full
duration  of  follow-up.  Seven  trials  used  more  than  one  method
of biochemical verification (Brown 2003; Colby 2005; Colby 2012;
Killen  2004;  Moolchan  2005;  Prochaska  2015;  Robinson  2003).
Carbon  monoxide  levels  were  measured  for  verification  in  1415
listed trials (Bailey 2013; Brown 2003; Colby 2005; Colby 2012; Killen
2004; Moolchan 2005; Muramoto 2007; NoT WV 2011; Patten 2006;
Pérez-Milena 2012; Prochaska 2015; Project EX-1 2001; Project EX-4
2007; Project EX Spain 2015b; Robinson 2003), salivary cotinine in
15 trials (Abroms 2008; Brown 2003; Colby 2005; Colby 2012; Harris
2010; Hoffman 2008; Joffe 2009; Killen 2004; Lipkus 2004; Moolchan
2005;  NoT  MD  2009;  Pbert  2011;  Prochaska  2015;  Robinson  2003;
Scherphof  2014)  and  urinary  cotinine  in  one  trial  (Guo  2014).
Peterson  2009  used  internal  verification  within  questionnaires.
Two studies reported using a form of "bogus pipeline" alongside
biochemical validation in an attempt to improve the assessment of
smoking status (Harris 2010; Robinson 2003).

Risk of bias in included studies

Figure 2 summarizes the review authors' judgements across each
risk  of  bias  domain  and  Figure  3  shows  a  breakdown  for  each
domain by study. We judged the majority of studies to be at unclear
or high risk of bias in at least one domain.

Allocation

Blinding

Of  the  41  included  studies,  15  were  cluster-randomized  (Aveyard
2001;  Dalum  2012;  Guo  2014;  Harris  2010;  Haug  2013;  Hoffman
2008;  NoT  WV  2011;  Pbert  2011;  Peterson  2009;  Project  EX-1
2001; Project EX-4 2007; Project EX Russia 2013; Project EX Spain
2015a; Project EX Spain 2015b; Woodruff 2007) and the remainder
allocated individuals. Of the cluster-randomized trials, we judged
three  to  be  at  high  risk  of  selection  bias  because  of  the  way  in
which institutions or students within clusters were recruited (NoT
WV  2011;  Project  EX  Spain  2015a;  Woodruff  2007).  Three  of  the
individually randomized studies were rated at high risk of selection
bias because of the method of allocation or concealment (Brown
2003; Greenberg 1978; Sherbot 2005). Twenty-five studies did not
provide sufficient detail on either randomization or allocation, and
hence we judged them to be at unclear risk of selection bias.

We  rated  nine  studies  as  having  high  risk  of  performance  bias
(Abroms 2008; Bailey 2013; Gungormus 2012; Guo 2014; Haug 2013;
Pérez-Milena 2012; Prochaska 2015; Project EX Spain 2015a; Project
EX  Spain  2015b).  These  were  generally  behavioural  intervention
trials  in  which  there  was  a  considerable  difference  in  the  extent
of  intervention  given  according  to  group  allocation.  We  judged
19  studies  to  be  at  unclear  risk  of  performance  bias,  as  it
was  not  clear  if  blinding  had  taken  place  or,  in  the  case  of
behavioural  interventions,  was  not  clear  whether  participants  in
control groups were aware of the programme the intervention arms
were receiving.

We  judged  14  studies  that  involved  face-to-face  contact  in  the
intervention  group  to  be  at  high  risk  of  detection  bias,  as  they
employed inadequate or no biochemical validation and were liable
to  possible  differential  misreport  (Dalum  2012;  Greenberg  1978;

Spain 2015a; Project EX Spain 2015b; Sherbot 2005; Woodruff 2007).

Incomplete outcome data

The percentage of participants lost to follow-up was less than 10%
in  some  studies,  but  was  often  high,  and  sometimes  above  50%
(Dalum 2012; Horn 2007; Lipkus 2004; Moolchan 2005; Project EX
Spain 2015a; Skov-Ettrup 2014). We judged six studies to be at high
risk  of  attrition  bias,  as  having  particularly  high  or  unexplained
dropout,  especially  if  this  occurred  differentially  between  groups
(Dalum 2012; Gungormus 2012; Horn 2007; Project EX Spain 2015a;
Project EX Spain 2015b; Skov-Ettrup 2014). We judged two further
studies to be at unclear risk, as they did not report attrition rates in
sufficient detail to make a judgement (Robinson 2003; Project EX-4
2007). We judged all other studies to be at low risk of attrition bias.

Other potential sources of bias

We also evaluated studies for any other potential sources of bias.
We judged four studies to be at unclear or high risk of other bias
owing to possible or confirmed issues with treatment fidelity and
contamination (Aveyard 2001; Dalum 2012; Robinson 2003; Skov-
Ettrup 2014). We judged one study to be at high risk of other bias
due to significant between-group differences at baseline (Sherbot
2005), and three at high or unclear risk because of inadequate or
inconsistent reporting of data by group (Guo 2014; Prochaska 2015;
Project  EX  Spain  2015a).  We  classified  one  study  as  having  high
risk of other bias because the definition of the cessation outcome
measure appeared not to be consistent with the maintenance stage
of  the  Stages  of  Change  model  used  (Gungormus  2012),  and  one
because of doubts about the extent to which the smoking cessation
intervention was delivered (Redding 2015).

were unable to establish the denominator and the study report was
published  before  follow-up  was  complete  (Robinson  2003).  One
study did not report sufficient data for numerical extraction (Project
EX Russia 2013). Two studies used a combination of counselling and
pharmacological interventions (Bailey 2013; Prochaska 2015) and
so did not did not fit into the categorization adopted for this review;
one of these (Prochaska 2015) also did not provide sufficient data
with which a summary statistic could be calculated.

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

Behavioural interventions versus control, grouped by delivery
mode

Among studies that primarily offered individual counselling as the
intervention (Analysis 1.1), the pooled risk ratio (RR) for smoking
cessation was 1.07 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.83 to 1.39, I2 =
1%, seven studies, n = 2088). This estimate was heavily influenced
by the results of Harris 2010, which showed a small, negative (albeit
not  statistically  significant)  effect  of  the  intervention  on  30-day
point  prevalence  abstinence  at  six  months.  This  study  however
claimed a beneficial effect of the intervention on quit attempts and
an  increased  rate  of  cessation  among  heavier  baseline  smokers.
Harris  2010  and  Pérez-Milena  2012  also  demonstrated  notably
higher quit rates in both intervention and control groups than the
much larger study of Pbert 2011 (crude intervention group quit rate
20% for Harris 2010, 30% for Pérez-Milena 2012, 5% for Pbert 2011).

Studies that used group counselling (Analysis 1.2) demonstrated a
larger intervention effect (RR 1.35, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.77, I2 = 0%, nine
studies, n = 1910). None of the nine contributing studies showed
a  statistically  significant  effect  of  the  intervention  individually,
although  in  eight  of  these  studies  the  point  estimate  of  the  RR
was  above  one  and  many  had  small  sample  sizes  (less  than
100 participants per group). Two studies yielded very large point
estimates because of very low (Greenberg 1978) or zero (Project EX
Spain 2015a) quit rates in the control group.

Among  interventions  that  used  information  or  communication
technology  (Analysis  1.3),  there  were  no  statistically  significant
intervention effects for either purely computer-based interventions
(RR  0.79,  95%  CI  0.50  to  1.24,  I2  =  0%,  three  studies,  n  =  340)  or
messaging  interventions  (RR  1.18,  95%  CI  0.90  to  1.56,  I2  =  0%,
three  studies,  n  =  2985).  When  we  pooled  results  from  the  three
studies that used a combination of a computer-based intervention
and face-to-face counselling, statistical heterogeneity was high (I2
= 62%), with substantially different results between the two largest
trials,  and  hence  we  have  not  presented  pooled  results  for  this
comparison. Aveyard 2001 (based on the results after one year of
follow-up reported in Aveyard 1999) found no effect (RR 1.03, 95% CI
0.80 to 1.33, n = 1089), whereas Hollis 2005 found a strong, positive
intervention  effect  (RR  1.79,  1.19  to  2.71,  n  =  448).  The  latter's
authors  attribute  the  difference  to  greater  provision  of  adjunct
counselling alongside the computer-based materials, as in Aveyard
2001 the face-to-face component of the intervention was delivered
to participants in a group in a school classroom setting. The effect
sizes at one year and two years for Hollis 2005 were very similar,
even  though  the  percentage  of  participants  in  the  intervention
group  achieving  cessation  dropped  from  28%  to  24%  between
these two time points, while two-year follow-up results provided
by Aveyard 2001 continued to show a non-statistically significant
intervention  effect.  The  third  study  in  this  subgroup  found  no
intervention effect, but this was based on a small subgroup of the
total sample who were smokers at baseline (Redding 2015).

The  diverse  category  of  trials  whose  interventions  included
multiple  delivery  methods  (all 
included  self-help  materials
alongside  other  more  intensive  delivery  modes)  (Analysis  1.4)
showed  a  pooled  RR  of  1.26  (95%  CI  0.95  to  1.66,  I2  =  0%,  eight
studies, n = 2755). In this analysis there were also two small trials
with  a  very  high  RR  estimate  because  of  a  low  cessation  rate  in
the control group (Gungormus 2012; Guo 2014); these studies were
rated  as  having  high  risk  of  bias  but  because  of  their  size  were

relatively  uninfluential  on  the  pooled  estimate.  The  three  largest
trials  in  this  meta-analysis  (Dalum  2012;  Lipkus  2004;  Peterson
2009) all showed positive, non-statistically significant findings, with
RR  estimates  ranging  between  1.10  and  1.29.  All  three  of  these
trials  used  a  multifactorial  intervention  that  included  elements
of  counselling  alongside  self-help  materials,  with  some  level  of
tailoring to individual requirements.

Behavioural interventions versus control, grouped by
theoretical basis

The theoretical basis of behavioural interventions was not always
easy  to  classify,  as  the  studies  did  not  always  provide  detailed
information  and  some  studies  used  interventions  that  combined
multiple theoretical approaches.

In  the  three  subgroups  that  could  be  defined  by  the  theoretical
basis of the intervention, corresponding to Stage of Change models
(Analysis  2.1),  motivational  interviewing  (Analysis  2.2)  and  social
cognitive theory (SCT) (Analysis 2.3) respectively, all showed small
effect sizes (stage of change versus control RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.85 to
1.31, I2 = 0%, six studies, n = 3282; motivational interviewing versus
control RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.36, I2 = 0%, ten studies, n = 1752;
SCT versus control RR 1.16, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.51, I2 = 0%, six studies,
n = 3667).

In  the  group  of  studies  that  were  classified  as  using  a  complex
theoretical  model  (e.g.  drawing  on  multiple  theories)  (Analysis
2.4),  there  was  evidence  of  a  positive  intervention  effect  (RR
1.40,  95%  CI  1.14  to  1.74,  I2  =  14%,  nine  studies,  n  =  2827).  One
study  was  quite  influential  on  the  pooled  estimate,  and  was  the
only  one  of  the  contributing  trials  that  reported  a  statistically
significant intervention effect (Hollis 2005). Of the two studies that
could  not  be  included  in  the  meta-analysis  but  also  fell  into  this
category, the study of Project EX Russia 2013 in summer recreation
camps claimed a higher smoking cessation rate for smoking in the
intervention  group  (in  the  context  of  a  near-zero  cessation  rate
among participants in the control group) and Robinson 2003, using
a combination of CBT and motivational techniques delivered over
four sessions with telephone follow-up, did not detect any effect on
cessation.

Pharmacological interventions

This  review  contains  four  studies  that  used  pharmacological
interventions. Effect sizes are displayed in Analysis 3.1, Analysis 3.2
and Analysis 3.3. All studies were relatively small and abstinence
rates  were  low,  and  so  confidence  intervals  are  wide.  The  only
studies that used directly comparable interventions were two trials
that  used  nicotine  replacement  therapy  (NRT)  (Moolchan  2005;
Scherphof 2014). These yielded a pooled RR of 1.11 (95% CI 0.48 to
2.58, I2 = 20%, n = 385). Pooled results from nicotine patch yielded
an RR of 1.02 (95% CI 0.41 to 2.56, I2 = 57%, n = 319). Moolchan 2005
also used a nicotine gum treatment arm: the RR of 1.74 (95% CI 0.21
to 14.60, n = 66) for gum versus placebo at six months had a very
wide confidence interval. Muramoto 2007 did not detect evidence
for a benefit of standard dose bupropion (RR 1.49, 95% CI 0.55 to
4.02,  n  =  207),  and  Killen  2004  also  failed  to  detect  an  effect  for
bupropion used as an adjunct to NRT patches versus patches alone
(RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.41 to 2.69, n = 211). Given the small number of
individuals in both the intervention or control groups who achieved
smoking  cessation  at  any  point  during  follow-up,  these  studies
appear to be severely underpowered.

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

Two  trials,  not  included  in  forest  plots,  used  interventions  that
combined a pharmacological and a behavioural component. Both
the intervention and the control group participants of Bailey 2013
received 10 weeks of group-based CBT and skills training, followed
by nine weeks of therapy using a nicotine patch; the intervention
group  additionally  received  nine  additional  subsequent  group
sessions  ("extended  treatment").  The  trial  resulted  in  a  large
increase in smoking cessation in the intervention group compared
to  control  (seven-day  point  prevalence  abstinence  at  6  weeks:
15/72 versus 5/71, RR 2.96, 95% CI 1.14 to 7.71, n = 143 (analysis
not  shown)).  Prochaska  2015  used  a  complex  intervention  that
consisted  of  several  components,  including  a  Transtheoretical
Model (Stages of Change) (TTM)-based computer intervention, six
sessions of CBT and the option of 12 weeks using a nicotine patch
for  heavier  smokers.  This  study  reported  15%  seven-day  point
prevalence abstinence after 12 months for all trial participants, but
no evidence of a difference between the study arms (full results data
were not available).

Project EX interventions

Five eligible trials used a version of Project EX, originally developed
as a clinic-based smoking cessation programme (Sussman 2004):
an initial evaluation in the USA (Project EX-1 2001), and four more
recent  studies  in  the  USA  (Project  EX-4  2007),  Spain  (Project  EX
Spain 2015a; Project EX Spain 2015b) and Russia (Project EX Russia
2013).  The  first  of  these  studies  (Project  EX-1  2001)  contained
a  third  arm  in  which  the  Project  EX  intervention  was  enhanced
with a 'school-as-community' component. This was combined with
the  standard  Project  EX  arm  for  the  purpose  of  data  analysis
and the enhanced intervention has not been used in subsequent
trials.  Among  the  four  studies  with  data  suitable  for  pooling,  the
estimated  effect  RR  was  1.48  (95%  CI  1.05  to  2.10,  I2  =  0%,  four
studies, n = 1215, Analysis 4.1). Project EX Russia 2013 also stated
a  beneficial  effect  on  smoking  cessation,  but  did  not  provide
sufficient  data  to  be  included  in  numerical  analysis.  This  result
should  be  taken  in  the  context  that  the  two  Spanish  studies,
which  were  conducted  in  similar  school  settings,  were  judged
at  particularly  high  risk  of  bias,  with  concerns  relating  to  both
institutional and participant-level dropout. Additionally, there was
a  marked  variation  in  absolute  quit  rates  between  the  Project
EX  trials,  with  reported  six-month  quit  rates  in  control  group
participants ranging from zero (Project EX Spain 2015a) to 25% of
baseline smokers (Project EX-4 2007).

Sensitivity analysis

Varying  the  assumed  ICC  had  relatively  little  effect  on  the
magnitude of pooled RRs as many studies were either individually
randomized or had already allowed for clustering in their published
analyses,  and  estimates  from  other  studies  already  tended  to
have wide confidence intervals. In the different sensitivity analysis
scenarios, point estimates for the pooled RR ranged from 1.34 to
1.38 for Analysis 1.2, from 1.25 to 1.27 for Analysis 1.4, from 1.15 to
1.16 for Analysis 2.3, from 1.39 to 1.43 in Analysis 2.4 and from 1.46
to 1.53 in Analysis 4.1.

Adverse effects

None  of  the  psychosocial  trials  reported  whether  any  adverse
events  had  occurred.  In  the  trial  of  nicotine  patch  or  gum  versus
placebo of Moolchan 2005, one or both of the active medications
were  associated  with  an  increase  compared  to  placebo  in  five
symptom categories - sore throat, hiccups, erythema, pruritus and

shoulder/arm  pain.  Bailey  2013  reported  the  occurrence  of  73
unspecified  adverse  events  during  the  open-label  nicotine  patch
treatment phase, but that none of these was "medically serious".
Scherphof  2014  stated  that  participants  using  the  nicotine  patch
reported  more  episodes  of  headache,  cough,  abnormal  dreams,
muscle  pain,  and  "patch-related  adverse  events"  than  those  in
the  control  group,  but  that  successful  quitters  in  the  nicotine
patch group reported a lower level of insomnia than those in the
control  group,  which  the  authors  attribute  to  withdrawal  effects.
The  authors  state  these  self-reported  side  effects  to  be  generally
mild.

In  the  trial  of  bupropion  as  an  adjunct  to  nicotine  patch  (Killen
2004),  although  young  people  reported  a  total  of  47  self-rated
"severe" complaints, with nausea the most common, none of these
was judged to be severe by the lead study physician. In the trial of
bupropion alone (Muramoto 2007), a large number of participants
in all study groups, including the control group, reported adverse
effects  (for  example,  around  half  of  all  participants  reported
headache; cough, throat symptoms, sleep disturbance and nausea
were also each reported by more than 10% of participants). Eight
subjects  discontinued  bupropion  treatment  because  of  different
adverse  events,  and  two  further  serious  adverse  events  resulting
in  hospitalization  occurred  among  participants  in  the  bupropion
group:  one  participant  was  admitted  for  anticholinergic  crisis
after  ingesting  Datura  innoxia  and  one  participant  intentionally
overdosed on study medication and other substances.

Summary of main results

This  is  an  update  of  a  review  first  published  in  2006.  The  most
recent  (2017)  update  includes  19  additional  studies.  However,
our  certainty  in  the  findings  remains  low  or  very  low  for  all
comparisons.  For  behavioural  therapies  (Summary  of  findings
for  the  main  comparison),  when  we  grouped  interventions  by
delivery mode, no interventions showed effects apart from group
counselling,  but  certainty  here  is  limited  by  inconsistency  and
risk  of  bias,  and  imprecision  is  an  additional  issue  for  the  other
interventions tested. When we grouped studies by theoretical basis,
studies  employing  complex  theoretical  models  showed  the  most
promise,  but  again  these  studies  were  clinically  heterogeneous.
There  is  very  limited  evidence  on  pharmacotherapies  in  this
population, with two small studies of nicotine replacement therapy
and  two  small  studies  of  bupropion  failing  to  demonstrate  an
effect  (Summary  of  findings  2).  Evidence  here  is  again  limited  by
issues  with  imprecision  and  risk  of  bias.  Pooled  results  from  the
four studies evaluating Project EX showed a pooled result whose
confidence  intervals  only  narrowly  exceeded  1.  As  with  previous
versions  of  this  review,  this  update  demonstrates  that  more
research is still needed in this field. Our specific recommendations
for  future  research  are  detailed  below  (see  Implications  for
research).

Completeness, applicability and quality of the evidence

As detailed in Summary of findings for the main comparison and
Summary  of  findings  2  the  quality  of  the  evidence  in  this  review
is  limited  by  issues  relating  to  individual  study  quality  (risk  of
bias), imprecision due to a small number of included studies and
some studies appearing underpowered, and inconsistency due to
clinical heterogeneity between studies. This hampers our ability to

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

draw any firm conclusions about the interventions evaluated in this
review.  Some  further  issues  with  the  data  are  discussed  in  more
detail below.

The  first  of  these  is  that  most  of  the  included  studies  were
conducted  in  high-income  countries.  As  previously  explained
(see  Background),  adolescent  smoking  rates  are,  for  the  most
part,  declining  in  high-income  countries.  However,  they  remain
high,  and  in  some  cases  continue  to  rise,  in  lower-  and  middle-
income countries (LMICs). Therefore, the majority of the evidence
from  this  review  has  not  been  generated  in  the  setting  where
the  interventions  are  most  needed.  This  is  not  to  say  that  the
interventions tested in high-income countries are not relevant to
LMICs,  nor  that  high  income-countries  are  not  also  in  need  of
effective  stop-smoking  programmes  for  adolescents,  but  LMICs
may face particular challenges with implementation that have yet
to be adequately explored by the research in this field.

With  regards  to  applicability,  it  should  be  noted  that  where
recruitment  was  by  inclusion  from  self-reports  it  is  likely  that
those volunteering, and in some trials obtaining parental consent,
could  be  perceived  as  a  subset  of  all  smokers  -  those  who  were
both willing to quit and willing to participate in a research study.
Some study authors comment on this aspect of recruitment (Kealey
2009b).

A  further  weakness  in  the  evidence  base  springs  from  the
definitions  of  quitting  used  in  different  studies.  These  vary  from
self-reported  quitting  for  longer  than  one  day  through  to  seven-
day  or  30-day  point  prevalence  abstinence  at  the  point  of
ascertainment, to longer or continuous periods (see Characteristics
of included studies). With respect to the shorter point prevalence
abstinences, a negative result is useful in demonstrating evidence
of a lack of effect where the study size is adequate but care should
be  taken  with  the  shorter  quit  lengths  such  as  24  hours.  The
irregularity and instability of the smoking habit in its early stages
(for example, weekend smoking is commonly reported) and the low
number of cigarettes smoked at baseline by some participants, calls
into question the prognostic value of short-term point prevalence
abstinence  measurements  of  less  than  30  days.  Several  trials
recognize  this  pattern  of  smoking  and  use  a  30-day  measure  of
abstinence but continuous abstinence remains the recommended
outcome (West 2005). It is tempting to conclude that encouraging
an increased number of what are effectively short-lived (e.g. seven-
day) quit attempts allows young people to 'practice' quitting, and
therefore may help to achieve prolonged cessation in the long run.
Prolonged quit attempts might also have a health benefit on their
own, or interrupt the progression to more regular or heavy smoking.
However, we have no data for young people against which we can
test these assumptions.

In addition, several studies clearly demonstrate the importance of
biochemical verification (Robinson 2003; Killen 2004; Colby 2005)
as substantial numbers of participants have given false information
regarding  quit  attempts.  This  raises  possible  doubts  about  the
validity  of  those  studies  that  showed  positive  results  but  did  not
use  verification,  for  example,  Hollis  2005.  In  Project  EX-1  2001,
verification was incomplete and a weighting factor was added to
results. For NoT WV 2011, verification was added to the intervention
but only done at three months. There is a continued need for further
studies where smoking status has been verified, but the experience
of some studies (e.g. Hoffman 2008) underlines the challenges that
face researchers in this area. Muramoto warns that exhaled CO has a

short half-life and may be an insensitive measure given the episodic
nature of teen smoking. She reports cotinine confirmed rates 50%
to 65% lower than CO rates (Muramoto 2007).

Potential biases in the review process

For  the  purpose  of  this  review,  we  have  taken  a  clinical  focus
on  young  smokers.  In  public  health  terms,  the  line  between
young smokers, experimenters and 'potential' smokers is blurred.
Some  interventions  are  therefore  aimed  at  the  population  level,
attempting  to  combine  prevention  and  cessation.  Individual
clinicians, however, face a different problem: what advice should
they  give  and  what  works  for  the  young  person  who  has  started
smoking and expresses a wish to stop? For this review, therefore,
we  drew  what  might  otherwise  be  seen  as  an  arbitrary  line  and
developed a protocol that would include those prevention studies
that had a cessation intervention component and discrete results
for smokers.

Ideally, we would wish to know outcomes in terms of true smoking
cessation,  that  is,  quitting  smoking  and  never  smoking  again,
although  an  absolute  measure  of  cessation  in  these  terms  is  in
practice  impossible,  as  it  would  require  life-long  follow-up  of
participants.  It  is  necessary  therefore  to  consider  just  how  well
what  are  effectively  proxy  measures  correspond  to  the  desired
outcome. Clearly, longer periods of follow-up would be of greater
value. We therefore limited our review to studies with six months'
follow-up,  as  recommended  elsewhere  (Mermelstein  2002;  West
2005). There is clear evidence in some of the included studies that
performed repeated measures, of a waning effect over this period
(e.g. Brown 2003). Early relapse is an obvious danger, especially for
young people who have been shown to make many quit attempts
(MMWR 2009). In order to standardize comparisons, we took the six-
month period as beginning from baseline measurement. It should
be noted however, that studies may not set a quit date until some
weeks  into  the  programme  (e.g.  Project  EX)  and  this  may  be  a
source of bias when comparing outcomes.

For our results, we used an intention-to-treat analysis, that is, all
those randomized were included in their original groups, whether
or not they received the full intervention. We counted all those with
missing  data  as  continuing  smokers.  We  requested  information
from  authors  where  necessary  to  facilitate  these  calculations.
Although  this  is  standard  practice  in  adult  cessation  studies,  the
reasons for young people dropping out from follow-up are diverse,
and  by  no  means  always  related  to  risk  of  continued  smoking.
We accept, therefore, that this assumption leads to a conservative
analysis, and that it may bias our results towards the null.

Many  studies  in  this  area  are  cluster-randomized.  Where  authors
had  not  allowed  for  clustering  effects  in  their  statistical  analysis,
we imputed a plausible value of the ICC, and varied this value in a
sensitivity analysis. This did not have large influence on estimates
of the pooled effect sizes, and the uncertainty due to this analysis
appears small compared to the uncertainty in the effect estimate
itself, as reflected in generally wide confidence intervals that do not
rule out the possibility of clinically important effects.

Agreements and disagreements with other studies or
reviews

The  results  of  this  review  are  for  the  most  part  consistent  with
other reviews of smoking cessation interventions in young people,

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

though other reviews are very different from ours (Sussman 1998;
Sussman  2002;  McDonald  2003;  Sussman  2006;  Gervais  2007).
Some of these reviews had a much wider focus and included non-
experimental studies. For example, Sussman 2006 (also discussed
by USDHHS 2012) found some evidence of a modest improvement
in  quit  rate  both  overall  and  stratified  by  the  theoretical  basis  of
the intervention but included many non-randomized studies and
did  not  restrict  by  the  length  of  follow-up.  Our  review  update
has  aimed  instead  to  evaluate  the  experimental  evidence  for
effectiveness. Our results are also consistent with Riemsma 2003,
whose  review  found  results  similar  to  Aveyard  2001.  A  recent
review of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) in adolescents, which
included a broader range of study types than our review, also did
not detect evidence of an effect (King 2016).

There  is,  however,  one  review  of  randomized  controlled  trials  of
which we are aware that concluded that behavioural interventions
for smoking cessation in adolescents were effective (Peirson 2016).
This  was  an  update  of  a  2013  review  (Patnode  2013)  focusing
on  primary-care  relevant  interventions.  Though  the  2013  review
did  not  find  any  evidence  of  effectiveness,  in  the  2016  review,
inclusion  criteria  were  amended  to  include  only  studies  with
control  groups  that  received  no  content  specifically  designed  or
intended  to  prevent  or  treat  tobacco  smoking.  Three  studies  are
therefore included in Peirson 2016's meta-analysis of behavioural
interventions  for  smoking  cessation;  of  these,  one  was  excluded
from  our  review  as  it  did  not  meet  our  inclusion  criteria  (Pbert
2008). The study driving the observed effect in Peirson 2016 is Hollis
2005. In our review, Hollis 2005 is classed as an intervention using
both  computer-based  and  face-to-face  counselling  interventions;
when  pooled,  the  result  for  this  comparison  was  not  statistically
significant but we did not present pooled results due to substantial
statistical  heterogeneity  (see  Analysis  1.3).  In  our  analysis  by
theoretical  basis,  Hollis  2005  is  pooled  with  other  interventions
using  a  complex  theoretical  model  (Analysis  2.4);  here  an  effect
was detected. However, this group of interventions was clinically
heterogeneous and we judged Hollis 2005 to be at high risk of bias
as  it  did  not  use  biochemical  verification  of  smoking  status.  As
this  study  was  the  most  influential  on  the  effect  estimate  in  this
subgroup,  having  a  large  sample  size,  we  believe  these  concerns
warrant caution when interpreting results.

Our  results  contrast  with  those  of  systematic  reviews  that  have
investigated  the  effectiveness  of  similar  interventions  in  adult
populations.  For  some  of  the  intervention  methods  considered
there  is  not  enough  evidence  from  trials  of  young  people  to
make  a  definitive  comparison  with  results  from  trials  in  adults.
However, the pooled effect size estimates for individual and group
therapies  are  lower  than  those  in  previous  Cochrane  Reviews
for  adults.  For  individual  counselling  in  young  people,  the  RR
estimate  of  1.07,  with  an  upper  95%  CI  limit  of  1.39,  compares
to  an  estimate  of  1.57,  with  lower  95%  CI  limit  of  1.40  in  adults
(Lancaster 2017). For group counselling versus control, the effect
size  estimate  for  young  people  (1.35)  is  also  lower  than  the
effect sizes seen for some group-based interventions in adults (RR
1.88  when  compared  to  self-help  interventions,  Stead  2017).  The
estimated RR for mobile phone-based interventions is much lower
in  our  review  than  in  the  corresponding  review  in  adults  (1.67,
Whittaker 2016). The lack of evidence regarding the effectiveness
of  pharmacological  interventions  in  young  people  is  particularly
striking. The existing evidence base gives us no reason to believe
that the neuropharmacological efficacy, effectiveness and safety of

pharmacotherapies for smoking cessation should be different for
adolescents than for any other group of smokers, but the context
and  meaning  of  smoking  in  adolescence  is  very  different  from
that for adult smokers (Amos 2006). While there is strong evidence
of  the  effectiveness  of  NRT  (from  150  trials,  Stead  2012)  and
bupropion (from 65 trials, Hughes 2014) for cessation, our review
contains just four relatively small studies that used either of these
treatments, and hence their effectiveness in young people remains
uncertain.  Taken  together,  these  comparisons  demonstrate  that
adult interventions whose effectiveness is well established cannot
be assumed to be equally successful in younger age groups.

Future directions

Twenty-seven  of  the  41  included  studies  have  been  published
within  the  last  ten  years,  with  19  new  studies  contributing  to
this  update,  suggesting  an  increase  in  both  activity  and  in  some
instances  in  quality.  However,  this  update  has  not  resulted  in
stronger  conclusions  regarding  the  effectiveness  of  interventions
in  this  area.  Due  to  continuing  limitations  in  the  evidence  base,
we are unable to recommend widespread implementation of any
one  model.  We  are  aware  that  there  is  a  growing  interest  in  this
topic and we intend to continue regular updates of this review. Over
the period that we have been extracting data, teenage prevalence
figures  have  shown  some  improvement  in  those  countries  using
global public health campaigns (USDHHS 2012), such as bans on
smoking in public places (Frazer 2016), suggesting global measures
may have had an impact on smoking initiation. However, we must
not  lose  sight  of  the  fact  that  a  substantial  segment  of  young
people  still  smoke  and  a  high  proportion  of  quit  attempts  fail
(Bancej  2007).  In  some  lower  and  middle  income  countries,  the
prevalence  of  smoking  in  young  people  is  rising  (Eriksen  2015),
and in high income countries, the burden disproportionately falls
on  people  with  mental  health  conditions  and  on  those  of  lower
socioeconomic status. Further research into effective ways to help
young people stop smoking continues to be needed.

Implications for research

Research  is  developing  and  increasingly  studies  are  measuring
verified, sustained quitting. This trend is to be encouraged for all
new trials for teen smoking. However, our confidence for all findings
in  this  review  is  limited  by  issues  with  imprecision,  risk  of  bias,
and  inconsistency.  More  studies  are  urgently  needed  evaluating
both pharmacological and behavioural interventions for smoking

cessation  in  young  people.  Studies  should  minimize  risk  of  bias
as  much  as  possible  and  be  adequately  powered  for  cessation.
The evidence is developing for complex psychosocial interventions
but  needs  to  be  replicated  and  tested  in  different  settings.  The
theoretical  basis  of  all  interventions  should  be  explicit,  and
reporting  using  CONSORT  standards  (Schulz  2010)  should  be  the
norm  (e.g.  Hollis  2005).  Trials  of  brief  interventions  or  self-help
materials would be useful, particularly as these are often used as
control conditions for more complex interventions. In addition, the
majority of studies in this review were conducted in high-income
countries,  despite  adolescent  smoking  rates  being  substantially
higher in lower- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Therefore,
further studies conducted in LMICs would be particularly useful.

Likely losses to follow-up for this age group must also be considered
in the research design and the assumption that losses to follow-up
are  non-quitters  (whilst  representing  the  current  'gold  standard')
needs  testing.  Every  effort  should  be  made  to  keep  the  latter  as
small as possible, so that intention-to-treat analysis with missing
participants  treated  as  continuing  smokers  can  be  carried  out
without excessive bias towards the null. Brown 2003 and Peterson
2009 demonstrate good practice in this respect. Subsidiary analysis
of  data  with  other  imputed  data  is  acceptable  but  should  not
represent the main result.

Biochemical verification remains the gold standard (West 2005) and
there is the potential for substantial misclassification of smoking
status  in  adolescents  if  relying  on  self-report  alone  (Jarvis  2008).
If  it  is  used,  note  should  be  made  on  the  limitations  of  exhaled
CO,  given  the  episodic  nature  of  smoking  in  this  population.
However, although it is recognized that self-reports in this cohort
are not necessarily reliable, voluntary use of verification can affect
recruitment and retention, especially if parental consent is required
before it is used in adolescents, and a pragmatic decision needs to
be taken in study design that balances these factors (SRNT 2002).

Our  review  did  not  find  any  eligible  studies  that  used  electronic
cigarettes  as  an  intervention  for  tobacco  smoking  cessation  in
adolescents.  A  recent  systematic  review  of  electronic  cessation
interventions  (Hartmann-Boyce  2016)  also  found  no  randomized
trials in this age group, and only a single, non-randomized, study
that  investigated  their  use  in  a  young  adult  population,  aged  18
to  24  years  (Choi  2014).  Given  the  sharply  increasing  popularity
of electronic cigarettes (Farsalinos 2016), it appears reasonable to
expect future evaluations in relation to tobacco smoking cessation
in young people as the scope of the research literature in this area
continues to grow.

Few of our studies complied with the Russell Standard (West 2005).
Six  months'  follow-up  should  be  a  minimum  requirement,  and
research  should  use  outcomes  based  on  sustained,  continuous
quitting  in  line  with  the  Russell  Standard.  As  a  complementary
measure,  long-term  prospective  studies  of  the  natural  smoking
history of those making quit attempts in adolescence are needed.
Finally,  as  the  field  matures,  direct  comparisons  of  effective
treatments  should  become  possible  and  should  support  full
economic analyses.

Pre-test smoking status assessment: self-report

Post-test smoking status assessment: biochemically validated self-report

Intervention: X-Pack programme, tailored to young adults. 15-min in-person counselling session dur-
ing which the participant was encouraged to set a quit date in the following month and key information
was reviewed; self-help kit (The X-Pack) containing a guidebook, motivational materials and cigarette
alternatives (gum, toothpicks, putty); and 10-12 individually tailored emails from counsellors over the 6
months following the quit date, to which participants were encouraged to respond. Emails were weekly
in first month post quit date, and monthly for following 5 months

Previously excluded, now included in 2017 update. This is on account of the redefinition of our inclu-
sion criteria for age of participants.

Authors' judgement

Support for judgement

Random sequence genera-
tion (selection bias)

Unclear risk

“Counselors were assigned a list of identification numbers for enrolled partici-
pants, each of which was randomly assigned to a participant’s condition”. No
details on generation of randomization sequence itself

Allocation concealment

All outcomes

Blinding of outcome as-
sessment (detection bias) 
All outcomes

Unclear risk

Information not sufficient to make judgement

High risk

Behavioural intervention so blinding is impossible, and different amounts of
contact time with counsellors between groups causes a high risk of differen-
tial misreport. “After the in-person counselling session, the participant [CTA
group] was not provided with additional assistance in quitting.”

Low risk

Biochemically validated

Incomplete outcome data
(attrition bias) 
All outcomes

Low risk

"We found no significant differences in follow-up rates between groups at ei-
ther time point or for the cotinine sample."

Methods

Participants

Interventions

Country: UK
Setting: schools in West Midlands
Study design: cluster-RCT. Schools sampled with probability in proportion of size of year group. Com-
bined prevention/cessation trial

Participants: 1089 adolescent smokers (defined as ≥ 1 cpw) (I = 547; C = 542)
Age range: 13-14 years
Criteria for inclusion: inclusion was at level of school; 89 schools approached, 53 agreed to participate.
Data extracted for this cessation review based on all pupils in year 9 who smoked ≥ 1 cpw
Follow-up method: questionnaire to all students
Inducements to enter study: none
Pre-study smoking status assessment: self-reported
Post-study smoking status assessment: self-reported
Significant demographic differences between arms of trial: none apparent in published data

Intervention: computer 'expert system' designed to diagnose stage of change and deliver material
tailored to individual. 6 sessions, 2 per term, 1 class-based (tutor training mandatory) and 1 comput-
er-based delivered over period of school year (3 school terms per year in UK)
Theoretical basis of intervention: psycho-social intervention based on Transtheoretical Model of
Stages of Change
Control: control schools received health education as delivered locally at that time; in addition teach-
ers received 3 lesson plans plus handouts but no specialist training or record of what was delivered.
Theoretical basis of control: normal local practice

those who were successfully followed up and those who were not.

Baseline characteristics were not reported and so there may have been imbal-
ance of groups at baseline. Even though the study was cluster-randomized,
school-level information was not reported and school could not be allowed
for in the analysis. There is evidence for very inconsistent delivery of the inter-
vention between schools. The nature of loss of some data via recording errors
makes bias likely.

Intervention: 3 sequential interventions plus maximum of 2 boosters:
(1) clinical message encouraging quitting or not starting, (2) 10-12 min individual, multi-media interac-
tive computer-delivered expert system tailored to stage of change of individual (3) 3-5 min of motiva-
tional counselling by trained health counsellors. Boosters were delivered at clinic attendance (comput-
er programme and motivation counselling) or by telephone (motivational counselling only). Repeated
attempts were made to deliver boosters.
Theoretical basis of intervention: prompts to clinicians to give brief advice, TTM and MI
Control: dietary advice (5-a-day fruit and vegetables); theoretical basis of intervention: brief advice -
3-5 min motivational counselling

Measurement: 30-day PPA; follow-up periods: > 3 months, 1 year and 2 years
No verification
Losses to follow-up: 6% at 12 months and 12% at 24 months

This systematic review uses definition of smoking of 1 cpw for ≥ 6 months to define a regular smoker.
Hollis et al confirm that their definition of 'smokers' most closely fits this criterion.
We have only used the data for smokers, although the trial included separate smoking uptake preven-
tion results.

Methods

Country: USA

Setting: participants were recruited from the community (community adolescent substance abuse fa-
cility (66 %), public health clinics (21 %), university medical centre paediatric clinics (10 %), and dorms
and high schools (3 %). The intervention was mobile-phone based

Study design: RCT

Participants

Participants: 200 (I = 100, C = 100), 52.5% female, 90.5% black or African American, 6.5% white, 3% un-
known or other

Age range: 14-18 years, mean (SD) = 16.2 (1.39)

Criteria for inclusion: aged 14-18 years, scored > 1 in mFTQ assessment of dependence

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

Follow-up method: confidential, self-administered questionnaire and cotinine assessment

Inducements to enter study: none reported

Baseline characteristic equivalence: the 2 groups were similar in sociodemographic and smoking
characteristics. Approximately 66% of intervention group students planned to quit within the next 12
months compared with 57% of control students. The intervention group had slightly higher depression
and anxiety scores

Pre-test smoking status assessment: self-report. Mean cpd = 6.7

Post-test smoking status assessment: biochemically validated self-report

Interventions

Intervention: Calling It Quits counselling intervention. One 30-min session/week with the school nurse
for 2 weeks before quit date, one 15-min session/week for 2 weeks after quit date. Sessions based on 5
A's model, adapted for adolescents

Theoretical basis for intervention: SCT

Control: 4 weekly visits with the school nurse, where informational pamphlets were delivered

Outcomes

Measurement: 30-day PPA

Relevant follow-up periods: 12 months

Verification: validated with salivary cotinine < 11.4 ng/mL

“Thirty-five schools were recruited, pair-matched on demographics (percent-

are low-income, and were randomly assigned to either the counseling in-
tervention (16 schools, n _ 486 subjects) or attention control condition (19
schools, n _ 582 subjects). Randomization was conducted after completion of
baseline data collection in each school. A random number was generated us-

counted for, and how the resulting randomization had a difference of 3 schools
between groups, if it truly was pair matched

Country: USA
Setting: high schools in Washington State
Study Design: matched pair, cluster-RCT, randomized at school level
Recruitment: following smoking status baseline survey in all schools smokers were invited to partici-
pate in intervention. Non-smokers also invited to preserve confidentiality of students

Participants: 790 smokers: (I = 403; C = 387)
Age range: high school smokers, almost all aged 16-18 years
Criteria for inclusion: see Notes as restricted subset. Parental consent sought for those aged under 18
years.
Follow-up method: questionnaire at 12 months from intervention
Pre-study status assessment: baseline survey to identify monthly and "regular" smokers (defined as
those reporting smoking on ≥ 20 of the last 30 days)
Inducements to enter study: USD 10 per completed post-study questionnaire (USD 20 if survey re-
turned at second or third prompt).
Post-study smoking status assessment: self-report
Significant demographic differences between arms of the trial: random assignment but experimental
group contained higher proportion of daily smokers (statistically corrected in analysis)

Intervention: complex intervention including quit kit, tailored telephone counselling, supportive web-
site (TTM based) and school-wide cessation health promotion campaign. Specific attributes of teen
smoking addressed, e.g. need for privacy, confidentiality and sense of being in control, state of motiva-
tion, importance of peer support
Theoretical basis of intervention: TTM, MI, CBT and SCT-based counselling
Control: normal school-based activity

Measurement: self-reported, 6-month continuous abstinence, measured at 12 months
Verification: self-report. No biochemical validation but internal within-questionnaire validity checks on
reports of smoking status
Losses to follow-up: 11% at week 52 after intervention

The 2017 review update uses data reported by Heffner 2016, who report on the subgroup of "regular
smokers" (smoking on ≥ 20 of the last 30 days) at baseline. Although this is more restrictive than our
own criteria, it is this group that is recognized, in the literature, as the most likely to be addicted. Data
on the number of participants randomized were provided by the lead study author.

in range 0-6, 53% in range 7-13 and 17% in range 14-21
Post-study smoking status assessment: questionnaires
No significant demographic differences between arms of trial

Intervention: initially schools split into 3 arms: (1) Project EX sessions alone (clinic-only schools). (2)
Project EX plus school community development 'school-as-community' (SAC schools). (3) Control:
standard care
1. Project Ex was 8 sessions or 'clinics' over a 6-week period delivered to groups and developed in
trials. 4 sessions were preparation for quitting over 2 weeks, and next 4 were weekly during the first
month post-quit
Theoretical basis of intervention: complex theoretical constructs including MI etc, and including games
for groups, education and anger management, yoga, weight control, meditation, assertiveness train-
ing, role play and relapse prevention
2. SAC intervention: modelled on Toward No Drug Abuse programme. Student body organized service,
recreational and job training functions, and produced a Project newsletter, to enable expression of an-
ti-tobacco attitudes.

Measurement: 30-day PPA; Follow-up periods: > 3 months, 6 months from start of study
Verification: CO (for 62 students and results adjusted by false quit reporting factor of this group)
Losses to follow-up: 51% in intervention group - 40% of intervention group dropped out during clinics -
42% in control group lost to follow-up.

Results: no difference in outcomes between two intervention arms of trial so study authors pooled data
and compared, as a single arm with control arm
Calculated OR based on 17% in intervention = 44 people and 8% in control being 6 people
Calculated OR = 2.388 (0.976 to 5.841)

Recruitment in intervention arm was voluntary; 90% of participants said they had volunteered because

Baseline comparison by group: not reported for those who were smokers at baseline

Interventions

Based on the Project EX clinic program similar to the Project EX-1 2001 intervention. 8 sessions were
delivered over a 6-week period

Participants randomized to the comparison group received standard tobacco prevention and cessation
activities (if any) that were routinely provided by their school

Outcomes

Pre-test smoking status assessment: self-report, I = 84%, C = 81% were daily smokers, cpd 8.3 during
the week but 15.9 at weekends, FTND 3.1, 62% were low dependence (0-3)

Post-test smoking status assessment: biochemically validated self-report

Interventions

Intervention: 4 x 15-min weekly sessions with GPs, focus on initial reduction, signing a declaration to
quit at 3rd visit and 4th visit for reinforcement

Theoretical basis for intervention: MI

Control: a single 15-min session with brief advice and a leaflet. All participants sent a text message on
quit date, the day before and a week after, and monthly emails for a year

Outcomes

Measurement: 12-month continuous abstinence

Relevant follow-up periods: 12 months

Verification: expired CO ≤ 6 ppm (Smoke Check)

Methods

Low risk

3 losses, counted as smokers for meta-analysis

Country: USA
Setting: 4 family planning clinics (2 in teaching hospitals, 2 in community health centres) in metropoli-
tan areas, Philadelphia
Study design: RCT

Participants

Girls, aged 14-17 years, 84% African-American ethnicity, registering at family planning clinics

Exclusion criteria: pregnant at time of recruitment

828 participants randomized, including 166 "baseline smokers"

Baseline smoking status measured by self-report, with those classified as being in any of the first 3
stages of the Stage of Change model for smoking cessation classified as "baseline smokers"

No inducements to recruitment but could receive small non-monetary gift incentives (e.g. pencil case
and teddy bear) at clinic visits to minimize attrition and USD 10 gift vouchers at 12- and 18-month tele-
phone follow-up

Interventions

Intervention: computer-based information and feedback, plus counselling from BA-/MA-level counsel-
lors with family planning counselling experience and training on smoking

Participants could attend ≤ 4 sessions which included group-specific, computer-delivered feedback
and in-person counselling

Intervention period: 9 months

Theoretical basis: TTM

Usual care: generic, non-tailored computerized information and advice + standard “contraceptive edu-
cational counseling”

Outcomes

Self-reported: computer-assisted surveys at baseline, 3, 6, 9 months; telephone phone follow-up sur-
veys at 12, 18 months (phone survey staff were blind to group allocation)

Cessation measure assessed using stages of change – e.g. if reported moving to action or maintenance
phase of smoking cessation

No biochemical verification

Notes

New for 2017 update

Study was primarily aimed at increasing condom use but smoking cessation formed part of the inter-
vention and results were reported separately for those classified by the authors as “baseline smokers”

Age range: 13-19 year olds; 64% male
Follow-up method: telephone assessment, self-reporting
Inducements to enter study: fast food coupons, discounts at music stores and money on completion
Pre-study smoking status assessment: mFTQ
Significant demographic differences between arms of trial: more cases in intervention than control
arms because of school wish to have offenders treated

Intervention: 4 x 50-min sessions behavioural programme, based on STS (Start To Stop) model, deliv-
ered by trained health educators, MI at start of programme and monthly phone calls for 1 year to assess
smoking status and give brief support, based on stage of change.
Theoretical basis of intervention: aocial influence theory, motivational enhancement, CBT and TTM
Control: qritten material at start of study, and monthly phone calls to assess smoking status

Measurement: 7-day PPA; follow-up periods: > 3 months, 12 months
Verification: attempted for all quitters. Salivary cotinine samples obtained for 18/41 cases, CO initially
as a "bogus pipeline" for some students

Paper based on incomplete follow-up and denominators unclear so data not shown in comparisons.
No evidence of effect detected. We were unable to obtain clarification from study authors.
Stratified data available on baseline characteristics.
Referral to study for violation of school no-smoking policy raises issues of consent.

Follow-up method: contacted via email to complete internet-based questionnaire, email/text re-
minders sent after 4 days and after 11 days. If there was still no response after 18 days up to 4 attempts
were made to contact participants over telephone

Inducements to enter study: none

Baseline characteristic equivalence: “At baseline there were no statistically significant differences be-
tween groups”

Pre-test smoking status assessment: self-report, mean (SD) cpd: I = 15.4 (7.0), C = 15.6 (6.8)

Post-test smoking status assessment: self-report

Intervention: access to programme website, which included smoking facts, tests, exercises, videos and
a chat forum. In addition there was the option of receiving tailored text messages. This entailed a week-
ly message up to 4 weeks before their quit date, and a daily message 1–3 days before the quit date.
Then they received 2 tailored text messages/d during a period of 4 weeks. For the following 4 weeks,
the frequency of text messages declined to 4-5 text messages/week. The system generated 3 types of
tailored messages based on 3 different tailoring parameters: self-efficacy, beliefs about smoking and
themes chosen by the user.

Theoretical basis for intervention: Stage of Change theory and theory of planned behaviour

Control: also had access to website and the option to activate text messages. These messages were less
frequent and untailored. Messages were sent once daily for 5 weeks beginning 5 days before the chosen
quit date. Weekly messages were sent for the following 3 weeks.

Reason for exclusion

NRT double-blind randomized trial for 112 young people. Reported follow-up was for 3 months on-
ly.

RCT of a psycho-social intervention targeted at young people. Although measurements made at 6
months' follow-up, the control group were given the intervention 3 months after the intervention
group, therefore only 3 months' effectiveness data were available

NCT of nasal spray for 6 weeks plus counselling vs counselling alone. Unpleasant adverse effects,
poor adherence, and consequent lack of efficacy did support the use of nicotine nasal spray as an
adjunct to counselling. Outcome reported at 12 weeks therefore not added to review.

Median age of study subjects was 20 years with range 18-21 years. This age range is outside scope of
this review.

Evaluated recruitment strategies, not smoking cessation

Study reported prevalence-level information only so it was not possible to identify individual-level
smoking cessation. Majority of sample (around 95%) were non-smokers at baseline. Although inter-
vention contained a cessation component it was not possible to separate this from the effect of the
other components of the intervention. Study was previously listed as an ongoing study, excluded in
2017 update after publication of the results paper (Harrell 2016).

Although a cessation trial, the intervention group could choose reduction rather than cessation as

Review

This study, a "quasi-experiment" with pair matching for analysis, described 2 interventions (same
intervention but different time of delivery) and control. Control data on quitting collected at 6
months but data from 1 intervention arm collected at approximately 19 weeks after allocation.

West Virginia NoT with 3- and 4-month follow-up data from baseline

Community intervention, with cessation component and control population, aimed at adults in
community > 18 years. Although subset of population this study was not aimed primarily at young
people.

Average age of participants in intervention group 21.9 ± 6.8 years and control 24.1 ± 6.9 years.
Small size of overall study groups (56 cases in each arm) would mean it would be difficult to extract
meaningful outcomes from sub-group analysis for age range of this review.

This was a comparison trial between 2 interventions. There was no control group randomized to
'placebo'/no intervention. The study authors state "The inclusion of two different interventions (for
smokers) rather than a treatment/control comparison is for process analysis since the sample size
was inadequate for a clinical trial." The number of smokers in study was 135.

Majority of tobacco consumed by participants was smokeless, outcomes not divided by type of to-
bacco

Review

Perry 1980

This was primarily a prevention study as the stated aim was to influence the incidence of smoking.
The results were presented in such a form that overall prevalence was measured for a whole year
group and discrete smokers could not be identified.

Prokhorov 2010

Of 1574 participants, only 62 were smokers

Quinlan 2000

Rabius 2004

Clinical trial using intervention matched to stage of change (TTM). Age range 18-55 years. Mean age
by group of participants was 20.41 years, 21.71 and 23.3 years and therefore this study falls outside
the scope of this review.

The age range of this study included a cohort of 18-25 year olds. it is not possible to disaggregate 18
and 19 year olds from report of study but author contacted for primary data. If available these data
will be incorporated in future versions of review

Previous versions of this review were authored by Gill Grimshaw and Alan Stanton. Both authors conceived the review, and both selected
and extracted data for the previous versions. GG and AS wrote the previous versions of the review in collaboration.

The author team for this update changed. For this update, NL, WH, TF, and JLB conducted the majority of screening and data extraction,
with contributions from JHB. TF led analysis with contributions from WH, PA and JHB. TF, WH, PA and JHB updated the text. All authors
reviewed and approved the final version.

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews

NL is a co-applicant on a completed trial investigating nicotine patch preloading for smoking cessation (not a harm reduction approach).
The nicotine patches were provided free of charge by GlaxoSmithKline; however the trial was funded by the NIHR HTA (09/110/01), and the
running and the reporting of the trial were carried out independently to the funder and treatment provider.

PA declares: PA is an author of one of the included studies.

JLB declares no conflicts of interest.

JHB declares no conflicts of interest.

Upon re-evaluation for the update in 2017 we decided to modify the inclusion criteria such that non-randomized controlled trials are no
longer included in this review. This is because of the increased risk of bias they introduce, which can decrease the certainty of our findings.
We re-assessed previously included studies to ensure consistency, and excluded six studies because they were non-randomized (Chan
1988, Myers 2005, NoT AL 2008, NoT FL 2001, NoT NC 2005, NoT WV 2004). Another reassignment of studies occurred with our evaluation
of ages of participants. We decided to include studies in which more than 50% of the participants were under 20 years so long as there
was evidence that the intervention was tailored towards young people. In following this, three studies that had been excluded in previous
editions have been included in this edition (Abroms 2008; Harris 2010; O'Neill 2000), and a further study has been included because of the
publication of a corrigendum to the original trial paper (Project EX-4 2007). In addition, in the 2017 update we no longer list participation,
retention  or  enrolment  as  outcomes,  focusing  solely  on  smoking  cessation  and  adverse  events,  in  line  with  other  Cochrane  Tobacco
Addiction Group reviews. We have moved the outcome, Adverse events to be listed as a primary outcome. We have added 'Summary of
findings' tables in line with Cochrane guidance.
