extrapyramidal syndromes than those treated with low-
potency agents such as thioridazine. Low doses of neurolep-
tic agents generally lower the incidence and severity of the
disorders. Dystonia, unfortunately, can appear at low anti-
psychotic doses and may be recurrent so that, even at low
antipsychotic doses, prophylaxis may be needed.

Several circumstances may make the development of ex-
trapyramidal syndromes especially undesirable. Paranoid
patients for whom the therapeutic relationship is tenuous are
one example. The development of these syndromes would be
particularly harmful in patients requiring orthopedic devices
such as neck braces or casts. These considerations should
enhance the prescribing of prophylaxis. On the other hand,
this prophylaxis is relatively contraindicated in patients who
may be harmed by anticholinergic side effects such as im-
paired recent memory. Older patients receiving low-potency
antipsychotic agents are unlikely to benefit from prophylaxis.
Patients with deficits in short-term memory from head
trauma, dementias, and other causes are not good candidates
for prophylaxis as they are more likely to suffer further mem-
ory impairment and may become delirious.

The withdrawal of prophylactic medication should be at-
tempted after the initial treatment has been completed if the
patient is free of symptoms and the antipsychotic regimen has
been stabilized. Studies have shown that some patients will
have recurrent episodes and deterioration of mental status
when anticholinergic therapy is withdrawn. For this reason,
the withdrawal of prophylactic agents should be gradual and
carefully monitored.

Panic Disorder
THOUGH PANIC DISORDER and panic disorder with agorapho-
bia or phobic avoidance (PDA) are common (the mean life-
time prevalence of panic disorder is 1.5%), the diagnosis is
frequently missed: 70% of patients with PDA in one large
study had more than ten medical consultations before receiv-
ing the correct diagnosis and treatment.

The "classic" presentation of panic disorder consists of
sudden, unexpected, discrete attacks of intense fear or dis-
comfort without a recognizable precipitant, accompanied by
at least four of the following symptoms during at least one of
the attacks: dyspnea or smothering sensations; dizziness,
unsteadiness, or faintness; palpitations or tachycardia; trem-
bling or shaking; sweating; choking; nausea or abdominal
distress; depersonalization or derealization; numbness or
paresthesias; flushes or chills; chest pain or discomfort; fear
of dying; and fear of going crazy or doing something uncon-
trolled. Panic disorder, however, frequently occurs with
symptoms referable to only a single organ system. Such sin-
gle system presentations include chest pain and dyspnea
(33% to 59% of patients seen because of chest pain but with
no abnormalities found on coronary angiography were found

in three different studies to have PDA); balance disorder
("dizziness") without true vertigo (25% to 50% of patients
seen because of vestibular disorder symptoms have a subtype
of panic disorder); abdominal discomfort, pain, and diarrhea
(about 33% of patients seen by gastroenterologists were
found to have PDA).

Large-scale clinical studies have shown that for most pa-
tients, PDA is a chronic relapsing disorder. Multiple family
and twin studies show that panic disorder has a highly famil-
ial transmission with a strong genetic component (31%
monozygotic concordance, 0% dizygotic concordance).

Panic disorder with agoraphobia has a startlingly high
comorbidity and mortality. Patients with untreated PDA at-
tempt suicide at a rate equivalent to that of patients with
major depression (15% to 20% of patients). This disorder has
a dramatically high incidence of comorbid major depression,
alcohol abuse, substance abuse, other anxiety disorders,
multiple phobias or agoraphobia, cardiovascular disease,
and personality disorders. Patients with PDA experience
substantially more impairment in social, family, and occupa-
tional functioning than the general population.

The proven standard of effective treatment for PDA con-
tinues to be pharmacotherapy to stop and prevent recurrent
panic attacks, plus behavior therapy (exposure in vivo) for
any phobic avoidance that may remain once the panic attacks
have been stopped. Most clinical studies have found the first-
generation tricyclic antidepressants, the monoamine oxidase
inhibitors, and two of the benzodiazepines (alprazolam
[Xanax] and clonazepam [Klonopin]) highly effective in
stopping and preventing recurrent panic attacks when main-
tained at therapeutic blood concentrations. Of the newer
antidepressant medications, fluoxetine (Prozac) and clo-
mipramine hydrochloride (Anafranil) have demonstrated
efficacy in PDA, whereas buproprion hydrochloride (Well-
butrin) and the nonbenzodiazepine anxiolytic buspirone
hydrochloride (BuSpar) have not.

The goal of appropriate pharmacologic management is
the complete absence of all panic and subpanic attacks. This
can be achieved with a single medication in more than 85% of
patients, though it may take several treatment trials to find the
best medication. Refractory cases may require more compli-
cated protocols.

Recent reports of two nonpharmacologic treatments,
cognitive therapy and cognitive-behavioral therapy, show
promise for some patients with PDA.

The core of cognitive-behavioral treatment is systematic
structured exposure to the feared internal sensations, coupled
with cognitive procedures to restructure anxiety-provoking
thoughts, catastrophic misinterpretations, and faulty core be-
liefs. The therapist directs the patient to induce the somatic
sensations typical of a panic attack (dizziness, tachycardia,
dyspnea, chest tension) in the office (by having the patient
spin around, run in place, hyperventilate, or contract chest
muscles tightly), while together therapist and patient criti-
cally examine the symptom experience, correct the patient's
frightening and catastrophic cognitive misinterpretations of
the sensations, and control the symptoms with a variety of
relaxation techniques. The patient practices at home what is
learned in the office and keeps a daily diary of symptoms,
reflex cognitive distortions, and corrective thinking and
behavior.

periods. The few studies comparing the efficacy (short- and
long-term) of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treat-
ments suffer from a variety of conceptual and methodologic
difficulties. These include a failure to differentiate patients
with panic disorder from those with panic disorder and ago-
raphobia or those with subtypes of panic disorder, and the
heterogeneity of diagnostic criteria, treatment procedures,
and measures of clinical success. Thus, our present state of
knowledge does not enable us to predict accurately which
patients will do best with which treatment(s) or how different
treatments might best be integrated.

Patients with PDA should be educated regarding the vari-
ous treatment options available. The choice of treatment will
depend on the training and expertise of the clinician, the
availability of specialists, a patient's sense of urgency, availa-
ble resources, and the preferred type of treatment. If non-
pharmacologic treatment is elected, those patients who are
not completely relieved of panic attacks after an adequate
treatment trial (three months), or who relapse after treat-
ment, should receive appropriate pharmacologic therapy
for panic, combined with exposure treatment of phobic
avoidance.

Rational Polydrug Use in Psychiatry
SINGLE-DRUG THERAPY has been the standard for psy-
chopharmacology for the past two decades. This approach is
based on clinical studies that excluded multiple drug thera-
pies to decrease variance in the results. There is consensus,
however, that 20% to 40% of patients with depression,
manic-depressive illness, anxiety disorders (panic disorder
and obsessive-compulsive disorder), and schizophrenia ei-
ther do not respond initially or do not maintain a response to
standard single-drug regimens.

Few double-blind placebo-controlled studies have tested
polydrug regimens because a large number of patients would
be required to achieve statistical significance. We have to rely
mainly on case series and reports based on pharmacologic
theory or empiric findings. The reasons to use several drugs
include a nonresponse to monodrug therapy; the need for
imminent clinical remission (from either patient suffering or
the financial limitations of waiting for serial therapies to
work); the different therapeutic sites of action of multiple
agents; additive or multiplicative effects; and the avoidance
of side effects. For example, acute mania appears to respond
faster, with better patient compliance, and with fewer side
effects when a potent benzodiazepine (usually lorazepam or
clonazepam) is temporarily added to a regimen of neurolep-
tic and antimanic agents. In labile manic-depressive illness,
prophylaxis with an anticonvulsant (valproate or carbamaze-
pine) or verapamil enhances stability.

Patients with depression that does not abate in three to
four weeks with standard antidepressant therapy commonly
will have lithium, thyroid, or stimulants added to the regi-
men. These agents work independently, and several may be
used for refractory cases. Some antidepressants produce side
effects that can be countered by others. Because the thera-
peutic effect is additive, two antidepressant heterocyclic
reuptake inhibitors can be administered concurrently. This is
commonly done when agitation or insomnia occurs with the
use of fluoxetine or desipramine by adding trazodone or an-
other sedating agent, such as doxepin or amitriptyline, at
night. Although panic disorder often responds to the use of a
single agent (such as alprazolam, phenelzine sulfate, or imip-
ramine hydrochloride), subtle fluctuations in anxiety may
continue and increase anticipatory anxiety to a disabling de-
gree. Hence, adding the other agent(s), which act through
separate mechanisms, is frequently required. A pharmaco-
logic plateau of obsessive-compulsive disorder to the use of
clomipramine or fluoxetine may take 12 weeks to occur, with
a third of patients not responding. Serotoninergic activity is
augmented by adding the other primary drug or buspirone
hydrochloride (as much as 100 mg per day), lithium, or
fenfluramine hydrochloride.

Schizophrenia is not a unitary disease, but neuroleptics
all appear to have equivalent efficacy. Polydrug therapy with
older neuroleptics plus clozapine has increasing appeal but
few data to support its use. Neuroleptic side effects contrib-
ute importantly to noncompliance and morbidity, however.
In addition to the well-appreciated use of anticholinergics,
the recent understanding of akathisia has led to a low thresh-
old for the use of propranolol hydrochloride (20 to 80 mg per
day in divided doses) for this extrapyramidal syndrome of
anxiety and motor restlessness. The augmentation of neuro-
leptic therapy has proved beneficial with the use of carbama-
zepine, lithium, or benzodiazepines in some schizophrenic
patients. Although no specific subgroup is predictably re-
sponsive, it is commonly thought that these drugs are rela-
tively more effective in patients with active psychotic
symptoms, aggression, or schizoaffective schizophrenia.

The use of several hypnotic agents in a single patient is
usually based on their half-life. In selected patients with
pronounced difficulty falling and staying asleep, an ultra-
short-acting hypnotic (triazolam, for instance) may be bene-
ficial when combined with a longer-acting agent, and the
combination has reduced morning sedative side effects.

In these uses of polydrug therapy, each agent is prescribed
systematically and for a specific target behavior that can be
evaluated for response. This rational use of multiple drugs is
therefore valid. It is distinct from older, fixed-dose combina-
tion drugs or simplistically adding virtually identical agents
without careful reasoning. The search for therapeutic benefit
must be tempered by caution about additive side effects such
as anticholinergic or hypotensive effects.
