The present study aimed at investigating the influence of personality on both anticipatory stress 
vulnerability and the effectiveness of coping strategies in an occupational stressful context. Following 
assessment of individual personality traits (Big Five Inventory), 147 volunteers were exposed to 
the anticipation of a stressful event. Anxiety and cardiac reactivity were assessed as markers of 
vulnerability to anticipatory stress. Participants were then randomly assigned to three groups 
and subjected to a 5‑min intervention: relaxation breathing, relaxation breathing combined with 
cardiac biofeedback, and control. The effectiveness of coping interventions was determined through 
the cardiac coherence score achieved during the intervention. Higher neuroticism was associated 
with higher anticipatory stress vulnerability, whereas higher conscientiousness and extraversion 
were related to lower anticipatory stress vulnerability. Relaxation breathing and biofeedback 
coping interventions contributed to improve the cardiac coherence in all participants, albeit with 
greater effectiveness in individuals presenting higher score of openness to experience. The present 
findings demonstrated that personality traits are related to both anticipatory stress vulnerability 
and effectiveness of coping interventions. These results bring new insights into practical guidelines 
for stress prevention by considering personality traits. Specific practical applications for health 
professionals, who are likely to manage stressful situations daily, are discussed.

Vol.:(0123456789)www.nature.com/scientificreportsStress vulnerability refers to the established predisposition of some individuals to have an elevated psychophysi-
ological response to stressful stimuli. Stress vulnerability has many immediate effects, such as decreased wellbeing 
and increased risks of incidents, as well as long-term deleterious consequences (e.g., development of mental and 
cardiovascular disorders)1–4. Determining factors, such as personality traits, that may affect stress vulnerability is 
necessary to reduce these risks and promote individualized stress management training. Personality is reflected 
in a set of patterns of thoughts, feelings and  actions5. The widely used Five Factor Model allows characteriza-
tion of personality into five traits: neuroticism, extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness and openness to 
 experiences6. Personality traits have been repeatedly associated with many psychophysiological markers of stress 
(e.g., cardiac reactivity, cortisol secretion, psychological stress)7–15. Neuroticism has been repeatedly linked to an 
increase in negative emotions and related physiological responses such as increased heart rate, cortisol reactivity 
and amygdala activity during a stressful  event13,15,16. By contrast, extraversion and openness have both been asso-
ciated with lower levels of subjective stress, lower cardiovascular reactivities and reduced cortisol  secretions7,9,15. 
Findings for the conscientiousness trait remain inconclusive, being neither advantageous or disadvantageous in a 
stressful situation, while agreeableness remains, so far, less  explored7,13. Based on these results, neuroticism may 
be associated with higher stress vulnerability, while openness and extraversion seem associated with reduced 
vulnerability (i.e. higher resilience).

Most of the investigations in the domain of stress evaluated the influence of personality during confrontation 
with a standardized laboratory stressor, limiting the generalisation of results to real-life stressors. Indeed, most 
paradigms used stereotypical stressors such as a mental arithmetic task, the Stroop task, an anger recall, or the 
Trier Social Stress Test, which do not optimally represent stressors typically encountered in everyday  life7,9,15. 
Nowadays, ecological studies are crucial to understand in greater detail the relationship between individual 
characteristics and vulnerability to real stressors. Recent advances made it possible to overcome the limita-
tions of standard laboratory tasks by implementing virtual reality or high-fidelity simulations (also called full 
scale simulations). Simulation environments enable situations still closer to real-life along with experimental 
control, hence allowing investigation of the direct effects of stress on professional  performance17–22. Simulation 
studies usually focus on urgent and crucial professional situations, such as the management of critical care for 
 anaesthetists20–22. These simulations remain indispensable for training anesthesiology residents to practice in 
one of the most stressful medical  professions23.

In many daily-life contexts, stressful situations can be detected before the occurrence of the actual stressor. 
The stress anticipation induces immediate psychophysiological responses and influences the subsequent acute 
stress  response24–28. Interestingly, the period of stress anticipation offers a window of opportunity to benefit from 
a preventive coping  intervention20,24,25. Several and various coping techniques including relaxation breathing, 
cerebral stimulation, or biofeedback have been explored to manage threat, harm, or  stress20,24,25,29,30. Among 
these interventions, relaxation breathing appeared the most robust option for managing stress reactivity, due 
to its cost-effective nature and its ease of implementation in almost all stressful  situations20. When paired with 
cardiac biofeedback, relaxation breathing resulted in a significant reduction of psychophysiological stress markers 
notably during anticipatory  stress20,24,25,31–34.

Successful management of anticipatory stress may depend on the interaction between individuals’ charac-
teristics and the implemented coping intervention. Previous studies revealed that personality traits are likely 
to modulate the effectiveness of coping methods such as biofeedback, brain stimulation, muscle relaxation, or 
 meditation30,35–37. To date however, no study has investigated the moderating role of personality traits in the effec-
tiveness of relaxation breathing and cardiac biofeedback. Determining in greater detail the relationship between 
personality and coping intervention effectiveness may allow design of relevant and individualized programs for 
the prevention of stress related disorders.

The present study therefore aimed to explore the association between personality traits and both anticipa-
tory stress vulnerability and coping intervention effectiveness. This study characterises the influences during the 
anticipation of real-life stressful situations, such as medical critical care situations, by using high fidelity simula-
tion. We hypothesized that higher neuroticism and lower extraversion traits may be related to anticipatory stress 
vulnerability. We further expected that personality would influence the effectiveness of relaxation breathing with 
or without a cardiac biofeedback intervention.

Materials and methods
Participants.  A total of 147 participants voluntarily took part in this experiment (42 women, 26.8 ± 2.3 years 
old). Volunteers were recruited during their training in critical care scenarios at the medical simulation centre 
of Lyon University during the academic year 2019–2020. Participants were all anesthesiology and critical care 
residents (from the first to the fifth year). Four investigators provided information about the study, collected 
written  individual  informed  consent,  and  enrolled  participants.  The  study  was  approved  by  the  Institutional 
Review Board of Claude Bernard University Lyon 1 (Lyon, France, IRB 2019070903) and informed written con-
sent was obtained from each participant prior to inclusion. All experiments were performed in accordance with 
the Declaration of Helsinki.

Personality.  At the beginning of the experiment, all participants filled-out a demographic questionnaire and 
the French validated version of the Big Five Inventory (BFI-fr)38. The BFI contains 45 items assessing openness to 
experience, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness and neuroticism (Table 1). Each item assesses agree-
ment or disagreement with descriptive statements on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) 
to 5 (strongly agree). For each of the five personality traits, a mean was determined. In this study, the internal 
consistencies for each personality traits ranged from acceptable to good (openness to experience α = 0.66, con-
scientiousness α = 0.77, extraversion α = 0.88, agreeableness α = 0.78, neuroticism α = 0.84).

Paradigm.  All participants performed a high-fidelity (full-scale) simulation that was divided into five peri-
ods: scenario briefing (2 min, anticipation), coping intervention (5 min, coping), the stressful critical care 
scenario (15 min), personalized debriefing (15 min), and a final resting state period during which a collective 
debriefing occurred (15 min, basal). The present study focused on the anticipation and coping periods (Fig. 1).

Anticipation period.  To assess psychological anticipatory stress, all participants filled out the State Anxi-
ety Inventory Form A (STAI-Y)39,40. In this study, the STAI-Y had an excellent internal consistency (Cronbach 
α = 0.94). Then, during the two minutes of the briefing, each participant received information on the scenario in 
which he/she would be involved (for more detailed information please refer to the Annexe 1). The high-fidelity 
simulation  reproduces  professional  critical  clinical  situations  through  realistic  scenarios  chosen  to  fit  to  the 
expected competency level of residents.

To determine physiological anticipatory stress, a score of cardiac reactivity was computed (mean heart rate 
during anticipation minus mean heart rate basal) for each resident; a high score reflected high physiological 
 stress11. Means were extracted from the continuous monitoring of cardiac activity (HexoskinTM, Carre Tech-
nologies Inc, Montreal, Quebec, Canada).

Coping  period.  Following  the  briefing,  participants  were  randomly  assigned  to  one  of  the  three  5-min 
interventions. All the interventions were conducted in an isolated and silent room, and were all guided by the 
same experimenter (S.S). Participants in the relaxation breathing group (relaxation breathing) performed 
standardized relaxing breathing at 6 breaths/min with the help of a visual breathing cursor (Fig. 2, left part). 
Participants  in  the  cardiac  biofeedback  group  (biofeedback)  performed  the  same  breathing  exercise,  while 
visualizing information on their instantaneous heart rate (beats/min) and scores of cardiac coherence (Fig. 2, 
left  and  right)  (emWavePRO®  interface,  HeartMath  technologies,  Add  Heart®).  The  relaxation  breathing 
and biofeedback interventions were displayed via a computer interface window of 5 × 2.8 inches. Participants 
in the control group (control) performed a common  professional  activity (i.e. reviewed printed laboratory 
test results). The duration of the intervention (5 min) was chosen to fit the numerous occupational-life contexts 
where time-constraints are important. A previous study showed that 5 min of relaxation breathing or biofeed-
back intervention appears sufficient to reduce psychological  stress20.

An ear pulse sensor was attached to all participants to record the cardiac activity at 370 Hz (HeartMath 
technologies, Add Heart®). The cardiac coherence score was computed as (Peak Power / [Total Power − Peak 
Power]) on a min-by-min basis, this score is assessed and displayed by the EmWave  software41,42. As a high car-
diac coherence score has been associated with increased positive emotional  regulation25,43,44, the score achieved

during the intervention was used to determine individual coping ability, with high scores corresponding to 
efficient physiological stress coping.

Statistical analysis.  Linear regression analysis was used to predict psychological anticipatory stress (STAI-
Y), cardiac reactivity, and cardiac coherence by personality trait. Each personality trait was analysed separately. 
The analysis was controlled for age, gender, weight, height and amount of sport practiced per week because these 
factors are likely to influence cardiac parameters and/or psychological stress  responses9,11,15. The level of educa-
tion was included in order to adjust for the probable influence of experience in stress management due to train-
ing in the medical curriculum. All quantitative variables of adjustment have been standardized. In the case of 
cardiac coherence, the interaction term (trait X group) was considered. Statistical analyses were performed with 
R studio version 1.2.1335 (R Foundation, Vienna, Austria). For all regression models, the β (i.e., estimate the 
effect on the outcome of each 1-unit increase in the independent variable) and the adjusted coefficients  R2 (i.e., 
percentage of variance explained) were provided. Normality of residuals of the models were checked. Inclusions 
for analyses are shown in the study flowchart (Fig. 3).

Results
Cohort characteristics.  Participants’ demographic and psychometric parameters are presented in Table 2.

Personality and anticipatory stress vulnerability.  A higher score of conscientiousness was associated 
with  a  lower  level  of  psychological  anticipatory  stress  (β = −  0.193,  P = 0.036).  A  higher  score  of  extraversion 
was associated with a lower level of psychophysiological anticipatory stress (β = − 0.300, P = 0.002; β = − 0.210, 
P = 0.029).  However,  a  higher  score  of  neuroticism  was  associated  with  a  higher  level  of  psychophysiological 
anticipatory stress (β = 0.631, P < 0.001, β = 0.229, P = 0.036) (Table 3, Fig. 4).

Personality and coping intervention effectiveness.  Compared to the control, both the relaxation 
breathing and  biofeedback induced an increase in cardiac coherence during the coping period (Fig. 5A). 
Higher score of openness was associated with a greater score of cardiac coherence in both relaxation breath-
ing (β = 0.413, P = 0.010) and biofeedback (β = 0.284, P = 0.038) groups. No other personality traits were associ-
ated with the score for cardiac coherence (Table 4, Fig. 5B).

Discussion
The aim of this research was to determine the influence of personality traits on the anticipatory stress vulner-
ability and effectiveness of preventive coping intervention. This study characterised the influences of personality 
traits during the anticipation of a simulated professional critical care situation. Results showed that individuals 
with high scores of neuroticism  (N+), low scores of conscientiousness  (C−), or low scores of extraversions  (E−) 
exhibited elevated anticipatory stress markers. Interestingly, openness was found to positively predict the effec-
tiveness of relaxation breathing and biofeedback coping interventions.

As expected, results revealed that neuroticism was associated with worsened anticipatory stress vulnerability 
(i.e.,  N− resilience,  N+ vulnerability). Accordingly, a higher neuroticism score predicted elevated psychological 
and physiological anticipatory stress responses. Neuroticism is a higher-order personality trait that accounts for 
a tendency to experience emotional instability, distress and negative  emotions45,46. We postulated that these ten-
dencies led to a greater level of subjective stress, which in turn is manifested by elevated cardiac reactivity. Others

studies found that  N+ is linked to an increase of vulnerability during the confrontation with the  stressor13,15,16 
and with the long-term development of stress related-pathologies (e.g., burnout, depression)47. Present results 
therefore represent a new step in the overall understanding of the relationships between neuroticism and vulner-
ability with early stress anticipation, acute stress and mental disorders.

Our findings also revealed that extraversion was inversely associated with anticipatory stress vulnerability (i.e., 
 E− vulnerability,  E+ resilience). Lower scores for extraversion predicted elevated psychological and physiological 
anticipatory stress responses. This result is consistent with previous findings reporting higher subjective stress 
and cortisol level in  E− individuals during the confrontation with a standardized stressor (mental arithmetic, 
anger recall, Trier Social Stress Test)9,10,15. Extraversion is a higher-order personality trait that accounts for an 
individual’s tendency to experience positive emotions and to be  sociable45,46. In our experiment, we hypothesized 
that the tendency to experience positive emotions induced a more positive mindset for dealing with the situation, 
which turns into a lower level of psychophysiological stress. It is also possible that the tendency to be sociable 
resulted in a lowering of general anxiety and specific anticipatory stress. Indeed, social support is one of the main 
strategies used for coping or regulating cognition in response to stressors, as assessed by the Brief Cope Scale 
Inventory (social support, avoidance, positive thinking, problem solving)48.

While not predicted, our results also showed that conscientiousness was negatively associated with psycho-
logical anticipatory stress vulnerability (i.e.,  C− vulnerability,  C+ resilience). Literature reveals that individuals 
with a higher conscientiousness trait use problem-focused coping  methods49–51. In the present work, the stressful 
situation was a multimodal complex task, where a high level of competence was required to succeed. It seems 
likely that  C+ individuals focusing on problem-solving may have the higher level of theorical resources neces-
sary to deal with certain aspects of the critical situation. Similarly,  C+ individuals have an increased tendency to 
self-discipline and  responsibility45,46. As an explanatory track, we hypothesized that a high-level of self-discipline 
might contribute to lowered levels of anticipatory stress notably by allowing individuals to have control over the 
situation. Taken together, our results revealed that individuals with a high neuroticism trait, and/or a low extra-
version or conscientiousness trait, are the most vulnerable to an anticipatory stress, and confirm the importance 
of evaluating these traits for understanding stress responses.

For the first time, this study evaluated the influence of personality traits on the effectiveness of relaxation 
breathing and cardiac biofeedback interventions. Our data revealed that individuals with high scores of open-
ness  (O+) achieved better cardiac coherence scores. This is in agreement with Peciuliene et al. (2015) who found 
that individuals with high openness scores presented more physiological benefits (i.e., lowering physiologi-
cal arousal) following biofeedback training based on skin  conductance30. Others studies further revealed that 
openness was positively associated with perceived coping ability, notably during a stressful event, and a greater 
level of control over the  task7,52. As both coping interventions tested here relied on breathing-control, it seems 
possible that the openness trait led to more effective practice of these new exercises, which in turn resulted in 
efficient stress  reduction53. Furthermore, individuals with high openness trait are curious by  nature45,46, which 
might make them spontaneously more interested in trying a new exercise. Future studies exploring various 
interventions are necessary to determine which technique is the most efficient coping method for  N+,  E− and 
 C− individuals. Previous findings suggested that stress reduction through meditation is a promising alternative 
for  N+  individuals36, while cerebral stimulation might be more effective for  E−  individuals54. Comparing these 
alternative coping strategies using the same stressful paradigm will be necessary to confirm the specificity of the 
intervention-trait relationships. These studies are needed before offering preventive personalized treatment and 
to prevent the development of stress related disorders.

As a final practical observation, this study explored ecological stress within a medical professional context. 
In addition to the usual decrease of well-being and health, high levels of stress in physicians are associated 
with poor quality of care and increased risks of  incidents3,4. Identifying a physician’s personality traits associ-
ated with anticipatory stress is relevant to estimate these professional risks. Our results showed that  N+,  E− and

 C− anaesthesiologists and critical residents are vulnerable to anticipatory stress. Previous studies repeatedly 
reported that  N+ and  E− influenced level of school and job stress, and are associated with the risk of  burnout47,55,56. 
Together, these results support that  N+ and  E− anaesthetists are at great risk of both immediate and long-term 
specific professional stress, and should be prioritized to early stress coping training. Our findings suggest that 
relaxation breathing and cardiac biofeedback might contribute to increase scores of cardiac coherence in all 
profiles (even in  N+ and  E+ individuals), thus these interventions might be efficient to reduce physiological stress 
during the anticipation of a stressful critical care event. One should note that our study explored the influences of 
personality traits using high fidelity simulations, thus it remains necessary to duplicate our findings in a real-life 
hospital context. Replication of the present findings in other daily real-life settings (e.g. job interview, competitive 
sport) will also help to generalize our conclusions to other contexts. As a final remark, it would be interesting 
to perform similar studies comparing younger students and older professionals to examine if our findings are 
moderated by the individual’s coping experience, generated by repeated confrontation with stressful situations.

This study has some limits that should be emphasized in order to prevent over interpretation of the results. 
Firstly, while our finding paves the way for understanding the influence of personality on stress coping in an 
ecological context, it should be noted that both the stressor (i.e., anticipation of a critical care) and the popula-
tion (i.e., anaesthesiology and critical care residents) remain specific. Therefore, results may not generalize to 
other occupational stress contexts, while generalization to other population remains speculative, the personality 
of our medical students appeared similar to the one of others students in other domains/speciality (see Annexe 
2). Secondly, while conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism present all Cronbach alpha 
scores superior to 0.70 and could be considered as  satisfactory38, one should note that the consistency of the 
openness trait was a little lower (0.66). Thirdly, the percentage of variance explained by our models ranges from 
3 to 60. While the coping effectiveness models explained more than 50% of the variation of cardiac coherence 
scores, the anticipatory stress models showed a low adjusted  R2. Thus, the relationship between personality traits 
and anticipatory stress was relatively small. As anticipatory stress appears to be determined by multiple factors 
(e.g., influence of gender, experience, age, inner resources), each factor, including personality traits, is unlikely 
to have a large effect. Fourthly, due to the innovative and exploratory aspect of our study no correction for multi 
tests were applied, thus the error risk might be inflated.

To conclude, our results showed that individuals with a high neuroticism trait and a low extraversion trait 
are the most sensitive to anticipatory psychophysiological stress. Moreover, those with high openness to experi-
ence trait benefited more extensively from brief coping interventions. These data encourage the assessment of 
personality in identifying ecological stress vulnerability and offering individualized stress management training 
including relaxation breathing and cardiac biofeedback. Practically, these data offer a promising direction to 
pursue in investigating how to protect vulnerable health professionals from chronic stress.
