Abstract: Background: Stress is a natural response of the body, induced by factors of a physical
(hunger, thirst, and infection) and/or psychological (perceived threat, anxiety, or concern) nature.
Chronic, long-term stress may cause problems with sleep, concentration, and memory, as well as
aﬀective disorders. The passionﬂower (Passiﬂora incarnata) is a perennial plant with documented
therapeutic properties. The literature data suggest that the passionﬂower itself, as well as its
preparations, helps reduce stress and can therefore be helpful in the treatment of insomnia, anxiety,
and depression. The objective of this systematic review was to evaluate Passiﬂora incarnata in
terms of its neuropsychiatric eﬀects. Methods: The scientiﬁc databases PubMed, ClinTrials.gov,
and Embase were searched up to 22 October 2019. The search identiﬁed randomized clinical trials
describing the eﬀects of Passiﬂora incarnata in neuropsychiatric disorders. Results: The systematic
review included nine clinical trials. The duration of the studies included in the analysis varied
widely, from one day up to 30 days. Study participants were no less than 18 years old. In each of
the papers, the eﬀects of passionﬂower were measured by using a number of diﬀerent tests and
scales. The majority of studies reported reduced anxiety levels following the administration of
Passiﬂora incarnata preparations, with the eﬀect less evident in people with mild anxiety symptoms.
No adverse eﬀects, including memory loss or collapse of psychometric functions, were observed.
Conclusion: Passiﬂora incarnata may be helpful in treating some symptoms in neuropsychiatric patients.

Keywords: Passiﬂora incarnata; neuropsychiatric disorders; stress; anxiety; depression

1. Introduction

The passionﬂower (Passiﬂora incarnata L.) is a perennial plant which that can grow up to 10 m,
with egg-shaped edible fruit. The low-calorie fruit (41–53 kcal/100 g) is a rich source of vitamins A,
C, B1, and B2, as well as calcium, phosphorus, and iron. The species is native to South America,
Australia, and South East Asia, and today is cultivated to source raw material for pharmaceutical
use [1]. Passiﬂora incarnata is one of the best-documented species of the Passiﬂora genus with therapeutic
properties. The aerial parts of the plant, ﬂowers, and fruits are used for medicinal purposes. They are
credited with anthelmintic, antispasmodic, and anxiolytic eﬀects. The passionﬂower is also used as a
remedy for burns, diarrhea, painful menstruation, hemorrhoids, in neurotic disorders, insomnia, to treat
morphine dependence, and can be helpful in convulsions or neuralgia, too. Passiﬂora incarnata is a source
of alkaloids, phenolic compounds, ﬂavonoid, and cyanogenic glycosides. The primary phytochemicals
found in the passionﬂower are ﬂavonoids (apigenin, luteolin, quercetin, and kaempferol) and ﬂavonoid
glycosides (vitexin, isovitexin, orientin, and isoorientin) [1,2]. The species has the highest overall
isovitexin content [3]. On 25 March 2014, the European Medicines Agency published a herbal

monograph on Passiﬂora incarnata, thus recognizing its status as a medicinal product [4]. Clinical trials
found no threats to human health in relation to the use of Passiﬂora incarnata [5,6].

Stress is a natural response of the body. It can be induced by factors of a physical (hunger,
thirst, infection) and/or psychological (perceived threat, anxiety or concern) nature—namely stressors.
Stress has been linked to cellular inﬂammation. Physiologically, the body’s response to stress
causes an immediate activation of the adrenergic system and the sympathetic–adrenomedullary axis
(SAM axis), followed by the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis (HPA axis). Chronic, long-term
stress is a pathological condition, which may impair concentration and memory, as well as lead to
aﬀective disorders, such as depression, schizophrenia, and the post-traumatic stress disorder [7].
Passiﬂora incarnata is one of the herbal remedies used to alleviate the eﬀects of stress [2]. A rat study
demonstrated that long-term use of passionﬂower was correlated with reduced stress levels and,
consequently, increased motivation to act and improved motor activity [8]. The beneﬁcial eﬀects of
passionﬂower on memory function have also been conﬁrmed [9]. The use of P. incarnata in people with
chronic insomnia may produce a therapeutic eﬀect in the management of sleep disorders, memory loss,
and degenerative brain diseases. Passiﬂora may be helpful in the treatment of insomnia, through its
sedative action, as a result of which the person experiencing diﬃculty sleeping will be more likely to get
to sleep [10]. Passiﬂora demonstrates positive eﬀects in episodes of anxiety, restlessness, sleeplessness,
and in depressive states [11].

The objective of this systematic review was to evaluate the efficacy of Passiflora incarnata preparations
in the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders. The systematic review included randomized controlled
trials (RCT) which investigated the relationship between the use of Passiflora incarnata and a range of
disorders of the nervous system.

2. Materials and Methods

2.1. Search Strategy, Inclusion Criteria

At least two independent authors (K.W., J.A. and K.S.Z.) searched PubMed/MEDLINE/Embase,
from database inception until 22 October 2019, without language restrictions. Randomized clinical
trials have been found to describe the eﬀect of the use of passion ﬂower in neuropsychiatric disorders.
The following search string in Pub Med was used: (“passiﬂora” OR “passion fruit” OR “passion” OR
“passion ﬂower”) AND (anxiety OR depression OR insomnia OR somatoform); Embase (“passiﬂora”/exp
OR “passiﬂora”) AND (“depression”/exp OR “central depression” OR “clinical depression” OR
“depression” OR “depressive disease” OR “depressive disorder” OR “depressive episode” OR
“depressive illness” OR “depressive personality disorder” OR “depressive state” OR “depressive
symptom” OR “depressive syndrome” OR “mental depression” OR “parental depression” OR
“anxiety disorder”/exp OR “anxiety disorder” OR “anxiety disorders” OR “insomnia”/exp OR
“agrypnia” OR “hyposomnia” OR “insomnia” OR “sleep initiation and maintenance disorders”
OR “sleeplessness” OR” somatoform disorder”/exp OR “somatoform disorder” OR “somatoform
disorders”), oraz ClinTrials.gov (Passiﬂora).

We utilized the following inclusion criteria: (i) original studies, (ii) studies with access to full
text, (iii) studies in which the treatment included any products (supplements, tinctures, extracts,
infusions, raw materials, etc.) containing Passiﬂora incarnata, (iv) presence of meta-analytical data
(change score/endpoint) on psychiatric symptoms in the process of each neuropsychiatric disease,
and (v) studies carried out in humans. Exclusion criteria were as follows: (i) intervention with products
containing other psychoactive substances; (ii) meta-analyses, systematic reviews, and review works.

2.2. Data Abstraction

Data for country in which the study was conducted, information about the sponsors, type of
blindness, duration of the study, and main purpose of the study, as well as the name of the
preparation used during therapy, were extracted. During data abstraction, detailed data on the

Nutrients 2020, 12, 3894

3 of 19

studied population were looked for, i.e., the average age and standard deviation of studied persons,
the number and percentage of men participating in the study, and the number of people randomized
to the study. Data extraction was performed based on the guidelines contained in the Preferred
Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) protocol, but with no study
protocol registration. If data were missing, authors were contacted via email, to ask for additional
information.
Inconsistencies were resolved by consensus, with the corresponding author being
involved. The results that were compared in the systematic review involved various scales and
tests, such as the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD), Visual Analogue Scale (VAS),
Numerical Rating Scale (NRS), Observers Assessment of Alertness and Sedation Scale (OAA/S),
Corah’s Dental Anxiety Scale, Revised (DAS-R), Ramsey Scale, Digit symbol substitution test (DSST),
Concentration Endurance Test, (The d2 test), Memory test, Continuous Performance Task/Test (CPT),
Trieger Dot Test (TDT), Perceptive Accuracy Test (PAT), Finger Tapping Test (FTT), and State-Trait
Anxiety Inventory (STAI-S, STAI-T). Data from charts and ﬁgures were extracted by means of
WebPlotDigitizer software (https://automeris.io/WebPlotDigitizer/) in order to detect the risk of bias,
the Cochrane Collaboration’s tool for assessing risk of bias was used.

2.3. Outcomes

The primary outcome was to evaluate the eﬀects of a Passiﬂora incarnata on neuropsychiatric
symptoms, namely depressive/anxious phenotype and reactivity to stress. Co-secondary outcomes
were insomnia, somatoform and psychomotor functions, sedation, and nervous restlessness.

3. Results

3.1. Search Results

The ﬁrst search in PubMed and Embase databases resulted in 417 hits. Among them, 305 studies
were excluded as duplicates and/or after evaluation at the title/abstract level. After excluding
305 studies, 112 full-text articles were eventually reviewed, 103 of which were excluded due to the
failure to meet previously established inclusion criteria. The main reasons for exclusion were as
follows: review (n = 31), intervention with multi-herbal preparations (n = 21), an article published
in a language other than Polish or English (n = 11), lack of access to full text (n = 8), intervention
with other psychoactive substances (n = 3), supplementation during pregnancy (n = 1), review of the
substance isolated from Passiﬂora incarnata (n = 1), lack of availability of ﬁnal results (n = 1), a study in
which a comparison group was missing (n = 1), and a study that did not focus on neuropsychiatric
disorders (n = 1). Finally, nine studies were included in the systematic review. The scheme of searching
databases is included in Figure 1.

3.2. Study Characteristics

Nine studies carried out between 2017 and 2019 were included in this systematic review.
The objective of this systematic review was to evaluate Passiﬂora incarnata in terms of its
neuropsychiatric eﬀects. More than half of the studies (ﬁve) were carried out in Iran, and the others in
Brazil, Turkey, Germany, and Australia. The vast majority of study participants was healthy [6,12–18].
There was only one study [19] in which the participants had a diagnosis of Generalized Anxiety
Disorder (GAD). The duration of the studies included in the analysis varied widely—from one day
up to 30 days. Predominantly, the aim of the reviewed papers (n = 4) was to assess the eﬀects of
passionﬂower use on the anxiety experienced by patients during spinal anesthesia, dental procedures,
or surgery. Studies investigating the eﬀects of P. incarnata administration on sleep quality and cognitive
functions were also included in the analysis. The majority of the analyzed studies (n = 7) were
double-blind (DB), with one cross-over study. The other trials (n = 2) were single-blind (SB), and one
(n = 1) was a cross-over study. In all the papers included in the review, the participants were no less
than 18 years old. Details of the studies included in the systematic review are presented in Table 1.

Conclusions

Passiﬂora extract is eﬀective
in the treatment of systemic
anxiety; additionally, there is
a low incidence of
impairment of work
eﬃciency with Passiﬂora
extract, as compared to
oxazepam. There is a need
for further research on the
use of Passiﬂora in the
treatment of systemic anxiety.

Preoperative oral
administration of 700 mg/5
mL of Passiﬂora water extract
reduces the level of anxiety in
patients before spinal
anesthesia without changing
their sedation level,
psychomotor function test
results, or hemodynamics.

In outpatient surgery, oral
administration of Passiﬂora as
a premedication reduces
preoperative anxiety with
comparable dysfunction of
psychomotor functions, as
compared to preoperative
oral intake of oxazepam.

The Hamilton Depression (HAM-D) Scale is a numerical scale consisting of 21 points (or 17
points in some cases). It is a tool used in general psychiatry, to assess the diagnosis of depression
and to clinically evaluate the use of antidepressants. The HAM-D score level of depression is as
follows: 10–13, mild; 14–17, mild to moderate; and >17, moderate to severe [20]. The numerical and
analog-visual scales belong to pain scales with scores ranging from 0 to 10, with score 0 reﬂecting no
pain and 10 the strongest imaginable pain. The four-stage OAA/S scale is a useful tool in assessing the
awareness of patients who have received midazolam. The scale has been used for sedation-related
drugs, to assess a person’s level of sedation, since the 1990s [21]. The Corah Dental Anxiety Scale has
been used since the 1970s [22]. It consists of four items (questions) on dental anxiety. Each answer
is scored from 1 to 5. A total of 20 points can be obtained, with a score above 15 suggesting the
presence of a dental phobia [23]. The Corah scale is another Dental Anxiety Scale which can be used in
children [24]. The Ramsey scale is one of the most widely used scales to assess the level of sedation.
Scores are recorded from 0 to 6, with 0 being conscious and 6 being deeply coma [25]. The DSST
test is primarily used in clinical neuropsychology. Initially, it helped scientists to understand how a
person learns. Currently, it is used in the assessment of cognitive disorders, such as schizophrenia
and major depression [26]. The concentration strength test concerns the diagnosis in the context of
concentration, as well as the perception and possible correction of errors [27]. The memory test mainly
focuses on visual memory. It informs about possible alterations within the central nervous system,
and it can also be used to assess the attention/concentration disorders. The continuous exercise test is a
neuropsychological test that is used in the diagnosis of ADHD and epilepsy, as well as in patients with
brain damage. It focuses mainly on the patient’s constant attention, while allowing us to measure the
degree of impulsiveness during the test. It helps to collect quantitative data about the patient [28,29].
Measurement of perceptual-motor skills is performed by using the Trieger point tests (e.g., TDT) or the
exact perception tests (e.g., PAT) [30,31]. TDT is also a useful tool for assessing the level of anesthesia
and recovery [32]. The ﬁnger tapping test is one of the standard neuropsychological assessments that
examines motor functioning, speciﬁcally, motor speed and lateralized coordination. The inventory of
the state and trait of anxiety allows the assessment of the severity of anxiety and its characteristics [33].

3.4. Risk of Bias Assessment

The bias analysis showed that the three studies were of low quality and received less than 5 points
in the risk of bias (ROB) evaluation [13,16,17]. In the last six [6,12,14,15,18,19], the number of points
was higher than 5. The average number of points in all studies is 5.66 The results of the bias risk
analysis are presented in Table 4.

4. Discussion

14 of 19

Neuropsychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia, bipolar aﬀective disorder, major depressive
disorder, and attention-deﬁcit hyperactivity disorder, are a common and, regrettably, increasingly
prevalent problem. Around the world, depression aﬀects some 322 million people, while 264 million
live with anxiety [34]. Mild dysfunctions of the nervous system can be treated with psychotherapy,
but more severe disorders require pharmacological treatment alongside therapy [35]. In the past
year, the academic interest in these disorders has been growing due to the COVID-19 pandemic and
the related upsurge in anxiety and depression [36]. Pharmacotherapy is eﬀective, but, at the same
time, it carries the risk of side eﬀects and dependence [37]. Hence, the search for herbal remedies for
neuropsychiatric disorders continues to go on [38]. Passiﬂora incarnata is a perennial plant containing
precious phytochemicals with health-promoting properties. The most important among them would
appear to be chrysin, due to its neuroprotective eﬀects [39]. The systematic review method used in this
study made it possible to assess the eﬃcacy of passionﬂower with respect to neurological disorders,
by synthesizing the results of nine clinical trials included herein. This is the ﬁrst systematic review
evaluating the eﬀects of Passiﬂora incarnata in neuropsychiatric disorders.

Nine clinical trials were included in this paper. The reviewed studies analyzed the eﬀects of
passionﬂower preparations on anxiety levels experienced by patients during medical interventions,
including spinal anesthesia, dental procedures, or surgery, as well as on sleep quality and cognitive
functions. In eight papers, the study subjects were healthy, and, in one, P. incarnata was given to
patients with a diagnosis of Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD). Various commercial products
containing passionﬂower preparations were administered in the analyzed trials, including drops,
tablets, and syrup. Detailed information, including the type of preparation and dosage, is presented in
Table 1.

Akhondzadeh et al. [12], in their study of people with Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD),
compared the eﬀects of passionﬂower extract with oxazepam over a period of 28 days. To this end,
they used the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression. Study participants receiving either passionﬂower
extract (45 drops/day) or oxazepam were evaluated each day, prior to, during, and after taking the
relevant substance (Table 2). The authors demonstrated that there were no signiﬁcant diﬀerences
between taking passionﬂower vs. oxazepam, and the former did not cause an impairment of job
performance in the subjects. A follow-up large-scale trial was recommended.

Aslanargun et al. [13] investigated the eﬀects of administering passionﬂower syrup (700 mg/5 mL,
30 min before anesthesia) on anxiety, psychomotor function, sedation, and hemodynamics in patients
before spinal anesthesia. The eﬀects of passionﬂower were examined in awake patients after surgery
(Table 2). The authors demonstrated that P. incarnata signiﬁcantly contributed to reducing preoperative
anxiety. Even though it was reported that psychomotor functions were impaired 30 min after
extubation, the preoperative values were restored by 90 min. Side eﬀects, including cutaneous
vasculitis, urticaria, asthma, or rhinitis, were not observed. Hemodynamic parameters did not change
after the administration of Passiﬂora, as compared to the placebo. Additional advantages included the
lack of intraoperative sedation and respiratory depression. According to the authors, P. incarnata is a
safe and eﬀective anxiolytic which can be used before spinal anesthesia.

The objective of the study by Azimaraghi et al. [14] was to compare the eﬃcacy of passionﬂower and
oxazepam in reducing patients’ preoperative anxiety. The authors demonstrated that patients who were
given Passiﬂora tablets (500 mg for premedication) had lower preoperative anxiety levels, as compared
to the group receiving oxazepam, and the eﬀects of both medications on postoperative psychomotor
function were similar. Recovery time was, likewise, comparable in both groups (Table 2). The authors
suggest that Passiﬂora incarnata is safe and deﬁnitely more eﬀective for reducing preoperative anxiety in
comparison to oxazepam. They also point out that it can be included in the treatment of preoperative
anxiety in children and adolescents.

To compare the anxiolytic action of Passiﬂora incarnata with that of midazolam, Dantas et al. [15]
employed an experimental model involving bilateral extraction of the mandibular third molars.

The participants received 15 mg of midazolam (one pill) or 260 mg of Passiﬂora incarnata (one pill)
administered orally 30 min before the start of the surgical procedure. In a cross-over design, participants
were randomly assigned an extraction side (right or left) and a protocol (midazolam or Passiﬂora) at the
ﬁrst procedure. The researcher delivered the drugs to the participants, in encoded form, as “Protocol 1”
(midazolam) or “Protocol 2” (Passiﬂora). The patients were asked to specify whether they felt calm,
a little anxious, very anxious, or so anxious that they felt bad. Detailed results are presented in Table 3.
Higher levels of anxiety were observed in women than in men. The anxiolytic action of both substances
used in the study was similar. Among the participants in the midazolam group, 20% reported they
did not remember anything, while none of the patients receiving passionﬂower reported such an
experience. In terms of adverse eﬀects, somnolence was reported by 82.5% of the participants who
received midazolam, and 50% in the Passiﬂora group. When given the choice, 52% of the participants
would opt for surgery with midazolam, and 27.5% for the P. incarnata treatment, while the remainder
found no diﬀerence between these interventions. The authors suggest that the higher preference for
midazolam among the participants was related to the eﬀect of amnesia, which prevented the formation
of negative memories.

Dimpfel et al. [16] evaluated the eﬀects of NEURAPAS

(192 mg of P. incarnata extract) on
brain electric activity. Electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings were made at 30 min and 1.5, 3,
and 4 h after administering the preparation. EEG tests were performed during the Concentration
Endurance Test, memory test, and Continuous Performance Task/Test. Results are presented in Table 2.
No diﬀerences were observed in the analyzed psychometric parameters between NEURAPAS
vs.
obtained higher values in the Continuous
placebo. Sixteen participants receiving NEURAPAS
®
Performance Task/Test. The analysis of neurophysiological alterations after taking NEURAPAS
revealed frequency changes in EEG that were similar to those of sedative and antidepressant medications,
without impairing cognitive function.

The objective of the study by Kaviani et al. [17] was to evaluate the eﬀects of the passionﬂower
extract on anxiety levels in psychiatrically healthy patients undergoing dental treatment. No diﬀerences
were observed in mean anxiety scores before taking the medication (Table 2). The authors emphasize
their important ﬁnding of very eﬀective anxiety-reducing action of the passionﬂower. They also
acknowledge the need for further research on P. incarnata.

Movafegh et al. [6] investigated the eﬀects of passionﬂower (500 mg) on anxiety in surgery patients.
The results of their tests are presented in Table 2. The authors conclude that P. incarnata at 500 mg/day
provides a safe and eﬀective anxiolytic eﬀect, without impairing psychomotor function. At the same
time, they strongly stress that their sample was too small (n = 60) and urge that research should be
continued with a larger group.

Ngan and Conduit [18] analyzed the eﬀects of Passiﬂora incarnata herbal tea on sleep quality over
a period of seven days, as measured by using sleep diaries and polysomnography. The participants
drank 250 mL of the herbal tea once a day, in the evening (to avoid the sedative eﬀect during the day),
and the measurements were performed in the morning, upon rising. The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory
(STAI-S) was used to evaluate the eﬃcacy of passionﬂower infusions, but the results were not included
in the report from the study. An attempt was made to contact the authors to obtain their results, but
there was no answer. In terms of subjective sleep-quality parameters, a signiﬁcant improvement of the
reported sleep quality (SQ) was observed in the Passiﬂora treatment, with a mean increase of 5.2%,
compared to the placebo. The authors highlight that passionﬂower may have a limited impact on
sleep quality in people with low anxiety levels. Their ﬁndings may also have been aﬀected by the long
interval between drinking the herbal tea and the measurement of anxiety.

The objective of the study by Rokhtabnak et al. [19] was to compare the eﬀects of premedication
with melatonin vs. Passiﬂora incarnata on the cognitive function in adult patients undergoing elective
surgery. No signiﬁcant diﬀerences in pain scores were observed between the groups, either before or
after surgery. The Digital Symbol Substitution Test revealed better postoperative results for melatonin
than Passiﬂora. Both groups showed reduced anxiety and increased sedation scores in the Ramsey test.

Detailed results are presented in Table 2. The authors report positive eﬀects of both interventions on
reducing patient anxiety.

Passiflora incarnata is important

in herbal medicine for treating anxiety or nervousness,
Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD), symptoms of opiate withdrawal, insomnia, neuralgia, convulsion,
spasmodic asthma, ADHD, palpitations, cardiac rhythm abnormalities, hypertension, sexual dysfunction,
and menopause. However, the mechanism of action is still under discussion. Despite gaps in our
understanding of neurophysiological processes, it is increasingly being recognized that dysfunction of
the GABA system is implicated in many neuropsychiatric conditions, including anxiety and depressive
disorders. Therefore, the in vitro effects of a dry extract of P. incarnata on the GABA system were investigated.
The extract inhibited [3H]-GABA uptake into rat cortical synaptosomes but had no effect on GABA release
and GABA transaminase activity. P. incarnata inhibited concentration dependently on the binding of
[3H]-SR95531 to GABAA-receptors and of [3H]-CGP 54626 to GABAB-receptors. Using the [35S]-GTPγS
binding assay, Passiflora could be classified as an antagonist of the GABAB receptor. In contrast, the ethanol-
and the benzodiazepine-site of the GABAA-receptor were not affected by this extract. In conclusion,
the first evidence was shown that numerous pharmacological effects of P. incarnata are mediated via
modulation of the GABA system, including affinity to GABAA and GABAB receptors, and effects on
GABA uptake [40]. Aman et al. carried out research on mice which indicated that P. incarnata may be useful
in treating neuropathic pain. The authors suggested that these properties may result from underlying
opioid and GABA-ergic mechanisms, but also pointed to the potential involvement of oleamid-based
cannabimimetics [41]. The mechanism of action cannot, at present, be regarded as clarified; however,
more recent studies imply that the anxiolytic effects may be mediated via modulation of the GABA
system [42–44]

This systematic review has some limitations. First, there are few studies on the eﬀects of Passiﬂora
incarnata in neuropsychiatric disorders. Taking into account the inclusion and exclusion criteria,
only nine works were qualiﬁed for the present synthesis. Secondly, almost all authors postulate to
continue research in large-scale populations. In the analyzed publications, the study groups ranged
from only 16 to 128 persons. Moreover, it has been proposed to include populations of diﬀerent
ethnicities in continuing the research. Due to the high heterogeneity, it was impossible to perform a
meta-analysis, which further suggests that research in this area should be continued.

Another limitation may be the lack of information on which part of the plant was used in the
research. Traditional medicine uses the leaves, stamps, seeds, and ﬂowers (aerial parts) of P. incarnate [4].
Unfortunately, the authors usually do not specify in their publications what part of the plant was
used by them. Ngan and Conduit [18] indicated that they used leaves, stamps, seeds, and ﬂowers.
Perhaps all the others also used all the aboveground parts as a mixture. It seems advisable, therefore,
for the authors to indicate what part of the plant they used in their research, as this may be relevant for
the interpretation of the results and discussion.

In conclusion, the authors of the works included in this systematic review all agree that
Passiﬂora incarnata may be an eﬀective, cheap, and safe drug used in counteracting at least some of the
symptoms of neuropsychiatric origin. At the same time, they indicate the advisability of continuing
research on a large population of people from various geographical regions.

5. Conclusions

Passionﬂower has the potential to alleviate some symptoms of neuropsychiatric origin. No adverse
eﬀects, including memory loss or collapse of psychometric functions, have been linked to passionﬂower
administration. The anti-anxiety eﬀect of Passiﬂora incarnata is comparable to drugs such as oxazepam
or midazolam. Consequently, it seems to be an eﬀective and safe pharmaceutical to reduce stress
reactivity, insomnia, anxiety, and depression-like behaviors.
