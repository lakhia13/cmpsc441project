Abstract 
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that is globally increasing in prevalence. 
The rise of ASD can be partially attributed to diagnostic expansion and advocacy efforts; however, the interplay 
between genetic predisposition and modern environmental exposures is likely driving a true increase in incidence. 
A range of evidence indicates that prenatal exposures are critical. Infection during pregnancy, gestational diabetes, 
and maternal obesity are established risk factors for ASD. Emerging areas of research include the effects of maternal 
use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, antibiotics, and exposure to toxicants during pregnancy on brain devel-
opment and subsequent ASD. The underlying pathways of these risk factors remain uncertain, with varying levels 
of evidence implicating immune dysregulation, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, gut microbiome altera-
tions, and hormonal disruptions. This narrative review assesses the evidence of contributing prenatal environmental 
factors for ASD and associated mechanisms as potential targets for novel prevention strategies.

Background
Autism  spectrum  disorder  (ASD)  is  an  umbrella  term 
for a heterogeneous group of neurodevelopmental disor-
ders  characterized  by  deficits  in  social  communication, 
repetitive  and  stereotypical  behaviors,  and  intellectual 
disabilities of varying levels [1]. ASD characteristics per-
sist  throughout  life  but  are  primarily  diagnosed  during 
early childhood when atypical developmental trajectories

emerge [2]. A recent systematic review of 71 studies esti-
mated  the  global  median  prevalence  of  ASD  between 
2012  and  2022  to  be  10  per  1000  children  and  adults 
[3]. Males are approximately 4.2 times more likely to be 
affected than females [3], with differences in social com-
munication,  camouflaging,  and  restrictive  and  repetitive 
behaviors evident between the sexes [4].

The etiology of ASD is multifactorial, shaped by inher-
ited  genetics,  environmental  contributions—particularly 
those  associated  with  the  maternal  environment—and 
intricate  gene–environment  interactions  [5,  6].  Epide-
miological  studies  indicate  that  potential  environmental 
prenatal factors contributing to ASD include exposure to 
infection  during  pregnancy,  obesity,  gestational  diabetes 
mellitus  (GDM),  maternal  selective  serotonin  reuptake 
inhibitor  (SSRI)  use,  antibiotic  use,  and  prenatal  expo-
sure to toxicants [7–12]. These prenatal factors may alter

several  pathways  during  critical  developmental  periods 
[13], particularly in genetically sensitive individuals [14]. 
The evidence relating to the potential pathways underly-
ing the aforementioned prenatal factors is largely preclin-
ical and implicates immune dysregulation, mitochondrial 
dysfunction, oxidative stress, gut microbiome alterations, 
and  hormonal  disruptions  [15–19].  Understanding  the 
complex  etiology  of  ASD  and  underlying  pathways  may 
help  identify  early  biomarkers  and  targets  for  primary 
prevention.  While  previous  reviews  have  explored  vari-
ous genetic and prenatal factors associated with ASD risk 
[20, 21], here, we assess the current evidence for poten-
tially  modifiable  prenatal  environmental  risk  factors  for 
ASD,  as  outlined  in  Fig.  1.  We  discuss  potential  mecha-
nisms  underlying  each  specific  risk  factor,  particularly 
expanding on the role of the gut microbiome.

Genetic predisposition
Many  genes  and  gene  variants  likely  contribute  to 
ASD  [22].  The  high  concordance  of  ASD  in  monozy-
gotic  twins,  increased  sibling  recurrence,  and  familial 

aggregation  of  ASD  suggest  a  strong  genetic  compo-
nent,  with  heritability  estimated  to  be  approximately 
50%  [23–26].  The  presence  of  autistic  traits  in  geneti-
cally defined disorders, such as fragile X syndrome and 
Rett  syndrome,  supports  the  importance  of  genetic 
contributions  to  ASD  more  generally  [27].  Sex  differ-
ences  in  autism  may  arise  due  to  differential  genetic 
penetrance,  sex-specific  loci,  or  genetic  mutations  [28, 
29]. Sex-specific phenotypic changes may begin via epi-
genetic  interactions  in  utero  through  altered  hormone 
exposure influencing endocrine function and neurode-
velopment  [30,  31].  A  genetic  predisposition  to  ASD 
may increase susceptibility to inflammation, mitochon-
drial  dysfunction,  oxidative  stress,  alterations  in  the 
gut  microbiome,  and  hormone  disruption,  which  may 
collectively  underlie  the  connection  between  prenatal 
factors  and  ASD  development  [17,  32].  However,  the 
clinical  heterogeneity  of  ASD,  including  sexual  dimor-
phism, behavioral phenotype distinctions, and individ-
ual developmental progression, makes it challenging to 
ascertain underlying genetic variations and pathophysi-
ology [33].

Infection during pregnancy
Several  studies  have  established  an  association  between 
infections  such  as  rubella  [34,  35]  and  cytomegalovi-
rus  [36]  during  pregnancy  and  an  increased  likelihood 
of  ASD  in  children  [8,  37],  consistent  with  the  findings 
from preclinical studies investigating the role of maternal 
infection in ASD-like behavior in offspring [38]. A Dan-
ish  population  study  found  that  viral  infections  includ-
ing influenza, gastroenteritis, and other unspecified viral 
infections  in  the  first  trimester  of  pregnancy  requiring 
hospitalization correlated with a 2.8-fold increase in the 
risk of ASD, while bacterial infections in the second tri-
mester  were  associated  with  a  1.4-fold  increase  [39].  In 
the same cohort, exposure to only influenza during preg-
nancy was associated with a 2.3-fold increase in the risk 
of  ASD,  regardless  of  the  trimester  of  exposure  [40].  A 
meta-analysis  of  36  studies  revealed  that  any  maternal 
infection or fever was associated with a 1.3-fold increase 
in  ASD  development  [8].  Fever  during  pregnancy  was 
associated  with  a  2.1-fold  increase  in  the  odds  of  ASD, 
independent  of  infection;  however,  these  findings  were 
attenuated  in  mothers  who  reported  taking  antipyretic 
medications  to  prevent  or  reduce  fever,  suggesting  anti-
pyretics  may  modify  the  relationship  between  infection 
and  ASD  [41].  A  Danish  population-based  genome-
wide association study found an association between the 
genetic profile of mothers with a history of any infection 
during  pregnancy  and  subsequent  ASD  compared  to 
the  genetic  profile  of  mothers  with  no  history  of  infec-
tions during pregnancy [42]. While the reported genetic 
association  between  a  history  of  maternal  infection  and 
ASD  was  relatively  low,  these  maternal  infection–based 
cases of ASD may have distinct genetic aetiologies. Vali-
dation  of  infection  sites,  types  and  timing  during  preg-
nancy poses a challenge, limiting the accurate evaluation 
of maternal infection’s role in ASD development. Further 
research  is  needed  to  distinguish  the  direct  pathogenic 
effects of infection from the indirect effects of inflamma-
tion during pregnancy.

Potential mechanisms
Inflammation

Maternal  immune  activation  (MIA),  triggered  by  infec-
tion or inflammation during pregnancy, has been associ-
ated with a range of developmental difficulties in children, 
including  increased  risk  of  speech,  language,  and  motor 
delays  [43],  increased  behavioral  and  emotional  prob-
lems  [44]  and  altered  connectivity  in  brain  regions  sup-
porting  working  memory  in  children  [45].  MIA  elevates 
circulating  and  central  proinflammatory  cytokines 
in  animal  models,  potentially  impacting  fetal  immu-
nity  and  neurodevelopment  [46,  47].  Offspring  of  mice 
exposed  to  MIA  during  pregnancy  exhibit  heightened 

neuroinflammation  and  display  ASD-like  impaired  inhi-
bition  and  social  interaction  behaviors  [48].  Maternal 
cytokines may cross the placenta, enter fetal circulation, 
and  activate  the  fetal  immune  system  [49,  50].  The  pla-
centa  expresses  all  ten  functional  toll-like  receptors,  in 
humans  and  can  therefore  directly  recognize  microbial 
products,  leading  to  increased  placental  inflammation 
and  inflammatory  cytokine  release,  affecting  fetal  brain 
development  [51].  As  such,  administration  of  bacterial 
mimetic  lipopolysaccharide  (LPS)  to  pregnant  mice  on 
embryonic  day  14  increases  maternal  circulating  levels 
of  interleukin  (IL)-17,  a  T  cell-derived  proinflammatory 
cytokine,  and  subsequently  leads  to  increased  ASD-like 
impaired  vocalization  and  social  approach  behaviors  in 
their  offspring  [52].  Administration  of  IL-17-blocking 
antibodies prior to LPS prevented such behaviors [53]. In 
the  poly(I:C)  MIA  mouse  model,  an  increase  in  inflam-
matory  cytokine  concentration  in  maternal  serum  and 
amniotic  fluid  is  associated  with  subsequent  ASD-like 
deficits  in  inhibition  control  and  exploratory  and  social 
behaviors in the offspring [54]. IL-6, a key proinflamma-
tory  cytokine,  has  been  shown  to  play  a  critical  role  in 
promoting  MIA-induced  ASD-like  deficits  in  inhibition 
control and social interaction in mice [48]. In addition to 
maternal IL-6 being able to cross the placenta and influ-
ence the fetus directly [55], there is also evidence that pla-
cental IL-6 signaling in response to MIA results in acute 
immune  activation  in  the  fetal  brain  and  subsequent 
behavioral impairments [54]. In mice, blocking placental 
IL-6 signaling prevents MIA-induced immune activation 
in  the  fetal  brain  and  subsequent  behavioral  abnormali-
ties [54]. Elevated gene expression of IL-6 has also been 
observed  in  the  brains  of  MIA-exposed  mice  and  in  the 
brain  tissue  of  autistic  individuals  [56].  It  is  likely  that 
concurrent  risk  factors  or  repeat  infections  are  relevant 
to  ASD  susceptibility  [57].  Adequate  maternal  levels  of 
vitamins and antioxidants may enhance resilience to the 
effects of MIA [58], potentially influencing the effects of 
MIA on ASD development.

Mitochondrial function

Mitochondria  are  highly  sensitive  to 
immune  and 
intrauterine  changes  and  may  mediate  the  relationship 
between  infection-related  inflammatory  responses  and 
ASD  development  [16].  A  recent  review  identified  12 
preclinical studies providing evidence for MIA-inducing 
ASD-like  altered  inhibitory  and  social  behavior,  senso-
rimotor  coordination  in  offspring,  and  changes  in  brain 
mitochondrial  morphology,  density,  and  oxidative  stress 
levels [59]. Exposure to LPS has been shown to increase 
reactive  oxygen  species  (ROS)  production  [60]  and  lead 
to metabolic reprogramming from oxidative phosphoryl-
ation to glycolysis, particularly in microglia, the primary 

 Love et al. BMC Medicine          (2024) 22:393

innate immune cells in the brain [61]. In addition to being 
a  target  of  MIA,  mitochondrial  molecules,  including 
adenosine  triphosphate,  mitochondrial  DNA,  and  ROS, 
can  also  lead  to  inflammatory  responses,  directly  influ-
encing  neuroinflammation  [62].  Given  the  critical  role 
of mitochondrial function in brain development, includ-
ing  neurogenesis,  synaptogenesis,  glial  cell  development 
and other processes with high bioenergetic requirements, 
MIA-induced  disruption  in  mitochondrial  bioenerget-
ics during this critical period has major implications for 
neurodevelopment  [59].  Preclinical  models  suggest  the 
potential reversibility of MIA insults by redox modifiers 
such as N-acetylcysteine [63]. Human postmortem tissue 
studies  have  shown  decreased  expression  of  mitochon-
drial genes in regions involved in emotion and behavior 
regulation  and  motor  function  in  autistic  brains  com-
pared to non-autistic individuals [64]. Positron emission 
tomography  (PET)  scanning  identified  mitochondrial 
dysfunction in multiple brain regions in 23 adult autistic 
males compared to 24 age- and sex-matched nonautistic 
individuals  [65].  Reduced  mitochondrial  function  corre-
lated with more severe social communication challenges 
in males, indicating a potential association between spe-
cific  brain  areas  and  core  ASD  characteristics  [65].  The 
small  sample  size  limits  exploration  of  mitochondrial 
function using PET scanning and the study has yet to be 
repeated in females.

Gut microbiome

In preclinical studies, changes in the maternal gut micro-
biome during pregnancy mediate the effects of maternal 
infection  on  ASD  development.  The  offspring  of  influ-
enza  A  virus  (IAV)-infected  mice  exhibited  impaired 
mucosal  immunity  and  altered  immune  cell  profiles 
within gut-associated lymphoid tissue [66]. As IAV does 
not directly infect the fetus or placenta [67], this response 
may  occur  due  to  changes  in  the  maternal  immune  sys-
tem  or  potentially  be  mediated  via  the  gut  microbiota, 
which can influence early life immune development [66]. 
Offspring of the poly(I:C) MIA mouse model show ASD-
like communicative, social, and stereotypic impairments 
alongside  differences  in  the  gut  microbiome  profile  and 
increased  intestinal  permeability  [18].  Oral  adminis-
tration  of  Bacteroides  fragilis  to  MIA  pups  reduced  gut 
permeability  and  ameliorated  ASD-like  anxiety,  sensori-
motor,  repetitive,  communicative,  and  social  behaviors 
[18],  suggesting  that  therapies  targeting  the  gut  micro-
biome  may  improve  ASD-like  behavioral  symptoms. 
Mothers of children with ASD have more Proteobacteria, 
Alphaproteobacteria,  Moraxellaceae,  and  Acinetobacter 
than  mothers  of  children  without  ASD  and  that  these 
microbiome  profiles  are  associated  with  their  children’s 
microbiome  [68].  The  role  of  the  gut  microbiome  as  a 

mediator between maternal infection and ASD develop-
ment has yet to be explored in humans.

Infection during pregnancy induces inflammation, dis-
rupting  inflammatory  pathways,  and  mitochondrial  and 
gut microbiome function. While each pathway may play a 
distinct role in ASD development, there is likely a cumu-
lative  effect  from  multidirectional  interactions  between 
multiple pathways (Table 1). Variability in assessing acute 
and  chronic  inflammation  highlights  the  necessity  for 
standardized  biomarkers  and  laboratory  techniques  to 
assess inflammatory responses.

Maternal obesity and GDM
Maternal  obesity  and  GDM  are  both  linked  to  an 
increased  likelihood  of  ASD  in  children.  Several  epide-
miological  studies  have  shown  that  pre-pregnancy  obe-
sity increases the odds of ASD in children by 1.3–2.0-fold 
[7]. Additionally, excessive gestational weight gain on its 
own increases the odds for ASD in children by 1.1–1.6-
fold  [7].  A  meta-analysis  of  12  studies  found  that  GDM 
was  associated  with  a  1.5–1.7-fold  increase  in  the  risk 
for ASD in children compared to mothers without GDM 
[96].  Pre-existing  type  2  diabetes  is  also  associated  with 
a  1.3-fold  increase  in  the  risk  of  ASD  in  children,  and 
GDM  is  associated  with  a  1.4-fold  increase  when  diag-
nosed  at  26  weeks  gestation  or  earlier  [97].  No  associa-
tion between GDM and ASD development was detected 
when GDM was diagnosed after 26 weeks [97], indicating 
that the timing of GDM onset may be important.

Potential mechanisms
Inflammation

Both  obesity  and  GDM  are  well-known  inflamma-
tory  conditions  and  can  lead  to  a  dysregulated  immune 
system,  which  may  subsequently  impair  fetal  neu-
rodevelopment  and  increase  ASD  susceptibility  [98]. 
Preclinical findings demonstrate that systemic inflamma-
tion  induced  by  maternal  obesity  and  GDM  leads  to  an 
increased release of maternal proinflammatory cytokines 
that  cross  the  placenta  and  alter  the  fetal  development 
of neural pathways that regulate behavior [69]. Pregnant 
rats were administered streptozotocin, a diabetes-induc-
ing  agent,  leading  to  elevated  levels  of  inflammatory 
cytokines IL-1β and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α in the 
brain tissue of their offspring, accompanied by neurode-
velopmental delays in behavioral tasks [73]. Exposure to a 
high-fat diet during pregnancy in rodents also increases 
local  and  systemic  inflammation  and  the  production  of 
the  proinflammatory  cytokines,  including  IL-1β,  IL-6, 
and  TNF-α  in  maternal  and  offspring  serum  and  brain, 
increasing atypical anxiety, cognitive and social behaviors 
in the offspring [70–72].

Hormonal disruption

Obesity  and  GDM  may  promote  hormonal  changes  in 
women  during  pregnancy  influencing  maternal  weight, 
glucose  metabolism,  and  immune  function  [89,  97]. 
Consequently,  obesity  and  GDM  may  disrupt  the  inter-
action  between  maternal  metabolic  hormones  such  as 
leptin  and  insulin  [90,  99],  leading  to  heightened  secre-
tion  of  inflammatory  cytokines  [100]. The  dysregulation 
of  metabolic  hormones  and  cytokine  secretion  can  be 
transmitted from mother to fetus, influencing the devel-
opment  of  brain  regions  and  neural  circuitry  associated 

with energy balance and behavior regulation [101]. Addi-
tionally,  maternal  and  fetal  metabolic  hormone  changes 
can  shape  the  developing  brain  and  may  contribute  to 
sexually  dimorphic  characteristics  and  behaviors  [102, 
103].  Mouse  and  human  studies  indicate  that  placental 
immune  responses  may  occur  in  a  sex-specific  manner 
in  response  to  maternal  stressors,  potentially  mediated 
by  hormonal  disruptions  and  consequently  influenc-
ing  neurodevelopmental  outcomes  [104,  105].  However, 
whether  placental  immune  activation  has  a  causal  role 
or  reflects  fetal  brain  immune  activation  in  response  to 

 Love et al. BMC Medicine          (2024) 22:393 

Page 6 of 13

maternal  obesity  and  diabetes  has  yet  to  be  established, 
as  has  whether  these  responses  reflect  sex-specific  ASD 
characteristics.

Gut microbiome

Obesity and GDM in women during pregnancy can alter 
the  gut  microbiota  composition  [80,  81]  and  lead  to 
inflammation  in  the  gut  mucosa  and  impaired  gut  bar-
rier integrity [72, 80]. An impaired gut barrier can result 
in  the  translocation  of  the  mother’s  gut  microbiota  and 
its  by-products  such  as  proinflammatory  cytokines  and 
LPS, into the placenta [84, 85]. In mice, depletion of the 
maternal  gut  microbiota  inhibits  placental  growth  and 
vascularisation,  modulating  metabolite  circulation  [82]. 
Supplementation  with  short-chain  fatty  acids  (SCFAs) 
prevents  the  inhibition  of  placental  growth  and  vascu-
larisation,  highlighting  the  crucial  role  of  the  maternal 
gut  microbiome  in  early  placental  structure  and  func-
tion  [82].  By  contrast,  the  administration  of  neurotoxic 
levels  of  the  SCFA  propionic  acid  to  pregnant  mice 
induced  ASD-like  social,  anxiety,  and  repetitive  behav-
iors,  which  were  alleviated  by  sodium  butyrate,  indicat-
ing gut-derived metabolites may have complex effects on 
ASD-like behavioral outcomes [83]. Neurotoxic levels of 
propionic  acid  also  induced  ASD-like  behaviors  in  neo-
natal rats born to mothers with type 1 diabetes, and insu-
lin therapy in the mothers mitigated ASD-like social and 
communication behaviors in offspring [106], highlighting 
the  impact  of  hyperglycemia  on  offspring  ASD  and  the 
potential benefits of insulin therapy during pregnancy.

Further investigation is needed to explore the relation-
ship between obesity, GDM, and ASD, as well as potential 
underlying pathways, particularly in human cohorts. Dis-
crepancies  in  epidemiological  evidence  may  stem  from 
variations in body mass index profiles and diabetes types 
considered.  The  co-occurrence  of  obesity  and  GDM, 
given  their  shared  metabolic  features  and  inflammatory 
profiles,  complicates  the  assessment  of  their  respective 
roles  in  ASD  development,  with  the  combined  effect  of 
maternal  obesity  and  diabetes  likely  exerting  a  greater 
influence on ASD outcomes than either condition alone. 
Investigating  the  individual  and  combined  contribution 
of  obesity  and  GDM  is  crucial  for  identifying  unique 
and  shared  underlying  pathways.  Prenatal  dietary  inter-
ventions  targeting  gut  microbiota-derived  inflammation 
could reduce the effect of maternal obesity and GDM on 
ASD development.

Maternal SSRI use
Evidence from epidemiological studies suggests that pre-
natal  use  of  SSRI  antidepressants  is  associated  with  a 
1.5–4.5-fold increase in the risk for ASD in children, com-
pared  to  children  not  exposed  to  SSRIs  [11,  107–109]. 

This risk appears to be influenced at least to some extent 
by the trimester of pregnancy during which exposure to 
SSRIs  occurred,  with  the  highest  odds  of  ASD  develop-
ment being for children of mothers with SSRI use during 
the first trimester [110, 111]. This timing of vulnerability 
to the effects of SSRIs coincides with the period of active 
organogenesis occurring between weeks three and  eight 
of gestation, being also the critical period for ASD devel-
opment in children of women exposed to potent terato-
gens,  such  as  valproic  acid  and  thalidomide  [112,  113]. 
The association between prenatal SSRI use and ASD risk 
is attenuated when controlled for pre-existing psychiatric 
conditions  [114],  suggesting  confounding  by  indication. 
Further, the significant association of preconception-only 
use of SSRIs, defined as occurring from 3 months prior to 
conception, and the risk of ASD in children, suggests that 
confounding by indication is likely involved [110]. Given 
the  relatively  short  half-lives  of  SSRIs,  except  fluoxetine 
which  can  still  be  biologically  active  after  five  or  more 
weeks of cessation [115], the mechanisms underlying the 
association  between  preconception  exposure  to  SSRIs 
and  ASD  development  are  unclear.  Additional  popula-
tion-based  studies  are  required  to  improve  the  current 
understanding  of  risks  versus  benefits  associated  with 
SSRIs and other antidepressants used during pregnancy, 
particularly  given  the  high  risk  of  ASD  development  in 
children of mothers with psychiatric disorders [116].

Potential mechanisms

SSRI use during pregnancy may alter fetal serotonin sys-
tem  development,  impair  mitochondrial  and  gut  micro-
biome  function,  and  elevate  oxidative  stress  [87,  93]. 
SSRIs  act  by  inhibiting  serotonin  uptake  centrally  and 
peripherally [117]. During pregnancy, there is a substan-
tial increase in peripheral serotonin production. In addi-
tion  to  gut  enterochromaffin  cells  [118],  the  pancreas 
also contributes to increases in maternal serotonin levels 
during  pregnancy  [119],  while  placental  production  of 
serotonin  contributes  to  the  fetal  brain  serotonin  con-
centration [120]. The serotonin system is critical for neu-
rodevelopment,  and  its  disruption  has  been  implicated 
in ASD development, with elevated whole blood seroto-
nin  levels  being  consistently  found  in  people  with  ASD 
[74].  High  blood  levels  of  serotonin  in  mothers  exposed 
to  SSRIs  could  therefore  result  in  disrupted  serotonin 
functioning  in  the  fetal  brain,  leading  to  neurodevel-
opmental  abnormalities  [121].  Preclinical  studies  have 
shown  that  using  SSRIs  modulates  mitochondrial  func-
tion by affecting the activity of mitochondrial enzymatic 
complexes  involved  in  the  electron  transport  chain  and 
the process of oxidative phosphorylation [78, 79]. While 
some studies have shown positive effects of certain SSRIs 
on  the  activities  of  individual  enzymatic  complexes  or

respiration analysis indicative of mitochondrial dysfunc-
tion,  others  have  reported  negative  or  divergent  effects 
[79],  with  prenatal  exposure  potentially  contributing  to 
changes in neonatal energy metabolism [122]. It is, how-
ever, important to note that these conclusions are based 
on  outcomes  in  animal  studies,  with  almost  no  human 
data  available.  The  gut  microbiome  is  also  essential  for 
serotonin  production,  and  gut  microbes  acting  through 
short-chain  fatty  acids  have  been  shown  to  modulate 
serotonin  production  in  preclinical  and  in  vitro  human 
models [86]. Alterations in serotonin signaling observed 
in  individuals  with  ASD  following  SSRI  use  may  there-
fore  be  mediated  by  SSRI-induced  changes  in  the  gut 
microbiome [118, 123].

Epidemiological  studies  are  needed  to  establish  causal 
pathways  between  maternal  SSRI  use  and  ASD  devel-
opment.  Isolating  the  direct  impact  of  SSRIs  is  complex 
due  to  the  interplay  of  depression,  potential  comorbidi-
ties, and lifestyle factors as well as the need to account for 
confounders like past maternal mental illness and timing 
of SSRI exposure. Studies of SSRI use may be influenced 
by indication bias, as the reasons for usage may affect the 
biological mechanisms underpinning ASD.

Maternal antibiotic use
Maternal  antibiotic  use  during  pregnancy  may  increase 
the likelihood of ASD, with 1.1–1.5-fold increases in the 
risk of ASD reported across several international cohorts 
after  prenatal  antibiotic  exposure  [12,  124,  125].  A  pro-
spective  birth  cohort  showed  that  among  women  who 
received  antibiotics  during  pregnancy,  influenza  in  the 
second  trimester  was  not  associated  with  ASD  develop-
ment in children. For women who were not exposed to an 
antibiotic at any point during pregnancy, influenza in the 
second trimester was associated with a 4.0-fold increase 
in  the  odds  of  ASD,  indicating  that  antibiotic  use  may 
modify the influence that maternal influenza has on ASD 
development  [126].  Notably,  adjusting  for  the  type  of 
antibiotic  prescribed  and  using  sibling-matched  cohorts 
to  account  for  unmeasured  familial  environmental  and 
genetic  confounders  attenuated  many  of  these  findings. 
Studies  on  antibiotic  use,  like  those  on  SSRIs,  are  often 
confounded  by  indication  and  include  any  exposure  to 
antibiotics.  Prospective  cohort  studies  may  help  deter-
mine  whether  observed  effects  are  due  to  antibiotics  or 
underlying infections.

Potential mechanisms

Mouse  models  have  demonstrated  that  antibiotic  use 
can modify MIA’s effect on offspring neurodevelopmen-
tal  outcomes,  leading  to  behavioral  abnormalities  [15]. 
Antibiotic use can increase gut permeability [88], result-
ing  in  increased  systemic  translocation  of  the  maternal 

gut  microbiota  and  its  by-products,  such  as  LPS,  into 
the placenta and fetal gut [88]. This, in turn, can impact 
fetal immunity or induce epigenetic changes by releasing 
SCFAs  [88].  The  administration  of  the  broad-spectrum 
antibiotic  vancomycin  to  pregnant  poly(I:C)  MIA  mice 
altered  the  gut  microbiota  composition,  resulting  in 
reduced  intestinal  T  helper  17  cell  levels  and  decreased 
IL-17a in the maternal plasma, preventing reduced socia-
bility, increased repetitive behaviors, and abnormal com-
munication  typically  observed  in  the  offspring  of  mice 
receiving  MIA  manipulation  [75].  While  these  findings 
conflict with evidence that antibiotic use may contribute 
to  ASD  development,  the  presence  of  commensal  bac-
teria  that  are  sensitive  to  vancomycin  may  be  necessary 
for  the  prevention  of  MIA-associated  behavior  in  the 
offspring [75]. It is noteworthy that experimental antibi-
otic administration in rodents differs greatly from human 
usage  in  terms  of  types,  dosages,  treatment  durations, 
and  underlying  conditions  and  reason  for  administra-
tion. Additionally, existing gut microbiome composition, 
immune  response,  and  infection  susceptibility  vary  due 
to  species-specific  physiology  and  future  studies  should 
consider these factors.

Maternal exposure to toxicants
Prenatal  exposure  to  toxicants  such  as  phthalates,  air 
pollutants,  and  heavy  metals  may  disrupt  the  endocrine 
system  and  increase  inflammation,  altering  downstream 
neurodevelopment and increasing ASD likelihood [127]. 
Exposure  to  plasticizers  such  as  phthalates  measured  in 
prenatal  urine  samples  has  been  associated  with  higher 
ASD  symptom  scores  in  several  epidemiological  stud-
ies  [10,  128,  129].  Prenatal  air  pollution  exposure  was 
also  associated  with  a  2.2-3.6  increase  in  ASD  risk  in 
children  in  several  large-scale  epidemiological  studies 
[130,  131],  while  a  meta-analysis  of  28  studies  revealed 
that  maternal  exposure  to  air  pollution  was  associated 
with  a  1.4-fold  increase  in  the  risk  of  ASD  in  newborns 
[132].  A  meta-analysis  of  two  longitudinal  cohort  stud-
ies found that an increase in maternal concentrations of 
the  heavy  metals  cadmium  and  cesium  were  both  asso-
ciated  with  a  1.8-fold  increase  in  the  risk  of  ASD  [133]. 
A  systematic  review  of  53  studies  revealed  higher  lead 
and mercury concentrations in autistic individuals com-
pared  to  non-autistic  individuals  [134].  However,  sig-
nificant  geographical  and  metal  detection  heterogeneity 
among  studies  included  in  the  meta-analysis  highlights 
the need for future longitudinal studies with harmonized 
designs,  measures,  and  analysis  strategies.  Evidence  for 
an  association  between  prenatal  pesticide  exposure  and 
ASD  is  emerging  but  limited  by  variability  in  pesticide 
types  [135–137],  measurement  methods,  and  exposure 

 Love et al. BMC Medicine          (2024) 22:393

levels [138] between studies and there are few preclinical 
studies.

Potential mechanisms

The accumulation of persistent organic and heavy metal 
pollutants  may  act  synergistically  via  alterations  in  hor-
monal  pathways,  inflammation,  and  oxidative  stress, 
leading  to  neurotoxic  effects  during  critical  prenatal 
and  early  postnatal  periods.  Preclinically,  stronger  asso-
ciations  between  maternal  toxicant  exposure  and  social 
impairment  are  often  observed  in  males  [139].  Stronger 
associations  in  males  suggest  a  sex-specific  interaction, 
potentially mediated by a hormone imbalance as mater-
nal  toxicant  exposure  can  disrupt  testosterone  activity 
in  the  fetus  [91].  By  mimicking  or  interfering  with  hor-
mone  production  or  homeostasis,  toxicants  may  influ-
ence  sexually  dimorphic  aspects  of  neurodevelopment 
and subsequent social behaviors [139]. Further, bisphenol 
A exposure during pregnancy also increases male infants’ 
risk  of  ASD  via  downregulating  methylation  (silencing) 
of  the  brain  aromatase  gene,  leading  to  decreased  neu-
roestrogen  production  [92].  A  large  birth  cohort  study 
has  demonstrated  elevated  prenatal  di-(2-ethylhexyl) 
phthalate  (DEHP)  levels  to  be  associated  with  increased 
ASD  symptoms  at  2  and  4  years,  potentially  mediated 
by  a  metabolic  shift  in  pregnancy  toward  nonoxidative 
energy  pathways  [94].  Higher  prenatal  phthalate  levels 
and a higher oxidative stress genetic score are associated 
with subsequent ASD, with oxidative stress-related single 
nucleotide  polymorphisms  (SNPs)  modifying  the  prena-
tal phthalate and ASD association [10, 95]. Autistic chil-
dren may metabolize toxicants differently [140], possibly 
due  to  epigenetic  modifications  that  affect  mechanisms 
underlying  genetic  susceptibility  to  toxicant  exposure. 
Alteration in the genes that encode the proteins respon-
sible  for  the  breakdown  of  toxicants  is  one  biologically 
plausible mechanism [141].

Diesel  exhaust  particles  (DEPs),  a  primary  toxic  com-
ponent  of  air  pollution  have  been  linked  to  ASD-like 
vocalization and social behavior deficits potentially medi-
ated  by  dysregulated  prenatal  toll-like  receptor  (TLR)-4 
expression  [77].  Prenatal  exposure  to  DEPs  in  TLR-4 
knockout  mice  induced  neuroinflammation,  delayed 
microglial  maturation,  and  increased  the  levels  of  the 
inflammatory  cytokine  IL-1β,  potentially  linking  DEP 
exposure  to  ASD  development  through  immune  dys-
regulation [76]. Heavy metals may also alter glutathione 
antioxidant capability, which has been found in individu-
als  with  ASD  [142];  however,  the  relationship  between 
maternal  exposure  to  heavy  metals  and  ASD  develop-
ment is not well understood in humans, and even less is 
known about the underlying mechanisms.

Research  on  the  role  of  toxicants  such  as  phthalates, 
air  pollutants,  and  heavy  metals  in  ASD  development  is 
still  in  its  infancy  and  requires  further  investigation.  To 
explore  the  underlying  pathways,  toxicant  biomarkers 
are frequently measured in blood, urine, or hair. Assess-
ing the accumulation of toxicants may benefit from using 
brain or tooth samples as they represent the tissue where 
toxicants  are  deposited  [131];  however,  obtaining  these 
samples  can  be  challenging,  with  brain  tissue  notably 
harder to collect than teeth.

Future directions
The  last  decade  has  seen  major  advances  in  identify-
ing  prenatal  risk  factors  for  ASD  including  exposure  to 
infection, GDM, and obesity [7–9, 143], while the poten-
tial  impacts  of  SSRI  use,  antibiotic  use  and  exposure  to 
toxicants are emerging fields of research [10–12]. Explo-
ration  of  mechanisms  underlying  ASD  such  as  immune 
dysregulation,  gut  microbiome  alterations,  hormonal 
disruption,  mitochondrial  dysfunction,  and  oxidative 
stress  is  predominantly  preclinical.  Transitioning  pre-
clinical  findings  into  epidemiological  studies  is  required 
to  strengthen  the  evidence  of  pathways  underpinning 
ASD  and  to  identify  potential  targets  for  novel  preven-
tion strategies.

ASD  is  phenotypically  and  genetically  heterogeneous, 
with  the  former  creating  diagnostic  and  classification 
challenges  and  the  latter  leading  to  a  range  of  sensitivi-
ties  to  environmental  risk  factors,  potentially  masking 
relevant  associations.  ASD  frequently  co-occurs  with 
other  conditions  and  shares  overlapping  social,  cogni-
tive,  and  behavioral  characteristics  with  ADHD,  mood, 
and  psychiatric  disorders  [144,  145].  Understanding 
how prenatal risk factors for ASD influence these shared 
characteristics  may  provide  insights  into  related  condi-
tions.  Improvement  in  the  definition  of  ASD  subgroups 
may reduce the diluting impact of case misclassification. 
Latent  class  analysis  is  a  statistical  method  that  can  be 
used to identify ASD subgroups agnostically by analyzing 
the  behavior  and  social  traits  of  autistic  individuals,  to 
identify  subgroups  based  on  the  severity  of  characteris-
tics, co-occurring conditions, developmental trajectories, 
and potential responses to intervention strategies. Apply-
ing  latent  class  analysis  may  increase  our  understand-
ing  of  ASD  heterogeneity  and  help  identify  biological 
pathways and treatment targets relevant to specific sub-
groups,  thus  enabling  personalized  management  plans 
and improved outcomes for autistic individuals. The use 
of genetic susceptibility scores, like those evaluating the 
role of genetic predisposition to oxidative stress in ASD 
pathogenesis [95], may lead to an improved understand-
ing of genetic susceptibility to environmental risk factors 
and  their  underlying  biological  processes  [95].  Genetic 

Love et al. BMC Medicine          (2024) 22:393

susceptibility  scores  capturing  the  transcriptional  activ-
ity  of  response  pathways  beyond  oxidative  stress  may 
provide novel genetic markers of mechanisms associated 
with ASD development.

To address challenges in identifying causal pathways in 
epidemiological  research,  sufficiently  large  and  detailed 
longitudinal  birth  cohort  studies  are  needed  to  develop 
a  comprehensive  understanding  of  the  impact  of  non-
etiological factors and prenatal and early life risk factors 
on  the  developmental  trajectory  of  ASD.  Epidemiologi-
cal  studies  must  employ  robust  clinical  phenotyping  of 
the diverse spectrum of autistic traits and behaviors and 
integrate highly dimensioned multi-omic methodologies 
to  offer  valuable  insights  into  the  mechanisms  underly-
ing  ASD.  The  exposome  approach,  which  describes  all 
an individual’s environmental exposures throughout life, 
beginning  with  prenatal  development  [146],  may  con-
textualize  multi-omic  methods  and  enhance  our  under-
standing  of  gene–environment  interactions  on  health 
outcomes, such as ASD development.

Epidemiological  research  must  thoroughly  consider 
potential confounding and mediating factors across preg-
nancy  and  early  life.  Complementing  epidemiological 
findings  with  preclinical  research  is  essential  for  testing 
causality  and  conducting  more  invasive  investigations 
into  the  mechanisms  underlying  ASD  development. 
Further research exploring the causation of ASD should 
examine maternal and early-life genetic and environmen-
tal  contributors,  focusing  on  identifying  points  of  con-
fluence  in  overlapping  biological  pathways  to  uncover 
predictive  biomarkers  and  targets  for  early  primary 
prevention.

Conclusions
ASD  is  a  growing  public  health  challenge,  where  the 
interplay  between  genetic  predisposition  and  modern 
environmental  exposures,  notably  the  prenatal  environ-
ment,  plays  a  substantial  role.  Infection,  obesity,  GDM, 
SSRI  use,  antibiotics,  and  exposure  to  toxicants  during 
pregnancy may all influence inflammation, hormonal bal-
ance, mitochondrial function, and the gut microbiome to 
disrupt subsequent neurodevelopment. Further, underly-
ing pathways may interact, leading to cumulative effects 
on ASD risk. Understanding the interplay between genet-
ics  and  the  prenatal  environment  in  ASD  etiology  and 
identifying modifiable points of confluence between mul-
tiple  pathways,  is  crucial  to  developing  novel  and  effec-
tive  public  health  policies  aimed  at  reducing  prenatal 
exposure to risk factors in susceptible populations.
