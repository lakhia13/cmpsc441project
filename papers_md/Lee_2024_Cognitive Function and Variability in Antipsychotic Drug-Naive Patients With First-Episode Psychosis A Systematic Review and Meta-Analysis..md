IMPORTANCE Cognitive impairment contributes significantly to clinical outcome and level of
function in individuals with psychotic disorders. These impairments are present already at
psychosis onset at a group level; however, the question of heterogeneity in cognitive function
among patients has not been systematically investigated.

OBJECTIVE To provide an updated quantification of cognitive impairment at psychosis onset
before patients receive potentially confounding antipsychotic treatment, and to investigate
variability in cognitive function compared with healthy controls.

DATA SOURCES In this systematic review and meta-analysis, PubMed articles were searched
up to September 15, 2022.

STUDY SELECTION Original studies reporting data on cognitive function in antipsychotic
drug–naive patients with first-episode psychosis (FEP) were included.

DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS Data were independently extracted by 2 researchers.
Cognitive tasks were clustered according to 6 domains of the Measurement and Treatment
Research to Improve Cognition in Schizophrenia (MATRICS) Consensus Cognitive Battery and
the domain of executive function. Random-effects model meta-analyses of mean differences
and coefficient of variation ratios (CVRs) were performed, as well as meta-regressions,
assessment of study quality, and publication bias.

MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The main outcome measure was Hedges g for mean
differences in cognition and CVR for within-group variability.

RESULTS Fifty studies were included in the analysis with a total of 2625 individuals with FEP
(mean [SD] age, 25.2 [3.6] years, 60% male; 40% female) and 2917 healthy controls (mean
[SD] age, 26.0 [4.6]; 55% male; 45% female). In all cognitive domains, the FEP group
displayed significant impairment compared with controls (speed of processing: Hedges
g = −1.16; 95% CI, −1.35 to −0.98; verbal learning: Hedges g = −1.08; 95% CI, −1.28 to −0.88;
visual learning: Hedges g = −1.05; 95% CI, −1.27 to −0.82; working memory: Hedges
g = −1.04; 95% CI, −1.35 to −0.73; attention: Hedges g = −1.03; 95% CI, −1.24 to −0.82;
reasoning/problem solving: Hedges g = −0.90; 95% CI, −1.12 to −0.68; executive function:
Hedges g = −0.88; 95% CI, −1.07 to −0.69). Individuals with FEP also exhibited a larger
variability across all domains (CVR range, 1.34-1.92).

CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Results of this systematic review and meta-analysis identified
cognitive impairment in FEP before the initiation of antipsychotic treatment, with large effect
sizes. The high variability within the FEP group suggests the need to identify those individuals
with more severe cognitive problems who risk worse outcomes and could benefit the most
from cognitive remediation.

Cognitive Function and Variability in Patients With First-Episode Psychosis

Original Investigation Research

C ognitive impairment is a central characteristic of

schizophrenia1-3 and other psychotic disorders and has
a strong association with functional4-6 and clinical
outcome.5,7 Cognitive symptoms may often precede illness
onset,8-10 and a previous meta-analysis11 showed signifi-
cantly impaired cognitive performance already present in
antipsychotic drug–naive patients with first-episode psycho-
sis (FEP), ie, before the introduction of medication effects or
adverse effects as potential confounders. In the study includ-
ing reports published up until 2012, cognition was found
to be impaired in patients, with medium to large effect sizes
(standardized mean difference [SMD] range, −0.74 to −1.03).
These results were comparable with earlier meta-analyses in
FEP, which also included patients taking medication (eg,
Mesholam-Gately and colleagues12 with an SMD range of
−0.71 to −1.2), whereas a more recent study13 focusing only on
Chinese samples assessed with the Measurement and Treat-
ment Research to Improve Cognition in Schizophrenia
(MATRICS) Consensus Cognitive Battery14(MCCB) produced
slightly larger effect sizes (SMD range, −0.87 to −1.41). Impor-
tantly, all of these studies focused on mean comparisons only,
despite the fact that psychotic disorders are generally consid-
ered to be highly heterogeneous in terms of symptom profile
and course of illness.15

Attempts to describe variability in cognitive function have
been synthesized in a systematic review of studies in schizo-
phrenia spectrum and bipolar disorder16 and a narrative re-
view on schizophrenia.17 Both reviews focused on studies in-
vestigating cognitive subgroups and concluded that distinct
subgroups exist ranging from relative intact cognition to se-
vere cognitive dysfunction. However, this body of research has
typically included patients with longer duration of illness,
and the question of heterogeneity early in the illness trajec-
tory and before initiation of antipsychotic treatment is still
unclear. Furthermore, due to the methodological variability
in studies examining potential subgroups, meta-analytical
evidence is still lacking regarding cognitive heterogeneity.

One way to measure heterogeneity is through comparing
the amount of variability in the group of patients with psy-
chosis with the variability in the control group, eg, by using
the coefficient of variation ratio (CVR).18 This method was re-
cently used by Catalan et al19 to demonstrate greater variabil-
ity in cognitive function in individuals at clinical high risk for
psychosis (CHR-P) compared with controls. Individuals at
CHR-P are defined using different combinations of risk fac-
tors, and current estimates indicate that 25% go on to de-
velop psychosis within a 3-year period.20 The study examin-
ing cognitive variability in those at CHR-P also included a small
group of patients with FEP who exhibited similar within-
group variability as those at CHR-P, but to our knowledge,
cognitive variability in FEP has not been analyzed at the
meta-analytic level in larger samples.

Since the previous meta-analysis of antipsychotic drug–
naive individuals with FEP,11 a large number of new studies
assessing cognitive deficits in patients have been published.
The field has also seen an increased trend toward data harmo-
nization since MCCB has become the dominant test battery.
In addition, guidelines and standards for the reporting of

Key Points

Question How do patients with first-episode psychosis (FEP)
compare with controls in cognitive function and cognitive
variability, before initiation of antipsychotic medication?

Findings In this systematic review and meta-analysis including
50 studies and 2625 individuals with FEP, the mean cognitive
performance of antipsychotic drug–naive individuals with FEP was
significantly impaired compared with controls, across all cognitive
domains. At the same time, the within-group variability in FEP was
significantly greater, indicating a wider distribution of cognitive
ability in patients with FEP compared with controls.

Meaning Patients with psychosis display cognitive difficulties
very early in the disease process, and the considerable
heterogeneity in cognitive function should prompt individual
assessments in clinical settings in order to optimize care.

systematic reviews have been updated.21 In the present study,
our primary aim was, therefore, to update and extend the pre-
vious meta-analysis in antipsychotic drug–naive patients with
FEP. The secondary aim was to perform the first systematic
meta-analysis of within-group variability in cognitive ability
in FEP.

Methods

The meta-analysis was registered on PROSPERO and fol-
lowed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews
and Meta-analyses (PRISMA)21 (eTable 1 in Supplement 1) and
Meta-Analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology
(MOOSE)22 reporting guidelines (eTable 2 in Supplement 1).

Search Strategy and Selection Criteria
We applied the same search terms as in our previous meta-
analysis on antipsychotic drug–naive individuals with FEP11
(full search terms available in the eMethods 1 in Supple-
ment 1). A literature search was performed on September 15,
2022, using the PubMed database. All abstracts were screened
by 2 authors independently (M.L. and C.L.), using Rayyan
software.23 Studies included in the meta-analysis fulfilled the
following inclusion criteria: (1) available data on individuals
with psychosis spectrum disorder (corresponding to any di-
agnosis within the DSM-IV chapter on “Psychotic Disorders”
excluding a diagnosis of psychotic disorder due to a general
medical condition and substance-induced psychotic disor-
der), (2) individuals categorized as having FEP, (3) patients re-
ported as being antipsychotic-drug naive, (4) available data on
cognitive performance, (5) available cognitive data from a
healthy control group, and (6) ability to cluster cognitive tests
into 1 of 6 neurocognitive categories of the MCCB or execu-
tive function. Exclusion criteria were (1) articles in a language
other than English, (2) review articles or case reports, (3) over-
lapping sample and neurocognitive test, and (4) cohorts with
a mean duration of untreated psychosis (DUP) longer than 5
years. Studies deemed relevant were read in full length. Ref-
erence lists were screened, and known researchers who had

previously published on antipsychotic drug–naive samples
were contacted. Conflicts regarding inclusion were resolved
through discussion. For studies published before 2012, we re-
lied on data reported in Fatouros-Bergman et al11 (eMethods
2 in Supplement 1). Race and ethnicity data were not col-
lected in our study. Swedish records do not track race or
ethnicity, and we did not consider it a primary aspect of our
research question.

Dataset From the Karolinska Schizophrenia Project
In addition to the literature search, we also included our own
cognitive data collected within the Karolinska Schizophrenia
Project (KaSP; antipsychotic drug–naive patients with FEP and
age- and sex-matched controls), parts of which have been
published elsewhere24,25 (eMethods 3 in Supplement 1).

Outcome Measures and Data Extraction
Cognitive tests were grouped in a similar way as in Fatouros-
Bergman et al11 (eMethods 2 in Supplement 1), following the
domains of the MCCB, with the exception of social cognition.
This was considered beyond the scope of this review, given the
many different aspects (and outcome measures) of social cog-
nition available.26 In addition, the domain of executive func-
tion was added. The executive function domain includes tests
and outcome measures with a focus on cognitive flexibility,
compared with the MCCB reasoning and problem-solving do-
main, which focuses more on organizational and planning
skills. In summary, tests are grouped according to 7 domains:
processing speed, attention, working memory, verbal learn-
ing, visual learning, reasoning and problem solving, and
executive function. A complete list of outcome measures

clustered under their respective domain is available in the
eMethods 4 and eTable 9 in Supplement 1.

Two researchers (M.L. and M.C.) independently ex-
tracted data from the sample of studies into separate spread-
sheets. Cognitive performance (mean and SD) was extracted
for each eligible task, as well as demographic data (age, sex,
years of education, DUP, country). The independent spread-
sheets were then compared, and any inconsistencies were
resolved through discussion.

When additional information was required, correspond-
ing authors were contacted by email. If the FEP sample con-
sisted of both antipsychotic drug–naive patients and patients
either taking medication or drug free, data on only antipsy-
chotic drug–naive individuals was requested. Raw scores or
uncorrected T scores were requested when not already avail-
able. When several articles used patients from the same clini-
cal institution, authors were asked to clarify whether samples
were overlapping or not. If there was no response (after 1
additional reminder email), it was assumed that samples
were overlapping (eTable 10 in Supplement 1). In all cases of
overlapping samples and cognitive tests, the study with the
largest sample size was chosen for inclusion in the meta-
analysis.

Statistical Analysis
Our main meta-analytical effect size measure was Hedges g.
When applicable, test scores were transformed so that higher
values always indicated better performance. Random-effects
meta-analyses, using a restricted maximum likelihood random-
effects variance estimator, were conducted for each of the 7
cognitive domains, resulting in a pooled estimate. For several

of the domains (speed of processing, working memory, and ex-
ecutive function), participants could contribute with several
outcome measures or test scores. To handle this unit of analy-
sis problem,27 multilevel meta-analyses were conducted using
the rmv.mv function in the metafor package, version 3.8-128
in R (R Core Team), accounting for nonindependent effects and
sampling errors (eMethods 5 in Supplement 1). Between-
study heterogeneity was assessed using the Q statistic, the I2
index, and prediction intervals. The presence of publication
bias was assessed by visually inspecting funnel plots. Study
quality was judged using a modified version of the Newcastle-
Ottawa Scale (eMethods 6 in Supplement 1). Two researchers
(M.L. and M.C.) independently rated all studies and, when rat-
ings differed, reached consensus through discussion. When 10
or more studies reported scores from the same cognitive test,
meta-regressions were performed to evaluate the impact of a
series of preregistered potential moderators. Age, sex, educa-
tion, and year of publication were selected in order to repli-
cate and extend the previous meta-analysis of cognitive func-
tion in antipsychotic drug–naive individuals with FEP by
Fatouros-Bergman et al,11 and in addition, we included study
quality (eMethods 8 in Supplement 1). To calculate and com-
pare the within-group variability in FEP and controls, we used
the CVR. The CVR is the natural logarithm of the ratio of esti-
mates of population coefficients of variation,18 which is the

ratio of the SDs normalized to the mean. Given the results of
the prior meta-analysis,11 large differences in mean values were
expected, and to get an unbiased estimate of variability, the
CVR was deemed particularly appropriate in this case.

For robustness check, analyses of the log variability ratio
were also conducted and can be found in eTable 13 in Supple-
ment 1, along with CVR sensitivity analyses for domains con-
taining negative outcome measures (eMethods 7 in Supple-
ment 1). The CVR values presented in writing and plots have
been back transformed from the log scale, to aid interpretabil-
ity. All analyses were conducted using the metafor package28
in R, version 4.2.1 (R Core Team).29 Code for reproducing the
analyses and figures can be found at Github.30

ment 1). The final sample consisted of 50 studies (Figure 1 and

and 2917 healthy controls (mean [SD] age, 26.0 [4.6]; 55% male;
45% female). The mean (SD) education level was 11.9 (1.3) years
for patients and 13.2 (1.8) years for controls. Mean (SD) DUP was
20.9 (16.8) months (the number of studies available for
analysis of DUP = 24).

Cognitive Functioning in Antipsychotic Drug–Naive Patients
With FEP as Compared With Controls
Individuals with FEP performed significantly worse than con-
trol individuals across all cognitive domains, with large ef-
fect sizes ranging from −0.88 to −1.16 (Figure 2 and Figure 3).
In order of magnitude, the effect was largest for speed of pro-
cessing (Hedges g = −1.16; 95% CI, −1.35 to −0.98), followed by
verbal learning (Hedges g = −1.08; 95% CI, −1.28 to −0.88), vi-
sual learning (Hedges g = −1.05; 95% CI, −1.27 to −0.82), work-
ing memory (Hedges g = −1.04; 95% CI, −1.35 to −0.73), atten-
tion (Hedges g = −1.03; 95% CI, −1.24 to −0.82), reasoning/
problem solving (Hedges g = −0.90; 95% CI, −1.12 to −0.68),

and executive function (Hedges g = −0.88; 95% CI, −1.07 to
−0.69). Study-level forest plots are available in eFigures 1
through 7 in Supplement 1.

Heterogeneity, Study Quality, Publication Bias,
and Meta-Regression
There was substantial heterogeneity in effect sizes. All cogni-
tive domains displayed I2 estimates above 70%, suggesting that
the variance in observed effects was mostly due to differ-
ences in true effects and not sampling error.31 Prediction in-
tervals were large, indicating that the mean group difference
could vary substantially depending on sample (eTable 12 in
Supplement 1). Quality rating of the studies ranged from 3 to
8 (mean = 6.1, median = 6). Publication biases are reported in
eTable 12 and eFigures 15 to 21 in Supplement 1. Meta-
regressions revealed no strong effects of the potential mod-
erators (age, sex, education, publication year, and study qual-
ity) that were assessed (eTable 15 in Supplement 1).

Variability of Cognitive Functioning in Antipsychotic
Drug–Naive Patients With FEP Compared With Controls
The patients showed significantly greater within-group vari-
ability in cognitive performance compared with the controls.
CVR values ranged between 1.34 to 1.92 (Figure 4 and
Figure 5), meaning that variability in the patient group was
about 30% as large to almost twice as large as that of the
controls. In order of magnitude, the largest CVR was
obtained for the attention domain (CVR = 1.92; 95% CI, 1.62-
2.27), followed by visual learning (CVR = 1.87; 95% CI, 1.63-
2.15), working memory (CVR = 1.61; 95% CI, 1.37-1.90), ver-
bal learning (CVR = 1.55; 95% CI, 1.40-1.72), reasoning/
problem solving (CVR = 1.46; 95% CI, 1.31-1.64), speed of
processing (CVR = 1.43; 95% CI, 1.27-1.61), and executive
function (CVR = 1.34; 95% CI, 1.13-1.58). Sensitivity analyses
of within-group variability are available in eTable 14 in
Supplement 1 as well as additional study-level forest plots of
CVR in eFigures 8 through 14 in Supplement 1.

Discussion

Results of this updated systematic review and meta-analysis
supported the presence of substantial cognitive impairment in
patients experiencing their FEP, before antipsychotic treatment

has been introduced. As a group, patients underperformed com-
pared with controls, with similar effect sizes, across all cognitive
domains. Furthermore, we, for the first time (to our knowledge),
performed a comprehensive meta-analytic comparison of within-
group variability, demonstrating a greater variability in cognitive
performance within the patient group compared with the healthy
controls across all domains.

The present synthesis incorporated more than twice as
many studies and participants as the previous meta-analysis
on antipsychotic drug–naive individuals with FEP11 and was
conducted using updated reporting standards and meta-
analytic methods. Inclusion criteria followed the same prin-
ciples, apart from a stricter selection in regard to DUP as we
wanted to characterize the onset of the disorder and not the
chronic effects of unmedicated psychosis. The updated litera-
ture search yielded some additional differences in study char-
acteristics where a majority of studies (eTable 11 in Supple-
ment 1) used the MCCB, and one-half of the new studies
(eTable 11 in Supplement 1) included were conducted in 1 coun-
try (China) as compared with 25% of included studies in the
previous meta-analysis.11 Effects detected in the current study
were slightly larger (a difference of 0.08-0.33 in Cohen d). There
are several possible explanations, including increased harmo-
nization across studies and more reliable psychometrics,
although meta-regression of publication year failed to show

significance. The results are similar to those reported in chronic
schizophrenia samples1-3 and are slightly larger compared
with those observed in medicated FEP.12,13 Hence, our find-
ings corroborate the notion of cognitive impairment
as a central feature already present in the early stages of
psychotic disorders,32,33 before the introduction of antipsy-
chotic medication.

Similar to the previous meta-analysis, we observed a large
proportion of variability between studies, where I2 values and
prediction intervals show that the mean effect size can vary
considerably depending on the sample. Meta-regressions did
not reveal any strong effects of our preregistered potential
moderators. However, recruiting antipsychotic drug–naive
individuals with FEP for research is notoriously complicated,
potentially resulting in different screening and recruitment
procedures across studies, which could increase variability
between studies.

Using CVR as an outcome, we found greater within-
group variability in the patient group compared with the con-
trol group, across all cognitive domains (eDiscussion in Supple-
ment 1). This indicates a wider distribution of cognitive ability
in those with FEP compared with the normal population, mean-
ing that some may experience severe cognitive problems and
some may be relatively spared or may even be performing
above average. The results can be viewed as support for the
suggestion that patients with psychotic disorders can be di-
vided into different cognitive subgroups,16,17 which may, in
turn, share underlying biological disease mechanisms.34

Several lines of data indicate that cognitive impairment in
psychotic disorders typically starts years before psychosis
onset8-10; however, it is not clear whether the transition from
the CHR-P or prodromal stage to a psychotic syndrome is as-
sociated with further cognitive deterioration.35 In a meta-
analysis by Catalan and colleagues36 of cognitive function in

Original Investigation Research

those at CHR-P compared with healthy controls, the effect sizes
obtained were in the medium range (−0.39 to −0.51), ie, con-
siderably smaller than our results in patients with FEP. At the
same time, the variability estimates19 were consistently lower
(CVR range, 1.15-1.45 vs 1.34-1.94). Given that individuals at
CHR-P represent a heterogeneous group where only a minor-
ity of individuals will go on to develop psychosis, less severe
deficits on a group level are to be expected, whereas it may be
seen as more surprising that cognitive variability is lower than
in FEP. In addition to the individuals at CHR-P who transition
to psychosis, the FEP group is made up of the estimated 10%
who do not experience a prodrome37,38 (possibly adding more
preserved cognitive ability) as well as those individuals who
refuse to seek help before emergency services are needed39,40
(possibly adding more impaired individuals). Although inter-
preting cross-sectional data in a longitudinal context should
be done with caution, it could be speculated that the in-
creased variability may be a consequence of this addition of
more spared, and more impaired, groups of patients. A fur-
ther explanation could be that within the FEP group, there are
individuals who experience considerably more cognitive de-
cline than others during the transition to psychosis, resulting
in this even wider distribution of cognitive performance (as
compared with controls). This lends indirect support to the idea
of different cognitive trajectories leading up to and during the
transition to psychosis; however, longitudinal studies are
needed to address these questions.

Limitations
There are several limitations to address. A general concern is cog-
nitive testing of unmedicated individuals with psychosis. This
procedure provides data free from possible confounding
effects of medication but may be associated with other factors
affecting the test results, such as sleep deprivation, lack of mo-
tivation, and disruptive psychotic symptoms (although most
studies fail to find a strong association between cognition and

psychotic symptoms35). Regarding the CVR analysis, this mea-
sure depends not only on the performance and variance of the
patient group but also on the characteristics of the control group.
Controls who volunteer for research could theoretically be a se-
lected group with less variability, meaning that their similarity
would inflate the variability of the patient group. In the quality
assessment of studies, the recruitment procedure for controls
was scrutinized, and the majority of studies were reported using
community controls. This would indicate that most research-
ers have attempted to address this issue. Furthermore, CVR val-
ues may have been influenced by the factors listed previously
regarding the testing of individuals not taking medication, po-
tentially adding to the degree of variability. Psychometric fea-
tures of specific tasks used may also have contributed to our re-
sults, and tasks with lower reliability would likely result in more
variability. Finally, we aimed to study cognitive function early
in the psychotic illness process and, therefore, limited inclu-
sion to studies with a mean sample DUP of 5 years or less
(thereby excluding, eg, chronically unmedicated samples).
However, a subgroup of the studies included did not report DUP.
This is a possible limitation, although all studies included de-
fined their sample as having FEP, and the mean age of nearly
all samples would indicate a DUP of less than 5 years.

Conclusions

Results of this systematic review and meta-analysis identified
cognitive dysfunction already present at the onset of psy-
chotic illness and before initiation of antipsychotic treatment
and, for the first time (to our knowledge), revealed higher vari-
ability between individuals with FEP compared with controls.
The results highlight the importance of cognitive assessments
in clinical practice, in order to identify individuals at risk for poor
functional outcome, and to select individuals for cognitive
remediation,41,42 as part of a precision medicine approach.
