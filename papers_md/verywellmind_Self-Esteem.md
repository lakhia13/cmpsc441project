- Healthy Self-Esteem

- Low Self-Esteem

- Excessive Self-Esteem

- Self-esteem is how you see your personal value and worth.

- Healthy self-esteem helps with motivation, relationships, and understanding needs.

- Low self-esteem can lead to mental health issues like anxiety and depression.

Self-esteem is your subjective sense of overall personalworthor value. Similar to self-respect, it describes your level of confidence in your abilities and attributes.

Having healthy self-esteem can influence your motivation, your mental well-being, and your overall quality of life. However, having self-esteem that is either too high or too low can be problematic. Better understanding what your unique level of self-esteem is can help you strike a balance that is just right for you.

Key elements of self-esteem include:

- Self-confidence

- Feelings of security

- Sense of belonging

- Feeling of competence

Other terms often used interchangeably with self-esteem include self-worth, self-regard, and self-respect.

Self-esteem tends to be lowest in childhood and increases during adolescence, as well as adulthood, eventually reaching a fairly stable and enduring level. This makes self-esteem similar to the stability of personality traits over time.


## Why Self-Esteem Is Important


Self-esteem impacts your decision-making process, your relationships, your emotional health, and your overall well-being. It also influencesmotivation, as people with a healthy, positive view of themselves understand their potential and may feel inspired to take on new challenges.

Four key characteristics of healthy self-esteem are:

- A firm understanding of one's skills

- The ability to maintain healthy relationships with others as a result of having a healthy relationship with oneself

- Realistic and appropriate personal expectations

- An understanding of one's needs and the ability to express those needs

People with low self-esteem tend to feel less sure of their abilities and may doubt their decision-making process. They may not feel motivated to try novel things because they don’t believe they can reach their goals. Those with low self-esteem may have issues with relationships and expressing their needs. They may also experience low levels of confidence and feel unlovable and unworthy.

People with overly high self-esteem may overestimate their skills and may feel entitled to succeed, even without the abilities to back up their belief in themselves. They may struggle with relationship issues and block themselves from self-improvement because they are so fixated onseeing themselves as perfect.

## Theories of Self-Esteem


Many theorists have written about the dynamics involved in the development of self-esteem. The concept of self-esteem plays an important role in psychologist Abraham Maslow'shierarchy of needs, which depicts esteem as one of the basic human motivations.

Maslow suggested that individuals need both appreciation from other people and inner self-respect to build esteem. Both of these needs must be fulfilled in order for an individual to grow as a person and reachself-actualization.

It is important to note that self-esteem is a concept distinct fromself-efficacy, which involves how well you believe you'll handle future actions, performance, or abilities.


## Factors That Affect Self-Esteem


There are many factors that can influence self-esteem. Your self-esteem may be impacted by:

- Physical abilities

- Socioeconomic status

- Thought patterns

Racism and discrimination have also been shown to have negative effects on self-esteem.Additionally, genetic factors that help shape a person's personality can play a role, but life experiences are thought to be the most important factor.

It is often our experiences that form the basis for overall self-esteem. For example, low self-esteem might be caused by overly critical or negative assessments from family and friends. Those who experience what Carl Rogers referred to asunconditional positive regardwill be more likely to have healthy self-esteem.


## Healthy Self-Esteem


There are some simple ways to tell if you have healthy self-esteem. You probably have healthy self-esteem if you:

- Avoid dwelling onpast negative experiences

- Believe you are equal to everyone else, no better and no worse

- Express your needs

- Have apositive outlookon life

- Say nowhen you want to

- See your overall strengths and weaknesses and accept them

Having healthy self-esteem can help motivate you to reach your goals, because you are able to navigate life knowing that you are capable of accomplishing what you set your mind to. Additionally, when you have healthy self-esteem, you are able toset appropriate boundariesin relationships and maintain ahealthy relationshipwith yourself and others.


## Low Self-Esteem


Low self-esteemmay manifest in a variety of ways. If you have low self-esteem:

- You may have an intense fear of failure.

- You may struggle withconfidence.

Low self-esteem has the potential to lead to a variety of mental health disorders, including anxiety disorders and depressive disorders. You may also find it difficult to pursue your goals and maintain healthy relationships. Having low self-esteem can seriously impact your quality of life and increases your risk for experiencing suicidal thoughts.

## Excessive Self-Esteem


Overly high self-esteem is often mislabeled asnarcissism, however there are somedistinct traitsthat differentiate these terms.
