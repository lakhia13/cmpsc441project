fi bromyalgia: addressing stress by emotional 
exposure, processing, and resolution

Abstract
I comment on the well-designed trial by Alda and 
colleagues reported in a recent issue of Arthritis 
Research and Therapy which demonstrated some 
benefi ts of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for 
fi bromyalgia (FM). CBT in this and other studies 
provides statistically signifi cant but rather modest 
benefi ts for FM. This may be because CBT does not 
directly address the high rates of victimization, post-
traumatic stress disorder, and emotional avoidance 
experienced by a substantial number of patients with 
FM. Interventions that encourage emotional exposure, 
processing, and resolution of stressful or traumatic 
experiences and relationships hold potential for larger 
eff ects for many patients and need to be tested.

Alda  and  colleagues  [1]  present  a  well-designed  and 
implemented 
(RCT)  comparing 
cognitive-behavioral  therapy  (CBT),  pharmacotherapy, 
and  treatment-as-usual  for  patients  with  ﬁ bromyalgia 
(FM).  I  commend  their  inclusion  of  a  pharmacotherapy 
comparison, assessment of mediators and outcomes, and 
6-month  follow-up.  CBT  improved  several  outcomes, 
adding to a growing literature supporting CBT for FM.

But how well does CBT work for FM? A critical look at 
this and similar studies shows that the beneﬁ ts - although 
non-zero - are rather modest clinically. Th  e largest eﬀ ects 
in  this  study  (approximately  one  standard  deviation 
compared  with  treatment-as-usual)  were  for  pain  catas-
tro phizing and acceptance. But these are actually change 
processes  or  mediators  directly  targeted  by  CBT,  not 
outcomes  of  clinical  interest.  In  contrast,  there  were

moderate-sized eﬀ ects on overall FM impact and quality 
of  life,  small  eﬀ ects  on  depression  and  anxiety,  and  -  of 
greatest  concern  -  no  eﬀ ects  on  pain.  Th  ese  results  are 
generally  consistent  with  recent  meta-analyses  [2,3], 
which report non-zero but rather modest beneﬁ ts of CBT 
for  FM.  Overall,  it  appears  that  only  a  minority  of  FM 
patients  -  perhaps  one-third  -  demon strate  clinically 
meaningful  improvement  from  CBT  and  other  psycho-
logical/behavioral interventions [4].

Are small to moderate eﬀ ects and a minority of patients 
improving  the  limit  of  eﬀ ectiveness  of  psychological 
interventions  for  FM?  Do  genetics,  long-term  central 
nervous system sensitization, and socioeconomic contin-
gencies simply ‘account for more variance’ and trump the 
inﬂ uence of psychological processes? Perhaps, but I argue 
that we do not yet know, because our intervention eﬀ orts 
have not been guided by the larger literatures on eﬀ ective 
psychological  therapies  and  pathological  processes  in 
FM.

I  ﬁ nd  a  tendency,  especially  in  medical  settings,  to 
equate CBT with ‘eﬀ ective psychological therapy’ and to 
contrast  it  with  one  alternative  -  ‘talk  therapy’.  Th  is  is 
incorrect.  CBT  is  one  of  many  psychological  inter ven-
tions  that  have  proliferated  over  the  past  few  decades, 
many  of  which  are  active,  time-limited,  and  -  most 
importantly  -  beneﬁ cial.  Furthermore,  psycho therapy 
research  has  identiﬁ ed  general  processes  that  predict 
positive  outcomes  across  a  range  of  psychological 
therapies.  Five  such  processes  are:  a)  providing  a  new 
rationale  for  the  problem  and  how  to  change  it;  b) 
teaching symptom and self-management skills; c) experi-
encing and processing avoided emotions and memories; 
d) encouraging behaviors that have been avoided, usually 
due to negative emotions (for example, fear, guilt); and e) 
providing a supportive therapeutic relationship that also 
corrects 
interpersonal  expectations  [5].  Th  e 
primary  focus  of  CBT  for  FM  is  providing  the  rationale 
of,  and  teaching  cognitive  and  behavioral  skills  for, 
symptom  management.  CBT  for  pain  typically  does  not

‘open  up’  negative  emotions,  encourage  previously 
avoided  emotional  experiences  (except  pain  exposure 
exercises,  which  are  probably  helpful),  or  use  the  thera-
peutic relationship as a change vehicle.

How  is  this  relevant  to  FM?  Many  studies  have  found 
elevated rates of trauma, victimization, and interpersonal 
conﬂ ict among people with FM - at least among patients 
actively  seeking  treatment  [6].  Such  trauma  and  the 
subsequent avoidance of emotional processing lead to the 
increased post-traumatic stress disorder found in FM [7]. 
Suppressed and dysregulated anger, emotional unaware-
ness  and  confusion,  and  reactivity  to  interpersonal 
conﬂ ict are increased in FM. Th  e elevated pain catastro-
phizing targeted by Alda and colleagues [1] encompasses 
rumination,  helplessness,  and  somatic  magniﬁ cation  - 
common consequences of unresolved stress.

Should we target for treatment the unresolved stress in 
patients  with  FM?  If  so,  how?  Interestingly,  eﬀ ective 
treatments for trauma and post-traumatic stress disorder, 
which  encourage  experiencing,  expressing,  and  process-
ing of stress-related emotional memories, remain largely 
untested  for  those  FM  patients  who  have  victimization 
histories  and  emotional  avoidance  [8].  Th  ere  are  a 
handful  of  small  trials  indicating  the  beneﬁ ts  to  people 
with  FM  of  private  writing  about  stress,  group  therapy 
for  enhancing  emotional  awareness,  and 
individual 
therapy  targeting  unresolved  stressors  [9].  It  is  note-
worthy  that  Alda  and  colleagues  actually  included  two 
ancillary  exercises  that  activate  avoided  emotions  - 
expressive  writing  and  assertive  communication.  I 
applaud this, but encourage testing of interventions that 
have emotional processing as a primary target.

Perhaps we fear that patients will respond negatively to 
such  an  intervention  -  rejecting  it,  feeling  stigmatized, 
and having increased symptoms. Such interventions also 
are  emotionally  challenging  for  therapists.  We  should 
not,  however, 
fears  prompt  avoidance  of 
potentially  adaptive  experiences.  Colleagues  and  I  are 
testing an intervention that has FM patients confront and 
process avoided emotional experiences and relationships, 
and are comparing it to CBT and an educational control. 
We  do  not  yet  know  this  intervention’s  eﬀ ects,  how  it 
compares with CBT, and importantly - given the hetero-
geneity  of  FM  -  which  patients  beneﬁ t  most  from  each 
approach [10]. However, our initial observations are that 

almost all of our patients acknowledge that stress contri-
butes  to  their  FM  symptoms,  and  patients  ﬁ nd  that 
confronting  avoided  emotions  immediately  inﬂ uences 
their pain, which powerfully demonstrates the relevance 
of  their  emotions.  I  encourage  researchers,  clinicians, 
and patients to be courageous and develop, test, and - if 
empirically  supported  -  implement  interventions  that 
directly address the unresolved stressors experienced by 
many patients with FM.
