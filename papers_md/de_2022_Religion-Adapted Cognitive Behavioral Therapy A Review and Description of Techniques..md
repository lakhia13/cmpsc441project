Abstract
Systematic reviews have shown the efficacy of religion-adapted cognitive behavio-
ral  therapy  (R-CBT);  however,  many  clinicians  lack  practical  knowledge  of  these 
protocols. We describe here the techniques of religious adaptation to CBT that have 
proved  effective.  We  selected  randomized  clinical  trials  comparing  R-CBT  with 
control conditions in clients with a diagnosis of a psychiatric disorder and extracted 
the  information  from  their  adapted  manuals.  The  most  frequent  religious  adapta-
tions  were  the  integration  of  religious  content  to  perform  cognitive  restructuring, 
psychoeducation and motivation; engagement in religious activities such as behav-
ioral activation, meditation, or prayer to help cognitive restructuring, using religious 
values and coping strategies. A description of these techniques is presented here, as 
well as some practical examples.

Introduction

There is growing recognition of the need to make an effort to adapt culturally effec-
tive  interventions  to  offer  evidence-based  interventions  that  are  more  humanized 
and focused on the individual (Kirmayer & Ban, 2013) as well as to address relig-
iosity  and  spirituality  in  clinical  practice  and  in  psychotherapy  (Moreira-Almeida 
et  al.,  2014,  2016).  Spirituality  is  about  the  personal  search  for  existential  mean-
ing,  the  sacred  and  transcendent,  while  religiosity  refers  to  the  organized  system 
of  beliefs,  practices,  and  rituals  which  seek  to  bring  the  individual  closer  to  the

sacred or transcendent (Moreira-Almeida & Koenig, 2006). Religion-adapted cogni-
tive behavioral therapy (R-CBT) involves  the adaptation of secular  CBT  protocols 
through the use of patients’ religious content, to be more sensitive and client cen-
tered.  Consistent  evidence  suggests  religion-adapted  psychotherapy  protocols  can 
be  as  effective  (Lim  et  al.,  2014),  or  even  more  effective  than  standard  protocols 
(Anderson et al., 2015). This effect seems to be independent of the therapist’s own 
religiosity. Interestingly, one study found the spiritually adapted protocol conducted 
by  non-religious  therapists  was  more  effective  than  when  conducted  by  religious 
therapists (Propst et al., 1992).

The relationship between religion and psychotherapy is relevant because religious 
beliefs  and  practices  are  often  central  to  how  religious  clients  create  meaning  in 
their lives (Pargament, 2011), implementing coping resources and developing resil-
ience (Zimpel et al., 2015). Conversely, at times, religion can also be the cause of 
conflict or suffering, resulting in mental health problems (Johnson et al., 2007). The 
integration of religiousness and psychotherapy can further improve the therapeutic 
relationship,  bolster  adherence  to  treatment  and  improve  the  individual’s  capacity 
to deal with suffering (Martins & Moreira-Almeida, 2018). Moreover, research also 
shows  that  most  clients  want  clinicians  to  address  religious  issues  in  their  general 
sessions of psychiatry (Baetz et al., 2004) and psychotherapy (Post & Wade, 2009). 
These  findings  are  supported  by  the  recent  Position  Statement  on  religiosity  and 
spirituality  from  the  World  Psychiatry  Association  which  proposes  a  careful  con-
sideration of clients’ religious beliefs and practices, regardless of the professional’s 
beliefs  (Moreira-Almeida  et  al.,  2016).  For  these  reasons,  religiosity  should  be 
regularly and routinely assessed and addressed in psychotherapy (Moreira-Almeida 
et al., 2014, 2016).

Several recent systematic reviews of dozens of randomized controlled trials have 
found  that  religion-adapted  psychotherapy  is  at  least  as  effective  as  conventional 
psychotherapy for mental disorders (Anderson et al., 2015; Gonçalves et al., 2015; 
Hook et al., 2010; Lim et al., 2014; Post & Wade, 2009; Worthington et al., 2011). 
Cognitive  behavioral  therapy  (CBT)  is  the  most  frequently  investigated  religion-
adapted psychotherapy and possesses robust proof of efficacy (Pearce, 2016). How-
ever, translating this knowledge into the actual practice of psychotherapy can be a 
challenge, since it is not always self-evident which religious adaptations were made 
to  the  CBT  protocols.  Knowledge  of  these  changes  is  essential  for  clinicians  who 
want  to  use  these  evidence-based  protocols  in  the  care  of  their  clients,  as  well  as 
for researchers who want to investigate the active ingredients of R-CBT. Consistent 
with the need for culturally based interventions (Kirmayer & Ban, 2013), the objec-
tive of the present study is to identify and describe the changes made to CBT proto-
cols in order to accommodate religiosity. For this study, we included papers assess-
ing R-CBT using a randomized control trial design for psychiatric disorders, since 
randomized control trials are the gold standard for assessing treatment efficacy.

Methods

Firstly,  we  reviewed  studies  included  in  three  previous  reviews  on  religious-
adapted  psychotherapy,  two  of  which  were  systematic  reviews  (Anderson  et  al., 
2015;  Hook  et  al.,  2010;  Lim  et  al.,  2014).  We  initially  relied  on  these  three 
reviews because they were the most recently published studies. In addition, three 
different  reviews  were  considered  to  assemble  a  broader  range  of  studies,  thus 
reducing the chances of missing any articles prior to 2014. The studies conducted 
by  Lim  et  al.  (2014)  and  Anderson  et  al.  (2015)  were  both  systematic  reviews, 
but Anderson et al. (2015) only included studies relating to anxiety and depres-
sion,  while  Lim  et  al.  (2014)  covered  all  mental  disorders,  except  for  substance 
use. Moreover, these studies appraised different databases. Although Hook et al. 
(2010) was not a systematic review, they did include studies assessing religious-
adapted  psychotherapy  for  general  psychological  problems  such  as  unforgiving-
ness, eating disorders, schizophrenia, alcoholism, anger, and marital issues.

We then performed a review of randomized clinical trials that have been pub-
lished in peer-reviewed journals, comparing R-CBT with secular CBT or control 
conditions (e.g., waiting list, placebo, or treatment-as-usual) in clients diagnosed 
with a psychiatric disorder. Since the three reviews included studies up to Janu-
ary  2014,  we  performed  a  web  search  using  PubMed,  EMBASE,  the  Cochrane 
Library and PsycINFO databases covering the period from January 2013 to May 
2019.  We  used  the  following  search  terms:  (spirit*  OR  relig*  OR  faith*)  AND 
(CBT  OR  “cognitive  behavioral”  OR  “cognitive  behavioural”  OR  “cognitive 
therapy”) AND (“clinical trial” OR “randomized controlled trial” OR “controlled 
clinical trial”). We chose these three terms (spirit* OR relig* OR faith*) because 
they  cover  various  ways  to  refer  to  what  we  are  calling  R-CBT,  e.g.,  faith/reli-
gious/spiritual-adapted  CBT,  spiritually  integrated  CBT,  religious  CBT,  reli-
gious/spiritual  therapies,  etc.  We  used  the  terms  ending  with  an  "*"  to  include 
their  derivatives;  for  example,  religio*  includes  religiosity,  religion,  religious, 
etc. Once we had located all the studies satisfying our inclusion criteria, we then 
contacted  all  authors  and  co-authors  to  obtain  the  R-CBT  manuals  used  in  the 
clinical trials.

We  only  included  randomized  clinical  trials  since  this  design  permits  the 
reduction in bias when testing new treatments and is considered the gold standard 
for assessing the efficacy of interventions and studies assessing R-CBT in clients 
diagnosed with a psychiatric disorder. Exclusion criteria were as follows: partici-
pants with a medical illness, though without a psychiatric disorder; internet-based 
interventions; and contextual therapies (like mindfulness or acceptance and com-
mitment therapy). Under cognitive-behavior intervention, we included all studies 
that  referred  to  their  interventions  as  techniques  adapted  to  standard  cognitive 
behavior techniques. Texts in languages other than English, Portuguese and Span-
ish were excluded.

Data  concerning  the  description  of  R-CBT  were  extracted,  as  well  as  data 
about the primary mental health disorder, sample size, type of control group, and 
primary  outcomes.  Adapted  CBT  techniques  were  extracted  from  the  published

clinical trials, and the manuals were sent by the authors and co-authors. We asked 
for permission to cite any manuals that were not published. This study focused on 
the description of adapted CBT techniques.

Results

Two  hundred  and  thirty-seven  papers  published  between  2013  and  2017  were 
screened  (Cochrane = 89,  PubMed = 38,  Embase = 107,  Psycinfo = 3),  of  which 
seven  were  assessed  for  eligibility.  Only  one  was  included  in  this  study  (Koenig 
et  al.,  2015a,  2015b)  since  five  studies  were  different  analyses  conducted  on  the 
same  sample  (Koenig  et  al.,  2014,2015a,2016a,  2016b;  Pearce  et  al.,  2015a)  and 
one  did  not  satisfy  the  definition  of  a  randomized  clinical  trial  (Koenig,  2014b). 
See Fig. 1 for the PRISMA flowchart which depicted the phases of this systematic 
review. Other 10 studies were extracted from the prior reviews (up to and including

January 2014) (Anderson et al., 2015; Hook et al., 2010; Lim et al., 2014). However, 
we were unable to retrieve one of the papers for analysis (Johnson et al., 1994). The 
final sample consisted of 10 studies (Armento, 2011; Bowland et al., 2012; Ebrahimi 
et  al.,  2013;  Johnson  &  Ridley,  1992;  Koenig  et  al.,  2015b;  Pecheur  &  Edwards, 
1984; Propst et al., 1992; Propst, 1980; Razali et al., 2002; Zhang et al., 2002).

We  were  able  to  obtain  six  manuals  from  the  10  papers  included  (Bowland 
et al., 2012; Koenig et al., 2015b; Pecheur & Edwards, 1984; Propst, 1980; Propst 
et  al.,  1992;  Zhang  et  al.,  2002).  Content  concerning  the  techniques  in  the  other 
four  papers  was  extracted  from  the  description  of  the  intervention  reported  in  the 
paper describing the clinical trial. See Table 1 for more details on the clinical trials 
included in this work.

Depressive  disorder  was  the  most  frequently  studied  mental  health  disor-
der  in  these  clinical  trials  (seven  studies)  (Armento,  2011;  Ebrahimi  et  al.,  2013; 
Johnson & Ridley, 1992; Koenig et al., 2015b; Pecheur & Edwards, 1984; Propst, 
1980;  Propst  et  al.,  1992).  In  addition  to  major  depression  investigated  in  five  tri-
als,  Koenig  et  al.,(2015a,  2015b)  studied  R-CBT  in  chronic  medical  illness  with 
comorbid depression (Koenig et al., 2015b) and Ebrahimi et al. (2013) focused on 
Dysthymic  Disorder  (Ebrahimi  et  al.,  2013).  Two  other  studies  assessed  R-CBT 
in  Generalized  Anxiety  Disorder  (Razali  et  al.,  2002;  Zhang  et  al.,  2002)  and  one 
in  Posttraumatic  Stress  Disorder  (Bowland  et  al.,  2012).  All  studies  assessed  the 
symptoms  of  the  target  disorder.  Other  investigated  outcomes  were  clinical  sever-
ity (Pecheur & Edwards, 1984; Propst et al., 1992), response and remission (Koenig 
et  al.,  2015a,  2015b),  quality  of  life  (Armento,  2011),  coping  style  (Zhang  et  al., 
2002),  self-concept  and  hopelessness  (Pecheur  &  Edwards,  1984),  personality  and 
neuroticism (Zhang et al., 2002), trait anxiety (Armento, 2011), automatic thoughts 
and values (Johnson & Ridley, 1992), social adjustment (Propst et al., 1992), dys-
functional depressive attitudes (Ebrahimi et al., 2013), physical functioning (Koenig 
et  al.,  2015b)  and  environmental  reward  (Armento,  2011).  All  these  studies  were 
published in the English language.

Initial Considerations

Eight of the 10 studies supplied an adapted CBT for religious clients. However, one 
study  randomized  a  secular  treatment  and  a  religiously  adapted  treatment  for  reli-
gious  and  non-religious  clients  (Razali  et  al.,  2002),  while  another  study  included 
two atheist clients (one in the R-CBT group) (Armento, 2011). One of these studies 
reported a positive outcome only for religious clients (Razali et al., 2002). Seven of 
the  10  protocols  explicitly  instructed  therapists  to  respect  clients’  religious  beliefs 
and opposed attempts to proselytize (Armento, 2011; Bowland et al., 2012; Koenig 
et  al.,  2015a,  2015b;  Propst,  1980;  Propst  et  al.,  1992;  Razali  et  al.,  2002;  Zhang 
et al., 2002). The goal of R-CBT is to use the client’s own religious beliefs, values, 
teachings, and practices to help resolve mental health issues. Therapists do not need 
to share the beliefs of their clients to administer spiritually adapted protocols.

Except for Bowland et al. (2012) and Propst (1980), all protocols were offered 
individually rather than in groups. In general, the duration of the sessions varied

from  45  to  90  min,  offered  on  a  weekly  basis,  and  the  number  of  sessions  var-
ied from eight to 12 (Bowland et al., 2012; Ebrahimi et al., 2013; Koenig et al., 
2015b; Pecheur & Edwards, 1984; Propst, 1980; Propst et al., 1992). Some pro-
tocols  were  briefer,  consisting  of  two  (Armento, 2011)  to  six  sessions  (Johnson 
&  Ridley,  1992)  over  two  (Armento,  2011)  to  three  weeks  (Johnson  &  Ridley, 
1992).  The  protocol  advocated  by  Zhang  et  al.  (2002)  consisted  of  one  month 
of weekly sessions and five months of biweekly sessions. One study offered the 
intervention by phone and online (Koenig et al., 2015a, 2015b).

Below, we explore the adapted interventions from the perspective of the clini-
cal  practice.  We  classified  the  interventions  as  Adapted  Assessment,  Adapted 
Psychoeducation, Adapted Motivational Strategies, Adapted Behavioral Interven-
tions,  Life  Values  and  Adapted  Cognitive  Interventions.  We  chose  this  classifi-
cation system as we believe it provides clinicians with information about which 
adaptations have supporting research in order to guide the adaptations clinicians 
might use in their practices. The information can also be used by researchers who 
want to study new protocols or components of R-CBT. See Table 2 for a summary 
of the interventions. 

Adapted Assessment

The CBT assessment aims to collect information about the client to develop a for-
mulation of the case and create a cognitive concept about the client, to diagnose 
disorders, explain the cognitive and behavioral model, explain the treatment, and 
create a treatment plan (Beck et al., 2013). A spiritually adapted assessment adds 
to  a  standard  clinical  assessment  of  the  religious/spiritual  history  of  a  client  to 
better  understand  the  relationship  between  a  client’s  religious  beliefs,  practices, 
and values and the problem presented. With this objective, one study invited cli-
ents  to  clarify  their  religious/spiritual  experiences  as  well  as  their  involvement 
in  religious  activities  in  the  community  and  in  private  (Armento,  2011).  If  cli-
ents  were  atheist  or  agnostic,  they  were  invited  to  describe  this  experience  too 
(Armento, 2011). This protocol also encourages the therapist to consult specific 
literature  about  a  client’s  religion  (Armento,  2011).  The  manuals  produced  by 
Koenig  et  al.,  (2015a,  2015b)  encourage  therapists  to  identify  the  religious  lan-
guage  and  symbols  used  by  the  client.  In  the  first  section  of  the  Bowland  et  al. 
manual, individuals discuss their understanding of spirituality and their religious 
and  spiritual  experiences,  both  positive  and  negative.  The  therapists  define  the 
experiential dimensions of spirituality and religion as synonymous, but state that 
religion is related to an institution (Bowland et al. manual). Therapists also define 
religious and spiritual coping, both positive and negative, so that individuals can 
identify their own positive spiritual resources (Bowland et al. manual). There fol-
lows an example of a question about experiences of religiousness (Bowland et al. 
manual, p.6):

What aspect of your spiritual life has been most important to you? What has 
been most helpful? Least helpful?

Adapted Psychoeducation

In  each  of  the  protocols,  the  initial  sessions  are  designed  to  evaluate  the  client 
and provide psychoeducation about the cognitive behavioral model and the disor-
der, as well as to introduce the treatment rationale. Psychoeducation is an essen-
tial part of CBT since the objective of CBT is to help the clients develop abilities 
so they can become their own therapist, to use these abilities to modify cognition, 
emotions  and  behavior  (Wright  et  al.,  2008).  Thus,  the  rationale  for  integrating 
religiousness into CBT can also be provided in these initial sessions. Some proto-
cols provide explicit information to clients about the benefits of religion in reduc-
ing  anxiety  and  depressive  symptoms  (Armento, 2011;  Zhang  et  al., 2002).  For 
example,  Armento’s  manual  instructs  the  therapist  to  provide  information  about 
the  benefits  of  religiosity  through  studies  showing  the  association  between  reli-
gious  activity  and  lower  levels  of  depression  (Armento, 2011).  Also,  the  Zhang 
et al. manual presents the client with research evidence involving studies assess-
ing Taoist principles, for alleviating symptoms of anxiety and worry and improv-
ing the quality of life.

In addition to providing the customary CBT psychoeducation, some protocols 
also discuss religious theories for the formation of mental health symptoms (Bow-
land et al., 2012; Ebrahimi et al., 2013; Pecheur & Edwards, 1984; Propst, 1980; 
Propst  et  al.,  1992;  Razali  et  al.,  2002).  Pecheur  and  Edwards  (1984)  reviewed 
biblical teachings about the self, the world and the future with Christian clients 
suffering from depression. The relationship between mental health and religious-
ness, the use of religiousness for coping (Armento, 2011), the role of prayer and 
faith  (Koenig  et  al.,  2015b),  and  the  value  of  spiritual  coping  (Bowland  et  al., 
2012) were also introduced by some manuals.

The client’s beliefs were also used to explain the therapeutic rationale (Ebra-
himi  et  al.,  2013;  Koenig  et  al.,  2015a,  2015b;  Pecheur,  1980;  Propst,  1980; 
Propst et al., 1992). Many religions teach that our thoughts, behaviors, and emo-
tions are interconnected and therefore influence each other. See below an example 
of the relationship between cognition, feelings, and behavior:

The ancient Greek word “metanoia” literally means to “change your mind” 
or  “change  how  you  think,”  which  the  Bible  translated  as  “repent.”  Thus, 
changing the way we think (i.e., repenting in Christian language) is a bibli-
cal concept (Matthew 4:17) (Pearce et al., 2015a, 2015b).

The importance of becoming an observer of one’s own thoughts and the idea 
that thought modification is a therapeutic mechanism are concepts found in sev-
eral world religions’ sacred texts. An example from Christianity (Pecheur, 1980):

And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing 
of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and per-
fect, will of God (Romans 12:2).

See Table 2 for a summary of adapted initial interventions.

Adapted Motivational Strategies

Specifically, motivational interviewing is a tool to help clients recognize their prob-
lems  and  do  something  to  modify  them.  It  is  especially  useful  for  clients  who  are 
ambivalent about change (Miller & Rollnick, 2001). Thus, religious content can be 
used to motivate clients to better engage with their treatment. Specific teachings of 
many religious traditions, such as “life has a purpose” and “God expects individu-
als  to  improve  themselves,”  can  motivate  religious  clients  to  strongly  engage  with 
their  treatment.  Propst’s  manual,  for  example,  uses  specific  examples  of  Christ  to 
motivate  depressive  clients  to  develop  positive  activities  and  to  adopt  more  asser-
tive behavior, social skills, and goal setting (Propst, 1980; Propst et al., 1992). See 
Table 2 for a summary of adapted, motivational strategies.

The Koenig et al. manual provided two examples of how therapists can use a cli-
ent’s religious beliefs to help motivate them to engage with their treatment (Pearce 
et al., 2015a, 2015b):

For  monotheistic  clients:  “…therapists  emphasize  that  there  are  many  things 
God  asks  people  to  do  that  they  don’t  necessarily  feel  like  doing.  People  do 
these things because they believe that a loving God would only ask them to do 
things that are ultimately for their benefit.” (Pearce et al., 2015b, p.8).
For Jewish clients: “An effective way to change our mood is to engage in pleas-
ant activities. One of the first steps in changing our perceptions and negative 
thoughts  is  to  begin  to  see  the  good  things  in  our  environment  and  to  make 
some  of  them  a  part  of  our  daily  activity.  This  idea  is  consistent  with  Torah 
thought.” (Pearce et al., 2015b, p.8).

Adapted Behavioral Interventions

Religious Activities

Religious activities can be performed privately or in a faith community. Most pro-
tocols  explicitly  suggested  the  use  of  private  religious  activities,  such  as  praying 
for  self  and  others,  reading  religious  texts  and  meditating  on  religious  passages 
(Armento,  2011;  Bowland  et  al.,  2012;  Ebrahimi  et  al.,  2013;  Johnson  &  Ridley, 
1992; Koenig et al., 2015b; Razali et al., 2002). Faith community activities, such as 
seeking support by joining a spiritual group, spending time with members of one’s 
faith community, participating in study groups and engaging in charitable activities, 
were also encouraged (Bowland et al., 2012; Koenig et al., 2015b). See Table 2 for a 
summary of adapted behavioral interventions.

Armento  (2011)  developed  a  Behavioral  Activation  protocol  by  fostering  reli-
gious behaviors. Behavioral Activation consists of a simple procedure in which the 
therapist engages the clients in a process of change and encourages activity (Wright 
et al., 2008). It is essential for most depressive clients (Beck et al., 2013), and usu-
ally, it is already implemented in the initial sessions (Wright et al., 2008). Armento’s 
protocol  comprises  two  sessions.  In  the  first  session,  clients  were  helped  to  better 

1 3Journal of Religion and Health (2022) 61:443–466 

455

understand  their  symptoms  and  how  their  religious  beliefs  impacted  their  mental 
health (Armento, 2011). This protocol used the Serenity Prayer to engage clients to 
change what they can change and to accept what they cannot:

God, give me grace to accept with serenity the things that cannot be changed, 
Courage  to  change  the  things  which  should  be  changed,  and  the  Wisdom  to 
distinguish  the  one  from  the  other.  Living  one  day  at  a  time,  Enjoying  one 
moment at a time, Accepting hardship as a pathway to peace, Taking, as Jesus 
did, This sinful world as it is, Not as I would have it, Trusting that You will 
make all things right, If I surrender to Your will, So that I may be reasonably 
happy in this life, And supremely happy with You forever in the next. Amen 
(Niebuhr, 1951).

Then, they began the process of religious activation by adding religious activities 
to  behavioral  activation  (Armento,  2011).  As  mentioned  above,  this  protocol  used 
the  “Serenity  Prayer”  to  inspire  clients  to  think  about  “acceptance  versus  change” 
and to motivate them to engage with their treatment (Armento, 2011). Ways to be 
more active in the community and engage more in private religious practices were 
explored.  Clients  were  then  invited  to  engage  in  these  activities  for  the  next  two 
weeks (Armento, 2011). After the first week, clients received a phone call to check 
on their progress and to solve problems concerning the completion of their home-
work (Armento, 2011). In the second and final session, the experience and progress 
of the client were discussed (Armento, 2011). Here is the list of suggested activities 
in this protocol (Armento, 2011):

Community Activities: “attend a sacred liturgy, minister at a religious service 
or  function,  attend  a  bible  study,  attend  a  religious  social  function,  attend  a 
young  adults’  group,  speak  with  a  religious  leader,  volunteer  at  a  special 
event.”
Private Activities: “go to a peaceful place and pray privately, read the Bible, 
read a devotional book, private prayer or meditation at home, listen to prayer-
ful music, go for a walk or a hike, learn more about your faith.”

Coping Strategies

Some protocols also focus on R/S coping strategies. The Zhang et al. manual focuses 
on coping strategies to help clients with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) to act in 
accordance with their values, needs, and desires. It also teaches clients how to deal with 
worry and distress and to change the way one copes with life events based on tradi-
tional Chinese philosophical principles. To teach clients how to use religious coping 
strategies, Zhang et al. (2002) developed an “ABCDE” method of Chinese Taoist Cog-
nitive  Psychotherapy.  The  A  represents  “Actual  stress  factors”;  B,  “Belief  and  value 
system”; C, “Conflict and coping style”; D, “Doctrine direction and practice”; and E, 
“Effect evaluation and reinforcement.” In step “B,” clients classified their beliefs and 
values according to 10 identified needs: money, freedom, love, position, health, power, 
fame, friendship, family, and enjoyment. In step “C,” therapists helped clients assess 
their conflicts and coping styles using a list of commonly used coping styles in China: 

1 3456 

Journal of Religion and Health (2022) 61:443–466

“(1) to suppress or deny, (2) to express oneself openly, (3) to sublimate, (4) to abuse 
substances, (5) to vent, (6) to punish oneself, (7) to withdraw and console oneself, and 
(8) to engage in recreational activities” (Zhang et al., 2002). In step “D,” clients were 
exposed to Taoist teachings (Zhang et al., 2002):

Benefiting without hurting others and acting without striving,
Restricting selfish desires, learning to be content, and knowing how to let go,
Being in harmony with others and being humble, using softness to defeat hard-
ness, and
Person should maintain tranquility, act less, and follow the laws of nature.

Firstly, therapists explain how the principles of Taoism can help clients with GAD. 
Then, specific aspects of Taoist doctrine are taught and discussed concerning how to 
overcome  GAD.  Afterwards,  the  client  is  provided  with  psychoeducation  about  the 
rationale  of  the  adapted  treatment  and  about  Confucianism  and  Taoist  philosophy, 
including the “32-character Taoist formula”, which consists of eight principles. Clients 
are encouraged to discuss, reflect and apply each of these principles as a way of coping 
with anxiety. To reflect on these principles, chapters from the Daodejing are provided 
and explained. To assist in applying these principles in daily life, a CBT-like Thought 
Record is completed and alternate ways of coping based on Taoist principles are dis-
cussed. Many of the sessions are designed to assist clients in applying the Taoist princi-
ples to cope better with worry and stress (Zhang’s manual).

Despite individuals generally using spirituality in moments of crisis to "comprehend 
the seemingly incomprehensible and to manage the seemingly unmanageable" (Parga-
ment, 2011), sometimes the spiritual dimension can also be a field of conflict and suf-
fering (Pargament, 2011). With the intention of modifying the use of negative religious 
coping strategies, Bowland et al. (2012) helped clients restructure their interpretations 
of traumatic experiences. They provided psychoeducation about positive coping strate-
gies and negative religious coping strategies (Bowland et al., 2012). Spiritual histories 
of  traumatized  women  were  reviewed  and  alternative  interpretations  were  suggested 
based on the Christian scriptures (Bowland et al., 2012). In Session 3 of this manual 
(Bowland et al., 2012), clients’ religious coping strategies are identified, both positive 
and negative, and positive  coping  strategies are  encouraged.  Also, steps to deal with 
spiritual struggles are actively developed by each group member.

In  addition,  emotions  and  feelings  that  arise  from  a  traumatic  event,  like  anger, 
fear,  powerlessness,  shame,  guilt,  loneliness,  or  despair,  can  be  difficult  to  accept  in 
some religious traditions. As such, each of these feelings is discussed in sessions 4 to 
8 and positive religious coping strategies to deal with these emotions are explored and 
encouraged.

Life Values

Most religions promote values like forgiveness, generosity, altruism, and compas-
sion. Research shows that acting in accordance with one’s values is important for 

1 3Journal of Religion and Health (2022) 61:443–466 

457

mental  health  (VanderWeele,  2017).  Several  of  the  manuals  explore  the  client’s 
values.

Bowland  et  al.  (2012)  adapted  a  pre-existing  protocol  (Trauma  Recovery  and 
Empowerment Model) for traumatized Christian clients, applied in a group (Bow-
land et al., 2012). In Session 2, qualities like discernment, forgiveness, and trust 
were  discussed  and  clients  identified  these  values  as  something  that  they  either 
had or desired more of in their lives (Bowland et al., 2012). Also, the literature 
concerning forgiveness and health was explicitly discussed during the treatment, 
to  encourage  forgiveness  (Bowland  et  al.,  2012).  To  assess  these  spiritual  “vir-
tues,” a list of spiritual gifts was provided (Bowland’s manual, p.19):

Acceptance,  Accountability,  Believing,  Blessing,  Centeredness,  Clarity, 
Commitment,  Compassion,  Connection,  Contentment,  Courage,  Detach-
ment,  Discernment,  Discipline,  Faith,  Forgiveness,  Gratitude,  Guidance, 
Healing, Joy, Kindness, Leadership, Love, Meditative, Mercifulness, Mirac-
ulous,  Patience,  Peacefulness,  Praise,  Prayerfulness,  Prosperity,  Purpose, 
Serenity, Teaching, Tolerance, Trust, Understanding, Wisdom.

Subsequently, the group was encouraged to develop its own list and to assess 
how these virtues are present in their daily lives (Bowland’s manual). In the last 
three  sessions,  forgiveness,  hope,  vision,  and  healing  were  assessed,  since  reli-
giousness can help trauma survivors recover and develop these values. In terms of 
forgiveness, for example, clients were invited to define forgiveness and to distin-
guish it from the idea of “letting go,” recognizing it can be difficult for survivors 
to forgive the aggressor. The Bowland et al. manual also describes the work as a 
“spiritual  journey”  where  trauma  survivors  overcome  their  trauma  for  the  long 
term. Religious resources for healing are assessed and how to use these resources 
and create a healing space is encouraged. The group ended with a reflection such 
as the “Prayer of Loving Kindness” (Bowland’s manual, p.18):

May you dwell in the heart
May you be free from suffering
May you be healed
May you be at Peace.

The Zhang et al. manual also uses clients’ values as an important part of the 
therapy  by  introducing  the  concept  of  values,  assessing  the  client’s  values  and 
determining  to  what  extent  they  are  living  by  these  values  (Zhang  et  al., 2002). 
The  client’s  values  are  assessed  through  open-ended  questions  and  by  using  the 
Valued Living Questionnaire, both of which are used to contrast a client’s stated 
values with how much he/she has complied with them. Afterwards, clients exam-
ine conflicts between what they value and how they are behaving and are encour-
aged to develop strategies to act in greater compliance with their stated values.

Koenig  et  al.,  (2015a,  2015b)  also  included  in  their  protocol  values  such  as 
forgiveness,  meaning  and  purpose,  gratefulness,  gratitude,  altruism,  and  social 
engagement  and  did  so  based  on  the  specific  religious  teachings  of  the  clients 
(Koenig  et  al.,  2015b).  They  explicitly  encouraged  clients  to  practice  exercises 

1 3458 

Journal of Religion and Health (2022) 61:443–466

in gratitude and to act with altruism and generosity toward others (Koenig et al., 
2015b; Koenig, 2014a).

Adapted Cognitive Interventions

Restructuring Negative Automatic Thoughts and Irrational Beliefs

The cognitive behavioral model posits that the cognition associated with the inter-
pretation  of  a  situation  leads  to  emotions,  behaviors,  and  physiological  responses 
(Beck  et  al.,  2013).  Clients  with  mental  disorders  tend  to  have  distorted  cognition 
about  neutral  or  positive  situations  (Beck  et  al.,  2013).  So,  we  must  examine  and 
correct these cognitions to achieve improvement in mental symptoms (Beck et al., 
2013). In general, cognitive restructuring involves firstly identifying distorted auto-
matic  thoughts  (i.e.,  the  flow  of  thoughts  common  to  all  of  us)  and  then  modify-
ing them using cognitive restructuring techniques (Beck et al., 2013). In the adapted 
protocols, therapists use the client’s religious rationales and values as resources for 
cognitive restructuring (Ebrahimi et al., 2013; Koenig et al., 2015b; Pecheur, 1980; 
Pecheur  &  Edwards,  1984;  Propst,  1980;  Propst  et  al.,  1992;  Razali  et  al.,  2002). 
In other words, automatic thoughts are identified and then changed using religious 
values, teachings, and beliefs. For example, protocols adapted for Christians use bib-
lical scriptures (Koenig et al., 2015b; Propst et al., 1992), while Muslim protocols 
use the Holy Qur’an and Hadith (Koenig et al., 2015b; Razali et al., 2002). Some 
examples  of  verses  from  the  Bible  that  can  be  used  in  the  cognitive  restructuring 
of Christian clients suffering from depression due to negative views of the self are 
given below:

Look at the birds of the air, for they neither sow nor reap nor gather into barns; 
yet  your  heavenly  Father  feeds  them.  Are  you  not  of  more  value  than  they? 
(Matthew 6:26) (Pecheur 1980).

Naturally, any scriptures or passages from holy texts need to be taken specifically 
from the clients’ religious tradition and need to resonate with their particular system 
of belief.

Koenig et al., (2015a, 2015b) used an adapted instrument for cognitive restructur-
ing called the “ABCD(R)E” thought log, based on Albert Ellis’s method for cogni-
tive restructuring. In their protocol, they added step “R,” which stands for religious 
beliefs  and  resources  (Koenig  et  al.,  2015b;  Pearce  et  al.,  2015a,  2015b).  In  step 
R, clients are invited to challenge their automatic thoughts with their own religious 
beliefs, values, and teachings (Koenig et al., 2015b; Pearce et al., 2015a, 2015b):

How can your view of God, your religious/spiritual worldview, religious writ-
ings, spiritual wisdom, and other sources provide evidence that challenge your 
automatic  negative  beliefs  and  beliefs  that  you  can’t  cope?  (Koenig  et  al., 
2015b; Pearce et al., 2015a, 2015b).

1 3Journal of Religion and Health (2022) 61:443–466

Below is an example, reported by this manual, of religious cognitive restructuring 

for some depressive “should and must” statements:

Buddhism Religion: “When we use the word “should,” there is generally little 
room for self-acceptance or flexibility. The Buddha taught that guidelines for 
our own behavior can be important, but that these need to come from a place 
of caring and love for others, and from a place of higher wisdom and caring for 
ourselves.  Such  wisdom  may  reflect  the  recognition  that  situations  are  often 
complex and that a single mode of action or behavior is not even desirable or 
useful. (Koenig et al., 2015b; Pearce et al., 2015a, 2015b).

Another  study  integrated  Christian  principles  into  Rational-Emotive  Therapy 
(Johnson & Ridley, 1992). In Johnson and Ridley’s manual, clients were encour-
aged  to  question  four  categories  of  depressive  irrational  beliefs  (catastrophizing 
statements;  should/ought/must;  human  worth  assessment;  and  need  statements) 
using biblical scripture rather than secular arguments (Johnson & Ridley, 1992). 
Firstly,  irrational  beliefs  are  identified  and  labeled,  as  well  as  their  triggers  and 
consequences (Johnson & Ridley, 1992). Next, clients are instructed on how these 
irrational beliefs are responsible for their emotions. They are then taught how to 
contest their irrational beliefs based on teachings from the Bible (Johnson & Rid-
ley, 1992). See below an example of a “must” statement:

I  must  be  thoroughly  competent,  adequate,  and  achieving  in  all  possible 
respects  if  I  am  to  consider  myself  worthwhile,”  would  become:  “All  of 
us have become like one who is unclean and all our righteous acts are like 
filthy rags (Isaiah 64:4) (Johnson & Ridley, 1992).

Religious Imagery Modification

Many automatic thoughts are experienced through images or mental pictures (Beck 
et al., 2013). As this is achieved by means of automatic thoughts, we can identify 
and correct these images (Beck et al., 2013). The Religious Imagery Modification 
is a cognitive technique that helps to change depressive images using religious con-
tent and combines cognitive restructuring with systematic desensitization techniques 
(i.e.,  clients  are  invited  to  restructure  their  experiences  using  religiously  based 
imagery)  (Propst,  1980;  Propst  et  al.,  1992).  Systematic  desensitization  involves 
exposure  to  the  feared  situations  in  a  hierarchical  and  gradual  way  (Wright  et  al., 
2008). In this adapted technique, clients imagine a depressive scene and the thera-
pist uses this scene to help clients become more aware of their automatic thoughts 
and distortions. Clients then meditate on an image of Christ, with the intention of 
imagining  themselves  effectively  coping  with  depressive  thoughts  (Propst,  1980; 
Propst et al., 1992).

Rather  than  using  imagery,  Koenig  et  al.,  (2015a,  2015b)  encouraged  cli-
ents to practice contemplative prayer, meditating on a specific religious passage 
to  help  clients  better  manage  negative  thinking  patterns  (Koenig  et  al.,  2015b; 
Pearce  et  al.,  2015a,  2015b).  They  instructed  clients  to  choose  a  scripture  (and 

1 3460 

Journal of Religion and Health (2022) 61:443–466

also  provided  a  sacred  passage  from  the  client’s  holy  scriptures  related  to  the 
session  content  that  the  client  could  use  during  contemplative  prayer)  (Koenig 
et al., 2015b; Pearce et al., 2015a,  2015b). They were then asked to follow these 
instructions:

Savor each phrase. What word phrase or idea speaks to you? Read the passage 
again. Where does this passage touch your life? What do you see, hear, touch, 
or  remember?  Read  the  passage  a  third  time.  Listen  quietly.  Note  insights, 
reflections,  and  personal  response  to  the  reading  in  your  journal.  Follow  the 
steps in order or go back and forth between them as you feel moved. Finish by 
waiting for a few moments in silence. (Pearce et al., 2015b, p. 20).

In Pecheur’s protocol, clients were asked to recall depressive thoughts and feel-
ings  (Pecheur  &  Edwards,  1984).  Then,  they  were  given  lists  of  religious  coping 
statements and images (Pecheur & Edwards, 1984) using Beck’s cognitive triad of 
depression (i.e., distorted and pessimistic concept of self, world, and future) (Beck, 
1976).  Clients  were  invited  to  replace  their  negative  thoughts  and  images  with 
images  such  as  visualizing  Christ  going  with  them  into  a  difficult  situation.  For 
example:  "I  can  visualize  Christ  going  with  me  into  that  difficult  situation  in  the 
future as I try to cope" (Propst, 1980).

Restructuring Negative Automatic Thoughts and Irrational Beliefs Related to Faith

In addition to restructuring distorted cognitions related to the client’s mental health 
disorder,  some  studies  encouraged  clients  to  restructure  negative  thoughts  and 
beliefs related to their faith (i.e., spiritual struggles, such as feeling that God is pun-
ishing them). More specifically, studies encouraged clients to use religious positive 
coping  strategies  (e.g.,  spiritual  beliefs  that  give  meaning  to  existential  questions 
and suffering, a secure relationship with a forgiving and acceptant God, a sense of 
spiritual connection with others) and discouraged the use of negative religious cop-
ing  strategies  (e.g.,  viewing  God  as  punishing  or  abandoning  them,  being  unable 
to forgive) (Razali et al., 2002; Zhang et al., 2002). See Table 2 for a summary of 
adapted cognitive interventions.

Discussion

To our knowledge, this is the first review paper to identify and describe R-CBT tech-
niques that have shown efficacy in randomized clinical trials in clients with mental 
health  disorders.  The  final  sample  for  this  review  consisted  of  10  studies.  In  gen-
eral,  the  protocols  combined  different  cognitive  and  behavioral  techniques  with 
religious content to help clients use their own religious beliefs and practices, rather 
than those of the therapist. The most common spiritually integrated CBT techniques 
were:  using  religious  content  to  help  restructure  automatic  thoughts  or  distorted 
beliefs (Ebrahimi et al., 2013; Johnson & Ridley, 1992; Koenig et al., 2015b; Propst 

1 3Journal of Religion and Health (2022) 61:443–466 

461

et  al.,  1992;  Razali  et  al.,  2002;  Zhang  et  al.,  2002)  and  encouraging  private  reli-
gious activities and involvement in religious community activities (Armento, 2011; 
Bowland et al., 2012; Ebrahimi et al., 2013; Johnson & Ridley, 1992; Koenig et al., 
2015b;  Razali  et  al.,  2002)  as  both  techniques  are  described  in  six  out  of  the  10 
studies.

Concerning the efficacy in clients with depressive disorder, R-CBT was superior 
to the waiting list for reducing symptoms (Ebrahimi et al., 2013; Pecheur & Edwards, 
1984; Propst, 1980; Propst et al., 1992).  Moreover, studies found that R-CBT  was 
superior to the comparison group (Armento, 2011) and pharmacotherapy (Ebrahimi 
et  al.,  2013).  When  compared  to  secular  CBT,  the  results  are  inconclusive.  Some 
studies found that R-CBT was no more effective than secular CBT (Ebrahimi et al., 
2013;  Pearce  et  al.,  2015a,  2015b;  Pecheur  &  Edwards,  1984).  Propst  et  al.  found 
that R-CBT was only superior to the waiting list for reducing depressive symptoms 
(Propst et al., 1992), but not secular CBT, and only the religious imagery group (but 
not secular CBT) showed a lower proportion of depressed individuals than the wait-
ing  list  (Propst  et  al.,  1992).  Interestingly,  Johnson  and  Ridley  (1992)  found  that 
only R-CBT reduced irrational beliefs (but not secular rational-emotive therapy).

In relation to anxiety spectrum disorders, two studies assessed R-CBT in Gener-
alized Anxiety Disorder (Razali et al., 2002; Zhang et al., 2002), and one in Post-
traumatic  Stress  Disorder  (Bowland  et  al.,  2012).  Meanwhile,  Razali  et  al.  (2002) 
compared  supportive  psychotherapy,  relaxation  exercise,  benzodiazepines,  and 
R-CBT  with  supportive  psychotherapy,  relaxation  exercise,  and  benzodiazepines, 
independently,  and  found  that  religious  clients  receiving  R-CBT  achieved  a  more 
rapid improvement in symptoms of anxiety, but there were no differences in the fol-
low-up  and  no  differences  for  non-religious  clients.  Zhang  et  al.  (2002)  compared 
R-CBT  and  R-CBT  plus  benzodiazepines  with  only  benzodiazepines  and  reported 
that  those  who  received  R-CBT  (with  or  without  benzodiazepines)  showed  better 
improvement  in  their  symptoms  when  compared  to  those  who  only  received  ben-
zodiazepines  in  the  follow-up  (6  months).  Also,  R-CBT  was  superior  to  benzodi-
azepines for improving neuroticism, an important trait associated with generalized 
anxiety disorder. Finally, in Bowland et al. (2012), R-CBT was superior to the con-
trol group for reducing depressive anxiety and somatic symptoms in women survi-
vors of trauma. However, the nature of the control group is unclear.

It  is  important  that  therapists  know  how  to  use  spiritually  integrated  therapies. 
The vast majority of the world’s population (84%) reports some religious affiliation 
and most clients want their therapist to address religiousness in their psychothera-
peutic  process  (Post  &  Wade,  2009);  moreover,  religion  has  an  impact  on  mental 
health (Koenig, 2009; Moreira-Almeida et al., 2014). Considering these issues, it is 
unethical for clinicians not to address religiousness in treatment, to paraphrase Ros-
marin in his book about addressing spirituality and religion in the practice of CBT 
(Rosmarin, 2018). A religion-adapted CBT is needed because it can make religious 
patients feel more at ease with psychotherapy and it helps the therapist to identify 
and  mobilize  R/S  resources  that  the  patient  or  his/her  environment  may  have  and 
which  may  ultimately  help  in  the  psychotherapeutic  process.  In  addition,  R-CBT 
techniques  should  not  be  used  in  a  full,  standardized  protocol,  but  they  can  and 
should  be  incorporated  into  all  kinds  of  psychotherapeutic  approaches.  However, 

1 3462 

Journal of Religion and Health (2022) 61:443–466

there  is  a  gap  between  scientific  knowledge  and  clinical  practice,  and  one  of  the 
obstacles attributed to this gap is the lack of information on how to address religi-
osity  in  practice.  Thus,  describing  psychotherapeutic  techniques  is  fundamental  to 
reducing the "how to do" gap.

R-CBT allows the therapist to include the client’s religious cognitions and prac-
tices  to  reduce  symptoms  and  improve  function.  In  addition,  maladaptive  aspects 
of  the  client’s  religiousness  that  contribute  to  suffering  may  be  the  focus  of  treat-
ment.  As  Pargament  asserted:  “when  people  walk  into  the  therapist’s  office,  they 
don’t  leave  their  spirituality  behind  in  the  waiting  room”  (Pargament,  2011).  So, 
addressing religiosity should be dealt with like other aspects of life such as culture, 
finances, race, and sexual orientation. Besides, the inclusion of these aspects dem-
onstrates respect for the culture to which our client is devoted.

However, the adaptation must be client-centered, i.e., not just the client’s religion, 
but also the way he/she understands and practices the religion should be considered. 
Moreover,  therapists  should  take  care  of  ethical  aspects  and  should  not  attempt  to 
proselytize. Again, the content used in the therapy session must be related to the cli-
ent’s faith. The therapist’s beliefs should not be considered, nor his/her materialistic 
beliefs.  The  role  of  the  therapist  should  not  be  confused  with  pastoral  counseling. 
Finally, Rosmarin also points out that the integration of religiosity into CBT must be 
determined empirically. Thus, we should evaluate its results for each client through-
out the treatment (Rosmarin, 2018).

There are a few limitations that should be noted in this review. Like studies on 
conventional  CBT,  one  important  limitation  is  that  we  do  not  know  which  strate-
gies  are  the  "active  ingredients"  that  resulted  in  a  change  in  symptoms,  since  the 
studies  evaluated  protocols  comprising  diverse  techniques.  Secondly,  most  of  the 
studies  included  did  not  report  if  they  checked  for  fidelity  to  cognitive  behavioral 
techniques.  The  term  CBT  was  perhaps  used  loosely  in  some  studies  while  other 
studies seemed to produce a better fit to the third wave of CBT, i.e., a group of inter-
ventions that focus on the process of acceptance, mindfulness, attention, and values 
(Hayes et al., 2011). A third limitation is that many of the studies did not report the 
complete protocols and/or provide examples, and we did not have access to all the 
treatment manuals. However, we did have access to six protocols and retrieved infor-
mation from the techniques in the methodological descriptions or appendices of the 
other studies.

Importantly,  most  studies  were  performed  with  Christian  clients.  Thus,  many 
examples provided are relevant for Christian clients. So, studies are lacking for dif-
ferent cultures, mainly Eastern cultures. However, despite the diversity of religions, 
many concepts and practices are similar. Thus, these adapted techniques can provide 
the basis for the treatment of clients of different religions (Rosmarin, 2018) and can 
be used as an example for new psychotherapeutic adaptations for different cultures. 
Finally,  we  only  included  studies  published  in  English,  Portuguese  and  Spanish, 
although only one study was excluded based on the language criterion.

Despite  these  limitations,  this  study  is  the  first  to  describe  adapted  interven-
tions based on a careful review of the literature, on how to integrate clients’ beliefs 
and practices into CBT in a culturally sensitive way. The compilation of this treat-
ment information makes for easy access for busy therapists who want to implement 

1 3Journal of Religion and Health (2022) 61:443–466 

463

empirically based adaptations of CBT for their religious clients. Religious-adapted 
psychotherapy is still in its early stages of  development. However, this study  does 
represent a step toward advancing spiritually integrated psychotherapy as it aims to 
help therapists develop skills in religious-adapted CBT in a more formal way (Par-
gament, 2011). Also, it is important to note that personal religiousness and spiritual-
ity  do  not  prepare  therapists  for  this  kind  of  intervention  and  therapists  should  be 
instructed  not  to  attempt  to  proselytize,  imposing  their  view  of  religion  on  clients 
(Pargament, 2011).

We  hope  that  this  review  of  spiritually  adapted  CBT  protocols  provides  practi-
cal information for clinicians to use with their religious clients and provides helpful 
information for future research on the components of these approaches.

Conclusion

Various  adapted  tools  can  be  integrated  into  CBT  to  better  tailor  the  treatment  to 
clients’ cultural values and resources. We described these techniques using the best 
evidence  available  from  reviews  of  the  manuals  used  in  clinical  trials  comparing 
R-CBT to control conditions in psychiatric settings. The inclusion of religious issues 
in  psychotherapy  is  not  only  feasible  but  also  ethical  and  must  be  implemented 
according to the wishes of each patient.
