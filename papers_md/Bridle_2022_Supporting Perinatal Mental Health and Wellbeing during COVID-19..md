Abstract: Mental health is especially important as women transition into parenthood. The COVID-
19 pandemic has necessitated the rapid reconﬁguration of maternity services, including perinatal
mental healthcare, as offered by Specialist Perinatal Mental Health Midwives, in NHS Trusts in
the United Kingdom. This article represents work undertaken in rapid response to the COVID-19
pandemic and aims to document the ﬁndings from March 2020 up until May 2021 in literature
published on perinatal mental health through the pandemic, as well as to engage in a knowledge
mapping exercise across ﬁve NHS Trusts in London. In this research, we utilised a critical review
methodology which purposefully selects and synthesises materials after extensive literature searching
to provide a broad and informed narrative around an issue. For our knowledge mapping exercise, we
utilised an inclusive stance to gather, pool, and synthesise data from ﬁve NHS Trusts regarding the
provisions and reconﬁgurations of their perinatal mental health services, creating a comparable and
translatable snapshot in time. Our rapid, critical review highlighted two themes: ‘Increased Perinatal
Distress’ and ‘Inaccessible Services and Support’. Our knowledge mapping exercise produced four
themes: ‘Retention of Existing Service Provision’; ‘Additional Services Provided’; ‘Reconﬁguration of
Service Provision’; ‘Additional Provision to Support Staff Wellbeing’. We conclude by offering best
practice guidance in order to provide shared learning to aid the transition through para-pandemic
circumstances to service delivery in a post-pandemic ‘new normal’.

Mental ill health can affect up to 20% of women at any time between pregnancy
and 12 months post birth [1], which is referred to as the perinatal period. This ranges
from mild to severe and can include a variety of illness, such as depression, bipolar
disorder, anxiety disorders, and postpartum psychosis [2]. Perinatal mental illness is more
common in women from Minority Ethnic groups [3], and a study conducted in South
London found a prevalence of mental ill health of up to 27% in women pre-COVID-19 [4].
Since these statistics represent those women who receive formal diagnoses, it is likely that
the prevalence of mental ill health in the perinatal population is much higher, with many

women going undiagnosed and without treatment or support. Mental ill health in the
perinatal period not only has devastating effects on a woman at the time they transition to
becoming a mother, but also affects those around them, including their children, partners,
family, and friends, whilst also posing a considerable ﬁnancial burden to health and social
care services [5]. The area of perinatal mental health has become a major focus of interest in
recent times, with ongoing investment in new specialist mental health services [5].

The SARS-CoV-2 (coronavirus) or COVID-19 pandemic has brought about an unprece-
dented threat to the health of the population, as well as a signiﬁcant change to daily life.
Governments across the world have imposed stay-at-home orders (or ‘lockdowns’) and
introduced physical distancing and quarantine measures in an attempt to reduce the spread
of the virus and ease the burden on hospitals and healthcare systems, which have expe-
rienced and continue to experience record high numbers of patients requiring in-patient
intensive care [6,7]. Whilst maternity services in the United Kingdom have continued to
function, the capacity at which they are delivering care has been signiﬁcantly reduced, with
the almost total cessation of continuity of care and home-birthing, reduced provision of
face-to-face antenatal and postnatal care, and limits on birth partners during labour [8].
In the early stages of the pandemic, the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists
recommended that pregnant women should ‘shield’—that is, remain at home and under
no circumstances leave unless attending a maternity care appointment, seeking urgent
medical care, or attending hospital to give birth. This was later revoked, though lately
there has been renewed concern that women in their third trimester may experience worse
outcomes if they contract COVID-19 [9]

With the worry people have experienced about becoming ill and possibly dying from
COVID-19 as well as the restrictions placed on human life, it is no wonder that “fear from
the virus is spreading even faster than the virus itself “ [10]; p. 129). For perinatal women,
the psychological distress associated with COVID-19 is expected to pose “unprecedented
challenges that can signiﬁcantly impact on women’s mental health” [11]; p. 310).

In 2018, the Royal College of Midwives (RCM) [12] released a document entitled “SPE-
CIALIST MENTAL HEALTH MIDWIVES: What they do and why they matter”. This docu-
ment highlights the role perinatal mental health midwives play in supporting mental health
in pregnancy, not just for women and families, but also for the whole multidisciplinary
team. Midwives hold the unique position of sharing information on an infant’s health right
from the beginning of a pregnancy with the families they care for. This is an area which is
sometimes forgotten in maternity, and it is crucial midwives start the conversation as early
as possible.

Prior to the pandemic, perinatal mental health midwives based in London started a
Pan-London Perinatal Mental Health Midwives Forum (L.B., L.W., T.v.d.V., O.A., and S.H.),
supported by NHS England. Meetings were held quarterly to compare how roles were
utilised, and members of the forum also acted to support one another. This helped to map
out roles in terms of what each midwife was doing and whether there was uniformity in
how they all worked—i.e., highlighting which Trusts were doing certain things, noting
any inconsistencies and similarities, and establishing a functional network to link perinatal
mental health midwives across London with those in bordering counties. This group has
now grown to over 129 midwives throughout the UK and Ireland, offering a wonderful
network of support during these unprecedented times. We hope that by sharing some of
the ways we have changed the way we have supported women, we can help you and your
service think of alternative ways to support women and families during COVID-19 and the
subsequent years, which will undoubtedly be affected by this pandemic [10].

Whilst many women will experience perinatal mental health issues, the increased
pressure of COVID-19 on both the public and healthcare services has meant that, under-
standably, maternity services have seen an increase in the incidence of poor mental health.
A previous call to action [13] asserted that now is the time to prioritise women’s mental
health in the public health and mental health communities.

Our aims in this study were therefore twofold: (1) To summarise the published
perinatal mental health research conducted in the UK since the beginning of the COVID-19
pandemic and (2) to report on ﬁve NHS Trusts’ responses to delivering perinatal mental
health care over the past year.

2. Materials and Methods

The work conducted as part of this article was carried out using a twofold method-
ology: a rapid response critical review of the perinatal mental health literature published
about COVID-19 and a knowledge mapping exercise documenting the perinatal mental
health service provision and reconﬁguration across ﬁve NHS Trusts during the COVID-
19 pandemic.

2.1. Rapid Critical Review of the Literature

The ﬁrst part of this work presents a rapid response critical review of the literature
published on perinatal mental health and COVID-19 early on during the pandemic. Critical
reviews are used purposefully to synthesise materials after extensive, but not systematic,
literature searching. In doing so, critical reviews provide a broad and informed narra-
tive around an issue worthy of discussion by drawing upon speciﬁc literature for their
speciﬁc contribution to the ﬁeld of study (Grant and Booth, 2009). The critical review
does therefore not assess for or evaluate quality, deeming all literature to contribute to the
scoped knowledge base, regardless of its credibility or merit. A critical review, therefore,
“typically manifest in a hypothesis or a model, not an answer” [14]; p. 93), more often rendering
the outcome littered with more questions or new ways of thinking than when the review
was ﬁrst started. Within the context of this article, we present literature regarding the
provision of perinatal mental health care during the COVID-19 pandemic and the effect of
the pandemic on perinatal mental health. As a group, we searched individually for articles
using literature databases and social media to gather publications related to the impact
of COVID-19 on pregnant women and people from March 2020 up until May 2021. We
searched for articles related to pregnancy, birth, the postnatal period, and COVID-19 from
all over the world, with a focus on evidence arising from the UK. We did not discriminate
on the basis of country of origin, type of article (e.g., empirical, review, theoretical), where
it had been published, or supposed quality—all in-keeping with the guidelines for critical
reviews, as explained above. We extracted any ﬁndings related to the impact of restrictions
and the virus itself on the maternal mental wellbeing and service access satisfaction. We
then met to review the papers as a group, inductively and iteratively sorting the ‘headline
information’ from each paper into broad categories, which were then broadly synthesised
before being reduced into two themes.

2.2. Local Knowledge Mapping Exercise

The second part of this work presents a knowledge mapping exercise, documenting
responses to the pandemic (regarding perinatal mental health provision by midwives)
by ﬁve NHS Trusts in London or counties bordering London in the United Kingdom.
This knowledge mapping exercise draws on Trust-level policy regarding service provision
and reconﬁguration during the pandemic. The process of knowledge mapping has been
described as proffering a mode of associating information from numerous sources with the
aim of understanding the “dynamics at play in a health system or area of work” ([15]; p. 636).
Knowledge mapping exercises are underpinned by the key principles of being “inclusive
to ensure identiﬁcation of all relevant evidence” ([16]; p. 3) whilst enabling a comparable and
translatable snapshot of data [15]. The process can be broken down into ﬁve stages of data
handling (as seen in Figure 1). It began with ‘Data Acquisition’, where we reported on
the pandemic-related service reconﬁguration by perinatal mental health midwives based
in ﬁve Trusts in and around London, the United Kingdom. The second stage involved
‘Data Reﬁnement’, where distinct thematic areas to include were agreed upon. These were:
‘Retention of Existing Service Provision’; ‘Reconﬁguration of Service Provision’; ‘Additional

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 1777

4 of 12

Provision to Support Staff’. After this, we engaged with the process of ‘Data Pooling’,
whereby data sourced from all ﬁve NHS Trusts were recorded in their original format.
Next came ‘Data Comparison’, where data were further reﬁned to allow for uniform
reporting, after which comparisons across the dataset could be made with explainers
presented, as necessary, to illustrate Trust to Trust differences. The ﬁnal process entailed
‘Data Visualisation’, where the uniform data and comparisons allowed for a ﬁnal version of
the knowledge mapping exercise to be presented in a tabular format. By doing this, we are
able to descriptively report NHS Trust-level responses for the provision of perinatal mental
health care by midwives between March 2020 and May 2021—the ﬁrst, second, and third
waves of the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK. Whilst we have made every effort to ensure
the accuracy of the information mapped at the time of writing this article, the changing
nature of the pandemic means that local, national, and international guidance is changing
rapidly; therefore, our knowledge mapping exercise provides a snapshot in time rather
than a dynamic and all-encompassing report.

3. Results

The results of this work are reported in two halves. The ﬁrst is dedicated to the rapid
response critical review of the literature surrounding perinatal mental health care and care
provision by perinatal mental health midwives during the COVID-19 pandemic, while
the second reports on the ﬁndings from a knowledge mapping exercise of the provision
and reconﬁguration of perinatal mental health care services in ﬁve NHS Trusts during the
COVID-19 pandemic.

3.1. Rapid Response to COVID-19 Pandemic Critical Review of the Literature

The following section describes the results of the rapid critical review, discussed as

two themes: ‘Increased Perinatal Distress’ and ‘Inaccessible Services and Support’.

3.1.1. Increased Perinatal Distress

Used as an umbrella term, perinatal distress describes symptoms of “depression, anxiety
and stress which women may experience from conception to one year following birth”. The genesis
of perinatal distress can be varied and multifactorial, including physical, psychological,
and socio-cultural factors. Women at particular risk may have a history of mental ill health;
a history of abuse or domestic violence; or may have a limited support network, which
includes ﬁnancial or other major life stresses [17]

The second stage involved ‘Data Refinement’, where distinct thematic areas to include were agreed upon. These were: ‘Re-tention of Existing Service Provision’; ‘Reconfiguration of Service Provision’; ‘Additional Provision to Support Staff’. After this, we engaged with the process of ‘Data Pooling’, whereby data sourced from all five NHS Trusts were recorded in their original format. Next came ‘Data Comparison’, where data were further refined to allow for uniform re-porting, after which comparisons across the dataset could be made with explainers pre-sented, as necessary, to illustrate Trust to Trust differences. The final process entailed ‘Data Visualisation’, where the uniform data and comparisons allowed for a final version of the knowledge mapping exercise to be presented in a tabular format. By doing this, we are able to descriptively report NHS Trust-level responses for the provision of perinatal mental health care by midwives between March 2020 and May 2021—the first, second, and third waves of the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK. Whilst we have made every effort to ensure the accuracy of the information mapped at the time of writing this article, the changing nature of the pandemic means that local, national, and international guidance is changing rapidly; therefore, our knowledge mapping exercise provides a snapshot in time rather than a dynamic and all-encompassing report.

The impact of the virus on pregnant women has caused an understandable intensity
of distress. The initial lack of information surrounding the virus, the restrictions to social
interactions, increased loneliness, women’s concerns over their own health and fear of
infection and transmission of the virus to their unborn child, on top of the sudden alterations
in maternity care, all will have resulted in this [18]. Perinatal distress has been seen across
the globe during the pandemic in high-, middle- and low-income countries alike ([19–21]).
Tommy’s charity conducted a survey of 1000 new or expectant mothers in the UK during
the pandemic [22]. The charity found that 70% of women felt overwhelmed at some point
in their pregnancy, with 14% saying they struggled throughout, 49% feeling nervous or
anxious, and 77% saying the pandemic had added to their fears.

A similar story was heard from the Babies in Lockdown report published by Best
Beginnings [23]. A total of 87% of parents reported an increase in anxiety during the
pandemic, and one of the compounding factors was the false information and advice given
to pregnant women. The fear of infection, ﬁnancial insecurity, social isolation, and the
restrictions put on the partners and families of women/birthing people during antenatal
and intrapartum care all added to reports of anxiety, confusion, and loss. The report found
that 32% of families wanted help with their mental wellbeing. Those who had the highest
levels of anxiety in relation to the pandemic were Black/Black British (46%), Asian/Asian
British (50%), parents under 25 (54%), and parents with household incomes of less than
£16k (55%).

Similar ﬁndings have been reported worldwide through a systematic review looking at
the impact of COVID-19 on mental health in pregnancy from Canada, China, Italy, Turkey
and Greece [24]. The review stated that there was a statistically signiﬁcant increase in levels
of anxiety compared to those of depression. A thematic analysis completed in Australia
looking at a popular online forum for new and expecting parents found that this heightened
level of distress was signiﬁcant [20]. Women were worried about attending scans or going
food shopping, with one woman stating, “I feel the most anxious, overwhelmed, isolated,
out of control as I’ve ever felt before.”

From pregnancy to two years postpartum is a crucial period of rapid development
that sets the foundations for later health, happiness, and wellbeing [25]. It is a stage of
exceptional vulnerability, when babies are especially reliant on their caregivers and very
sensitive to their environment. Feedback from parents from the Babies in Lockdown
report [23] stated that 25% of parents reported concerns about their relationship with their
baby, and 35% of these parents felt they would like to obtain help with this. In the recent
report Working for Babies [25], professionals working with families were asked about the
impact of the pandemic on mental health, with 98% saying that babies had been impacted
by parental anxiety/stress/depression, leading to an effect on bonding and responsive care.

3.1.2. Inaccessible Services and Support

All of the reports relating to perinatal distress referenced the inability to access services
or support. An international cross-sectional survey of 6894 participants in 64 different
countries was conducted between 26 May 2020 and 13 June 2020 [26]. The most frequently
described anxieties were related to pregnancy and birth, including family being unable to
visit after birth (59%), the lack of a support person during labour (55%), and COVID-19
causing changes to their birth plan (41%). Further concerns were related to not having
access to medical appointments, which is associated with a signiﬁcantly higher chance of
posttraumatic stress and anxiety. This was recognised pre-pandemic through a systematic
review and meta-synthesis for perinatal mental health services citing such barriers as lack
of resources and the fragmentation of services [27], which now faced further restrictions
due to staff self-isolating and a lack of face-to-face services.

A survey conducted in the UK found that almost half of all patients seen by a specialist
mental health midwife reported their support to have stopped due to pandemic [28]. This
was more frequently seen by ﬁrst-time mothers, with one reporting, ‘It’s hard to feel like you’re
important, really just feel like we’re inconveniencing the hospital’ ([28]; p. 13). Further discussion

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 1777

showed the impact when these services were not available or taken away, “‘devastated.
Frightened. Powerless. Helpless. Shocked. I was having an elective c-section due to previous birth
trauma. To have my support taken away 2 days before I went into theatre and be told I had to do it
alone feels like it is the hardest thing I have ever been asked to do.’” ([28]; p. 3).

The Best Beginnings [23] survey of women in the UK highlighted a lack of face-to-face
appointments. “My anxiety is through the roof and I am trying to get professional help with
it to manage, but I’ve been told there is a long waiting list.” Only 32% of those surveyed
were conﬁdent that they could ﬁnd mental health support if they needed it.

Perinatal mental health teams faced similar challenges, with the majority of service
delivery needing to be delivered online ([29,30]); however, the importance of face-to-face
assessment in high-risk circumstances was emphasised by the rapid report into maternal
deaths in the UK during the ﬁrst three months of the pandemic, which included four
suicides and two domestic homicides [31].

A study featured in the British Medical Journal [32] found that there was a notable
increase in some Trusts restricting access for women requesting elective caesarean sections
(ELCS) for non-medical reasons during the COVID-19 pandemic. This is concerning when
considering the experiences many women have endured which have led them to this
decision. Most women with secondary tokophobia requesting an ELCS will have a history
of trauma during birth, and those women with primary tokophobia could have suffered a
history of sexual trauma [33]. The potential impact on a woman’s mental health if she is
denied the opportunity to birth how she chooses is signiﬁcant and the denial of this choice
could not only cause further trauma but may also have long-term impacts on a woman’s
mental health.

In a survey by Tommy’s [22], the majority of women reported hearing false informa-
tion and misconceptions regarding pregnancy and birth. It is also important to consider
that many women have requested ELCS during the pandemic as a result of fear of their
partner not being at the birth due to visiting restrictions and increased anxiety surrounding
childbirth. With virtual appointments being put in place in order to reduce the risk of
pregnant women being exposed to COVID-19 during antenatal appointments, it could be
said that women have had fewer opportunities to discuss their fears regarding birth, whilst
the reduced continuity of carer could have impacted on women’s ability to feel comfortable
with being honest about their anxieties.

Lockdown measures have also meant that women and birthing people needed to
remain inside for long periods of time, and this sadly saw an increase in domestic vio-
lence [21]. Midwives who would usually be able to see women face to face from as early
as 6 weeks were now not seeing women in clinics until 28 weeks into their pregnancy.
This reduced their ability to safely enquire about domestic violence and offer support in
a timely manner. The rise in domestic violence calls for support from police to helplines
rose worldwide [34]).

Working women have faced unfair treatment in the workplace during the pandemic.
Pregnant Then Screwed [35] conducted an online survey of 19,950 mothers and pregnant
women from 16 to 18 July 2020. The data showed that 15% of mothers either had been
made redundant or expected to be made redundant and, of those, 46% said that a lack of
childcare provision played a role in their redundancy. Worse still, the survey found that
45% of pregnant workers who were working outside of the home had not had an individual
risk assessment conducted, rising to 52% for Black, Asian, and Ethnically Diverse pregnant
women, who we know are at increased risk of severe COVID-19 illness [36]. All of this
has impacted their ability to access services, with women not only being concerned about
losing their job, but also being at greater risk of infection if they were having to travel
using public transport and then being made to sit in waiting rooms before their scheduled
antenatal appointments.

3.2. Knowledge Mapping Exercise

The section which follows reports the results of the local knowledge mapping exercise,
detailing the perinatal mental health provision by Specialist Midwives at ﬁve NHS Trusts
in response to COVID-19. Findings are presented under four distinct themes: ‘Retention
of Existing Service Provision’; ‘Additional Services Provided’; ‘Reconﬁguration of Ser-
vice Provision’; ‘Additional Provision to Support Staff Wellbeing’. These are explained
simplistically in Table 1 and narratively in the prose below.

3.2.1. Retention of Existing Service Provision

Retention of existing services extended to the assurance of face-to-face appointments
being offered to all from the beginning of pregnancy to discharge from maternity care,
if that is what women wanted. Further, perinatal mental health midwives continued to
work alongside caseloading midwives, where caseloading models of care were retained. It
should be noted, however, that every Trust involved in this paper saw caseload/continuity
of carer teams disbanded and/or used to cover areas with poor stafﬁng levels. Caseload
teams differ to traditional midwifery care in that they offer a one-to-one continuity of care
throughout pregnancy and birth.

3.2.2. Additional Services Provided

During the pandemic, it was noticed there was a marked increase in the need for ad hoc
support for women suffering with anxiety at all Trusts. At Trust A, this rose by 62%, while
it rose by 40% at Trust C. All midwives contributing to this knowledge mapping exercise
increased their availability either through increased hours, stafﬁng, or ad hoc support.

There was also a noted increase in requests for elective caesarean sections (ELCS).
Trust B responded to this surge through the specialist midwife for mental health offering
a ‘Birth Without Fear’ class. This was intended to enable women whose anxiety was
inﬂuencing their decisions around birth to have access to specialist mental health support
and evidence-based information, ensuring they were able to make an informed choice
about their birth.

The Pan-London Perinatal Mental Health Midwifery Forum developed a resource we
could share with women and staff that gave information about COVID-19, seeking mental
ill health support, resources to share with children, online support groups, and online
exercise classes for pregnant women and staff.

3.2.3. Reconﬁguration of Service Provision

All specialist perinatal mental health midwives involved in this paper adapted their
services to allow for further ad hoc support as needed with the increased levels of anxiety.
This included adapting existing provision to either partial or fully online provision to
counter any concerns about exposure to infection from having to come into the hospital.
This not only led to an anecdotal reduction in levels of anxiety but also enabled patients to
inquire safely about domestic violence and signposted them to services early on.

3.2.4. Additional Provision to Support Staff Wellbeing

Each Trust was supportive in some way, with in-house support aimed at maintaining
and improving staff wellbeing. This varied from relaxation rooms to links for online support
and to more specialist services. Trust E went one step further. The local Parent–Infant
Psychotherapy (PIP) service together with a perinatal psychologist also worked with the
perinatal mental health midwife to set up a service to support all maternity staff at the
height of the ﬁrst wave of the pandemic. The project was aimed at giving maternity staff the
opportunity to contact a member of the PIP team by e-mail or phone if they wanted to seek
advice or support following their shift if they felt they had particularly challenging cases.
This was not a referral service for patients, but more a service to give staff the opportunity
to reﬂect and debrief with a trained professional.

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, x FOR PEER REVIEW 8 of 12   Provision of virtual appoint-ments for those unable or not wanting to attend face-to-face ✔ ✔ ✔ ✔ ✔ Additional Pro-vision to Support Staff Wellbeing In-house support for staff men-tal wellbeing ✔ ✔ ✔ ✔ ✔ Key: ✔ = yes: continuation of service provision; ✔ = yes: addition of service provision; ❌ = no; 🚫 = not applicable 3.2.1. Retention of Existing Service Provision Retention of existing services extended to the assurance of face-to-face appointments being offered to all from the beginning of pregnancy to discharge from maternity care, if that is what women wanted. Further, perinatal mental health midwives continued to work alongside caseloading midwives, where caseloading models of care were retained. It should be noted, however, that every Trust involved in this paper saw caseload/continuity of carer teams disbanded and/or used to cover areas with poor staffing levels. Caseload teams differ to traditional midwifery care in that they offer a one-to-one continuity of care throughout pregnancy and birth. 3.2.2. Additional Services Provided During the pandemic, it was noticed there was a marked increase in the need for ad hoc support for women suffering with anxiety at all Trusts. At Trust A, this rose by 62%, while it rose by 40% at Trust C. All midwives contributing to this knowledge mapping exercise increased their availability either through increased hours, staffing, or ad hoc support. There was also a noted increase in requests for elective caesarean sections (ELCS). Trust B responded to this surge through the specialist midwife for mental health offering a ‘Birth Without Fear’ class. This was intended to enable women whose anxiety was in-fluencing their decisions around birth to have access to specialist mental health support and evidence-based information, ensuring they were able to make an informed choice about their birth. The Pan-London Perinatal Mental Health Midwifery Forum developed a resource we could share with women and staff that gave information about COVID-19, seeking mental ill health support, resources to share with children, online support groups, and online exercise classes for pregnant women and staff. 3.2.3. Reconfiguration of Service Provision All specialist perinatal mental health midwives involved in this paper adapted their services to allow for further ad hoc support as needed with the increased levels of anxiety. This included adapting existing provision to either partial or fully online provision to counter any concerns about exposure to infection from having to come into the hospital. This not only led to an anecdotal reduction in levels of anxiety but also enabled patients to inquire safely about domestic violence and signposted them to services early on. 3.2.4. Additional Provision to Support Staff Wellbeing Each Trust was supportive in some way, with in-house support aimed at maintaining and improving staff wellbeing. This varied from relaxation rooms to links for online sup-port and to more specialist services. Trust E went one step further.

Reconfiguration of Service Provision All specialist perinatal mental health midwives involved in this paper adapted their services to allow for further ad hoc support as needed with the increased levels of anxiety. This included adapting existing provision to either partial or fully online provision to counter any concerns about exposure to infection from having to come into the hospital. This not only led to an anecdotal reduction in levels of anxiety but also enabled patients to inquire safely about domestic violence and signposted them to services early on. 3.2.4. Additional Provision to Support Staff Wellbeing Each Trust was supportive in some way, with in-house support aimed at maintaining and improving staff wellbeing.

Further, perinatal mental health midwives continued to work alongside caseloading midwives, where caseloading models of care were retained. It should be noted, however, that every Trust involved in this paper saw caseload/continuity of carer teams disbanded and/or used to cover areas with poor staffing levels. Caseload teams differ to traditional midwifery care in that they offer a one-to-one continuity of care throughout pregnancy and birth. 3.2.2. Additional Services Provided During the pandemic, it was noticed there was a marked increase in the need for ad hoc support for women suffering with anxiety at all Trusts. At Trust A, this rose by 62%, while it rose by 40% at Trust C. All midwives contributing to this knowledge mapping exercise increased their availability either through increased hours, staffing, or ad hoc support.

It should be noted, however, that every Trust involved in this paper saw caseload/continuity of carer teams disbanded and/or used to cover areas with poor staffing levels. Caseload teams differ to traditional midwifery care in that they offer a one-to-one continuity of care throughout pregnancy and birth. 3.2.2. Additional Services Provided During the pandemic, it was noticed there was a marked increase in the need for ad hoc support for women suffering with anxiety at all Trusts. At Trust A, this rose by 62%, while it rose by 40% at Trust C. All midwives contributing to this knowledge mapping exercise increased their availability either through increased hours, staffing, or ad hoc support. There was also a noted increase in requests for elective caesarean sections (ELCS). Trust B responded to this surge through the specialist midwife for mental health offering a ‘Birth Without Fear’ class. This was intended to enable women whose anxiety was in-fluencing their decisions around birth to have access to specialist mental health support and evidence-based information, ensuring they were able to make an informed choice about their birth. The Pan-London Perinatal Mental Health Midwifery Forum developed a resource we could share with women and staff that gave information about COVID-19, seeking mental ill health support, resources to share with children, online support groups, and online exercise classes for pregnant women and staff. 3.2.3. Reconfiguration of Service Provision All specialist perinatal mental health midwives involved in this paper adapted their services to allow for further ad hoc support as needed with the increased levels of anxiety. This included adapting existing provision to either partial or fully online provision to counter any concerns about exposure to infection from having to come into the hospital. This not only led to an anecdotal reduction in levels of anxiety but also enabled patients to inquire safely about domestic violence and signposted them to services early on. 3.2.4. Additional Provision to Support Staff Wellbeing Each Trust was supportive in some way, with in-house support aimed at maintaining and improving staff wellbeing.

Further, perinatal mental health midwives continued to work alongside caseloading midwives, where caseloading models of care were retained. It should be noted, however, that every Trust involved in this paper saw caseload/continuity of carer teams disbanded and/or used to cover areas with poor staffing levels. Caseload teams differ to traditional midwifery care in that they offer a one-to-one continuity of care throughout pregnancy and birth. 3.2.2. Additional Services Provided During the pandemic, it was noticed there was a marked increase in the need for ad hoc support for women suffering with anxiety at all Trusts. At Trust A, this rose by 62%, while it rose by 40% at Trust C. All midwives contributing to this knowledge mapping exercise increased their availability either through increased hours, staffing, or ad hoc support. There was also a noted increase in requests for elective caesarean sections (ELCS). Trust B responded to this surge through the specialist midwife for mental health offering a ‘Birth Without Fear’ class. This was intended to enable women whose anxiety was in-fluencing their decisions around birth to have access to specialist mental health support and evidence-based information, ensuring they were able to make an informed choice about their birth. The Pan-London Perinatal Mental Health Midwifery Forum developed a resource we could share with women and staff that gave information about COVID-19, seeking mental ill health support, resources to share with children, online support groups, and online exercise classes for pregnant women and staff. 3.2.3. Reconfiguration of Service Provision All specialist perinatal mental health midwives involved in this paper adapted their services to allow for further ad hoc support as needed with the increased levels of anxiety. This included adapting existing provision to either partial or fully online provision to counter any concerns about exposure to infection from having to come into the hospital. This not only led to an anecdotal reduction in levels of anxiety but also enabled patients to inquire safely about domestic violence and signposted them to services early on. 3.2.4.

The Pan-London Perinatal Mental Health Midwives Forum also adapted in light of
what was happening with COVID-19. Previously meeting every three months and face to
face, we changed this to be a virtual monthly drop-in. This opportunity to check in on one
another and share what each service was doing was hugely inﬂuential in the changes we
could then implement within our own Trusts.

4. Discussion
4.1. Summary of Main Findings

The COVID-19 pandemic has caused an unprecedented health system shock which
has required the signiﬁcant reconﬁguration of the health service in order to continue to
provide healthcare whilst also reducing the risk of viral transmission. For maternity care,
guidance has been produced consistently by the RCOG with regard to how best to provide
maternity care and updating advice on the risk posed by the virus to pregnant and postpar-
tum women [37]. Maternity services have therefore been subject to repeated service-level
reconﬁguration [8], rendering many women unhappy with the care they received [38].
Speciﬁcally, it has been reported that women (in the general population) in the UK have
experienced some of the highest levels of perinatal mental ill health ever recorded empiri-
cally [39,40] and were adversely affected by restrictions associated with COVID-19 [41,42],
especially with regard to missing out on social and healthcare professional support [43].

Women and birthing people have faced unparalleled change at a time in their life
which should usually allow for preparation for parenthood. This preparatory work in
the lead up to the transition into parenthood should normally be accomplished with the
support of healthcare professionals, including a midwife and health visitor. For women with
mental ill health, this should be further supported by a specialist perinatal mental health
midwife [12]. Despite numerous publications [37,44,45] recommending the continuity
of care(r) and services, COVID-19 disrupted this support for many families, who were
left to navigate their maternity care through a screen on their laptop and/or birth alone
amongst strangers. This mapping exercise showed that the work the perinatal mental
health midwives were able to adapt allowed for care to continue in as normal a way as
possible, thus combatting the issues arising in perinatal mental health due to COVID-19
(which were identiﬁed in the critical review). This was only due to ongoing communication
and support from management, the personal and individual drive from the perinatal
mental health midwives themselves, and the peer support between members of the Pan-
London Perinatal Mental Health Midwife Forum. Future and ongoing planning needs to
include the ability to co-produce resources, to communicate with women and families, and
for specialist midwives to remain in place to ensure that perinatal mental health care is
delivered efﬁcaciously and with the compassion it requires.

4.2. Strengths, Limitations, and Future Directions

To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst paper to document how services in the United
Kingdom (NHS Trusts) adapted their perinatal mental health care provision, as offered by
specialist perinatal mental midwives, for women and birthing people. However, we realise
that this knowledge mapping exercise was limited to ﬁve predominantly London-based
NHS Trusts and therefore may not be broadly or directly applicable to perinatal mental
health services in other regions or countries. Another limitation linked to this one is the
fact we that were unable to provide individual Trust-level statistics due to the potential
for identiﬁability. This is the nature of local projects, and future research could rectify
this using national survey methodologies, as have previously been used [8]. Future work
should include a wider spectrum of Trusts throughout the UK and a wider global mapping
of perinatal mental health services to see where services continued and/or adaptations
were successful and ultimately share learning and best practices.

Combined with this knowledge mapping, we also offer a rapid critical review of
the literature published in the early stages of the pandemic and broadly synthesise the
landscape of perinatal mental health and how it was affected by the onset of COVID-

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2022, 19, 1777

19. Whilst we provide a rapid review of the work published, the pandemic has led to
many empirical explorations of maternal and child health, care, and service provision.
Consequently, further systematic reviews with speciﬁc questions are required to provide a
more thorough insight into the effects of the pandemic on perinatal mental health services
and care provision.

4.3. Conclusions

The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is still not fully understood, but, as seen within
services in London and based on articles from papers published early in the pandemic,
increased levels of perinatal distress and restrictions to perinatal mental health services
have been witnessed globally. Ongoing and global evaluations of service conﬁgurations
similar to ours will be helpful as we move from the pandemic into post-pandemic recovery,
building better services in what has been dubbed the “new normal”. In doing so, we
attempt to do our utmost to protect our future populations through shared learning, best
practice, and adaptations in the way we provide care.
