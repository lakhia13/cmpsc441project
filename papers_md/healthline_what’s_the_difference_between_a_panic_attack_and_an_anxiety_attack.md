- While the term “anxiety attack” is commonly used, it isn’t a medical term. It often refers to intense anxiety or what might actually be a panic attack.

- Panic attacks are sudden episodes of intense fear with physical and emotional symptoms like a racing heart, shortness of breath, and a sense of losing control. They may occur unexpectedly or be triggered by specific stressors.

- Psychotherapy and lifestyle adjustments, such as practicing mindfulness and reducing stress, may help manage anxiety and panic attacks.

Panic attacks are common in people with panic disorder, but anyone may experience one during their lifetime.


## What is an anxiety attack?


The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition, text revision (DSM-5-TR) doesn’t include anxiety attacks as a stand-alone diagnosis. Instead, the reference manual listsanxiety disorders.

Thisincludesthe following conditions:

- generalized anxiety disorder

- separation anxiety disorder

- agoraphobiawithout a history of panic disorder

- social anxiety disorder

Anxiety is an experienceusually relatedto the anticipation or handling of a stressful situation, experience, or event. It may come on gradually or suddenly.

Symptoms of anxiety include:

When these symptoms come on suddenly and intensely, a person may refer to them as an anxiety attack, when they may be describing a panic attack instead or an episode of severe anxiety.


## What is a panic attack?


Panic attackscome on suddenly and involve intense and often overwhelming fear. They’reaccompaniedby very challenging physical symptoms like a racing heartbeat, shortness of breath, or nausea.

The DSM-5-TR recognizes panic attacks and categorizes them as unexpected or expected.

Unexpected panic attacks can occur without an obvious cause. Expected panic attacks are cued by external stressors, such asphobias.

Panic attacks can happen to anyone, but having more than one may be a sign ofpanic disorder, a mental health condition characterized by sudden and repeated panic attacks.


## Symptoms of panic attack vs. anxiety attack


Because anxiety attacks aren’t a formal condition or experience, there are no specific diagnostic criteria or symptoms for it.

A panic attack can cause physical and emotional symptoms, including:

- apprehension and worry

- intense distress

- fear of dying or losing control

- a sense of detachment from the world (derealization) or oneself (depersonalization)

- heart palpitations or an accelerated heart rate

- shortness of breath

- tightness in the throat or feeling like you’re choking

- chills or hot flashes

- trembling or shaking

- numbness or tingling (paresthesia)

- nausea, abdominal pain, or upset stomach

- feeling faint or dizzy

It may be difficult to know when you’re having a panic attack. Keep in mind the following:

- The cause:Anxiety is typically related to something that’s perceived as stressful or threatening. Panic attacks aren’t always cued by stressors. Theymost oftenoccur out of the blue.

- The level of distress:While anxiety can be mild, moderate, or severe, panic attacks are intense experiences. For example, you may be unable to move or react when having a panic attack.

- Fight-or-flight response:During a panic attack, the body’s autonomous fight-or-flight response takes over. Physical symptoms are often more intense than when you’re feeling anxious in general.

- Speed of onset:Panic attacks usually occur abruptly and may last a few minutes or hours.

- Effect:Panic attacks may trigger intense worries or fears related to having another attack. This may have an effect on your behavior, leading you to avoid places or situations where you think you might be at risk of a panic attack.


## Causes of panic attack vs. anxiety attack


Everyone’s different and may feel anxious about a variety of situations. You may feel anxious about a first date, job interview, or coming up with solutions to an unexpected personal problem. This anxiety may be mild to severe, depending on your emotional resources and support.

Panic attacks may occur for expected or unexpected reasons.

Unexpected panic attacks have no clear external triggers. For example, you may be taking a nap and wake up with a panic attack.

Expected panic attacks happen when you face a known trigger. For example, if you’re afraid of flying, you could have a panic attack before boarding your flight.

Other sources and causes of mild to severe anxiety, including panic attacks, mayinclude:

- social situations

- phobias like agoraphobia (fear of crowded or open spaces),claustrophobia(fear of small spaces), andacrophobia(fear of heights)

- reminders or memories of traumatic experiences

- chronic illnesses likeheart disease,diabetes,irritable bowel syndrome, orasthma

- alcoholor drug withdrawal

- medication and supplements

- thyroid problems


## Risk factors for panic attack vs. anxiety attack


Anxiety, in general, may be more likely when you have a few risk factors,including:

- experiencing trauma or witnessing traumatic events, either as a child or as an adult

- experiencing a stressful life event, such as the death of a loved one or a divorce

- experiencing ongoing stress and worries, such as work responsibilities, conflict in your family, or financial woes

- living with a chronic health condition or life threatening illness

- having an anxious personality

- having another mental health condition like depression

- having close family members who also have anxiety or panic disorders

- using illegal drugs or consuming alcohol

People who live with an anxiety disorder are at an increased risk of experiencing panic attacks. However, having anxiety does not mean you will experience a panic attack.


## Diagnosing panic attack vs. anxiety attack


Because it’s not a formal condition, healthcare professionals will not diagnose anxiety attacks. Instead, if you have persistent anxiety or panic attacks, they may diagnose an anxiety disorder.

A doctor will ask you about your symptoms and conduct tests to rule out other health conditions with similar symptoms, such as heart disease or thyroid problems.

To get a diagnosis, a doctor may:

- conduct a physical exam

- order blood tests

- order a heart test, like anelectrocardiogram (ECG or EKG)

- recommend a psychological evaluation or questionnaire
