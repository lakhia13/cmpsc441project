ABSTRACT  
Background: Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is characterized by symptoms associated with 
difficulties  in  emotion  regulation,  altered  self-image,  impulsivity,  and  instability  in  personal 
found  between  BPD  symptoms  and  altered 
relationships.  A 
neuropsychological  processes.  Studies  of  event-related  potentials 
(ERP)  measured  with 
electroencephalogram  (EEG)  have  found  neural  correlates  related  to  BPD  symptoms.  Of  note  is 
the  P300  component,  considered  a  potential  mental  health  biomarker  for  trauma-associated 
disorders. However, no meta-analysis has been found to demonstrate this relationship.
Objectives:  To  evaluate  the  relationship  between  the  P300  component  and  BPD  symptoms.  To 
evaluate the relationship of other ERP components with BPD symptoms.
Methods:  The  method  and  procedure  were  adjusted  to  the  PRISMA  checklist.  The  search  was 
performed  in  three  databases:  WOS,  Scopus  and  PubMed.  A  Random  Effects  Model  was  used  to 
perform  the  analysis  of  the  studies.  In  addition,  a  meta-regression  was  performed  with  % 
women,  Gini  and  GDP.  Finally,  a  descriptive  analysis  of  the  main  results  found  between  P300, 
other ERP components (LPP, P100 and ERN/Ne) and BPD symptoms was performed.
Results: From a review of 485 articles, a meta-analysis was performed with six articles that met the 
inclusion criteria. A moderate, positive relationship was found between the P300 component and 
BPD symptoms (REM = .489; p < .001). It was not possible to perform meta-analyses for other ERP 
components (LPP, P100 and ERN/Ne) due to the low number of articles found.
Conclusion:  The  idea  that  P300  could  be  considered  for  use  as  a  biomarker  to  identify  altered 
neural  correlates  in  BPD  is  reinforced.  In  addition,  a  moderating  effect  of  inequality  (Gini)  was 
detected.

Resultados:  A  partir  de  una  revisión  de  485  artículos,  se  realizó  un  meta-análisis  con  seis 
artículos  que  cumplían  los  criterios  de  inclusión.  Se  encontró  una  relación  moderada  y 
positiva  entre  el  componente  P300  y  la  sintomatología  del  TLP  (REM = .489;  p < .001).  No  fue 
posible realizar meta-análisis  para otros componentes de ERP (LPP, P100 y ERN/Ne) debido a 
la baja cantidad de artículos encontrados.

1.  Introduction

The most current version of the Diagnostic and Statisti-
cal  Manual  of  Mental  Disorders  (DSM-5)  describes 
Borderline  Personality  Disorder  (BPD)  as  a pattern  of 
instability  in  personal  relationships,  self-image,  affect, 
and a high degree of impulsivity (American Psychiatric 
Association, 2013). At least three dimensions have been 
identified as characterizing BPD symptoms: 1) emotion 
dysregulation  (e.g.  impulsivity  under  stress,  maladap-
tive  behaviours,  self-injury,  suicidal 
ideation  or 
attempts);  2)  identity  disturbance  (e.g.  unstable  self- 
image  or  sense  of  self);  and  3)  interpersonal  disturb-
ances (e.g. unstable interpersonal relationships, frantic 
efforts to avoid abandonment) (Bohus et al., 2021).

Due  to  its  symptoms  and  the  impairment  that 
people  with  this  disorder  have,  BPD  is  considered  a 
severe  mental  disorder  (Kjær  et  al.,  2020).  This  is 
reflected  by  its  prevalence.  Ellison  et  al.  (2018) 
reviewed  studies  published  between  1989  and  2016, 
conducted in the United States, Norway, Great Britain, 
England, and the Netherlands in a community sample 
report prevalence of BPD at 0.5% to 3.2%. In psychia-
tric samples, studies published between 1985 and 2017 
were reviewed indicating a prevalence of BPD at 2.1% 
to  6.4%  and  an  overall  mean  for  all  studies  of  22.4% 
(Ellison  et  al.,  2018).  Another  epidemiological  study 
by  Samuels  (2011)  evaluated  5  articles  conducted 
between  the  years  2001  and  2010,  reporting  that 
BPD  has  a  prevalence  ranging  from  0.7%  to  2.7% 
(Samuels, 2011).

Although BPD symptoms and their prevalence are 
clear,  its  etiology  is  still  unknown.  A  meta-analysis 
by Ruocco (2005) provides an explanation from a neu-
ropsychological  perspective.  It  indicates  that  people 
with  BPD  present  difficulties  in  executive  functions, 
such as attention, cognitive flexibility, learning, mem-
ory, planning, rapid processing and visuospatial skills 
(Ruocco,  2005).  In  addition,  neuroimaging  studies 
indicate  that  people  with  BPD  do  not  fully  activate 
three  neural  regions  involved  in  cognitive  control: 
(1) dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, (2) inferior frontal 
gyrus and (3) inferior parietal sulcus, which would be 
related to BPD symptoms (Ruocco & Carcone, 2016).
However, there is no single area associated with the 
etiology of BPD. For example, Pérez et al. (2018) pro-
pose  that  there  are  disconnections  and  abnormalities 
in  limbic  areas  and  the  prefrontal  cortex  in  people 
with  BPD  (Pérez  et  al.,  2018).  Bertsch  and  Herpertz 
linking  neurological 
(2021),  proposed  a  model 

alterations  to  BPD  symptoms.  These  alterations 
include abnormalities in the medial prefrontal cortex, 
temporoparietal junction and precuneus, which could 
lead  to  difficulties  in  self-reference  and  mentalizing 
others’ emotions and intentions, as well as the amyg-
dala  and  midline  structures,  which  have  been  associ-
ated  with  hypermentalization 
in  BPD  patients 
(Bertsch & Herpertz, 2021).

Likewise,  when  faced  with  emotion  recognition 
tasks,  it  was  found  that  patients  with  BPD  have  a 
lower  fronto-limbic  activation  pattern  compared  to 
the control group, which was characterized by a deeper 
activation in the anterior cingulate cortex, areas associ-
ated  with  attention  modulation,  executive  functions, 
complex motor control and error detection (Wingen-
feld et al., 2009). This is in contrast to the study by Koe-
nigsberg et al. (2009) where patients with BPD, facing 
an  emotion  recognition  task,  present  a  neural  acti-
vation different from the control group, mainly facing 
negative  visual  emotion  stimuli,  this  because  patients 
with  BPD  increase  the  activation  of  the  primary 
regions  of  visual  processing,  the  amygdala,  fusiform, 
precuneus  and  parahippocampal,  which  indicates 
that  patients  with  BPD  are  more  hypervigilant,  while 
the control group uses a more reflective and less hyper-
vigilant network (Koenigsberg et al., 2009).

The  aforementioned  alterations  are  believed  to  be 
caused by multiple neurobiological systems, however, 
they could be produced by the main factor at the basis 
of  BPD  development:  exposure  to  traumatic  events 
occurring  mainly  during  childhood  (Amad  et  al.,  
2019;  Ball  &  Links,  2009;  Crowell  et  al.,  2009; 
Jaworska-Andryszewska  &  Rybakowski,  2022;  Stepp 
et al., 2016; Yuan et al., 2023). Therefore, the intersec-
tion  of  BPD  with  Posttraumatic  Stress  Disorder 
(PTSD),  is  not  surprising  (APA,  2013;  Carvajal,  
2002;  Owczarek  et  al.,  2023).  In  fact,  there  is  a  high 
comorbidity  between  BPD  and  PTSD  which  could 
be  as  high  as  35%  (Flasbeck  &  Brüne,  2021;  Friborg 
et  al.,  2013;  Pagura  et  al.,  2010)  and  patients  with 
BPD  have  reported  that  at  least  76.6%  present  a 
trauma  in  childhood  and  93.3%  present  a  trauma  in 
adulthood (Fung et al., 2023).

The connection also extends to Complex Posttrau-
matic Stress Disorder (CPTSD; World Health Organ-
ization, 2022). While PTSD, CPTSD, and BPD do not 
completely  share  symptoms,  there  are  overlaps.  For 
example,  PTSD  shares  with  CPTSD  and  BPD  core 
symptoms  such  as  reexperiencing,  avoidance,  and 
blunting.  In  addition,  CPTSD  shares  with  BPD 

symptoms such as sensitivity, worry, guilt, and detach-
ment  (Cloitre  et  al.,  2014).  However,  certain  symp-
toms  such  as  fanaticism,  impulsivity,  self-injury  and 
emotional  instability  are  considered  characteristic  of 
BPD  (Cloitre  et  al.,  2014).  In  this  sense,  traumatic 
symptoms  are  a  fundamental  element,  being  able  to 
provoke  the  referred  neurobiological  alterations  and 
being  a  relevant  actor  in  the  etiology  of  PTSD, 
CPTSD  and  BPD,  however,  the  mechanisms  that  are 
at  the basis  of  the  etiology of  these  disorders are still 
unknown, so it is necessary to advance in this line of 
research (Pagura et al., 2010).

Therefore, the focus of the current scientific debate 
resides  in  the  effort  to  elucidate  the  neurobiological 
bases  underlying  traumatic  symptoms  (Baranger 
et al., 2020; Ruchsow et al., 2006). To address this chal-
lenge, neuroimaging research techniques such as elec-
troencephalography  (EEG),  a  non-invasive  method 
that  allows  the  study  of  brain  bioelectrical  activity, 
which is mainly used to gain insight into neural pro-
cessing, delivering information about brain disorders 
and  cognitive  processes  (Amin  et  al.,  2015;  Carrión 
et  al.,  2009;  Maiorana  et  al.,  2016),  are  utilized.  In 
this  approach,  a  procedure  known  as  Event  Related 
Potentials (ERPs) is usually employed, ERPs are tran-
sient components in the EEG, which consists of expos-
ing individuals to a sensory stimulus and recording the 
resulting brain responses, being able to identify cogni-
tive  functions  (Georgieva  et  al.,  2015;  Hasan  et  al.,  
2023; Núñez et al., 2004). ERPs are categorized accord-
ing to their valence; (i.e. whether they are positive or 
negative),  their  latency,  which  refers  to  the  time 
from  stimulus  presentation  to  brain  response,  and 
their  topography,  which  describes  the  distribution  of 
electrical  activity  in  the  brain  (Luck,  2014;  Núñez 
et al., 2004).

A prominent ERP component in the trauma litera-
ture is the P300 or P3 component. In fact, it has been 
proposed as a potential biomarker of mental health in 
trauma-associated  disorders  (Lobo  et  al.,  2015;  Wang 
et al., 2018; Zukerman et al., 2018). P300 is a late posi-
tive (P) wave, peaking at around 300 ms (300) (Fabiani 
et al., 1998; Friedman et al., 2001; Luck, 2014). It pre-
sents  two  distinctions  P3a  and  P3b.  P3a  occurs  at 
peak amplitudes  over frontal  areas and is triggered by 
infrequent  changes  in  stimuli,  while  P3b  appears  in 
the parietal area and shows changes when the stimulus 
is  relevant  to  the  task  performed  (Polich,  2012).  In 
addition, the late appearance of the P300 allows evalu-
ating cognitive processes associated with attention and 
working memory (Duncan-Johnson & Donchin, 1982; 
Luck,  2014;  Polich,  2007)  This  is  relevant  to  evaluate 
in BPD due to the alterations at the neuropsychological 
level described above, similar to what occurs in PTSD 
where the P300 an has been used to identify attentional 
bias to stimuli that are relevant to the trauma (Stanford 
et al., 2001). Due to the relationship between potentially

traumatic  events  and  BPD,  it  is  necessary  to  assess 
whether the P300 is also related to BPD symptoms.

cognitive  processing.  However, 

A  review  conducted  by  Flasbeck  et  al.  (2020)  to 
identify  altered  neural  processing  in  individuals  with 
BPD,  reports  the  existence  of  a  relationship  between 
the P300 component and deficits in inhibitory control, 
and  a  relationship  between  P3a  distinction  and  early 
evaluative 
the 
relationship  of  other  ERP  components  that  could  be 
associated  with  BPD  symptoms  has  also  been 
reported,  as  is  the  case  of  the  relationship  with  the 
amplitude  of  the  FRN  (feedback  related  negativity) 
component  and  decision  making  in  individuals  with 
BPD where it is possible to observe altered processing 
(Flasbeck et al., 2020).

In  summary,  the  literature  has  evidenced  a  corre-
lation between components of event-related potentials 
and  symptoms  of  Borderline  Personality  Disorder.  It 
highlights,  P300  as  a  potential  biomarker  of  psycho-
logical  trauma,  possibly  linked  to  BPD.  However,  we 
say ‘possibly’ because the mainstream scientific litera-
ture has not yet provided a meta-analysis that jointly 
examines this relationship. Also, it remains uncertain 
whether other components of the ERP would maintain 
a  similar  connection  to  BPD  symptoms.  To  clarify 
these  unknowns,  a  meta-analysis  of  previous  studies 
establishing  the  relationship  between  ERP  com-
ponents  and  BPD  symptoms  becomes  imperative. 
The  present  meta-analysis  resolves  these  controver-
sies, and its aims are twofold. The first aim is to evalu-
ate the relationship between the P300 component and 
BPD symptoms; and the second aim is to evaluate the 
relationship  of  other  ERP  components  with  BPD 
symptoms.  Based  on  both  objectives,  two  hypotheses 
are  proposed.  The  first  is  that  the  P300  component 
shows  a  relationship  with  BPD  symptoms  whose 
effect  is  like  that  of  relationship  with  PTSD.  Second, 
there  are  other  ERP  components  (e.g.  FRN)  related 
to BPD  in  a  manner like  P300.  These hypotheses  are 
based on the relationship of BPD to traumatic events, 
its high comorbidity with PTSD, and the relationship 
of  these  events  to  P300.  The  present  meta-analysis 
contributes to the understanding of BPD as a disrup-
tive response related to exposure to traumatic events. 
Therefore,  we  also  assess  whether  the  social  factors 
of  the  populations  in  the  studies  linked  to  such 
exposure  (e.g.  gender,  economic  inequality  (Gini) 
and  economic  growth  (GDP);  Brewin  et  al.,  2000; 
Trickey  et  al.,  2012;  Xue  et  al.,  2015)  are  moderators 
for the relationship between ERP and BPD symptoms.

2.1.  Search  strategy

Reporting  methods  and  procedures  were  in  accord-
ance with the PRISMA checklist (Preferred Reporting 

4 

F. SALAS ET AL

Items  for  Systematic  Reviews  and  Meta-Analyses). 
English-language  articles  published  in  peer-reviewed 
journals  (indexes)  up  to  June  2023  were  processed 
for  inclusion.  The  search  was  performed  in  three 
scientific literature databases: Web of Science, Scopus, 
and PubMed. The search terms entered in the biblio-
graphic  databases  included  the  following  combi-
nations:  TITLE-ABS-KEY  BPD,  ERP  and  EEG 
according  to  the  following  logical  search  algorithm: 
‘borderline’  &  (‘personality’  &  ‘disorder’)  OR  ‘BPD’ 
&  (‘EEG’  OR  ‘electroencephalogram’  OR  ‘ERP’  OR 
‘event  related  potential’  OR  ‘P300’  OR  ‘P3’).  Due  to 
the quantitative focus of this study, we excluded docu-
ments such as book chapters, theoretical reviews, sys-
tematic  reviews,  editorial  comments,  letters  or  notes, 
case  studies,  and  other  articles  that  provided  non- 
quantitative  information  on  BPD  and  EEG.  This 
study was not pre-registered.

2.2.  Inclusion  and  eligibility  criteria

The following inclusion criteria were applied to these 
articles:  (1)  being  written  in  English  or  translatable 
into English; (2) present an empirical and quantitative 
study; (3) address the relationship of BPD symptoms 
(based  on  the  DSM-5  criteria)  and  ERP  responses; 
(4)  This  variable  should  theoretically  be  associated 
with  BPD  as  a  cause  and  not  as  a  consequence;  and 
(5)  have  data  to  perform  meta-analytic  calculations 
(e.g. Pearson’s correlation coefficient).

2.3.  Quality  assessment

The  assessment  of  methodological  rigour  and  the 
possible  presence  of  bias  in  each  of  the  studies  used 
in  the  meta-analysis  was  determined  using  the 
National  Institute  of  Health  (NIH)  version  ‘Quality 
Assessment  Tool  for  Observational  Cohort  and 
Cross-Sectional  Studies’  (NIH,  2023).  This  tool  com-
prises  14  areas  of  analysis,  which  considers:  formu-
lation  of  the  research  question,  composition  of  the 
study  population,  recruitment  procedures,  study 
power,  methods  of  measuring  exposures  and  out-
comes, dropout rate, and statistical approaches used.
Each original evaluation question is classified as ‘yes,’ 
‘no,’  ‘cannot  be  determined,’  ‘not  applicable,’  or  ‘not 
reported.’  In  the  present  study,  a  scoring  system  has 
been adopted that assigns a score of 1 to ‘yes’ answers, 
0.5  to  partial  statements,  and  0  to  ‘no’  or  unclear 
answers.  This  scoring  system  has  been  recommended 
by  similar  research  (Gaythorpe  et  al.,  2021)  and  is 
intended to quantify the results in a consistent manner.
The description of each criterion is detailed in Sup-
plementary Table S1. As a criterion for the final classifi-
cation,  studies  that  scored  7  or  more  points  were 
categorized  as  high  quality  (good),  while  those  that 
scored  between  5  and  6  points  were  considered 

acceptable (fair). On the other hand, studies that scored 
less than 5 points were classified as poor quality.

The  quality  assessment  process  was  conducted 
independently  by  two 
investigators 
(F.S.,  M.N.),  and  the  results  were  thoroughly  dis-
cussed.  Disagreements  that  arose  were  resolved 
through constructive discussion.

independent 

2.4.  Data  extraction

The initial search was performed by one of the authors 
(F.S.),  to  identify  the  articles  according  to  the  search 
terms.  This  was  followed  by  manual  inspection  to 
select  those  that  met  the  selection  criteria.  Screening 
was  performed  by  two  of  the  authors  (M.L.,  M.N.) 
independently,  reviewing  titles,  abstracts,  or  the  full 
article  if  relevant.  Differences  in  interpretation  were 
resolved by discussion with a third reviewer (G.S.) to 
develop a final coding. According to the inclusion cri-
teria,  the  selected  articles  were  read  in  their  entirety. 
To  classify  them,  a  colour  code  was  used:  included 
in green, excluded in red, doubts in yellow and orange 
not  found,  according  to  Cochrane  recommendations 
(Higgins, 2012).

2.5.  Analysis  plan

The effect size was determined using Pearson’s r cor-
relation  between  BPD  symptoms  and  the  ERP  com-
ponent.  Being  a  standardization  of  the  covariances, 
Pearson’s  r  has  a  common  metric  to  assess  the  size 
of  the  effect  (Botella  &  Sánchez,  2015).  The  selected 
analysis  model  is  random  effects,  since  it  allows  for 
flexible analysis of studies and generalization (Botella 
&  Sánchez,  2015).  To  analyze  homogeneity,  the 
Cochran Q statistic was used, which allows us to ident-
ify whether the correlations of the studies estimate the 
same  parametric  effect  (p > .05)  (Botella  &  Sánchez,  
2015).  In  addition,  the  I2  statistic  was  used  to  assess 
the differences present between the studies according 
to the groups of people that comprise it (e.g. age, gen-
der).  Multiplying  this  statistic  by  100,  the  percentage 
of  heterogeneity  of  the  studies  is  obtained  (Botella  & 
Sánchez, 2015).

To rule out publication bias, Rosenthal’s N tests (N 
Rosenthal >5*k + 10), Egger’s Z (p > .05). The absence 
of bias is confirmed by graphically locating the scores 
within the triangle centred on the mean using the fun-
nel plot. In case of being outside the limits, it was ana-
lyzed  if  the  residues  were  within  the  expected  ranges 
(−1.96 and 1.96; Botella & Sánchez, 2015). Once hom-
ogeneity  and  absence  of  bias  were  verified,  the  effect 
size  and  confidence  interval  of  each  study  and  the

variables  that  theoretically  may  be  influencing  the 
relationship  between  ERP  and  BPD  symptoms.  Indi-
cators of exposed groups such as the female ratio (per-
centage  of  women  in  the  sample),  inequality  index 
(Gini  of  the  country)  and  gross  domestic  product 
(GDP  of  the  country)  were  chosen  as  it  has  been 
shown  that  socioeconomic  status  and  inequality  are 
frequently  linked  to  mental  health  issues  (Harnett 
et  al.,  2023;  O’Donoghue  et  al.,  2023;  Winsper  et  al.,  
2020),  and  mixed  results  have  been  reported  on  the 
gender-based  prevalence  of  BPD  across  populations 
(Arranz et al., 2021; Qian et al., 2022; Sansone & San-
sone, 2011). Thus, we hypothesize that these variables 
could potentially moderate the link between ERP and 
BPD symptoms. The analyses were performed with R 
version 4.3.0 using the metafor package.

3. Results

3.1.  Selection  of  studies

We found 1,783 articles that met the initial search cri-
teria. Of these, 644 articles passed the duplication pro-
cess, and 49 articles passed the exclusion criteria. From 
these  articles,  a  database  was  created  that  could  con-
tain at least one study per article reviewed. Of the 49 
articles,  five  did  not  analyze  BPD,  three did  not  ana-
lyze  ERP,  and  30  articles  did  not  present  sufficient 
data  for  meta-analysis.  Four  articles  were  analyzed 
descriptively, being single studies of a single ERP com-
ponent (LPP, P100 and ERN/Ne). That is, they do not 
meet  the  required  minimum.  Therefore,  it  was  poss-
ible  to  meta-analyze  six  articles  on  the  P300  com-
ponent.  In  addition,  some  of  these  articles  presented

more than one relationship, so the meta-analysis was 
performed  for  a  total  of  10  relationships  between 
P300 and BPD symptoms. Figure 1 presents the flow 
chart of the study selection process.

3.2.  Sample  characteristics

Six  articles  were  included  with  a  total  sample  size  of 
151  (Mage = 25.75;  SDage = 3.91;  Female = 82.78%). 
Only  the  BPD  group  was  considered  in  this  sample 
because we sought to analyze the relationship between 
individuals  with  BPD  symptoms  and  the  P300  com-
ponent. The studies were conducted in four countries 
(Germany, China, Mexico, USA). Table 1 presents the 
characteristics of the studies.

3.3.  Assessment  of  quality

The  methodological  quality  within  the  included 
studies  varied.  Table  1  provides  an  overview  of  the 
14 quality assessment areas and the overall quality rat-
ing  indicating  risk  of  bias.  Using  the  guidance 

Table  3.  Meta-analysis  results

provided  by  the  NIH  (2023)  tool,  (1)  studies  were 
rated  ‘good’  quality  rating,  indicating  low  risk  of 
bias,  and  (5)  studies  were  rated  ‘fair’  quality  rating, 
indicating some risk of bias.

The  main  shortcoming  in  the  quality  of  the 
included studies is due to the type of ‘cross-sectional’ 
study design, which for questions ‘5, 6, 7,8, 10, 12 & 13’ 
obtained  the  minimum  score  since  they  evaluate 
characteristics  of  longitudinal  studies.  The  results  of 
the quality assessment are summarized in Table 2.

3.4.  Meta-analysis  of  the  relationship  between 
BPD  symptoms  and  P300

For  the  meta-analysis,  the  six  selected  articles  were 
used, with a total of 10 correlations between P300 and 
BPD symptoms (k = 10). Overall, a medium and signifi-
cant  effect  size  was  observed  (REM = .489;  p = .000). 
The  results  of  the  meta-analysis  are  presented  in  
Table 3 and the forest plot is presented in Figure 2.

The studies showed low heterogeneity (I2 = .01%; Q  
= 8.422;  p = .492)  and  an  absence  of  publication  bias,

as  indicated  by  Rosenthal’s  N  (Rosenthal’s  N > 5*k +  
10;  210 > 60).  However,  Egger’s  Z  value  was  signifi-
cant, which would indicate the presence of asymmetry 
in the distribution of effects. Further details of the dis-
tribution of effects are shown in Figure 3.

3.5.  Influential  diagnosticrs

A  sensitivity  analysis  was  performed  through  plots  of 
influential  diagnostics  to  see  if  any  outliers  were 
reported. It was found that no study presented an outlier. 
The results can be seen in Supplementary Figure 1.

3.6.  Meta-regression

To analyze possible sources of heterogeneity, a meta- 
regression  analysis  based  on  a  mixed  effect  model 
(MEM)  was  performed.  The  effect  of  three  potential 
moderators  was  explored  based  on  the  descriptives 
provided  by  the  studies:  percentages  of  women,  Gini 
and GDP. Only the Gini moderator showed a statisti-
cally significant effect. The results are shown in Table 4 
and Figure 4.

3.7.  Descriptive  results

3.7.1.  Relationship  between  P300  and  BPD 
symptoms
Six articles reported at least one relationship between 
the  P300  component  and  BPD-associated  symptoms. 
For example, in order to evaluate the P300 component 
and  its  relationship  with  reduced  risk  assessment  in 
BPD  patients,  Endrass  et  al.  (2016)  implemented  a 
Two-choice  task  to  assess  impulsivity  symptoms, 
where  participants  had  to  choose  options,  low  risk 
with  small  potential  gains  and  losses  or  high  risk 
with  larger  potential  gains  and  losses.  To  evoke  the 
ERP response, they used visual stimuli where a green 
smiling  face  was  associated  when  the  participant 
selected  the  gain  option  and  a  red  frowning  face 
when  the  participant  selected  the  loss  option.  A 
main  effect  of  participants  with  BPD  versus  the  con-
trol group was reported for the high-risk option, indi-
cating  that  participants  with  BPD  tended  to  mostly 
choose  the  high-risk  option.  When  performing 
correlation analysis between P300 and risk decisions, 
positive  and  significant  correlations  were  found 
between  loss  condition  (r = .56;  p = .03)  and  gain 
condition (r = .58; p = .01).

Similar results were reported in Stewart et al. (2019) 
where  they  sought  to  study  impulsivity  symptoms 
though  reward  processing,  identifying  that  the  feed-
back  process  and  altered  learning  are  related  to  BPD 
symptoms.  Through  a  Guessing  Task,  participants 
had  to  choose  a  door  in  which  one  contained  gains 
and the other losses, then they were told whether the 
answer  was  correct  (green  up  arrow)  or  incorrect 
(red  down  arrow).  Differences  in  neural  response 
were reported for both wins and losses, however, cor-
relation analyses indicated that there is a significantly 
lower P300 amplitude for wins versus losses which was 
related to worse BPD symptoms (r = .42; p = .015).

Following this line, a relationship between impaired 
inhibitory control and global BPD symptoms has also 
been reported by Ramos-Loyo et al. (2021), which the 
authors  characterize  based  on  the  DIB-R  assessing 
symptoms  such  as  social  adaptation,  impulsivity, 
affective  instability,  psychosis  and  problems  in  inter-
personal relationships. The authors studied inhibitory 
control  through  emotional  stimuli.  For  this  purpose, 
they  used  a  Go/NoGo  task,  where  participants  were 
shown affective images with pleasant, unpleasant and 
a neutral stimulus. The stimulus consisted of a vertical 
bar to the left or to the right and an arrow appearing in 
the  centre  of  the  screen  pointing to  the  left  or  to  the 
right. The Go condition occurred when the participant 
points  in  the  same  direction  as  the  bar  shown  to  the 
left or right of the image and they also matched in col-
our.  The  NoGo  condition  was  when  the  participant 
should  refrain  from  responding.  The  correlation 
analysis  indicated  a  relationship  between  the  ampli-
tude of the P3 NoGo and BPD symptoms, these corre-
lations  being  positive  and  significant  in  the  three 
conditions  evaluated:  Neutral  (r = .61;  p = .04),  Plea-
sant  (r = .85,  p = .001),  Unpleasant  (r = .73;  p = .01). 
The  authors  point  out  that  the  presence  of  higher 
amplitudes  of  P3  in  the  NoGo  task  would  alter  the 
context-independent 
and 
increase the psychopathological symptoms of BPD in 
emotional contexts.

These  alterations  at  the  emotional  level  have  also

processing,  which  is  linked  to  affective  instability  in 
BPD. Izurieta et al. (2016) studied the time course of 
facial  emotion  processing  in  patients  with  BPD. 
They confirmed the presence of biases in facial proces-
sing, both in early and later stages. When performing 
the  correlation  between  P300  and  anger  suppression 
in participants with BPD, a significant positive corre-
lation  was  observed  (r = .40;  p < .024)  (Izurieta  et  al.,  
2016).  These  results  would  indicate  that  there  is  a 
higher  probability  of  misclassifying  an  angry  face 
when it is predominantly happy (Izurieta et al., 2016).
The  study  conducted  by  Weinbrecht  et  al.  (2018) 
evaluated  the  processing  of  social  engagement  in 
BPD,  based  on  the  relationship  between  difficulties  in 
interpersonal 
social  exclusion, 
which  are  frequent  in  patients  with  BPD  because  of 
their  impulsive  behaviour  (Weinbrecht  et  al.,  2018). 
Through a Cyberball paradigm participants performed 
a  task  in  front  of  a  computer  where  they  threw  a  ball 
thinking they were throwing it to other online players. 
Correlation  analysis  showed  that  the  relationship 
between  P3  amplitude  was  positive  and  significant 
only  in  the  inclusion  condition  (r = .28;  p = .03), 
which  would  indicate  the  existence  of  a  bias  in  social 
processing  of  social  inclusion,  because  this  condition 
was  present  even  when  participants  with  BPD  were 
included in a larger amount (Weinbrecht et al., 2018).
Finally,  as  previously  reviewed,  individuals  with 
BPD present several difficulties in their executive func-
tions  (Ruocco,  2005).  Thus,  Xi  et  al.  (2021)  studied 
possible  alterations  in  the  processing  of  set  changes 
through  a  Task  Switching  paradigm.  They  found  no 
differences  in  set  processing  between  the  BPD  group 
and  the  control  group.  However,  it  was  evidenced 
that both ERP component P2 and  P3 were related to 
clinical  symptoms  of  BPD.  It  was  identified  that  P3 
amplitude  at  the  Pz  electrode  correlated  positively 
and  significantly  with  adaptive  coping  strategies  in 
BPD on the repetition task (r = .42; p < .05), occurring 
the same, but in front of the change task and P3 ampli-
tude  at  the  Cz  electrode  and  impulsivity  (r = .51;  p  
< .05)  (Xi  et  al.,  2021).  The  authors  indicate  that  the 
relationships  found  would  reflect  abnormal  brain 
activity in the set-shifting function mainly in the pre-
frontal cortex and that these results worsen perform-
ance  when  the  task  involves  attentional  allocation 
(Xi et al., 2021).

3.7.2.  Relationship  between  other  ERP 
components  and  BPD  symptoms
that  reported  relationships 
Studies  were 
between  ERP  components  such  as  LPP,  P100  and 
ERN/Ne  and  BPD  symptoms.  The  main  results 
found are reported below.

found 

The existence of self-referential processing biases is 
reported, where individuals with BPD tend to attribute 
negative  content  toward  the  self  (Auerbach  et  al.,  
2016). Thus, Auerbach et al. (2016) assessed self-refer-
ential biases in youth with BPD based on identity dis-
turbance  traits.  For  this  purpose,  they  used  a  Self- 
Referential  Encoding  Task  with  positive  words  and 
negative words. The results of the task were correlated 
with  the  positive  LPP  component.  The  LPP  com-
ponent  appears  in  front  of  attentional  processes 
mainly  to  stimuli  with  emotional  content  (Dennis  & 
Hajcak,  2009).  The  results  of  the  correlations  pre-
sented  a  negative  and  significant  relationship  in  the 
endorsed  positive  word  condition  between  early  LPP 
and  BPD  symptoms  (r = −.42;  p < .05),  which  would 
indicate  the  existence  of  a  discrete  neural  process, 
which would be contributing to self-referential proces-
sing  biases  in  individuals  with  BPD  (Auerbach  et  al.,  
2016).  The  relationship  between  P1,  P2  and  late  LPP 
components  and  BPD  symptoms  was  also  assessed, 
but no significant relationship was presented.

in  social 

Another  study  that  related  LPP  to  BPD  is  that  of 
Flasbeck  et  al.  (2017).  The  study  aimed  to  examine 
difficulties  in  interpersonal  relationships  by  assessing 
empathic  differences  between  the  BPD  group  and 
the control group. A paradigm was used where partici-
pants  had  to  complete  a  Social  Interaction  Empathy 
Task. To do so, participants had to distinguish images 
depicting  physically  or  psychologically  painful  inter-
actions  and  distinguish  between  physical  or  psycho-
interactions.  Correlation 
logical  pain 
analyses showed a relationship between the LPP com-
ponent and CTQ (Childhood Trauma Questionnaire) 
scores in the physical pain condition (r = .47, p = .10) 
and psychological pain (r = .54, p = .003). The authors 
conclude  that  this  relationship  would  be  indicative 
that individuals with BPD process and evaluate differ-
ently at a higher order cognitive level compared to the 
control  group.  By  presenting  a  relationship  between 
CTQ  and  LPP  scores  in  individuals  with  BPD  it  is 
established  that  trauma  would  be  relevant  to  BPD 
(Flasbeck et al., 2017).

As  previously  reported,  individuals  with  BPD  had 
impaired emotion processing in facial emotion recog-
nition  (Izurieta  et  al.,  2016).  However,  these  altera-
tions  also  transcend  to  other  areas  of  emotional 
processing.  This  happens  in  the  case  for  affective 
instability  and  emotional  awareness,  where  Izurieta 
et  al.  (2016),  reported  a  relationship  between  higher 
P100  amplitude  and  decreased  emotional  awareness 
in  BPD  patients  in  the  very  angry  faces  condition  (r

= .33;  p < .07).  The  authors  propose  that  the  P100  is 
a  component  that  can  be  observed  in  occipital  areas 
and appears at around 100 ms after a visual stimulus. 
Therefore, the proposed relationship would be indica-
tive of a more negative perception of others due to a 
hyper-reactivity  to  information  considered  threaten-
ing (Izurieta et al., 2016).

Finally,  Ruchsow  et  al.  (2006)  conducted  a  study 
where  one  of  their  aims  was  to  determine  whether 
impulsivity  in  BPD  patients  had  an  impact  on  the 
amplitudes of  the ERN/Ne  component.  The ERN/Ne 
is  an  ERP  component  that  relates  to  errors  made  in 
front of a task and appears in the moment right after 
responding  erroneously  (Luck,  2014;  Ruchsow  et  al.,  
2006). Thus, Ruchsow et al. (2006) using a Go/NoGo 
task  and  an  Eriksen  flanking  paradigm  presented  a 
string of letters in a congruent and incongruent con-
dition.  When  correlating  impulsivity  and  ERN/Ne 
amplitudes in BPD patients, three positive and signifi-
cant correlations are observed for different electrodes, 
but only in the non-planning impulsivity subtrait: Cz 
(r = .66; p = .020), C1 (r = .69; p = .013) and C2 (r = .68; 
p = .014).

4. Discussion

The  aim  of  the  present  study  was  to  analyze  the 
relationship  between  P300  event-related  potential, 
other  ERP  components  and  BPD  symptoms.  From 
the  literature  review  and  the  use  of  meta-analysis,  it 
was  possible  to  determine  an  effect  with  a  moderate 
and  positive  relationship  between  the  P300  com-
ponent and BPD symptoms (REM = .489; p = .00).

It  was  possible  to  observe  an  altered  P300  in 
relation to BPD symptoms such as risky decision mak-
ing associated with higher levels of impulsivity, anger 
suppression  characterized  by  biases  to  negative 
emotions,  altered  social  processing  in  inclusion  and 
difficulties  in  adaptive  coping  (Endrass  et  al.,  2016; 
Izurieta et al., 2016; Ramos-Loyo et al., 2021; Stewart 
et  al.,  2019;  Weinbrecht  et  al.,  2018;  Xi  et  al.,  2021). 
These symptoms were also accompanied by alterations 
in cognitive processes which would explain these traits 
(Di Bartolomeo et al., 2022; Schuermann et al., 2011).
Relationships  were  also  observed  in  studies  with 
other  ERP  components  (LPP,  P100  and  ERN/Ne) 
and  BPD  symptoms;  however,  it  was  not  possible  to 
perform  a  meta-analysis  due  to  the  low  number  of 
articles found. Descriptively, it is observed that other 
ERP  components  could  be  associated  with  global 
BPD  symptoms,  altered  emotional  awareness  and 
impulsivity.

However, they state that it was not possible to identify 
whether  these  associations  are  characteristic  of  BPD 
symptoms  or  would  be  characteristic  of  the  altered 
cognitive processes (Flasbeck et al., 2020). This could 
occur  because  there  are  no  longitudinal  studies  to 
determine  a  cause–effect  relationship,  and 
is 
unknown  whether  the  characteristics  of  the  altered 
cognitive  processing  would  be  prior  to  the  disorder 
or if they correspond to a progression at the neurobio-
logical level because of the development of BPD (Win-
sper et al., 2016).

it 

For their part, the review by Penengo et al. (2022) 
point  out  alterations  in  the  amplitudes  and  latencies 
of  the  positive  components  (P50,  P100  and  P300)  in 
patients  with  BPD,  which  could  provide  information 
in  the  detection  of  altered  neural  correlates  in  atten-
tion deficit processing, impulsivity and psychotic sus-
ceptibility. Unoka and Richman (2016) conclude that 
cognitive  impairment  is  what  distinguishes  patients 
with BPD compared to the control group. Impairment 
that  is  present  in  processes  associated  with  decision- 
making, memory, difficulty in changing mental  state, 
response  inhibition  and  planning,  relating  to  impul-
sivity, 
and 
emotional dysregulation (Unoka & Richman, 2016).

self-injury,  dissociative 

symptoms 

The meta-regression analyses analyzed the percen-
tage  of  women,  Gini,  and  GDP.  It  was  observed  that 
the percentage of women and GDP had no significant 
effect.  However,  the  Gini,  which  measures  economic 
inequality, did have a significant effect as a moderating 
variable.  The  literature  has  indicated  that  optimal 
access  to  economic  resources  is  considered  a  protec-
tive factor for emotional, social, and financial burden, 
but  when  inequality  exists,  this  factor  interacts  with 
neurobiological  mechanisms  associated  with  trauma 
(Harnett  et  al.,  2023).  Furthermore,  it  has  been 
observed  that  in  impoverished  urban  environments 
BPD  symptoms  is  higher  (García  et  al.,  2010).  This 
is  consistent  with  new  theories  on  the  psychological 
impact  of  traumatic  events  (Leiva-Bianchi  et  al.,  
2018)  and  recent  findings  on  PTSD  symptoms 
(Cáceres et al., 2022).

Regarding the evaluation of potential biases in the 
study,  the  indicators  showed  good  results.  However, 
ZEgger  was  significant.  This  can  be  explained  by  the 
values  reported  in  Ramos-Loyo  et  al.  (2021)  where  a 
small  sample  (N = 11)  and  a  very  high  correlation  (r  
= .85) can be observed.

Therefore,  the  P300  component  could  be  con-
sidered  for  use  as  a  possible  biomarker  to  identify 
altered  neural  correlates  in  BPD.  The  present  meta- 
analysis  supports  the  proposition  that  an  altered 
P300 would be present in disorders related to exposure 
to  traumatic  events  such  as  BPD.  Adverse  events 
during childhood and prenatally have been identified 
as being involved in the development of altered cogni-
tive  processes,  emotional  dysregulation,  impulsivity, 

and  dysfunctional  behaviours  (Lieb  et  al.,  2004; 
Palumbo et al., 2018). However, a distinct neural cor-
relate  between  BPD,  PTSD,  CPTSD  has  not  yet  been 
established (Azcárate et al., 2017).

The  relationship  found  between  P300  and  BPD 
symptoms could be used as an indicator of improve-
ment  in  therapeutic  processes,  because  it  is  possible 
to  observe  through  the  learning  of  cognitive  skills, 
an  improvement  in  cognitive  processes  related  to 
BPD  clinical  symptoms  (Unoka  &  Richman,  2016; 
Vai  et  al.,  2021).  This  would  be  possible  to  achieve 
using effective therapies, such as, Dialectical Behavior 
Therapy  (DBT),  Mentalization  Therapy,  Eye  Move-
ment  Desensitization  and  Reprocessing  (Bradley 
et  al.,  2005;  Choi-Kain  et  al.,  2021;  Ehring  et  al.,  
2014; Watts et al., 2013).

The  limitations of  this  study lie  in  the  diversity of 
methods  and  samples  used.  The  selected  articles 
used  different  paradigms  or  tasks  during  ERP 
measurements.  The  symptoms  assessed  also  varied 
(e.g.  risk-taking  decisions,  impulsivity,  emotion  dys-
regulation  and  global  BPD  symptoms).  The  number 
of  meta-analyzable  studies  made  it  impossible  to 
control  for  these  sources  of  variability.  Finally, 
further  studies  with  event-related  potentials  are  rec-
ommended  to  determine  what  other  ERP  com-
ponents  might  exhibit  BPD-associated  symptoms 
and  to  determine  whether  other  potential  bio-
markers  might  exist.
