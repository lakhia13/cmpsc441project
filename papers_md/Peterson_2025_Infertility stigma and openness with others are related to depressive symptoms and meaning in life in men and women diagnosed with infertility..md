Abstract 
Background  Stigma is the experience of feeling different from socially accepted norms which can lead to personal 
devaluation or fear of disapproval from others. For men and women experiencing infertility, stigma has been associ-
ated with psychological distress, feelings of otherness in relation to people with children, and selective disclosure 
with others about their infertility challenges. However, there are few studies which examine how infertility stigma 
and being open with others are related to depressive symptoms and meaning in life for men and women diagnosed 
with infertility.

Methods  Participants experiencing infertility were recruited for this cross-sectional study during November 
2023-January 2024 via announcements on infertility discussion listservs and social media accounts. Four-hundred 
fifty-eight women and 89 men completed an online survey. Participants were primarily from the United States (81%), 
followed by Europe, Canada, and Australia/New Zealand. Participants completed validated and reliable measures 
of infertility stigma, openness with others, depressive symptoms and meaning in life.

Results  Hierarchical regression models explained substantial variance (adjusted R-squared) for depressive symptoms 
(41% men; 27% women), search for meaning in life (12% men; 14% women), and presence of meaning in life (19% 
men; 25% women). For both men and women, higher personal infertility stigma was significantly related with higher 
depressive symptoms and search for meaning. For both men and women, higher openness with others about infertil-
ity was significantly associated with lower levels of depressive symptoms and greater presence of meaning.

Conclusions  The current findings support prior research indicating a significant association between infertility 
stigma and depressive symptoms and adds to the infertility literature by offering new insights into the relationships 
between stigma, openness with others, and meaning in life. Health care providers can use these findings to assist indi-
viduals and couples in reducing infertility stigma through collaborative conversations that reduce feelings of personal 
failure. Providers can also help those with infertility challenges to reduce psychological distress and increase meaning 
in life through accessing existing social networks and expanding social connections with others in ways that facilitate 
support.

Plain Language Summary 
An infertility diagnosis can lead to feelings of inadequacy, loss, and difficulty being open with family and friends. It 
can also affect how people view the meaning and purpose of their life. This study explores how infertility stigma 
and being open with others relates to depressive symptoms and meaning in life for men and women experienc-
ing infertility. When someone feels infertility stigma, they feel different from others and may question the fairness 
of life. When someone is open about infertility, they are likely to share their struggles with others. This study found 
that men and women who felt higher levels of infertility stigma had more depressive symptoms and were more 
likely to question the meaning of their lives. On the other hand, men and women who were more open with oth-
ers had fewer depressive symptoms and sensed more meaning in their lives. The researchers encourage health care 
providers to help patients reduce infertility stigma, while helping them be open in ways that lead to positive support 
and increased opportunities to create new meaning.

Background
Stigma  occurs  when  an  individual  or  a  group  with  cer-
tain  characteristics  that  differentiate  them  from  other 
members of society, sense public disapproval or personal 
devaluation  [1,  2].  For  men  and  women  with  infertility, 
they may experience stigma as a negative feeling of being 
socially different from others that can lead to psychologi-
cal  distress,  fears  of  undesirable  judgments,  and  selec-
tive disclosures with others [3, 4]. “We keep the fact that 
we are undergoing assisted reproduction very secret, we 
don’t  tell.  Our  family  does  not  know.  Very  few  friends 
know” (Klaus et al., [1]).

Infertility is defined as a disease of the male or female 
reproductive system resulting in the inability to conceive 
a  pregnancy  after  12  months  or  more  of  regular  unpro-
tected  intercourse  [5].  People  with  infertility  commonly 
internalize  negative  societal  or  cultural  attitudes  about 
the failure to have a child, leading to feelings of inferior-
ity,  a  sense  of  otherness  compared  to  people  with  chil-
dren,  social  isolation,  and  internalized  shame  [1,  6–8]. 
Furthermore,  infertility  can  be  experienced  as  a  devel-
opmental interruption in a couple’s expected life course, 
leading  one  or  both  partners  to  question  their  identity, 
views  about  parenthood,  and  beliefs  about  life’s  mean-
ing  [9].  This  is  particularly  true  in  pronatalist  countries 
where infertility is associated with increased stigma, less 
happiness, and lower life satisfaction [3, 10, 11].

Couples  with  infertility  are  more  likely  to  experi-
ence  depressive  symptoms  compared  to  fertile  couples 
[12,  13],  and  depressive  symptoms  in  one  partner  can 
impact  the  level  of  distress  in  the  other  [14].  A  system-
atic  review  of  17  quantitative  studies  from  13  countries 
found strong evidence of a significant positive association 
between  infertility  stigma  and  depressive  symptoms  in 
women  [15].  Qualitative  studies  have  found  that  stigma 
and  depression  are  commonly  reported  by  men  experi-
encing infertility [16, 17], however, there are few studies 

that directly examine how stigma is related to depression 
in men [18].

In  addition  to  increased  psychological  distress,  infer-
tility can also lead men and women to reconsider mean-
ing  in  their  lives  as  they  question  assumptions  about 
life’s  fairness,  identity,  and  parenthood  [9].  Meaning  in 
life consists of two components: the search for meaning 
and  the  presence  of  meaning  [19].  Search  for  meaning 
is defined as ongoing efforts to discover and make sense 
of one’s meaning and purpose in life. Presence of mean-
ing, on the other hand, is defined as having a clear sense 
that one’s aim and purpose in life is meaningful [19]. In 
a  study  of  women  trying  to  conceive,  the  presence  of 
meaning was related to the use of adaptive coping strate-
gies, whereas the search for meaning predicted increased 
ruminations  about  getting  pregnant,  increased  suppres-
sion  of  emotions  and  thoughts,  and  decreased  sharing 
with others about their attempts at pregnancy [20].

The  unexpected  and  stressful  nature  of  the  infertility 
experience can lead couples to feel uncertain about what 
challenges  to  share  and  with  whom.  This  is  particularly 
true for men who are less open than women about infer-
tility,  even  when  they  report  less  stigma  [4].  A  global 
study  of  1,171  men  with  infertility  in  five  geographic 
regions through the world found that 73% were not very 
likely to talk about their infertility with others [21]. Men 
also commonly report being less open with their partner 
about infertility stress to support and protect their part-
ner from burdening them with their own personal strug-
gles  [22].  Men’s  reluctance  to  disclose  their  infertility 
struggles with others may also be related to the amount 
of infertility stigma they feel, which is embedded in social 
and cultural norms of masculinity and shame [4, 16, 17]. 
However,  if  men  are  more  open  about  infertility,  there 
may  be  potential  benefits.  A  study  of  170  Italian  men 
found that men who shared their infertility struggles with 
others reported significantly fewer depressive symptoms 
compared to men who did not [23].

Despite the risk of experiencing infertility stigma, more 
depressive  symptoms,  less  meaning,  and  greater  chal-
lenges  to  being  open  with  others  about  infertility,  there 
have  been  few  studies  examining  the  specific  relation-
ships between these variables [15, 23] Because infertility 
has  a  lifetime  prevalence  of  17.5%  globally,  it  is  vital  to 
study  these  factors  as  they  are  deeply  embedded  in  the 
personal  and  social  experience  of  infertility  among  men 
and  women  around  the  world  [24].  The  current  study 
examined  how  depressive  symptoms  and  meaning  in 
life are related to men and women’s internalized infertil-
ity  stigma  and  levels  of  openness  with  others.  A  greater 
understanding of how these variables impact each other 
can  offer  people  coping  with  infertility,  counselors,  and 
healthcare providers additional support and resources to 
better manage the infertility experience.

Our  study  was  guided  by  two  primary  hypotheses. 
First, that greater infertility self-stigma would be associ-
ated with greater depressive symptoms, more search for 
meaning,  and  less  presence  of  meaning  in  life.  Second, 
that  higher  openness  with  others  would  be  related  with 
lower  depressive  symptoms,  lower  search  for  meaning, 
and higher presence of meaning in life.

Methods
Study design and participants

The study used a cross-sectional design where data were 
collected once at a single point in time [25]. Participants 
completed  an  online  survey  from  November  2023  to 
January  2024  and  were  recruited  via  listservs  and  social 
media sites of Uniquely Knitted – a U.S. based non-profit 
organization  that  provides  information  and  low-cost 
therapist-led process groups for the infertility community 
throughout the world. A total of N = 1030 people clicked 
on the survey and completed at least one item; of them, 
682 completed the survey. Several attention checks were 
used  to  ensure  data  quality  questions  (e.g.,  repeating 
items that has been previously asked, asking participants 
to  ‘click  strongly  agree’  as  an  item  response),  thereby 
increasing  the  trustworthiness  of  responses  by  eliminat-
ing those who may have sped through the survey without 
carefully reading many of the questions. This led to a final 
sample of 547 participants (458 women and 89 men).

Ethical approval and study procedure

The  study  was  approved  by  the  first  author’s  university 
institutional  review  board  (IRB).  The  survey  was  adver-
tised as an “infertility study” focused on people’s experi-
ences  with  infertility.  The  survey  was  estimated  to  take 
15–20 min to complete. After clicking on the study link, 
participants read a consent form providing more details 
about  the  study’s  content.  They  were  then  given  the 
option to continue with the survey or stop participation. 

Participants  who  provided  informed  consent  completed 
demographic  questions,  followed  by  questions  about 
their infertility history, and questions from validated psy-
chological measures. Participants who completed the full 
survey were entered into a random drawing of five $100 
gift  cards  for  Amazon.com,  which  were  selected  in  the 
Spring of 2024.

Infertility‑related measures
Infertility self‑stigma

Participants completed the 7-item Self-Devaluation sub-
scale of the Infertility Stigma Scale [26]. This measure is 
used  to  assess  internalized  stigma  and  negative  feelings 
about  the  self  because  of  one’s  infertility.  Participants 
were  asked  how  much  they  agreed  with  each  state-
ment. Three example items were “I am ashamed of being 
infertile,” “I look down on myself because of my infertil-
ity,”  and  “I  feel  inferior  to  others  because  of  my  infertil-
ity.”  Participants  answered  on  a  5-point  response  scale 
(1 = Totally  disagree,  5 = Totally  agree).  The  items  were 
averaged, with higher scores indicating greater self-deval-
uation. McDonald’s Omega showed high internal consist-
ency among the items for men (Ω = 0.90) and for women 
(Ω = 0.86).

Infertility diagnosis and treatment

We  created  several  items  to  assess  experiences  with 
infertility.  Participants  were  asked  for  their  infertility 
diagnosis  (male-factor,  female-factor,  combine-factor,  or 
unexplained  factor)  or  if  they  had  not  been  diagnosed 
with infertility. Participants who had not been diagnosed 
with  infertility  were  excluded  from  this  sample.  Partici-
pants were also asked for the length of time since diagno-
sis, infertility treatment history, and whether or not they 
had a child with their current or a former partner.

General psychological measures
Depressive symptoms

Participants completed the 10-item Center for Epidemio-
logic  Studies  Short  Depression  Scale  (CES-D-10  [27]). 
This  measure  is  used  to  assess  depressive  symptomatol-
ogy  in  the  general  population.  Participants  were  asked 
how often they were experiencing the issues described by 
each item. Three example items were “I felt depressed,” “I 
felt  lonely,”  and  “I  felt  hopeful  about  the  future  (reverse 
coded).”  Participants  answered  on  a  4-point  response 
scale  (0 = Rarely  or  none  of  the  time  (less  than  1  day); 
3 = All  of  the  time  (Every  day  or  almost  every  day).  The 
items  were  summed  and  reverse  coded  when  indicated, 
and  higher  scores  indicated  greater  depressive  symp-
toms. McDonald’s Omega showed high internal consist-
ency among the items for men (Ω = 0.83) and for women 
(Ω = 0.87).

Search for meaning and presence of meaning

Participants  completed  the  10-item  Meaning  in  Life 
Questionnaire [19]. This measure contains two subscales 
assessing  the  search  for  and  presence  of  meaning,  each 
containing  five  items  each.  Two  examples  of  search  for 
meaning were “I am always looking to find my life’s pur-
pose”  and  “I  am  searching  for  meaning  in  my  life.”  Two 
examples  of  presence  of  meaning  were  “I  understand 
my life’s meaning” and “my life has a clear sense of pur-
pose.” Participants responded on a 7-point response scale 
(1 = Absolutely  untrue,  7 = Absolutely  true).  The  items 
in each sub-scale were averaged with higher total scores 
indicating  higher  levels  of  either  presence  or  search  for 
meaning. McDonald’s Omega showed high internal con-
sistency among the presence and searching items for men 
(Ω = 91.  and  0.93)  and  for  women  (Ω = 0.87  and  0.91), 
respectively.

Openness to others

Participants  completed  the  8-item  Openness  to  Oth-
ers—Revised Questionnaire [23]. This measure is used to 
assess the extent to which people rely on their partners, 
friends,  family,  and  others  as  confidants.  Participants 
were asked how much they agreed with statements about 
how open they are with others using a 4-point response 
scale  (1 = Strongly  disagree,  4 = Strongly  agree)  with 
higher  scores  indicating  greater  openness.  We  assessed 
openness by creating two subscales: openness to partner 
(2  items)  and  general  openness  to  others  (4  items).  The 
openness  to  partners  items  were  both  reverse  coded: 
“There  are  some  concerns  I  prefer  to  keep  to  myself  in 
order  not  to  burden  my  partner,”  and  “I  think  that  if  I 
say how I really feel, I could demoralize my partner.” The 
general  openness  items  were  “Beyond  my  partner,  there 
are other people that I feel close to and with whom I am 
open  with,”  “I  share  all  my  problems  with  my  family,” 
“There is a person who is a true source of support for me,” 
and “I have no difficulty sharing all my problems with my 
friends.”

We  then  omitted  the  two  additional  items  from  the 
general  openness  subscale.  The  first  item  was  omit-
ted  because  it  overlapped  conceptually  with  depression: 
“Sometimes I feel so down I think that nobody could help 
me.”  We  were  concerned  that  the  inclusion  of  this  item 
assessing how “down” they feel would artificially bias the 
results  in  favor  of  our  hypothesis  when  predicting  our 
primary  outcome  measure  of  depression.  The  second 
item that we omitted was “I’d like to open up more with 
others.”  This  item  was  distinct  from  the  other  general 
openness  items  in  that  it  measured  a  hypothetical  (e.g., 
an  attitude  about  wanting  to  open  up)  as  opposed  to  a 
tangible  relationship  or  behavior  (e.g.,  sharing  problems 
with family and opening up to people besides a partner).

An  exploratory  factor  analysis  (principal  axis  factor-
ing  with  promax  rotation)  supported  this  two-subscale 
approach. The factor analysis revealed one general open-
ness to others factor with the four aforementioned items 
(29.56%  of  variance;  Eigenvalue = 2.37)  and  one  part-
ner  openness  factor  with  the  two  aforementioned  items 
(16.71%  of  variance;  Eigenvalue = 1.34).  All  factor  load-
ings  for  these  items  on  their  primary  factors  exceeded 
0.40.  The  factor  analysis  also  hinted  at  a  third  potential 
factor with just a single item (13.52% of variance; Eigen-
value = 1.08),  containing  the  hypothetical  opening  up 
item (factor loading = 0.45). The depression item did not 
load on any factor (all < 0.40).

We therefore proceeded with creating the openness to 
partner and general openness to others subscales. Cron-
bach’s  alpha  was  calculated  for  the  openness  to  part-
ner  subscale  because  there  were  only  two  items,  and  it 
showed  high  internal  consistency  between  the  items  for 
men  (α = 0.71)  and  for  women  (α = 0.73).  McDonald’s 
Omega  showed  moderate  internal  consistency  among 
the  general  openness  items  for  men  (Ω = 0.59)  and  for 
women (Ω = 0.66).

Overview of data analytic approach
Statistical analyses

Correlations among key variables, along with a series of 
hierarchical  regressions,  were  conducted  separately  for 
men and women. Because over half of the 89 men had a 
partner who also participated in the study, we ran sepa-
rate  regressions  for  men  and  women  to  avoid  violating 
the assumption of independence of observations. All con-
tinuous  predictor  and  outcome  measures  were  z-scored 
separately  by  gender  so  that  the  z-scores  were  centered 
around  the  means  for  each  gender.  These  variables 
included  age,  time  since  diagnosis,  education,  infertility 
self-devaluation,  openness  to  partner,  general  openness, 
and  depressive  symptoms.  Categorical  variables  were 
dummy coded using 0 and 1. All regression analyses were 
conducted hierarchically. The steps were ordered to iden-
tify the amount of explained variance that was added to 
the  model  for  each  variable  beginning  with  more  inter-
nally focused and intrapersonal variables and moving to 
more externally focused and interpersonal variables. Step 
1 included demographics (age, education), Step 2 added 
infertility  factors  (time  since  diagnosis,  diagnosis  type, 
trying  to  have  first  child,  and  current  treatment  status), 
Step  3  added  infertility  self-stigma,  and  Step  4  added 
openness  to  partner  and  openness  to  others.  Parallel 
analyses  were  conducted  for  men  and  women  for  each 
outcome variable.

We  highlight  the  total  adjusted  R2  and  the  change  in 
adjusted  R2  for  each  step  of  the  model  to  demonstrate 
the  extent  to  which  infertility  factors  (Step  2)  added

predictive  value  above  and  beyond  demographics  (Step 
1),  how  infertility  stigma  added  predictive  value  above 
and beyond demographics and infertility factors (Step 3), 
and how openness to others and partners added predic-
tive value above and beyond these variables (Step 4). Age 
was chosen as a predictor because age is related to infer-
tility, and education level is related to access to resources 
and treatment options. Key experiences related to infer-
tility  diagnoses  and  treatment,  such  as  time  since  diag-
noses and history of receiving treatment, were entered in 
case these factors affect depressive symptoms and mean-
ing. We split the psychological measures into ones assess-
ing  negative  psychological  experiences  (internalized 
stigma) and hypothesized protective factors (openness to 
partners and others) to establish whether the presence of 
protective factors explained variance in depressive symp-
toms  and  meaning  above  and  beyond  the  demographic, 
infertility factors, and stigma. For our key hypotheses, we 
report  and  focus  our  attention  on  the  regression  coeffi-
cients generated for each predictor in the fourth and final 
step  rather  than  the  individual  coefficient  values  in  the 
previous steps.

Interpreting effect sizes

Cohen [28] suggested effect size d can be interpreted as 
small (0.20), moderate (0.50), or large  (0.80), which cor-
respond to Pearson’s r correlations of 0.10, 0.24, and 0.37, 
respectively. Ferguson ([29] p. 533) recommended higher 
thresholds for what constitutes a “‘practically’ significant 
effect for social science data” (d = 0.41; β or r = 0.20). To 
strike a balance between Type I versus Type II errors, we 
focused on associations that were (a) statistically signifi-
cant  at  the  p < 0.05  level,  but  only  if  (b)  the  associations 
were  r >|.09|,  or  β >|.09|.  We  then  gave  special  atten-
tion  to  statistically  significant  findings  with  effect  sizes 
of  r  or  β >|.19|.  Furthermore,  in  the  tables,  we  noted 
whether associations were significant at p < 0.05, 0.01, or 
0.001 threshold, with smaller p values indicating greater 
confidence  in  rejecting  the  null  hypothesis.  All  results 
reported  in  the  results  section  were  statistically  signifi-
cant at least at the p = 0.05 level, unless otherwise noted.

Results
Sample characteristics

Participants  included  458  women  and  89  men  who 
reported  that  they,  their  partners,  or  both  had  received 
an infertility diagnosis. The mean age for the sample was 
34.0  (SD = 5.4)  for  men  and  32.9  (SD = 4.5)  for  women. 
Of  the  participants,  39.2%  were  currently  undergoing 
treatment,  36.9%  had  received  treatment  in  the  past, 
and  23.9%  had  never  undergone  treatment.  Female-
factor  infertility  was  reported  as  the  most  common 
diagnosis  (37.8%),  followed  by  unexplained  (33.8%), 

(15.9%),  and  male-factor 

combined-factor 
(12.4%). 
Eighty-nine percent of participants had a college (50.1%) 
or  advanced  degree  (38.6).  Eighty-five  percent  of  the 
sample identified as White, followed by Hispanic (5.3%), 
Biracial  (4.7%),  and  Asian  (4.0%).  Participants  were  pri-
marily  from  the  United  States  (81.2%),  followed  by 
Europe  (7.3%),  Canada  (7.3%),  and  Australia/New  Zea-
land  (2.4%).  Additional  demographic  details  of  the  final 
sample can be found in Table 1.

Zero‑order correlations among key variables

The  zero-order  correlations  among  variables  are  shown 
in  Table  2.  Consistent  with  the  hypotheses,  for  both 
men  and  women,  greater  infertility  self-stigma  was  sig-
nificantly  associated  with  greater  depressive  symptoms 
and  greater  search  for  meaning.  Partially  consistent 
with  the  hypothesis,  greater  infertility  stigma  was  asso-
ciated  with  lower  presence  of  meaning  for  women,  and 
was in this predicted direction for men, but the associa-
tion  for  men  was  not  statistically  significant.  Consistent 
with  the  hypotheses,  for  both  men  and  women,  greater 
openness to others was associated with lower depressive 
symptoms,  less  search  for  meaning,  and  greater  pres-
ence of meaning. Also consistent with the hypotheses, for 
women, higher openness with their partners was associ-
ated  with  lower  depressive  symptoms  and  lower  search 
for  meaning.  Partially  consistent  with  the  hypotheses, 
for men, greater openness to partner was only associated 
with lower depressive symptoms, but not with search or 
presence  of  meaning.  Although  it  was  not  the  primary 
focus of our analyses, we also noted that infertility stigma 
was  associated  with  less  openness  to  others  for  men 
(r = −0.51, p < 0.001) and for women (r = −0.43, p < 0.001), 
and to less openness with partners for women, (r = −0.26, 
p < 0.001), but not for men (r = −0.18, p > 0.05).

Depressive symptoms

The multiple regression analyses were conducted to iso-
late  the  strength  of  each  predictor  variable  when  con-
trolling for the others. Table 3 presents the results of the 
hierarchical regression for depressive symptoms showing 
that the variables explained 41% of the variance for men 
and  27%  of  the  variance  for  women.  In  Step  1,  demo-
graphic  variables  did  not  contribute  any  explained  vari-
ance for men and contributed only 1% in women, without 
any specific variable significantly contributing to depres-
sive symptoms. In Step 2, infertility variables contributed 
an insignificant 4% to the explained variance for men and 
contributed 3% of the variance for women showing that 
currently being in treatments was associated with higher 
depressive  symptoms  in  women.  In  Step  3,  infertility 
stigma  contributed  an  additional  19%  of  the  explained 
variance for men and 15% for women. In Step 4, openness

with  others  and  partner  contributed  an  additional  18% 
of  the  explained  variance  for  depressive  symptoms  in 
men,  and  an  additional  9%  in  women.  Consistent  with 
the hypotheses, in the final model (Step 4), greater infer-
tility  stigma  for  both  men  and  women  was  associated 
with higher depressive symptoms (men β = 0.23; women 
β = 0.24),  and  more  openness  to  others  was  related  to 
lower  depressive  symptoms  (men  β = −0.51;  women

partner was not associated with depressive symptoms.

Table 3 shows that regression variables explained 12% of 
the variance in search for meaning for men, and 14% of 
the  variance  for  women.  The  demographic  variables  in 
Step 1 accounted for an insignificant 2% to the explained 
variance for men and 2% for women, showing that lower

for meaning. The infertility variables in Step 2 accounted 
for an insignificant 4% to the explained variance for men 
and 4% for women, showing that having had treatment in

* p < .05, ** p < .01, *** p < .001, † p < .06. Hierarchical regression analyses were conducted to identify the roles of demographic (Step 1), infertility factors (Step 2), 
stigma (Step 3), and openness (Step 4) in predicting the outcomes of interest. The Beta (β) values displayed in the table represent those identified in the fourth and 
final step. The Adjusted. R2 is shown in each step. The * next to these values indicate if there was significant increase in percentage of variance explained over the 
previous step. For example, adding Step 3 predictors (.23) explained more variance in depression among men than the predictors included in Step 2 (.04). As shown in 
the bottom row, all final models after Step 4 was added were statistically significant predictors of the outcomes

the past was associated with lower search for meaning in 
women. In Step 3, infertility stigma contributed an addi-
tional 8% of the explained variance for  men,  and 7% for 
women, indicating that higher infertility stigma was asso-
ciated  with  higher  search  for  meaning.  In  Step  4,  open-
ness  with  others  did  not  add  any  additional  explained 
variance in search for meaning among men and only an 
increase  of  1%  for  women.  Consistent  with  the  hypoth-
eses, in the final model (Step 4), greater infertility stigma 
for  both  men  and  women  was  associated  with  higher 
search for meaning (men β = 0.26; women β = 0.20), how-
ever the association for men was only marginally signifi-
cant (p = 0.06). Also consistent with the hypothesis, more 

openness  to  others  among  women  was  related  to  lower 
search  for  meaning  (β = −0.13),  whereas  openness  to 
partner was not related to search for meaning in men or 
women.

Presence of meaning

Table 3 shows that the variables in the regression model 
for  presence  of  meaning  explained  19%  of  the  vari-
ance  for  men,  and  25%  of  the  variance  for  women.  The 
demographic variables in Step 1 accounted for 8% of the 
explained  variance  for  men  and  an  insignificant  1%  of 
the  explained  variance  for  women,  showing  that  higher 
education  in  men  was  associated  with  higher  presence

of  meaning.  In  Step  2,  the  infertility  variables  contrib-
uted  an  insignificant  5%  to  the  explained  variance  for 
men and 9% of the explained variance for women, show-
ing that already having a child was associated with higher 
presence  of  meaning  in  women.  In  Step  3,  infertility 
stigma  contributed  an  insignificant  2%  to  the  explained 
variance  for  men,  and  11%  for  women.  In  Step  4,  open-
ness  with  others  contributed  an  insignificant  4%  of  the 
explained variance for presence of meaning for men, and 
4%  for  women.  In  partial  support  of  the  hypotheses,  in 
the final model (Step 4), greater infertility stigma among 
women  was  associated  with  lower  presence  of  meaning 
(β = −0.23),  but  this  association  was  not  significant  for 
men  (β = −0.04).  In  support  of  the  hypotheses,  greater 
openness  to  others  was  associated  for  both  men  and 
women  with  higher  presence  of  meaning  (men  β = 0.29; 
women β = 0.22). In contrast to the hypotheses, openness 
to partner was not associated with presence of meaning 
for men or women.

Exploratory analyses of note

We  also  took  the  opportunity  to  examine  any  other 
large  associations  that  were  statistically  significant  that 
might  be  of  interest  (βs > 0.19  and  p < 0.05).  Although  it 
was  not  an  a  priori  hypothesis,  we  noted  a  strong  asso-
ciation between trying to have a child and women’s pres-
ence of meaning. Women who were not currently trying 
to have a child were much more likely to report presence 
of  meaning  in  their  lives  (β = 0.53),  or  viewed  another 
way,  women  who  were  currently  trying  to  have  a  child 
reported  less  presence  of  meaning  in  their  lives.  Simi-
larly, we noted that men with higher levels of education 
reported greater presence of meaning, and that men had 
fewer  depressive  symptoms  the  more  time  had  passed 
since  they  were  informed  about  an  infertility  diagnosis. 
Finally, there was an unusually large association between 
fertility diagnosis and depressive symptoms among men, 
with men who reported a male-factor diagnosis exhibit-
ing  notably  lower  depressive  symptoms  than  men  with 
female-factor,  combined,  or  unknown-factor  diagnoses. 
Given the small sample of men in the male-factor group, 
however, this is not a finding we emphasize.

Discussion
The findings from this study provide support for our two 
research hypotheses. First, consistent with Hypothesis 1, 
greater infertility stigma (e.g., they experienced attitudes 
such as “I am ashamed of being infertile”) was related for 
men  and  women  to  greater  depressive  symptoms  and 
search  for  meaning.  Partially  in  support  of  Hypothesis 
1,  greater  infertility  stigma  was  associated  with  lower 
presence  of  meaning  for  women,  but  not  men.  Consist-
ent with Hypothesis 2, greater openness with others was 

associated  with  lower  depressive  symptoms  and  greater 
presence  of  meaning  for  men  and  women.  Partially  in 
support  of  Hypothesis  2,  greater  openness  with  others 
was related to lower search for meaning for women, but 
not men.

Infertility self‑stigma was consistently related with higher 
depressive symptoms and search for meaning

Experiencing  stigma  is  known  to  have  negative  associa-
tions with mental and physical health, making it impera-
tive to understand and address in the context of infertility 
[30].  Infertility  stigma  is  reported  by  men  and  women 
throughout  the  world  and  is  embedded  in  cultural  and 
personal  beliefs  about  parenthood,  femininity,  and  mas-
culinity [7, 21, 31–33],). When personal infertility stigma 
was  included  in  our  regression  model,  it  explained  sub-
stantially  greater  variance  in  depressive  symptoms  for 
men  and  women  compared  to  models  only  including 
demographic  and  infertility  variables.  These  findings 
build  on  the  existing  literature  identifying  infertility 
stigma as a correlate of psychological distress in women 
[7,  30]  and  adds  to  the  limited  emerging  evidence  of  a 
potential  relationship  between  infertility  stigma  and 
depressive symptoms in men [16, 18, 34].

It  is  possible  that  the  relationship  between  personal 
stigma  and  depressive  symptoms  in  men  and  women 
in  our  study  can  be  explained  by  the  emotional  conse-
quences  of  self-criticism,  self-judgment,  and  feelings  of 
inferiority compared to people with children [1, 4, 7, 8]. 
The  role  of  internalized  shame  may  also  play  an  impor-
tant  role,  which  occurs  when  a  person  believes  they  are 
viewed negatively in the minds of others (external shame) 
and  internalizes  these  beliefs  as  truths  about  the  inad-
equacy  and  defectiveness  of  the  self  (internal  shame).  A 
previous  study  of  couples  pursuing  infertility  treatment 
found  that  shame  and  self-judgment  were  significantly 
associated with depressive symptoms [8].

The  association  between  stigma  and  increased  search 
for  meaning  was  also  consistent  with  our  hypothesis. 
Search  for  meaning  is  reported  when  people  feel  a  lack 
of clear purpose in their lives and are continually search-
ing  for  something  that  makes  life  feel  significant.  For 
men and women, infertility is an unexpected life stressor 
that  can  disrupt  identity  and  dismantle  previously  cher-
ished  beliefs  about  meaning,  fairness,  and  purpose  in 
life.  Although  the  search  for  meaning  has  rarely  been 
explored  in  men  and  women  experiencing  infertility,  a 
study  of  women  trying  to  conceive  found  the  search  for 
meaning  predicted  increased  ruminations,  emotional 
suppression,  and  decreased  sharing  with  others  about 
trying  to  become  pregnant  [20].  While  we  hypoth-
esized  this  relationship  would  be  present  in  the  current 
study, it is also possible that the search for meaning may 

Peterson et al. Reproductive Health  (2025) 22:7

Page 9 of 12

contribute to future psychological adjustment if it aids in 
the  process  of  meaning  creation  and  acceptance  which 
has been associated with long-term adjustment to unmet 
parenting goals following infertility treatments [35].

Cultural and social beliefs play a key role in the search 
for  meaning  and  its  relationship  to  psychological  well-
being [36]. A cross-national study found that the search 
for meaning was positively associated with happiness and 
life satisfaction in collectivist societies, but was not asso-
ciated  with  well-being  in  individualistic  societies  where 
questioning  one’s  belief  systems  conflicts  with  the  need 
to maintain positive self-regard and self-image [37]. Our 
study  primarily  consisted  of  participants  from  Western 
societies  and  lends  support  to  these  findings.  However, 
because  infertility  is  associated  with  the  difficult  task  of 
reconstructing  altered  belief  systems  about  identity  and 
future  life  goals  [35],  additional  studies  exploring  how 
stigma  and  the  search  for  meaning  vary  across  cultures 
are needed.

Openness with others was significantly related with lower 
depressive symptoms and higher presence of meaning

Consistent  with  our  second  hypothesis,  openness  with 
others  was  associated  with  lower  depressive  symptoms 
in men and women. To our knowledge, there is only one 
other  study  that  has  examined  the  relationship  between 
openness  with  others  and  depressive  symptoms  dur-
ing infertility [23]. In that study, Italian men undergoing 
assisted reproductive treatment (ART) were divided into 
two  groups:  men  who  shared  their  infertility  experience 
with others, and men who did not share their experience. 
Men  who  shared  their  experience  with  others  reported 
significantly  lower  depressive  symptoms,  and  less  open-
ness  with  others  also  predicted  higher  depression  [23]. 
Our  study  supports  this  finding  as  the  relationship 
between openness and depressive symptoms in men had 
a  large  effect  size.  Our  findings  also  add  to  the  existing 
literature  by  showing  this  association  was  found  among 
women. Those who limit openness and sharing with oth-
ers  may  feel  a  sense  of  hopelessness  about  the  future  as 
they face the emotional burdens and challenges of infer-
tility alone. In contrast, greater openness with others may 
be a way to receive social support which is a key protec-
tive  factor  in  reducing  isolation  and  psychological  dis-
tress in couples experiencing infertility [1].

Increased  openness  with  others  was  also  associated 
with  greater  presence  of  meaning  in  men  and  women. 
Presence  of  meaning  occurs  when  people  have  clear 
beliefs about life’s purpose and significance and is associ-
ated with increased well-being, mental health, and adap-
tive coping strategies [38]. Despite its critical importance, 
we  know  very  little  about  the  relationship  between  the 
presence  of  meaning  in  life  and  being  open  with  others 

about infertility. In the current study, it is possible that a 
strong presence of meaning existed before infertility and 
helped  men  and  women  be  open  with  others  about  the 
stress  of  the  experience.  A  second  explanation  may  be 
that  increased  openness  with  others  aids  in  the  process 
of storytelling, an essential component of meaning-mak-
ing [39]. Storytelling is also a foundational component of 
talk therapy and there is strong evidence to support that 
talking with an empathic, attuned therapist is associated 
with meaning creation [40]. Those more open with oth-
ers  about  infertility  may  benefit  from  a  similar  process 
of sharing with a trusted other. Finally, greater openness 
with others might assist in the cognitive process of mean-
ing  creation  through  acceptance,  which  is  an  adaptive 
response  to  stressful  life  events  and  has  been  reported 
when infertility patients redefine their life’s priorities and 
have new beliefs about the world [35]

While  increased  openness  was  associated  with  lower 
depressive  symptoms  and  increased  presence  of  mean-
ing, it is important to note that not all openness leads to 
positive  outcomes  [1].  Thus,  caution  needs  to  be  taken 
in  assuming  the  directionality  and  causal  relationship 
between  openness,  depressive  symptoms,  and  meaning. 
A study on infertility in Brazilian couples found that while 
open  disclosure  with  others  produced  positive  benefits 
such  as  increased  emotional  intimacy,  demonstrations 
of  affection,  and  supportive  conversations  with  others, 
it  also  was  associated  with  perceived  judgment,  lack  of 
understanding,  and  strained  relationships  [1].  Because 
of  this  possibility,  some  couples  choose  to  actively  keep 
their infertility a secret from close friends and family. A 
lack of openness in this form might prove to be a protec-
tive factor for couples as opposed to a negative barrier to 
support. Future studies are needed to better understand 
the  complex  relationship  between  openness  and  psy-
chological  distress  during  infertility  by  differentiating  a 
protective lack of openness that shields individuals from 
harmful judgment, from a lack of openness that prevents 
them from gaining helpful support from others.

It is worth noting that a lack of openness with a part-
ner was not related to depressive symptoms or any of the 
outcomes  measured.  One  possible  explanation  is  that 
the  depth  of  measurement  on  openness  to  partner  (two 
items) was not sufficient to identify the variability in how 
people  relate  to  their  partner  in  ways  that  are  relevant 
to  depressive  symptoms  and  meaning.  Another  possi-
bility is that most participants were above the threshold 
of  openness  needed  to  maintain  a  positive  and  healthy 
level  of  communication  with  their  partners.  This  might 
be especially likely due to how the sample was recruited: 
from  an  organization  that  is  geared  towards  helping 
people  and  couples  discuss  and  manage  infertility,  with 
many of the men in the sample also coming via referrals 

 Peterson et al. Reproductive Health  (2025) 22:7

Page 10 of 12

communicated to them by their partners. Therefore, the 
key variability in levels of openness that could contribute 
to mental health and meaning was coming from external 
sources like family and friends.

adults are choosing not to become parents, and this can 
be  associated  with  high  life  satisfaction  [48].  Thus,  dif-
ferentiating  between  childlessness  due  to  infertility  and 
choosing to live childfree is an important distinction.

Implications for mental health & health care providers

Because there is evidence that psychosocial interventions 
benefit  both  men  and  women  experiencing  infertility 
[41], we propose that mental health and health care pro-
fessionals use the findings from this study to reduce the 
negative  impact  of  stigma  and  encourage  openness  that 
facilitates positive support and meaning creation. Empir-
ically-supported interventions such as cognitive restruc-
turing  can  be  used  to  reduce  self-criticism  and  increase 
acceptance  which  has  been  associated  to  lower  depres-
sive  symptoms  in  women  after  unsuccessful  infertility 
treatments  [42].  Fertility  counselors  can  also  help  men 
and women challenge unhelpful cultural scripts related to 
identity, masculinity, femininity, and parenthood that are 
linked  with  feelings  of  shame  and  secret  keeping.  Doc-
tors,  nurses,  and  health  providers  who  interact  directly 
with  patients  can  reduce  stigma  through  collaborative 
patient  conversations  that  ease  feelings  of  personal  fail-
ure and isolation. Finally, researchers, policymakers, and 
health professionals can work to reduce infertility stigma 
for men and women at the community level through pub-
lic  programs  and  education  that  increase  social  aware-
ness of the physical and emotional  burdens of  infertility 
[18, 43].

Fertility patients can also be encouraged to access their 
existing  social  networks  through  increased  openness,  as 
well  as  expand  their  networks  by  connecting  with  oth-
ers  experiencing  infertility.  By  directly  connecting  with 
the  infertility  community,  men  and  women  are  likely  to 
receive  support  that  is  characterized  by  greater  under-
standing  and  non-judgmental  acceptance  that  comes 
from  those  sharing  a  similar  challenge.  Joining  online 
communities  with  anonymous  discussion  boards  can 
offer valuable support, particularly for men who are less 
likely  to  access  in-person  social  support  [44,  45].  For 
men,  online  platforms  appear  to  be  important  because 
they provide a ‘safe space’ to share their emotional strug-
gles,  combat  isolation,  and  offer  empathy  and  support 
to  others  undergoing  similar  challenges  [46].  For  men 
and  women  who  express  difficulty  accessing  and  rely-
ing  on  social  networks,  counselors  can  use  empirically 
supported  interventions  such  as  expressive  writing  that 
reduces depressive symptoms and can assist in meaning 
creation [47].

Lastly,  counselors  and  health  professionals  should 
bear  in  mind  that  these  considerations  should  only  be 
applied  to  individuals  and  couples  experiencing  infer-
tility.  Throughout  the  world,  an  increasing  number  of 

Limitations and strengths

The  findings  from  the  current  study  should  be  noted  in 
the context of its limitations. First, the study used a cross-
sectional  design  which  does  not  allow  for  inferences  of 
causality. Second, participants were recruited through an 
organization dedicated to support coping with infertility, 
thus those not related to this organization may not have 
had the same opportunity to participate. Third, the main 
outcome  measures  were  assessed  by  self-report,  which 
can  be  limited  by  bias  and  socially  desirable  responses. 
Fourth, participation in the study itself is a form of open-
ness  about  infertility,  thus  men  and  women  who  chose 
to participate in the study may be more inclined to share 
information  about  their  infertility  than  those  who  did 
not  participate.  Fifth,  the  generalizability  of  findings  are 
limited by our use of a primarily Western sample. While 
geographic  comparisons  are  vital  in  highlighting  unique 
cultural  differences  in  the  experience  of  infertility,  such 
comparisons were beyond the scope of the current study 
and would not have been possible given the limited sam-
ple  size.  Finally,  the  findings  about  men  are  limited  due 
to the small sample, as well as an underrepresentation of 
men  with  a  male-factor  infertility  diagnosis  (11%  com-
pared to global estimates of 20–30%; [49]), making it dif-
ficult to understand the impact of infertility diagnosis on 
the outcome variables.

A  strength  of  our  study  is  we  measured  openness  in 
men and women which has been less examined in popu-
lations dealing with infertility. We also expanded beyond 
the  usual  focus  on  depressive  symptoms  as  a  nega-
tive  mental  health  variable  by  exploring  meaning  which 
offers  a  broader  and  more  positive  perspective.  Finally, 
although  the  number  of  men  in  the  study  is  limited, 
it  is  a  comparatively  large  sample  when  viewed  in  the 
context  of  infertility  studies.  It  is  well  documented  that 
men  are  underrepresented  in  social  science  and  infer-
tility  research  [50,  51],  and  new  recruitment  methods 
have been proposed to increase men’s participation [52]. 
Despite using targeted strategies such as partner recruit-
ment,  male-specific  social  media  recruitment  requests, 
and direct contact with men using the Uniquely Knitted 
alumni database, these efforts proved challenging. Future 
studies  that  explore  ways  to  increase  men’s  engagement 
and participation in infertility research are needed so we 
can advance our knowledge about the impact of key psy-
chological  variables  that  relate  to  men’s  adjustment  and 
well-being during the infertility experience.

Conclusion
This study highlights the vital relationships between per-
sonal infertility stigma, openness with others, depressive 
symptoms, and meaning in life in men and women expe-
riencing infertility. Counselors and health care providers 
can  work  to  reduce  infertility  stigma  through  collabora-
tive patient conversations and education that reduce feel-
ings of personal failure and isolation. In addition, fertility 
patients can be encouraged to find ways to express open-
ness  with  others  that  leads  to  positive  support  and 
increased opportunities to engage in meaning making.
