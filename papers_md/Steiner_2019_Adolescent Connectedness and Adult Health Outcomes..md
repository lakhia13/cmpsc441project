Abstract

BACKGROUND:  Because little is known about long-term effects of adolescent protective factors 
across multiple health domains, we examined associations between adolescent connectedness and 
multiple health-related outcomes in adulthood.

METHODS:  We used weighted data from Waves I and IV of the National Longitudinal Study 
of Adolescent to Adult Health (n = 14 800). Linear and logistic models were used to examine 
associations between family and school connectedness in adolescence and self-reported health 
risk behaviors and experiences in adulthood, including emotional distress, suicidal thoughts and 
attempts, physical violence victimization and perpetration, intimate partner physical and sexual 
violence victimization, multiple sex partners, condom use, sexually transmitted infection (STI) 
diagnosis, prescription drug misuse, and other illicit drug use.

RESULTS:  In multivariable analyses, school connectedness in adolescence had independent 
protective associations in adulthood, reducing emotional distress and odds of suicidal ideation, 
physical violence victimization and perpetration, multiple sex partners, STI diagnosis, prescription 
drug misuse, and other illicit drug use. Similarly, family connectedness had protective effects 
for emotional distress, all violence indicators, including intimate partner violence, multiple sex 
partners, STI diagnosis, and both substance use indicators. Compared to individuals with low 
scores for each type of connectedness, having high levels of both school and family connectedness

was associated with 48% to 66% lower odds of health risk behaviors and experiences in adulthood, 
depending on the outcome.

CONCLUSIONS:  Family and school connectedness may have long-lasting protective effects 
across multiple health outcomes related to mental health, violence, sexual behavior, and substance 
use. Increasing both family and school connectedness during adolescence has the potential to 
promote overall health in adulthood.

Adolescence is widely recognized as a critical developmental period that shapes individual 
trajectories into adulthood. During adolescence, many young people engage in risk 
behaviors or experience adverse events that contribute to poor health outcomes and 
diminished life opportunities.1-3 For example, a robust body of literature has linked adverse 
experiences in adolescence to mental health issues, violence victimization and perpetration, 
risky sexual behaviors, and substance use in adulthood.4-7 Preventing negative trajectories 
spurred by adolescent health risk behaviors and experiences is particularly important given 
their prevalence. Data from the 2017 Youth Risk Behavior Survey indicate that in the 
previous year, 17.2% of US high school students have seriously considered attempting 
suicide, and 19.0% have been bullied on school property. Lifetime, 9.7% have had ≥4 sex 
partners, and 14.0% have misused prescription pain medicine.8

However, adolescence is not solely characterized by risk. Researchers have identified 
protective factors at multiple levels of the social ecology that either directly promote positive 
outcomes or buffer the negative effects of risk factors.9 Family and school connectedness, 
referring to a sense of caring, support, and belonging to family and school, respectively, are 
2 such factors for which evidence is particularly strong.10 A seminal analysis by Resnick et 
al11 using Wave I of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add 
Health) demonstrated protective associations between these types of connectedness and 
adolescent outcomes related to mental health, violence, sexual behavior, and substance use. 
Over the past 2 decades, protective relationships between family and school connectedness 
and multiple adolescent health outcomes have been replicated in numerous cross-sectional 
studies.12-16 For example, authors of a recent meta-analysis of primarily cross-sectional 
research on school connectedness and suicidal ideation and attempt found decreased odds of 
both outcomes with higher levels of connectedness.13 Authors of other recent studies have 
documented protective associations in relation to sexual risk, violence victimization, and 
substance use indicators.14-16

Longitudinal research is particularly valuable for establishing appropriate temporal ordering 
that is necessary, albeit not sufficient, for causal inference, and in a growing number of 
longitudinal studies, researchers have documented protective effects of connectedness.17-23 
However, because this literature is still developing, there are some limitations to what 
is known about the role of connectedness over time. Some studies have relatively short 
periods of follow-up, documenting longitudinal protective effects in adolescence or early 
young adulthood.17-20 The few studies with longer-term follow-up have almost all been 
focused on sexual risk or mental health and single indicators in these domains (ie, 
sexually transmitted infection [STI] diagnosis and suicidal ideation, respectively), with each 
study operationalizing connectedness differently and including a varied set of potential

confounders.21-23 Not only is there a need to address long-term effects for violence and 
substance use, including opioid use, but because health risks related to mental health, 
violence, sexual behavior, and substance use co-occur,24,25 there is value in considering 
outcomes in these domains collectively, with a consistent analytic approach.

Accordingly, we use nationally representative longitudinal data from Waves I and IV of 
Add Health to examine long-term associations with multiple indicators of mental health, 
violence, sexual behavior, and substance use. Documenting broad-based, long-lasting impact 
would further justify practices, programs, and policies that aim to strengthen young people’s 
connections to family and school.

METHODS

Sample

Measures

We used nationally representative data from Waves I and IV of Add Health, which employed 
a stratified, cluster sampling design to sample middle and high schools throughout the 
United States.26 Wave I data collection (1994–1995) included in-school questionnaires 
with students in grades 7 to 12 and in-home student (n = 20 745) and parent interviews. 
Wave IV (2008) data collection involved in-home interviews with 24- to 32-year-old 
participants (n = 15 701) who had completed in-home interviews as students in Wave I. 
Student participants lost to follow-up by Wave IV were sufficiently comparable to retained 
participants, with significant differences in means and proportions not exceeding ~5% for 
all sociodemographic characteristics, except biological sex (11%). The only differences in 
baseline risk behaviors and experiences observed between attrited and retained participants 
were that those lost to follow-up were slightly less likely to report suicidal ideation and more 
likely to have experienced or perpetrated violence (<5% difference in mean values).

School and family connectedness measured at Wave I were predictors of interest. A school 
connectedness scale (α = .78) that could range from 6 to 30 was computed as a sum of 6 
items (eg, feel close to people at school, feel that your teachers care about you). A family 
connectedness scale (α = .82) was based on 8 items (eg, your parents care about you, people 
in your family understand you, you feel close to your mom, you feel close to your dad). 
Responses to separate mother and father items were averaged, and the final 6 items were 
summed to create a scale with potential scores ranging from 6 to 30.

Outcomes of interest included self-reported health risk behaviors and experiences measured 
at Wave IV related to mental health, violence, sexual health, and substance use. In Table 
1, we detail the operationalization of each outcome. Briefly, we considered indicators 
of emotional distress, suicidal ideation and attempts, physical violence victimization and 
perpetration, intimate partner physical and sexual violence victimization, multiple sex 
partners, condom use, STI diagnosis, prescription drug misuse, and other illicit drug use.

We included the following sociodemographic characteristics as covariates: age in years, 
biological sex, race and ethnicity, parent’s highest level of education, parent’s marital 
status, and receipt of public assistance (eg, supplemental security income, food stamps).

All covariates were from Wave I except for age, which was based on Wave IV because 
observations were more complete. Parental variables and public assistance were based 
on Wave I parent report. Wave I measures were also included to control for baseline 
risk behaviors and experiences related to Wave IV outcomes. These covariates were 
operationalized in a similar manner as the outcome measures (Table 1), except for sexual 
violence and early sexual initiation, for which Wave IV lifetime measures were used.

Statistical Analysis

We conducted all analyses using SAS survey procedures (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC) 
and Wave IV sampling weights to account for the complex sampling design.27 The final 
weighted sample consisted of 14 800 participants who completed interviews at both 
Wave I and Wave IV. Analytic samples varied for each outcome because of skip patterns 
and missing data; participants were removed via list-wise deletion. Missing data analysis 
suggested that missing values were largely attributed to missingness in parental items, with 
~15.1% of participants in the final sample missing responses to at least 1 parent item from 
Wave I. Participants with missing values for parental covariates were more likely to be older 
and non-Hispanic African American or non-Hispanic other, although mean differences were 
not more than 10%.

To characterize the overall sample, we examined descriptive statistics for each measure 
and bivariate associations between connectedness and sociodemographic measures and 
baseline health risks. We then ran separate bivariate and multivariable regression models 
for each outcome, including both family and school connectedness, sociodemographic 
characteristics, and respective baseline outcomes in the adjusted models. Logistic models 
were used for all outcomes, except for the continuous emotional distress score, for which 
linear regression was used with β coefficients quantifying the change in emotional distress 
per unit increase in connectedness.

For dichotomous outcomes with significant multivariable associations for both family and 
school connectedness, we illustrate comparisons between high and low connectedness scores 
because the regression models described above only compare per-unit changes. To do so, we 
defined “high connectedness” as the upper quartile value of each connectedness scale and 
“low connectedness” as the lower quartile value of each scale. We then input combinations 
of these values with parameter estimates from the multivariable models to calculate odds 
ratios for (1) low levels of school connectedness and high levels of family connectedness, 
(2) high levels of school connectedness and low levels of family connectedness, and (3) 
high levels of both family and school connectedness. For each estimate, the reference group 
was low levels of both family and school connectedness. Mean values were input for all 
continuous covariates, and values of categorical indicators were based on modal responses to 
meaningfully represent an “average” individual.

We also examined college graduation (yes versus no) as a secondary outcome of interest. 
As a positive education outcome, it can enhance the relevance of our health-related 
findings for school health professionals who are particularly well suited to promote school 
connectedness. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has institutional review 
board approval to conduct secondary data analyses with Add Health data.

The mean age of respondents was 15.4 years at Wave I and 28.3 years at Wave IV; half 
(50.7%) were male (Table 2). The majority of the sample was non-Hispanic white (65.6%), 
with 16.1% non-Hispanic African American and 12.0% Hispanic. The vast majority of 
parent respondents were female (93.7%), and nearly one-fifth of parents had less than a 
high school education (16.8%) and were receiving public assistance (18.2%). Mean school 
and family connectedness scores were 22.1 and 25.5, respectively; bivariate associations 
between these connectedness measures and demographics, risk behaviors, and experiences 
are reported in Table 3. As for outcomes of interest at Wave IV (Table 2), prevalence ranged 
from 1.6% (attempting suicide in past 12 months) to 46.6% (condom nonuse in the past 12 
months).

In bivariate analyses, higher school connectedness was associated with lower emotional 
distress and lower odds of all dichotomous risk behaviors and experiences examined, except 
for past-year suicide attempt (Table 4). In multivariable analyses, protective effects of higher 
school connectedness remained for emotional distress (β = −.06, SE = 0.02, P < .001) (data 
not shown), suicidal ideation (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 0.97, 95% confidence interval 
[CI] = 0.95–1.00), physical violence victimization (aOR = 0.97, 95% CI = 0.96–0.99) and 
perpetration (aOR = 0.98, 95% CI = 0.96–0.99), multiple sex partners (aOR = 0.98, 95% CI 
= 0.96–0.99), STI diagnosis (aOR = 0.98, 95% CI = 0.96–1.00), prescription drug misuse 
(aOR = 0.97, 95% CI = 0.96–0.99), and other illicit drug use (aOR = 0.98, 95% CI = 
0.96–0.99) (Table 4).

Findings were similar for family connectedness. Bivariate analyses revealed significant 
protective associations for all dichotomous outcomes (Table 5) and emotional distress. In 
adjusted analyses, higher family connectedness was associated with lower emotional distress 
(β = −.07, SE = 0.02, P < .001) (data not shown) and odds of physical violence victimization 
(aOR = 0.97, 95% CI = 0.95–0.99) and perpetration (aOR = 0.97, 95% CI = 0.95–0.99), 
intimate partner physical (aOR = 0.98, 95% CI = 0.96–1.00) and sexual (aOR = 0.94, 95% 
CI = 0.91–0.97) violence victimization, multiple sex partners (aOR = 0.96, 95% CI = 0.94–
0.98), STI diagnosis (aOR = 0.96, 95% CI = 0.94–0.98), prescription drug misuse (aOR = 
0.94, 95% CI = 0.92–0.97), and other illicit drug use (aOR = 0.95, 95% CI = 0.93–0.97) 
(Table 5).

In Table 6, we provide estimates comparing high versus low levels of connectedness for 
dichotomous outcomes. The magnitude of associations comparing individuals with high 
family connectedness and low school connectedness to those with low scores for both types 
of connectedness ranged from a 29% to 51% decrease in odds, depending on the outcome. 
Similarly, effect estimates comparing individuals with high school connectedness and low 
family connectedness to low scores for both ranged from a 24% to 31% decrease in odds. 
Comparing those with high scores for both connectedness scales to those with low scores for 
both, we found an approximately 50% reduction in odds of past-year violence victimization 
(aOR = 0.49) and perpetration (aOR = 0.52) as well as STI diagnosis (aOR = 0.46) and 
multiple sex partners (aOR = 0.46). There was about a 65% decrease in odds of prescription 
drug misuse (aOR = 0.34) and other illicit drug use (aOR = 0.38).

When examining college graduation as a post hoc outcome (data not shown), higher school 
connectedness (aOR = 1.07, 95% CI = 1.05–1.09) and family connectedness (aOR = 1.03, 
95% CI = 1.00–1.05) were independently associated with increased odds of obtaining at 
least a 4-year college degree, also controlling for sociodemographic characteristics. Such 
associations reflected a more than threefold increase in the odds of graduating college (aOR 
= 3.10) when comparing those with both high scores for school and family connectedness to 
those with low scores for both scales.

DISCUSSION

Long-term consequences of health risks in adolescence are well documented.1-3 However, 
the influence of adolescent behaviors and experiences on health trajectories into adulthood is 
not limited to risk and subsequent adverse impact. Our study suggests that family and school 
connectedness during adolescence may have long-lasting protective effects across a range of 
adult health outcomes related to mental health, violence, sexual behavior, and substance use. 
Specifically, school connectedness in adolescence had independent protective associations 
for emotional distress, suicidal ideation, physical violence victimization and perpetration, 
multiple sex partners, STI diagnosis, prescription drug misuse, and other illicit drug use. 
Similarly, family connectedness had independent protective associations for emotional 
distress, all violence indicators examined, including intimate partner violence, multiple sex 
partners, STI diagnosis, and both substance use indicators. Suicide attempt and condom 
nonuse were the only 2 outcomes not protectively associated with family and/or school 
connectedness in multivariable analyses. We also found that both connectedness constructs 
are associated with increased likelihood of graduating from college, a key indicator of life 
opportunity.

The prevention implications of these findings are noteworthy, despite small effect sizes from 
the multivariable models. School and family connectedness are measured by multi-item 
scales so we would expect small effect estimates per unit change on the scale. As we 
demonstrated by calculating estimates comparing high and low connectedness scores, having 
both high levels of school and family connectedness is associated with a 48% to 66% lower 
likelihood of adult risk behaviors or experiences, depending on the specific outcome.

As noted previously, a few of these individual associations have already been 
documented.21,22,28 Specifically, both family and school connectedness have been found 
to be protective for STI diagnoses.21,22 Evaluation data from the Seattle Social Development 
Project, which aimed to promote both family and school connectedness through a 
multicomponent intervention, also suggest long-term protective effects for mental and sexual 
health; long-term associations with substance use were null, which is inconsistent with our 
study, perhaps because we used discrete indicators rather than a substance use index.28 
Likewise, researchers in a previous study using Add Health found protective associations 
between family connectedness and suicidal ideation, whereas our results for this outcome 
were null.23 The 2 studies operationalized connectedness and suicidality differently, which 
may have contributed to the discrepancy. Despite these few contradictory findings, our 
study replicates protective associations for STI diagnoses and mental health that have 
been documented previously and extends the literature by considering additional indicators

related to sexual behavior (ie, condom use) and mental health (ie, emotional distress, suicide 
attempt) as well as those related to violence and substance use. In contrast to much of 
the longitudinal research to date, we examined outcomes beyond adolescence and early 
adulthood; our findings suggest long-term protection into adulthood for multiple health risk 
behaviors and experiences. Additionally, the findings comparing high and low values of 
connectedness illustrate the potential magnitude of these protective associations, which has 
not been clearly demonstrated before.

An implication of our findings is that promoting both family and school connectedness is 
a promising approach to reducing risk behaviors and experiences long-term. Fortunately, 
there are a variety of school-, community-, and clinic-based strategies for establishing 
connectedness across child and adolescent development. Beginning in the early school 
years, teachers, school staff, and parents play a critical role in setting behavioral 
expectations and reinforcing that school is a nurturing environment where all students 
belong. Approaches informed by social-emotional learning, positive behavioral interventions 
and supports, and/or other positive youth development (PYD) models can offer ways for 
school staff to clearly articulate expectations, better manage classroom behaviors, cultivate 
supportive relationships, and foster engagement among all students.29-34 For example, 
schools can implement PYD programs, such as service learning or mentoring programs, 
and connect students to PYD programs offered by trusted community organizations (eg, 
4H, YMCA).33,35 School staff may be motivated to implement such approaches given that 
connectedness is associated with subsequent educational attainment. Moreover, programs 
based on these principles have been found to be cost effective.36 Engaging parents in schools 
is another strategy that can promote both school and family connectedness.37,38 Family 
connectedness can also be bolstered by programs that focus on strengthening parental 
monitoring and supervision and parent-child communication.36,39

Health care providers also have opportunities to promote school and family connectedness. 
Providers can ask children and adolescents about family relationships and school 
experiences as part of routine health screenings and engage parents in discussion about how 
to connect with their children (eg, reading aloud, family meals), monitor their children’s 
activities and friends, and communicate effectively.40 Even as confidentiality becomes 
critical during the adolescent years,41 providers can still encourage positive parenting 
practices (eg, parent-adolescent communication, parental monitoring) and advise parents 
on how to promote adolescents’ connectedness to school. PYD programs can also be 
implemented through clinic settings, such as Prime Time, which documented increases in 
family connectedness and subsequent long-term reductions in sexual risk.42,43

Limitations of this study should be considered. We examine self-reported health outcomes, 
and there may be underreporting due to social desirability biases. A specific measurement 
concern is that condom use in the past 12 months is an imprecise indicator, which 
may account for the lack of significant multivariable associations with this outcome. 
Additionally, the prevalence of suicide attempts was low, potentially precluding detection 
of significant differences. In using Wave IV, we have missing data because of study 
attrition, but baseline differences between those retained and lost to follow-up were minimal. 
Additionally, we did not control for all potential confounding factors given some were

unmeasured and others were strongly correlated with baseline outcomes, such that inclusion 
of these variables would have likely created multicollinearity. The data, particularly Wave 
I, are older, although given our research question, this is of minimal concern because 
we would expect connectedness to function similarly today. Finally, although the data are 
nationally representative, the school-based sampling limits generalizability.

CONCLUSIONS

Our study suggests that school and family connectedness in adolescence are protective 
factors for health and well-being in adulthood. Despite authors of previous studies reaching 
similar conclusions with select outcomes, in our study, we look across multiple health 
outcomes, as well as a key education indicator, and demonstrate long-term protective 
associations. These findings, in context with literature about how to promote these 
factors, point to the promise of innovative, multicomponent prevention approaches that 
span across developmental years and the most proximal actors in the social ecology of 
children and adolescents, including parents, schools, and health care providers. Although 
an ambitious and potentially resource-intensive undertaking, growing evidence suggests that 
such prevention strategies may have widespread and lasting benefits.
