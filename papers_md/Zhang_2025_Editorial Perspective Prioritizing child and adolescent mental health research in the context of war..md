Editorial Perspective: Prioritizing child and
adolescent mental health research in the context
of war

Introduction: Why this topic is important?

We face a paradox that children and adolescents (CA) are
one of the most vulnerable groups during war, yet their
subjective mental and emotional experiences and needs
are often excluded from empirical studies in the war con-
text, further excluding them from research beneﬁts. We
discuss several ethical and methodological issues that
might have resulted in CA being excluded and propose
that their inclusion during war should be prioritized with
appropriate research adaptations.

One reason for investigating CA in war contexts is the
sheer number affected. More than 468 million children
(1 in 6) globally lived in war zones in 2023, and about
250 million were living in the most lethal wars (Save the
Children, n.d.). The destructiveness of war and orga-
nized violence has led to high levels of deaths, and
amongst survivors’ distress and often mental health
problems including posttraumatic stress disorder, anxi-
ety disorders, depression, and suicidality that may last
months or years and are associated with signiﬁcant
social
impairment. This is a vitally important yet
neglected area for research.

Although there is an abundant literature on CA men-
tal health research in nonwar and postwar settings, the
ﬁndings may not be generalizable to CA living in war
zones. Informants often provide inadequate information
during wars, and CA need to have their own voice to
communicate their experiences ﬁrst-hand, such as their
fears and wish to regain a sense of safety. CA’s subjective
experiences are often not reliably known or reported by
adult caregivers (Van Roy, Groholt, Heyerdahl, &
Clench-Aas, 2010). For instance, CA may not disclose
shameful war experiences such as sexual assault and
underreport symptoms because of fear of heightening
caregivers’ distress. While caregivers, of course, may be
aware of visible distress (e.g., crying, clinging, with-
drawal, insomnia, loss of appetite, nocturnal enuresis),
they also underreport emotional symptoms in nonwar
settings (Van Roy et al., 2010). Therefore, CA need to
report symptoms themselves,
including their fears,
nightmares, level of avoidance, hyperarousal, concentra-
tion difﬁculties, and suicidal thoughts that frequently
occur during wars.

CA already marginalized in their communities may
face further stigmatization if not actively included to
understand their needs. Examples of these groups
include the very young and female adolescents, pregnant
adolescents, those with physical or mental disabilities,
adolescents separated from their families, adolescent
heads of households, adolescent survivors of sexual-/
gender-based violence, adolescent girls selling sex, and
children associated with armed forces. Despite their vul-

planned research. Postwar studies exemplify this, such
as the Longitudinal Study of War-Affected Youth in
Sierra Leone from 1991 to 2002, which offered novel per-
spectives on risk and protective factors in community
reintegration, social relationships, and psychosocial
function in former child soldiers (Betancourt, Keegan,
Farrar, & Brennan, 2020). There is signiﬁcantly less
such investigation of CA during wars than in postconﬂict
situations. Reasons for this include practical problems
conducting research during war, most crucially the risk
to investigators and participants and prioritizing physi-
cal and material needs. An example is the war in Gaza in
the months following the Hamas-led attack in Israel on
October 7, 2023. However, there may be other reasons
limiting the prevalence of CA mental health research in
wars. We discuss some of these barriers below.

Perceived categorical vulnerability leading to
exclusion from research
CA are inherently prone to perceived categorical vulnera-
bility during research due to age. However, CA are hetero-
geneous in terms of age and maturity, with different
physical, mental, and emotional capacities, as well as
socioeconomic proﬁles, which means they are positioned
differently in terms of risks and vulnerabilities created by
conﬂicts. An attempt to “protect” CA from research also
excludes them from the consequential beneﬁts. Instead of
seeing vulnerability as a static factor secondary to group
characteristics, it should be considered alongside other
contextual factors. Certain subgroups of children may be
unsuitable for research in one context using one set of
research methodologies but not in another. Where inclu-
sion is necessary to understand the needs of a speciﬁc
subgroup, adequate safeguards and all risk minimization
measures should be implemented.

Ethical considerations in researching children and
adolescents’ mental health during war
Postconﬂict studies in refugee camps may provide valu-
able lessons that can be generalized to ongoing conﬂict
situations, but this approach does not usually answer
key questions regarding the mental health of CA living in
war contexts. Much of the existing research has been
cross-sectional and primarily focuses on assessing CA
psychopathology in relation to past conﬂict exposure.
The scarcity of prospective longitudinal studies, espe-
cially ones that incorporate developmental and ecologi-
cal perspectives, has resulted in a lack understanding of
how speciﬁc risk and resilience factors shape psychopa-
thology and development over time that could inform

interventions
approaches are associated with biases, such as recall
bias, particularly prevalent in situations associated with

speciﬁc war events, including moves associated with dis-
placement and associated distress may not be reliably
reported long after they were experienced.

Carrying out research in war zones within the limita-
tions of war-damaged research infrastructure has many
challenges,
including barriers to building trust with
deeply traumatized communities, difﬁculties in obtain-
ing informed consent, and data collection. Psychiatric
interviews may be regarded as stress inducing, but when
conducted appropriately, can also act as a form of thera-
peutic intervention in an already traumatized popula-
tion. For example, an interview-based study with
Bosnian refugee parents and adolescents showed that
nearly all participants found the research process a posi-

factors when designing research and acknowledge the
possibilities and limitations of research conducted in
such environments.

experience

Other risks that need to be considered include data
security and risk to the researched community and
researchers. Safety planning should be undertaken
prior to all research in emergencies, but the challenge
lies in the application of research protocols during wars,
where access to treatment and services is severely con-
strained. Safety planning should speciﬁcally include the
following: equipping researchers with child-friendly and
culturally sensitive research methods, tools to recognize
and respond to distress, an awareness of how
researchers’ own characteristics affect
the process,
robust risk assessment, clear and fair selection criteria,
referral protocols, adapted methods and a continuous
assessment of consent. Ensuring a research design
appropriate to the developmental stage and contexts of
the participants makes it as participatory, noninvasive
and stress-free as possible.

Obtaining informed consent based on local and inter-
national standards is essential (Inter-Agency Standing
Committee (IASC), 2014). CA must understand the ben-
eﬁts and risks of research and the process of informed
consent should be a dynamic process. A degree of ﬂexi-
bility in the way consent is obtained may be necessary to
secure key components of consent during war contexts.
Research during war should protect participants’ rights
to conﬁdentiality. Researchers must also be aware of the
limits of conﬁdentiality – for example, when to breach
conﬁdentiality to protect participants. Research collabo-
ration with institutions, such as the governments and
humanitarian organizations, need to establish agree-
ments and ensure ethical oversight and participant
protection.

research is noninvasive and low risk, monetary pay-

should be appropriate to the context. The type and

Methodological considerations for research
during war
CA psychiatric population studies typically recruit par-
ticipants using administrative systems (e.g., housing,
school, primary care or census data). During wars, these
systems can no longer be relied on to recruit representa-
tive samples due to population displacement. Alternative
strategies such as recruitment through referrals from
other organizations or support schemes, or targeting
those in camps for the displaced, have been employed in
postconﬂict settings.

Regarding the instruments and data collection, clear
systems are needed for administration, collection, and
safe storage of completed responses. Digital data col-
lection methodologies offer rapid and safer communi-
cations and enable large groups to be recruited
quickly. Our epidemiological study of adolescents in
Ukraine included data collection in 2023–2024 follow-
ing the full-scale Russian invasion of 2022 using
school rolls in the same areas as the ﬁrst phase of
data collection (data collected 2016–2017)
(Osokina
et al., 2023). It took place during the high level of
bombing and destruction. The resulting displacement
of populations meant
that adolescents who were
receiving schooling remotely were enrolled in the study
through digital communication and completed elec-
tronic questionnaires.

However, there are logistical challenges that need to
be addressed include ensuring data privacy and compre-
hensive digital access for participants. Given the current
limited understanding of mental health issues in CA
during war contexts, using mixed or qualitative method-
ologies may be informative. An example of methodologi-
cal adaption to minimize stigmatization is the use of
school observations and classroom-based activities
involving all pupils without singling out participants.

Discussion

CA are often overlooked as participants in research espe-
cially in war contexts. We have argued for the need to
hear their voices, both in quantitative and qualitative
research, as carers or other informants cannot speak
adequately for them, and often underreport their experi-
ences. Research needs to be adapted in war contexts to
achieve safety for participants and researchers. The
expansion of digital applications may facilitate the exe-
cution of research. There have been calls for collabora-
tive international research that links investigators in
high income and low-income countries but
trust
between partners is crucial given the sensitive nature of
mental health research. In contexts of extreme high level
of war, CA mental health research will not be feasible or
appropriate, but
in prolonged war as occurred in
Ukraine since 2014, it may inform service planning and
delivery.
