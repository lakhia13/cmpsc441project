ABSTRACT: This Review evaluates the arachidonic acid
(AA, 20:4n-6) cascade hypothesis for the actions of lithium
and other FDA-approved mood stabilizers in bipolar disorder
(BD). The hypothesis is based on evidence in unanesthetized
rats that chronically administered lithium, carbamazepine,
valproate, or
lamotrigine each downregulated brain AA
metabolism, and it is consistent with reported upregulated
AA cascade markers in post-mortem BD brain. In the rats, each
mood stabilizer reduced AA turnover in brain phospholipids,
cyclooxygenase-2 expression, and prostaglandin E2 concen-
tration. Lithium and carbamazepine also reduced expression of
cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) IVA, which releases AA
from membrane phospholipids, whereas valproate uncompetitively inhibited in vitro acyl-CoA synthetase-4, which recycles AA
into phospholipid. Topiramate and gabapentin, proven ineﬀective in BD, changed rat brain AA metabolism minimally. On the
other hand, the atypical antipsychotics olanzapine and clozapine, which show eﬃcacy in BD, decreased rat brain AA metabolism
by reducing plasma AA availability. Each of the four approved mood stabilizers also dampened brain AA signaling during
glutamatergic NMDA and dopaminergic D2 receptor activation, while lithium enhanced the signal during cholinergic muscarinic
receptor activation. In BD patients, such signaling eﬀects might normalize the neurotransmission imbalance proposed to cause
disease symptoms. Additionally, the antidepressants ﬂuoxetine and imipramine, which tend to switch BD depression to mania,
each increased AA turnover and cPLA2 IVA expression in rat brain, suggesting that brain AA metabolism is higher in BD mania
than depression. The AA hypothesis for mood stabilizer action is consistent with reports that low-dose aspirin reduced morbidity
in patients taking lithium, and that high n-3 and/or low n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid diets, which in rats reduce brain AA
metabolism, were eﬀective in BD and migraine patients.

1. INTRODUCTION

Bipolar disorder (BD) is characterized by recurring cycles of
depressive and manic symptoms (Bipolar I) or hypomanic
symptoms (Bipolar II). The depressive phase is three times more
common than the manic or hypomanic phase, and the lifetime
suicide risk is 10−20%. BD is a life-long malady that is not
diagnosed on average until 10 years after symptoms appear, and
treatment may be delayed for another 10 years.1 Two serial BD
“biotypes” or “biostages” are recognized. An initial one, perhaps
explaining presenting symptoms,
involves an imbalanced
neurotransmission consisting of excessive dopaminergic and
glutamatergic transmission, reduced cholinergic muscarinic
transmission, with disturbed serotonergic transmission.1b,2 The
later appearing biotype additionally includes cognitive decline,
brain atrophy, and symptom worsening, and overlaps with the
biotypes of schizophrenia, schizoaﬀective disorder, and major
depressive disorder.3

Even with intensive treatment in academic centers, BD therapy
is inadequate and produces frequent side eﬀects; on average,
patients remain symptomatic for half the year. Thus, major

challenges in the ﬁeld are to identify more eﬀective, less toxic
drugs for treatment, and to deal with poor compliance. But drug
development has not progressed markedly in the last decades, in
part because BD pathology is not suﬃciently understood and
there is no accepted behavioral animal model for the disease.1a
Identifying a drug target also is diﬃcult because genomic studies
implicate 90 or more risk alleles, each with only a small
statistically signiﬁcant eﬀect.4 One possible approach, however, is
to try to understand mechanisms of action of the already FDA-
approved mood stabilizers, using cell or animal biochemical
models. These agents, the univalent ion lithium, valproate (2-
propylpentanoate), carbamazepine (5H-dibenz[b,f ]azepine-5-
carboxamide), and lamotrigine (3,5-diamino-6-(2,3-dichloro-

Figure 1. Model of brain arachidonic acid cascade initiated at synapse, with sites of action of mood stabilizers and atypical antipsychotics, based on
studies in unanesthetized rats and in vitro. Arachidonic acid (AA), esteriﬁed within synaptic membrane phospholipid, is liberated following ligand
binding to a neuroreceptor on the outer surface of the plasma membrane, which is coupled cPLA2 activation by a G protein or Ca2+. A fraction of
liberated unesteriﬁed AA is converted to bioactive eicosanoids (e.g., PGE2) by COX-2, lipoxygenase (LOX), COX-1, or cytochrome P450 epoxygenase
(CYP450), which together with AA produce cellular actions. The larger remaining fraction is converted to AA-CoA by AA-selective acyl-CoA synthetase
(Acsl)-4, then is re-esteriﬁed into membrane by lysophospholipid choline acyltransferase (LPCAT)-3. When administered chronically to rats, each of
the four mood stabilizers interferes with neuroreceptor-mediated activation of cPLA2, reduces COX-2 activity and PGE2 concentration in the brain.
Valproate, lamotrigine, and the antipsychotics olanzapine and clozapine also each reduce COX-2 gene transcription within the nucleus via NF-κB.
Lithium and carbamazepine each reduce cPLA2 IVA expression by reducing its gene transcription by AP-2, whereas valproate uncompetitively inhibits
AA-selective Acsl-4. Both lithium and carbamazepine increase GRK-3, which may reduce G-protein neuroreceptor coupled activation of cPLA2. The
ﬁgure also illustrates diﬀusion of circulating unlabeled unesteriﬁed AA and radiolabeled AA* into the cellular unesteriﬁed AA pool that is available for
reacylation.18 See text for details. Prepared by Dr. Chuck T. Chen as adapted from Rao et al.11a

phenyl)-as-triazine), have no common structure that would
suggest a speciﬁc common target.1

Since the discovery of lithium’s eﬃcacy against BD some 65
years ago,5 multiple hypotheses have been suggested to explain
its action,1 some of which are presented in this volume. In this
Review, I present evidence for the arachidonic acid (AA) cascade
hypothesis, while other actively investigated hypotheses include
the following: (1) Myo-inositol depletion (inhibition of inositol
monophosphatase (IMPase) in the phosphatidylinositide
cycle).6 (2) Inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-
3β).7 (3) Inhibition of protein kinase C. This hypothesis has
been proposed to explain the action of Tamoxifen against bipolar
mania.8 (4) Inhibition of NMDA/AMPA receptors. This

hypothesis is consistent with evidence that both the N-methyl-
D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist ketamine, and the
alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid
(AMPA) antagonist riluzole, showed eﬃcacy in bipolar
depression.9 It overlaps to some extent
the AA cascade
hypothesis, since each of the mood stabilizers blocks an AA
signal caused by injected NMDA in rats (see below).

2. THE ARACHIDONIC CASCADE HYPOTHESIS

2.1. The AA Cascade. Unlike many of the other hypotheses,
the AA cascade hypothesis for lithium’s action does not identify a
single enzyme, protein, or receptor target of lithium. Rather, this
hypothesis encompasses a system of ordered metabolic reactions

involving AA and its metabolites, which can be modulated by
receptor or biochemical events.10 Within this “system,” there can
be several points of therapeutic intervention. The hypothesis also
applies to each of the four mood stabilizers approved by the FDA
for treating BD (but not to potential mood stabilizers proven
ineﬀective), and further suggests related mechanisms of action of
certain antidepressants and atypical antipsychotics, of aspirin,
and of dietary intervention, with regard to BD symptoms (see
below).1a,11

AA (20:4n-6) is a long-chain n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid
(PUFA) that, like the n-3 PUFA, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA,
is esteriﬁed in millimolar concentrations in brain
22:6n-3),
phospholipids, triacylglycerols, and cholesteryl esters, or is found
in lower μmolar concentrations in its unesteriﬁed (free) form
within cells, often bound to fatty acid binding proteins. Neither
AA nor DHA can be synthesized de novo in vertebrates. Each
must be absorbed through the diet or synthesized mainly within
the liver by elongation of its shorter-chain nutritionally essential
precursor, linoleic acid (LA, 18:2n-6) and α-linolenic acid (α-
LNA, 18:3n-3), respectively.10 AA and DHA are metabolized by
separate but interacting metabolic systems or cascades within
brain, which are regulated by enzymes often showing speciﬁcity
for one or the other PUFA and its metabolites.12 These enzymes
often are functionally and transcriptionally coupled within the
separate cascades, during brain development and aging.13 Both
AA and DHA and their metabolites have important second
messenger actions in brain, aﬀecting gene transcription,
membrane ﬂuidity, neurotransmission, electrical excitability,
neuroinﬂammation, excitotoxicity, energy consumption, and
other functions.10

Figure 1 illustrates some relevant pathways within the AA
cascade, superimposed on an outline of synaptic and cell
structure.11a In this illustration, the cascade is initiated at the
outer plasma membrane surface when an agonist binds to a
neuroreceptor that is coupled to Ca2+-dependent AA-selective
cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2).12a cPLA2 hydrolyzes
esteriﬁed AA from the stereospeciﬁcally numbered (sn)-2
position of synaptic membrane phospholipid, and can be
activated via G-protein coupled cholinergic muscarinic M1,3,5,14
dopaminergic D2-like,15 or serotonergic 5-HT2A/2C receptors,16
or following entry of extracellular Ca2+ into the cell due to
glutamate binding to ionotropic NMDA or AMPA receptors.17
Of the unesteriﬁed AA released into the cytoplasm, the largest
fraction (about 95%) is recycled by conversion to AA-CoA by an
acyl-CoA synthetase (Acsl) (selectively Acsl-4) with the

consumption of 2 ATP,18 and then is re-esteriﬁed by an
acyltransferase (selectively lysophospholipid acyltransferase
(LPCAT)-313,19) into an available sn-2 position of membrane
lysophospholipid. The smaller fraction is metabolized through
enzymatic oxidation by cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, COX-1,
cytochrome P450 epoxygenase (CYP450), or lipoxygenase
(LOX), to produce multiple bioactive eicosanoid metabolites,
including pro-inﬂammatory prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and
thromboxane B2 (TXB2). AA also can be β-oxidized within
mitochondria, nonenzymatically converted to reactive oxygen
species (ROS), or follow other degradative pathways.

In the pathological condition of neuroinﬂammation, which is
associated with microglial activation,
the AA cascade is
chronically upregulated by a number of mechanisms. These
include secretion of cytokines (e.g., interleukin (IL)-1β or tumor
necrosis factor (TNF)-α) that stimulate astrocytic receptors that
are coupled to activation of cPLA2 and secretory sPLA2,20 and
excess glutamatergic levels that stimulate neuronal NMDA and
AMPA receptors and cause excitotoxicity.21 Synaptic loss and
apoptosis often accompany these changes.22

2. EFFECTS OF DRUGS USED IN BIPOLAR DISORDER

ON ARACHIDONIC ACID CASCADE
2.1. Lithium and Other Mood Stabilizers Down-
regulate Rat Brain AA Cascade. Figure 1 also identiﬁes
suggested sites of action of the four FDA-approved mood
stabilizers within the AA cascade, as well as of olanzapine and
clozapine (see below), based on experiments in unanesthetized
rats and in vitro. At the apex of the cascade, each of the mood
stabilizers can modulate AA hydrolysis by cPLA2, initiated by
agonist activation of certain neuroreceptors. The experimental
pattern of modulation is consistent with their ability to rectify the
proposed neurotransmission imbalance in early biostage BD (see
above).1a This was shown by neuroimaging studies in partially
restrained unanesthetized rats that had been treated chronically
with vehicle or a mood stabilizer, having indwelling femoral vein
and artery catheters.18 Just before acute saline or drug was
injected, radiolabeled [1-14C]AA (*AA in Figure 1) was infused
intravenously for 5 min, the animal was killed, and its brain was

lost within brain.18,23 Both k* and Jin are unaﬀected by changes in
cerebral blood ﬂow, and thus, the imaging method can be used
under pathological conditions and with changing functional
activity.

As shown in Table 1, chronically administered lithium,
valproate, carbamazepine, or lamotrigine, at a therapeutically
relevant plasma level, each blocked the AA signal in response to
25 or 50 (lithium) mg/kg i.p. NMDA in unanesthetized rats.24
Blockage by lithium and carbamazepine is consistent with their in
vitro inhibition of NMDA-induced Ca2+ inﬂuxes,25 and with
therapeutic eﬀects of NMDA or AMPA antagonists in bipolar
depression9 (see above). Lithium, carbamazepine, and valproate
each also dampened the AA signal in rats injected with the D2-like
receptor agonist quinpirole,26 while lithium decreased the signal
in brain auditory and visual areas in response to DOI ((±)-1-
(2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)-2-aminopropane hydrochlor-
ide), a serotonergic 5-HT2A/2C receptor agonist.27 Consistent
with the proposed hypocholinergic neurotransmission in BD
(see above), and lithium’s proconvulsant action with phys-
ostigmine, chronic lithium increased the rat brain AA signal to the
muscarinic M1,3,5 agonist arecoline,28 while also increasing brain
glucose metabolism.29 In separate experiments, each of the acute
agonist-induced signals could be blocked by pretreatment with
the speciﬁc receptor antagonist, conﬁrming its speciﬁc receptor
origin (Table 2).

Downstream in the cascade at the inner plasma membrane
(Figure 1), G-protein receptor kinases (GRKs) modulate
homologous desensitization of agonist activated G-protein
coupled receptors, like those identiﬁed in Table 1. In rat brain,
chronic lithium and carbamazepine each signiﬁcantly increased
GRK-3 expression in the membrane but not cytosolic fraction,
which might desensitize the AA signal initiated at G-protein
coupled D2-like and other receptors.30

It is possible to quantify turnover of long chain fatty acids in
brain phospholipids of partially restrained unanesthetized rats by
infusing the radiolabeled fatty acid intravenously for 5 min,
determining integrated plasma speciﬁc activity by repeated
arterial sampling, then killing the rat and subjecting its brain to
high energy microwaving to prevent post-mortem metabolic
changes.18 Fatty acid speciﬁc activity (radioactive/cold concen-
tration) is measured in brain acyl-CoA (Figure 1), the precursor
pool for fatty acid incorporation into phospholipid, and in plasma
to calculate, as a ratio, a dilution factor λ. A mathematical model
then is applied to determine fatty acid turnover in individual
phospholipids and other kinetic parameters.18 Using this
approach, we showed that chronic lithium, carbamazepine or
valproate each reduced AA turnover (deacylation−reacylation31
(Figure 1)) in brain phospholipids of unanesthetized rats, while

lamotrigine reduced AA incorporation into brain from plasma32
(Table 2). The reductions were selective for AA, since lithium,
valproate, or carbamazepine did not reduce DHA turnover, and
lithium or valproate did not reduce palmitate turnover.1a

Related to their selective reduction of AA turnover, chronic
lithium and carbamazepine each reduced transcription (mRNA
level) and activity of AA-selective Ca2+-dependent cPLA2 IVA12a
in rat brain, and expression of activator protein-2 (AP-2), a
cPLA2 IVA transcription factor, without changing expression of
DHA-selective Ca2+-independent iPLA2 VIA or of sPLA2 IIA
(Table 2).1a Valproate did not modify expression of any of the
three PLA2 enzymes, but uncompetitively inhibited AA
activation to AA-CoA by recombinant AA-selective Acsl-4 and
by a microsomal rat brain preparation.33 Lithium did not produce
such inhibition. On this basis, we are testing in our turnover rat
model proven nonteratogenic inhibitors of recombinant Acsl-4,
such as the valproate amide derivative valnoctamide,34 as
potential new mood stabilizers for treating BD via their eﬀect
on the AA cascade.35

Further downstream in the cascade (Figure 1), COX-2
colocalizes and is functionally coupled with cPLA2 IVA at
postsynaptic sites in brain.36 Each of the four mood stabilizers
reduced brain COX-2 activity and PGE2 concentration when
given chronically to rats (Table 2). Chronic lithium did not
reduce NF-κB in the intact rat,37 but does so in neuroblastoma
SH-SY5Y cells in vitro.38 Valproate and lamotrigine additionally
reduced COX-2 protein and mRNA and the COX-2 tran-
scription factor, NF-κB.1a Chronic valproate also reduced brain
mRNA levels for 87 genes and increased levels for 34 genes by at
least 40%, indicating that its AA cascade eﬀects are embedded in
multiple other brain changes.37a Lithium’s selectivity for the
COX-2 pathway was illustrated by showing that it did not change
expression of COX-1, 5-LOX, CYP450, or membrane PGE
synthase-2 (mPGES-2) in rat brain.39 At the resting state, it is
thought that PGE2 is produced from AA primarily via COX-2,
TXB2 via COX-1.40 Lithium, lamotrigine or gabapentin did not
change the rat brain TXB2 concentration, while carbamazepine
and VPA each reduced TXB2.24c,d,26c,41 Additionally, neither
valproate nor carbamazepine altered 5-LOX or its product
leukotriene B4 (LTB4), and carbamazepine did not change
CYP450.42

An unexpected and as yet incompletely understood observa-
tion was that chronic lithium elevated rat brain concentration of
antiinﬂammatory 17-hydroxy-DHA and other as yet unidentiﬁed
DHA metabolites.43 This elevation may contribute to the
reported synergy between aspirin and lithium in BD patients,
since 17-hydroxy-DHA is formed from DHA by acetylated COX-
2 following exposure to aspirin (see below).44

Review

In contrast to the overlapping actions of the four FDA
approved mood stabilizers, the antiepileptic topiramate (2,3:4,5-
bis-O-(1-methylethylidene)-β-D-fructopyranose 1-sulfamate),
which failed in phase III trials in BD I patients, did not change
any measured rat brain AA cascade marker,45 nor did gabapentin
(1-(aminomethyl)cyclohexaneacetic acid), which also lacks
eﬃcacy.41 Thus, the AA cascade model for lithium’s action has
a strong clinical-experimental correlation based on the rat studies
with the six drugs.

the tricyclic antidepressant

2.2. Antidepressants That Switch Bipolar Depression
to Mania Increase Rat Brain AA Metabolism. The AA
cascade hypothesis has relevance for the eﬀects of certain
antidepressants and atypical antipsychotics in BD.1b,11b For
example,
imipramine and the
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) ﬂuoxetine are
reported to increase “switching” of bipolar depression to mania
when used as monotherapy or with mood stabilizers.46
Bupropion, also an antidepressant but a norepinephrine and
dopamine reuptake inhibitor and nicotinic antagonist, does not
increase switching.46 These clinical distinctions correlated with
the diﬀerent eﬀects of
the three drugs on rat brain AA
metabolism. Thus, chronic ﬂuoxetine and imipramine at
therapeutically relevant doses increased AA turnover in rat
brain phospholipids, as well as expression (activity, protein,
mRNA, and phosphorylation) of cPLA2
its
transcription factor subunit, AP-2α,47 whereas chronic bupro-
pion had no comparable eﬀect. These results imply that the
manic or hypomanic phase of BD has a higher brain AA
metabolic rate than does the depression phase, a hypothesis that
can be tested directly by PET imaging of brain AA metabolism
using [1-11C]AA or [18F]AA.48

IVA and of

2.3. Atypical Antipsychotics Used in Bipolar Disorder
Indirectly Decrease Rat Brain AA Metabolism. Atypical
antipsychotics may act in part in BD by reducing the brain AA
cascade, albeit indirectly and secondary to their eﬀect on hepatic
PUFA metabolism.49 Olanzapine is an atypical antipsychotic that
is FDA-approved for maintenance therapy in Bipolar I, as well as
for bipolar mania, and it can rapidly dampen hyperactive motoric
symptoms before mood stabilizers start to act.1b Clozapine
shows eﬃcacy in acute BD mania, rapid cycling BD, and as
maintenance therapy in patients with refractory BD.1b As a class,
atypical antipsychotics have a high aﬃnity as antagonists for
dopaminergic D2 and serotonergic 5-HT2 receptors. They may
produce fewer motor side eﬀects than typical antipsychotics such
as haloperidol because of their ability to rapidly dissociate from
D2 receptors.50

Using our in vivo kinetic method, we found that both
olanzapine and clozapine when chronically administered to rats
reduced brain COX activity and PGE2 concentration, plasma
unesteriﬁed AA concentration, and AA incorporation into brain
from plasma (Figure 1).51 Olanzapine alone also reduced AA
turnover within brain phospholipids, while clozapine alone also
increased expression of DHA-selective iPLA2 VIA and COX-1.

3. ADDITIONAL THERAPEUTIC APPROACHES TO BD
INVOLVING THE BRAIN ARACHIDONIC ACID
CASCADE
3.1. Low Dose Aspirin. In a pharmacoepidemiological study
of patients taking lithium for an average duration of 847 days,
patients receiving low-dose (30 or 80 mg/day) acetylsalicylic acid
(aspirin) were signiﬁcantly less likely to have a “medication
event” (evidence of disease worsening) than patients on lithium
alone, independently of use duration.44 High dose aspirin given

for short periods of time, nonselective COX inhibitors, selective
COX-2 inhibitors, or glucocorticoids were not beneﬁcial. As low
increase serum lithium,52 aspirin’s
dose aspirin does not
synergistic eﬀect with lithium likely was centrally mediated,
particularly because it can enter the brain and inhibit AA
metabolism.53 Clinical trials with aspirin in BD currently are
underway.54

A central positive eﬀect of aspirin in BD is consistent with a
that aspirin given to men undergoing coronary
report
angiography reduced depression and anxiety.55 Of relevance,
the COX-2 inhibitor celecoxib, although having low brain
penetrability,56 showed signiﬁcant positive eﬀects as adjunctive
therapy in BD patients experiencing depressive or mixed
episodes, and in depressed patients.57

The clinical data are consistent with the AA cascade
hypothesis. Acetylation of COX-2 by aspirin reduces the ability
the enzyme to convert AA to pro-inﬂammatory PGE2.
of
Additionally, acylated COX-2 can convert AA to anti-
inﬂammatory mediators such as lipoxin A4 and 15-epi-lipoxin
A4, as well as DHA to anti-inﬂammatory 17-(R)-OH-DHA.43a
Lithium similarly reduces rat brain COX-2 activity and PGE2
concentration (Table 2), while increasing brain concentrations
of 17-hydroxy-DHA and other potential DHA-derived anti-
inﬂammatory metabolites.43b

3.2. Changing Dietary PUFA Composition Can Sup-
press Brain Arachidonic Acid Cascade. Brain concentrations
of AA and DHA can be altered reciprocally by changing dietary
PUFA concentrations, since brain AA and DHA concentrations
depend on dietary intake and hepatic elongation from nutrition-
ally essential LA and α-LNA, respectively.49 Furthermore,
decreases in dietary LA and increases in dietary α-LNA have
been reported to be neuroprotective in animal models. In rats,
reducing dietary α-LNA below a level considered to be PUFA
“adequate” reduces brain DHA concentration and uptake,
expression of DHA-selective iPLA2 VIA, and of brain derived
growth factor (BDNF) critical for neuronal integrity,58 while it
increases AA-metabolizing cPLA2 IVA, sPLA2 IIA and COX-2
activities. In contrast, reducing dietary LA below the “adequate”
level reduces brain AA concentration, kinetics and enzyme
expression, while reciprocally increasing corresponding DHA
parameters.59

While data are controversial with regard to dietary
intervention in the clinic, a cross-national study did identify a
signiﬁcant relation between greater DHA-containing seafood
consumption and lower prevalence rates of BD.60 Also, a review
of clinical trials reported that increased dietary n-3 PUFA in
combination with standard treatment
improved bipolar
depression, even taking into account sample bias.61 In the future,
one might maximize eﬀects of dietary intervention by combining
dietary n-3 PUFA supplementation with reduced dietary n-6
PUFA, which when compared to a standard diet was eﬀective in a
phase III trial in patients with migraine.62 Migraine occurs in 30%
of BD patients.63

4. ARACHIDONIC ACID CASCADE AND BIPOLAR

DISORDER BRAIN

BD genetics provide minimal evidence if any for the AA cascade
hypothesis. A signiﬁcant association with a calcium-independent
β (VIA) rs3788533 SNP (PLA2G6) in BD I has been
iPLA2
reported, and the activity of this enzyme was elevated in plasma
of patients with a history of psychoses.64 However, iPLA2 VIA is
largely selective for DHA hydrolysis.12a Association with the gene
for sPLA2 on chromosome 12q23-q24.1 also has been noted.65

Review

On the other hand, there is abundant evidence for general and
central inﬂammation as major contributing factors to BD, and
inﬂammation is classically associated with upregulated AA
metabolism and treated with nonsteroidal anti-inﬂammatory
drugs like aspirin and Celebrex (see above).66 Disturbed
circulating concentrations of proinﬂammatory interleukins,
TNF-α, and other cytokines have been reported in BD patients,
related to the manic or depressive phase of the disease as well as
to response to therapy.66

Studies on the post-mortem BD brain do show upregulated
AA cascade markers, thus a potential target of the mood
stabilizers, accompanied by evidence of neuroinﬂammation,
excitotoxicity, apoptosis, and synaptic loss. The changes are not
entirely speciﬁc to BD, as similar changes were demonstrated in
schizophrenic and Alzheimer’s disease brain tissue by the same
investigators.67 The changes may represent common late-stage
neurodegeneration in each disease, consistent with evidence of
biotype overlap (see above).3

In post-mortem BD compared with control prefrontal cortex,
mean protein and mRNA levels of AA-selective cPLA2 IVA,
sPLA2 IIA, COX-2, and membrane prostaglandin E synthase
(mPGES) were signiﬁcantly elevated, while levels of COX-1 and
cytosolic cPGES were reduced. mRNA and protein levels of
DHA-selective iPLA2 VIA, of 5-, 12-, and 15-LOX, of
thromboxane synthase (TXS) and of CYP450 did not diﬀer
from control values.67a In relation to the changes, BD compared
with control cortex demonstrated decreased expression of
antiapoptotic factors B-cell lymphoma (Bcl)-2 and BDNF, but
increased expression of pro-apoptotic Bcl-2-associated X protein
(BAX), Bcl-2 associated death promoter (BAD), and active
caspase-3 and -9.68 Higher levels also were noted of interleukin
(IL)-1β,
the IL-1 receptor (IL-1R), and of astrocyte and
microglia activation markers, glial ﬁbrillary acidic protein
(GFAP),
inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), c-fos, and
CD11b.69 Signiﬁcant synaptic loss, shown as reduced levels of
presynaptic synaptophysin and postsynaptic dendritic spine
drebrin, might explain the reported cognitive decline in BD.68
Indeed, synaptic loss often is evident
in conditions of
neuroinﬂammation and excitotoxicity, associated with an
upregulated AA cascade.67b,70

Despite the many similar changes, some diﬀerences between
changes in post-mortem BD and schizophrenia brain are
noteworthy. The dopamine reuptake transporter (DAT) is
downregulated in post-mortem schizophrenia and BD frontal
cortex,71 consistent with responsiveness of both diseases to
atypical antipsychotics. However, therapeutic responsiveness of
BD but not schizophrenia to lithium and the other mood
stabilizers that block the AA signal to NMDA in rat brain may
relate to an increased glutamate signaling in BD but not
schizophrenia brain. More than 90% of released glutamate is
cleared from the synaptic cleft by the excitatory amino acid
(reuptake) transporter (EAAT)2.72 EAAT2 is downregulated in
the BD cortex, as are NMDA receptor (NR) subunits NR1 and
NR2, consistent with increased glutamatergic activity (see
above).9,69 EAAT3 and EAAT4 are unchanged while EAAT1 is
elevated in BD.71 In schizophrenic cortex, EAAT1, EAAT3 and
EAAT4 are each upregulated while EAAT2 expression is
unchanged,71 consistent with decreased NMDA function in
schizophrenia.73 Decreased binding of cholinergic muscarinic
receptors in BD74 is consistent with lithium having an eﬀect by
upregulating the cholinergic muscarinic AA signal (Table 1).

5. DISCUSSION

BD represents a complex set of symptoms that evolve over time,
incompletely characterized pathophysiology, with multiple
low eﬀects, and without an
contributing genetic factors of
agreed-on behavioral animal model. There appear to be two
biostages, an initial one involving imbalance in neurotransmis-
sion−hyperglutamatergic and hyperdopaminergic transmission,
reduced cholinergic and altered serotonergic transmission, and a
later appearing stage with superimposed neurodegenerative
components associated with cognitive decline, symptom
worsening and brain atrophy, which overlaps with biotypes of
other neuropsychiatric disorders.

In this section, I review the AA hypothesis for the action of
lithium, and show that the hypothesis extrapolates to the actions
of the other FDA-approved mood stabilizers carbamazepine,
valproate and lamotrigine, but not to topiramate or gabapentin,
each of which failed phase III trials in BD patients.

The AA cascade hypothesis proposes that lithium and the
other mood stabilizers downregulate brain AA metabolism at
diﬀerent entry points (Figure 1). This suggested target of mood
stabilizers is consistent with studies showing upregulated cascade
markers in post-mortem BD prefrontal cortex, and can be tested
further in patients using PET to image brain AA metabolism. The
AA cascade hypothesis also may explain high switching rates of
BD depression to mania caused by the antidepressants ﬂuoxetine
and imipramine, and some treatment eﬀects of olanzapine and
clozapine. Further, it is supported by a pharmacoepidemiological
study showing that chronic low dose aspirin reduced morbidity
of patients taking lithium, and by evidence that high n-3 and/or
low n-6 PUFA diets are helpful in BD and migraine patients.

Lithium and the other mood stabilizers have proven eﬀective
in BD, but they do not always work, and they may work in some
individuals based on genetic speciﬁcity.75 Each also has unwanted
side eﬀects, leading to incomplete compliance and polyphar-
macy.1 Based on the AA cascade hypothesis and the suggested
targets of the current drugs at diﬀerent sites within the cascade,
future research should aim to develop less toxic and more
eﬀective mood stabilizers. This Review suggests that this aim
might be promoted by prescreening potential drug candidates for
their ability to reduce brain AA turnover and metabolic markers
in unanesthetized rodents, using our established kinetic methods
and model.1a,18 Our data also suggest that the animal model for
drug screening need not be a behavioral model, but rather might
be the intact unanesthetized rodent on which brain lipid
metabolic measurements can be performed. In the future,
combining mood stabilizers with low dose aspirin or dietary
intervention (high n-3/low n-6 PUFAs) may provide synergistic
amelioration of BD symptoms and reduce disease progression.
