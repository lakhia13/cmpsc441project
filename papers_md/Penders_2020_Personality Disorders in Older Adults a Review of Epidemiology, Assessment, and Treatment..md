Abstract
Purpose of Review The aim of the paper is reviewing recent literature on the epidemiology, assessment, and treatment of
personality disorders (PDs) among older adults (≥ 60 years).
Recent Findings Since 2015, 12 primary empirical studies have been published addressing PDs in older adults; 3 addressing
epidemiological aspects, 6 on assessment, 2 exploring both epidemiology and assessment, and 1 examining treatment. PD
research in older adults is steadily growing and is predominantly focused on assessment. The studies showed that PDs were
rather prevalent ranging from 10.6–14.5% in community-dwelling older adults, to 57.8% in nursing home–residing older adults.
The Severity Indices of Personality Problems-Short Form, Gerontological Personality disorders Scale, and Assessment of DSM-
IV Personality Disorders turned out to be promising instruments for assessing PDs in later life. Furthermore, schema therapy
seems to be a feasible and effective intervention.
Summary Despite promising findings, there is an urgent need for studies addressing PDs in older adults, especially studies
investigating epidemiological aspects and treatment options. Furthermore, new areas of interest arise such as PDs in other
settings, and behavioral counseling.

Introduction

In 2000, Agronin and Maletta highlighted the research gap on
personality disorders (PDs) in older adults, suggesting that the
lack of longitudinal data and the absence of age-appropriate
diagnostic instruments as well as an elderly adjusted nosology
contributed to this dearth of research [1]. Fifteen years later,
van Alphen and colleagues reviewed the scientific data and
concluded that still only a modest number of studies have
focused on PDs in later life. However, empirical research
within this field did increasingly address the absence of ap-
propriate assessment options by focusing on psychometric
properties of age-specific personality tests, the age-neutrality
of instruments, and validation of personality inventories in
older adults. Treatment studies were nevertheless scarce [2(cid:129)].
Meanwhile, the nosological difficulties remained.
Although the age-appropriateness of the PD criteria was in-
creasingly debated (e.g., [3]), the upcoming editions of the
DSM [4, 5] are inattentive to PDs in later life nor age-related
aspects. As van Alphen and colleagues [2(cid:129)] discussed the role
of the current classification system of PDs in later life, they
also saw opportunities which the recent included alternative

dimensional model might have in stimulating PD research in
older adults.

PDs in older adults are quite prevalent and given the aging
population, clinicians are often confronted with these older
adults. Considering the serious consequences, there is a clin-
ical need for adequate assessment and treatment options for
PDs in older adults. To keep track on recent developments and
research initiatives which may provide considerations for clin-
ical practice, this article evaluates primary studies on the epi-
demiological, diagnostic, and treatment aspects of PDs in
older adults of the last 6 years.

Methods

A literature search was performed between November 2018 and
April 2019, using the databases of Medline/Pubmed and
PsycINFO, to review papers published between July 2014 and
April 2019, describing the epidemiology, assessment, and treat-
ment of personality disorders (PDs) in older adults (≥ 60 years).
This interval was chosen in order to include studies published after
the most recent literature review on a similar subject matter [2(cid:129)].
The search consisted of the keywords “personality disor-
der(s)” or “personality pathology” and “older adults” or “elderly”
or “late(r) life”, which were required to appear in the article title
or abstract. English and Dutch articles of primary empirical stud-
ies were included when PDs (conform DSM) in adults aged
60 years and older were the primary focus, and the studies ad-
dressed PDs in relation to epidemiology, assessment, or treat-
ment. Articles were excluded if (1) PDs were accessory (e.g.,
covariate or comorbid condition) or when (2) they addressed
personality or (adaptive) personality traits; (3) other than DSM,
typologies (e.g., “type A”) were used; (4) the main focus was on
adults < 60 years; (5) they addressed themes beyond the scope of
this review; and (6) it contains primary non-empirical or second-
ary research (e.g., case-studies, Delphi-studies, and reviews). The
abstracts and articles were reviewed by the first author. In the
case of doubt, the other authors reviewed the concerning ab-
stracts and/or articles as well. Then, in- or exclusion followed
when consensus (agreement between at least 3 authors) was
reached. Figure 1 describes the selection process in detail.

Results

Epidemiology: Prevalence and Associations With
Cognitive Disorders and Quality of Life

In total, 5 studies reported prevalence rates of PDs in older
adults; one of these studies also addressed the association with
cognitive disorders and another examined health-related qual-
ity of life in the presence of PDs as well. Table 1 summarizes
the reported prevalence rates across studies.

The largest study [6], based on the National Epidemiologic
Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC) using
Wave 1 data of 16,884 community-dwelling adults aged 50
and older, revealed a prevalence rate of roughly 10.7% for
having at least one PD. The highest rates were found for
obsessive-compulsive PD (6.5%) followed by paranoid PD
(2.5%), while dependent PD (0.4%) and histrionic PD
(0.8%) were the least prevalent. Furthermore, the individuals
with PDs were more likely to be male, younger, and higher
educated than the individuals without PDs. However, this
study did not address the whole PD range; borderline,
schizotypal, and narcissistic PDs were not assessed.

Using Wave 2 data of NESARC, which covered all ten
PDs, Reynolds and colleagues [7] found that the prevalence
of PDs among older adults is approximately 14.5%. Again,
obsessive-compulsive PD was the most prevalent (7.6%), now
followed by narcissistic PD (3.9%). Once more, dependent
PD (0.26%) and histrionic PD (0.70%) were the least common
PDs. The higher prevalence rate might be explained by the
inclusion of all the 10 PDs, as borderline (3.2%) narcissistic,
and schizotypal (2.4%) PDs which were absent in Wave 1 data
appeared to be quite prevalent in this study. Furthermore, PDs
were significantly more common in older men (16.8%) than in
elderly woman (12.7%), with the exception of paranoid,
avoidant, and dependent PD which were more prevalent in
females. They also differentiated the prevalence rate within
four age groups: young-old, middle-old, old-old, and oldest-
old. Aside from dependent PD, all PDs differed significantly
across age-groups. Overall, with increasing age, prevalence
rates decreased. However, for avoidant, obsessive-compul-
sive, paranoid, and histrionic PD, a slight but non-significant
upturn in occurrence was noted from the old-old to the oldest-
old. This was mainly due to increasing prevalence rates for
these PDs among men, except for obsessive-compulsive PD
which rose with almost 35% in the most aged women.

The study of Oltmanns and colleagues [8(cid:129)(cid:129)] using data
of 1630 middle-aged community-dwelling adults (55–
65 years) of the St. Louis Personality and Aging
Network (SPAN) revealed a prevalence rate of about
11%; 8.2% had at least 1 PD, 1.8% with the criteria of
personality disorder not otherwise specified (PDNOS),
and roughly 1% qualified for having two or three PDs.
In line with the other studies, obsessive-compulsive PD
was most frequently observed (2.9%) now followed by
avoidant PD (2.5%). Schizotypal (0.1%), dependent
(0.1), and histrionic PD (0.2%) were the least common.
Additionally, they found that 9.3% of the participants fell
one criterion short of a diagnosis, and could therefore be
classified as having a “subthreshold” PD. When compar-
ing these findings to those of Reynolds and colleagues’
[7] subsample of young-old adults, the prevalence rates in
the latter study are substantially higher with the exception
of avoidant PD and even remain higher when the PD rates

in Oltmanns’ study are combined with the subthreshold
rates. As both research groups used seemingly comparable
samples, namely community-dwelling adults aged 55–
64 years living in the USA, and the assessment of PDs
differed, this might explain these deviating PD rates.

Although the findings from NESARC and SPAN studies
showed that dependent PD is quite infrequently observed
(0.1%–0.3%) this PD appeared to be substantially more prevalent
in Central Africa. In a cross-sectional multicenter community-
dwelling population in Central Africa (n = 1772), the prevalence

of dependent PD was 14.4% [9]. Moreover, the prevalence rates
differed depending on cognitive status. The highest rates were
found among the elderly with MCI (26.5%), followed by the
elderly with dementia (25.8%). In older adults without cognitive
disorders, the prevalence rate was 12.7%. Pilleron and colleagues
attributed their surprisingly high prevalence rate to the use of
DSM-IV criteria [4] which are insufficiently adapted to older
adults, as well as to the older adults’ proneness to respond con-
firmatory on PD items due to physical illnesses rather than psy-
chological disturbances. Although these factors are known to
complicate the assessment of PDs within the aged, they seem
unlikely to explain the discrepancy in prevalence as the
NESARC and SPAN studies (and nearly all studies for that mat-
ter) rely on instruments based on DSM PD criteria as well.
Furthermore, these studies should encompass this “proneness”
at least to a certain extent as well, as they all sampled older adults.
It seems more likely that the use of the Personality Disorders
Questionnaire (PDQ-4), which has a high false positive rate
[10] and cultural aspects might account for this difference, as
studies show that individuals living in more traditional societies,
as is Central Africa, score higher on dependent traits than those in
more westernized cultures [11]. Moreover, the cognitive status
might bias the judgements about PDs; interviewees might have
attributed some items (incorrectly) to enduring personality pat-
terns instead of to the person’s current (cognitive) state. In some
cases, informants even responded to the PD questionnaire on
behalf of the older adult, which might introduce bias too.

On e st ud y ex a m in ed PD p re v ale n ce in a n on -
community-dwelling elderly population. In a sample of 83
older adults living in nursing centers or joining senior citi-
zen clubs, about 58% were diagnosed with a PD when using
the French version of the Questionnaire on Personality
Traits [12]. Avoidant (20.5%), obsessive-compulsive
(12.0%), and paranoid PD (12.0%) appeared to be the most
prevalent while both histrionic and antisocial PD were ab-
sent in this sample. All PDs were more prevalent in men,
except schizotypal PD which was more often seen in women
than men (1.7% versus 0.0%). However, some caution is
warranted when interpreting the numbers, as the sample size
is rather small, it relied on self-report which might be biased
due to interference of age-related cognitive decline, and the
questionnaire on personality traits (QPT) tends to overesti-
mate the prevalence PDs [13].

Aside from prevalence rates, Pilleron and colleagues [9]
examined the relationship between dependent PD and cogni-
tive disorders. They found that after controlling for
sociodemographic, vascular, and psychological covariates,
the elderly with dependent PD were 2.18 times more likely
to have MCI, than the older adults without this PD. Although
dependent PD was also associated with dementia after
adjusting for sociodemographic factors (OR = 1.98, CI =
1.25–3.14, ρ = 0.004), this association faded when vascular
and psychological factors were taken into account.

Holzer, Huang [6] investigated the association between
PDs and physical health-related quality of life (PHRQoL).
They found that the presence of a PD was related to clinically
significant worse PHRQoL compared with older adults with-
out these disorders. However, after taken sociodemographic
and psychosocial covariates into account, only dependent,
paranoid, and obsessive-compulsive PDs remained associated
with decreased PHRQoL. These findings suggest that specific
symptoms of these PDs may be related to PHRQoL. Still, it is
also possible that that an unmeasured covariate may be pres-
e n t , g i v e n t h a t P D d i a g n o s e s c o m b i n e d w i t h
sociodemographic factors only explain 15% of the variance
of PHRQoL score.

As these 5 studies used a variety of research methods and
PD measures, direct comparison between prevalence rates is
complex. Most of these instruments, although validated in
various settings, have not yet been corroborated in older
adults. Furthermore, these are based on the DSM criteria
which contain measurement bias in older adults [3, 14].
Different sample types (community-dwelling, non-communi-
ty-dwelling) with varying comorbidity and differences in age
distribution across samples as well as diverse cultures (USA,
Europe, Africa) may affect prevalence rates as well.

Clinical Implications

These studies prove that PDs are quite prevalent in later life
[6–9, 12], and as they are known to have a serious impact on
one’s life, such as high levels of suffering and decreased func-
tioning [15], straining the clinician-patient relationship by
(interpersonal) difficulties, treatment rejection, and non-
compliance [15], it is important for clinicians to be alert to
PDs in older adults.

Moreover, the presences of a PD may complicate the rec-
ognition of/and adversely affect treatment of comorbid disor-
ders [16]. In the case of PDs, treatment outcomes are poor(er),
whereas the rates of relapse and readmission increases [17].
This, in addition to the already complex clinical picture of
older adults who often have multiple medical conditions,
whether or not combined with psychiatric comorbidity and
polypharmacy [18], seems to make it all the more important
to have valid and reliable instruments to facilitate “early” de-
tection of PDs in older adults [19]. Being more attentive to
PDs in late life may enable the clinician to take personality
functioning into account when considering his approach and
communication to optimize older adults’ treatment compli-
ance and to tailor interventions to accommodate the specific
needs of individual patients [20] which may enhance the odds
of a positive response to treatment and circumvent treatment
dropout. Furthermore, it may allow the clinician (such as gen-
eral practitioners, geriatricians) to screen for PDs and to make
faster and more specific referrals to mental health settings

where further diagnostic assessments and treatment options
are available [20].

Assessment

Diagnosing PDs, which ideally requires the use of multiple
sources of information, is a challenging endeavor due to the
complex and multifaceted nature of these disorders. This is
even more true when assessing PDs in older adults where
multimorbidity obscuring the clinical picture is the rule rather
than the exception, and available instruments, mostly de-
signed for (young) adults, are not automatically applicable to
the elderly [19]. This severely complicates the already com-
plex diagnostic process. Hence, there is a need for age-
appropriate instruments.

Since 2015, 8 studies addressed the assessment of PDs in
older adults, mostly by validating existing instruments within
older adults or by examining their age-neutrality. The investi-
gated instruments parallel the full PD spectrum of DSM-5; the
studies used the Gerontological Personality disorders Scale
(GPS; [21]) which is based on section II general PD criteria,
the Structured Interview for DSM-IV Personality (SIDP-IV;
[22]), the Questionnaire in Personality traits (QTP/VKP-4;
[23]), the Multisource Assessment of Personality Pathology
(MAPP; [24]), and the Assessment of DSM-IV Personality
Disorders (ADP-IV; [25]) all addressing section II specific
PD criteria. To overcome the issues linked to categorical clas-
sification, such as diagnostic heterogeneity within categories
and extensive co-occurrence of PDs, a dimensional counter-
part, the alternative model for personality, was included in the
DSM-5 section III “emerging measures and models” which
stimulated research in the elderly as well. The Severity Indices
of Personality Problems Short Form (SIPP-SF, derived from
the SIPP-118; [26]) which covers criterion A level of person-
ality functioning and the Personality Inventory for DSM-5
Brief Form [27] tapping onto the trait dimensions of criterion
B were both validated as well as investigated with regard to
their age-neutrality. The latter analysis was also done for the
Dimensional Assessment of Personality Pathology Basic
Questionnaire (DAPP-BQ) which measures maladaptive trait
dimensions. Table 2 summarizes the main findings per study.
In the past years, three personality measures have been
examined regarding their construct validity in older adults.
These were all relatively short instruments, mainly relying
on self-report, the SIPP-SF [28(cid:129), 29], the Personality
Inventory for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
Disorders, Fifth edition, Brief Form (PID-5-BF) [28(cid:129), 30],
and the GPS [20, 31]. The 60-item version of the SIPP was
significantly correlated to other PD instruments (i.e., the GPS,
the PID-5-BF, and the DAPP-BQ) [28(cid:129), 29] and was to be able
to differentiate between older adults with normal personality
functioning and those with personality dysfunctioning [28(cid:129)].
Beside construct validity, the concurrent validity of the PID-5-

Curr Psychiatry Rep (2020) 22: 14

BF in older adults was established as well. This brief version,
consisting of 25 items, was significantly positively correlated
to the 220 items of the original PID-5, and the same higher
order domains were corroborated [30]. Furthermore, the PID-
5-BF proved to be able to discriminate older adults with mal-
adaptive personality traits from the elderly with adaptive per-
sonality traits [28(cid:129)]. These short tests appeared to be useful for
assessing personality functioning and maladaptive personality
traits, which taken together form the basis of the DSM-5’s
alternative model of personality disorders [5]. Lastly, both
self- and informant-report versions of the Gerontological
Personality disorders Scale (GPS; 21) which is a 16-item
age-specific screener for PDs among older outpatients in men-
tal healthcare have been validated in community-dwelling
older adults sampled from 5 general practices. The sensitivity
(78%) and specificity (65%) of the informant version have
been found to be adequate. However, the diagnostic accuracy
of the self-report version was limited [20]. Aside from its
validity, the feasibility and acceptability of the GPS was ex-
amined as well [31]. The GPS appeared to be a useful tool in
general practice as it was judged to be feasible and acceptable
by professionals and older adults and informants.

In addition, since 2015 a number of studies have examined
the cross-age validity of personality measures. Aside from
construct validity, the SIPP-SF and the PID-5-BF have been
examined for age-neutrality [28(cid:129), 29] as has the ADP-IV [32],
by comparing mean scores across age groups, differential
items functioning (DIF), and differential test functioning
(DTF). When an item has DIF, this implies that the probability
of endorsing an item response is not the same across two
groups (e.g., old and young), even when they display the same
level on a common latent personality dimension. The aggre-
gated impact op DIF may jeopardize the comparability of the
scale scores across the perspectives, which is assessed with
DTF. In the ADP-IV, when used categorically, only 2 of the 79
(2.5%) items assessing personality disorder symptoms had
DIF in favor of older adults. When used dimensionally, 4
items were not age-neutral. The amount of DIF, however,
did not result in the whole PD scale scores being biased. The
mean scores on eight of the ten PDs displayed significant age
differences; overall older adults scored lower than young
adults. However, there were no age differences between older
adults and middle-aged adults. [32]. Personality functioning
as measured with the SIPP-IV displayed somewhat more DIF;
3 of the 60 items were biased favoring one age-group over the
other. On a scale level, relational capacities showed DTF
[28(cid:129)]. Furthermore, there were limited to no age differences
in mean scores [28(cid:129), 29]. A more cautious approach is needed
when assessing maladaptive traits in older adults with the
PID-5-BF, as 25% of the items and all domains appeared to
function differently across age [28(cid:129)].

Courtois and colleagues did an exploratory study toward
the development of the French version of the QPT by

assessing its association with the Big Five Inventory. They
found that PDs in older adults as assessed with the QPT were
significantly correlated with Openness, Conscientiousness,
Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism [12].

As assessment of PDs should ideally involve multiple
sources, questions emerge regarding agreement and which
source indicates more pathology. Oltmanns and colleagues
[8(cid:129)(cid:129)] compared three sources of information in a sample of older
adults; a clinical interview (SIDP-IV), a self-report questionnaire,
and an informant-report questionnaire (both MAPP). They found
that the concordance between the measures was low to moderate,
indicating that they identify some of the same symptoms but
mainly provide unique information. Unsurprisingly, the agree-
ment between the SIDP-IV and the self-report MAPP was the
highest, which is probably due to shared variance as they both tap
into the self-report perspective. Further, the clinical interview
appears to be the most conservative in assessing PDs in older
adults, followed by self-report. Informants, then again, reported
the most pathology.

Current research revealed that the SIPP-SF, the PID-5-BF, the
DAPP-BQ, and the GPS are adequate instruments for assessing
PDs in older adults. However, as the studies were conducted in
either general population or highly specific and relatively small
clinical populations, the generalizability of these results may be
limited. Overall, these studies pointed out that the expressions of
personality functioning (criterion A) can be more reliably com-
pared and assessed over age-groups than maladaptive personality
traits (criterion B) can. Furthermore, it appeared that personality
functioning and pathological traits were more and strongly cor-
related in older adults than in young adults, suggesting that in
older adults certain domains of personality functioning can be
more indicative for the presence of maladaptive traits. Including
other sources of information, such as informant-report, can aid in
the assessment of PDs. However, the choice of source can impact
the findings as they may vary in the level of conservativeness.

Clinical Implications

In comparison to adults (< 60 years), there are only few reli-
able and valid instruments for diagnosing PDs in older adults.
Aside from the lack of age-adjustments, many PD self-report
questionnaires and semi-structured interviews rely on a large
number of complex items (e.g. abstract language use, use of
double negatives), which may often be quite burdensome for
older adults. Fortunately, research on assessing PD in older
adults is growing and recent efforts show that there are now a
number of brief, age-neutral, and valid (although mostly self-
report) instruments available, albeit for general or highly spe-
cific populations [8(cid:129)(cid:129), 20, 28(cid:129), 29–32].

However, it is important to also use other sources of informa-
tion in complementing PD assessment as well as guiding its
interpretation [33]. Older adults might have had several
(psychological) treatments during their life, wherewithal medical

and/or psychiatric records [34]. Biographical information and
informant information might be available as well which could
provide insight regarding personality traits and psychosocial
(dys)functioning. This information can shed some light on the
enduringness of personality pathology. Informant report may
prove useful when verifying life-events, overcoming the possible
effects of sensory and cognitive impairment troubling self-report.
Additionally, it may also have incremental value by adding cru-
cial information in PD assessment, as self-report might be biased
due to the presence of severe psychopathology, limited self-
awareness, distorted self-perceptions, or as a result of reluctance
to disclose problems [35–37]. Furthermore, as the clinical pre-
sentation of PDs in late life might be more complex due to
cognitive aging, psychopathology, medical conditions, and
polypharmacy [18], including various sources of information to
the assessment of PD, if needed complemented by medical ex-
amination (e.g. excluding medical conditions such as head trau-
ma), is therefore recommendable.

Treatment

Since 2015, only one study has been published examining PD
treatment effectiveness in later life. This study used a non-
concurrent multiple-baseline design to investigate the value
of schema therapy in eight elderly mental health outpatients
(62–76 years) with a primary diagnosis of a cluster C PD or
PDNOS with cluster C traits as assessed by the Dutch version
of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV PDs (SCID-
II; [38]). Videler and colleagues [39(cid:129)(cid:129)] found that schema
therapy decreased the credibility of dysfunctional core belief,
led to symptom and complaint reduction, and improved the
quality of life. At follow-up, the participants did no longer
meet the general or cluster-specific criteria of a PD, and they
were remitted from PD diagnosis. Moreover, most of the ef-
fect sizes of these findings were high, which is in line treat-
ment effects in (young) adults [40].

Although this showed that schema therapy is feasible and
effective in later life PDs, results cannot be merely generalized
to other populations or other PDs, given the small sample size
and its focus on cluster C PDs only.

Clinical Implications

The current search pointed out that treatment of PDs in older
adults is still a highly underexplored topic, probably stemming
from a therapeutic nihilism. However, the study of Videler and
colleagues [39(cid:129)(cid:129)] showed that treating PD in older adults can
be effective and feasible, as do the findings of a small number
of (case) studies [41–43], thereby pointing out that this skep-
ticism is unwarranted.

When deciding on the most appropriate intervention for an
older adult with personality pathology, it is important to not
only evaluate his/her needs, level of motivation and

cooperation, type and severity of the PD, but to also take the
degree of functional limitations reflecting somatic and cogni-
tive comorbidity into account [44, 45]. Besides, specific ge-
rontological treatment concerns should be essential topics in
treatment, such as beliefs about and the consequences of so-
matic ailments, changing life perspective, cohort and socio-
cultural context-bound beliefs, intergenerational linkages, and
the loss of social roles [42]. Treating PDs in older adults there-
fore seems to require a more tailored and personalized
approach.

Furthermore, experts believe that interventions for PDs in
older adults can be considered allocated on a continuum, rang-
ing from supportive-structuring treatment approaches (e.g.,
psychoeducation, behavioral counseling) to adaptation-
focused (e.g., social skills training) to personality-changing
interventions (e.g., schema therapy, dialectical behavior ther-
apy) for each of which in- and exclusion criteria were formu-
lated [44, 45]. Moreover, initial results show that applying
clinical staging of PDs in treatment indication might improve
its outcomes and may facilitate early detection [46, 47]. While
empirical research addressing interventions for older adults
with PDs are needed, the above-described recommendations
can aid in defining achievable treatment goals and choosing
the most appropriate treatment level.

Discussion

While reviewing the eligibility of the articles addressing epi-
demiological, assessment, and treatment aspects of PD in
older adults (Fig. 1), there appeared to be an inconsistency
of terminology. Although in the first instance all the articles
seemed to be focused on PDs, a considerable number of arti-
cles (i.e., 9) turned out to be less clear about their central
theme, thereby excluded from the current review. The terms
PDs, PD features, PD symptomatology, and (high levels of)
PD symptoms were used interchangeably. Furthermore,
whereas a number of studies gave the impression to concen-
trate on PDs, after carefully reading only a minority of the
participants met the full criteria of PDs. In other studies, the
prevalence of PDs was absent, or the information published
did not permit the identification of participants with PDs.

With about 35% of the potentially eligible articles using
inconsistent terminology, it seems that the construct and/or
definition of PDs in older adults might be not that clear or
straightforward. Factors like different and more atypical clin-
ical presentations in later life, a more temporal instable course,
and late(r) onset [48, 49] may have contributed to this. This
has multiple implications. On a more practical level, it com-
plicates comparability between studies, impeding generaliz-
ability of the findings which are already scarce in this age
group. On a fundamental level, it interferes the diagnostic
process which, especially in older adults, is already no

14 Page 12 of 14

Curr Psychiatry Rep (2020) 22: 14

sinecure. Consequently, as diagnosis precedes and guides in-
terventions, it hampers treatment as well.

The inconsistency in terminology might also signal the
importance of examining the full spectrum of personality
functioning and traits. Indeed, the distinction between the
presence and absence of a PD is somewhat arbitrary. With
lowering by 1 criterion, the prevalence of PDs in older adults
would almost double [8(cid:129)(cid:129)]. Furthermore, a substantial number
of people exhibit at least some symptoms of personality pa-
thology. Aside from investigating full-blown PDs, further re-
search on PD symptoms in older adults is relevant as studies
show that these symptoms may be vital in predicting physical
health problems and other mental disorders [15, 50, 51].

Reviewing recent studies reveal that promising steps are taken
in the field of late life PD. However, further PD research, irre-
spective of its theme, should be carried out among the full range
of older adults, such as investigating the previous examined in-
struments across various settings and cultures of older adults.
Furthermore, studies developing age-specific cutoff scores for
domains displaying DIF (and not DTF which implies that it does
not represent the same measurement across groups), establishing
age-related norms, and developing informant-report instruments
are needed. Moreover, it would be valuable to examine which
content is best assessed by older adult self-report and what kind
of information should be captured from an informant perspective.
Also replications of Videler’s treatment study [39(cid:129)(cid:129)], preferably
RCTs, with larger sample sizes and addressing the whole PD
spectrum are needed. Exploring the effectivity of other treatment
modalities for PDs in older adults, albeit personality changing,
adaptation enhancing, or contextually focused, is of importance
as well including empirical studies addressing the usefulness of
in- and exclusion criteria per treatment level and clinical staging
and health management of PDs.

New Areas of Interest

Because of the global aging population, increasing clinical
and scientific attention for PDs in older adults is of impor-
tance, and also new areas of interest such as other settings,
and behavioral counseling may arise.

Recent PD research has been mainly focused on older adults
from either general or highly specific inpatient populations.
Although research within these populations should be stimulated,
other settings, such as assisted living facilities, geriatric medicine,
and general practice, should be considered as well.

Considering the prevalence of PDs in older adults, the ag-
ing population, and their central role in healthcare, general
practitioners (GPs) are often the first and perhaps the most
frequently contacted healthcare provider, who is consulted
by older adults with PDs, although these disorders, given their
ego-syntonic nature, are usually not the main reason for con-
sultation. Therefore, GPs can play a key role in the detection
of PDs in older adults. Early detection is important as it may

circumvent certain negative consequences of PDs and contrib-
ute in reducing economic costs, by making referrals to spe-
cialized mental health care for further assessment and treat-
ment, preventing hospital admissions, taking personality into
account, and tailoring treatments whereby minimizing non-
compliance and negative treatment outcomes. Given their of-
ten longtime involvement, GPs may also provide crucial ad-
ditional information about the older adult’s lifespan.

However, resources for recognizing and managing PDs in
older adults are scarce within this setting (as is research), com-
plicating the GP’s work. Further research within this setting,
given the GP’s central role, is urgently needed.

Another new area of interest might be behavioral counsel-
ing. This review points out that research on the effectivity of
treatment of PD in older adults is still limited. Research that
has been conducted was focused on interventions on (a more
direct) patient-level. However, factors like severe cognitive
deficits or treatment rejection can severely hamper interven-
tion options in older adults with PD, sometimes making
(direct) psychological treatments impossible. In these cases,
a more contextual and indirect approach such as behavioral
counseling might be an acceptable and appropriate alternative.
In behavioral counseling, the intervention is of an indirect
nature, as the patient’s behavior is treated by influencing his/
her significant others, caretakers, or nursing staff.

A promising form of behavioral counseling, based on the
cognitive therapy, is the Cognitive Model for Behavioral
Interventions (CoMBI; [52]), which is specifically developed
for nursing staff-members dealing with older adults with PDs.
In this protocol the ten PDs are described by means of self-
image, perception of others, eliciting event, and the patients’
challenging behavior. The patient’s core needs to play a cen-
tral role in this intervention. This model assumes that when the
patient’s core needs are insufficiently met, due to a triggering
event, both his/her self-image and perceptions of others will
be confirmed thereby provoking the challenging behavior.
However, if the triggering event can be substituted by staff
members addressing the patient’s core needs, the challenging
behavior will decrease. The feasibility of this 4-step protocol
is currently investigated in several facilities.

Conclusions

Since the review of van Alphen and colleagues [2(cid:129)], only a
limited number of studies addressed epidemiological, assess-
ment, and treatment aspects of PDs in older adults.
Nonetheless, these studies hold a promising view. Aside from
the attempts to map the prevalence of PDs in later life, studies
show continuing efforts examining the age-neutrality of
existing items and instruments, developing age-specific mea-
sures, and validating PD questionnaires in older adults, here-
with mainly using instruments tapping into the DSM-5’s

Curr Psychiatry Rep (2020) 22: 14

alternative model of PDs. Moreover, there is initial proof of
treatment effectiveness. These studies show that (research on)
PD in older adults should not be dismissed, but that they hold
the future.
