Abstract
Background and Objectives
Lipid metabolism in older adults is aﬀected by various factors including biological aging,
functional decline, reduced physiologic reserve, and nutrient intake. The dysregulation of lipid
metabolism could adversely aﬀect brain health. This study investigated the association between
year-to-year intraindividual lipid variability and subsequent risk of cognitive decline and de-
mentia in community-dwelling older adults.

Methods
ASPirin in Reducing Events in the Elderly (ASPREE) was a randomized trial of aspirin, involving
19,114 participants aged 65 years and older from Australia and the United States who were free of
dementia and major cognitive impairment. ASPREE-eXTension is the post-trial observational follow-
up of participants, currently to a maximum of 11 years. This post hoc analysis included participants
who had lipid levels measured at baseline and in years 1, 2, and 3. Year-to-year variability in total
cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol
(HDL-c), and triglycerides over the ﬁrst 3 years was quantiﬁed using variability independent of the
mean. Individuals who initiated or discontinued lipid-lowering therapy during this period were
excluded. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression was used to analyze associations with
incident dementia, adjudicated by expert panels, and cognitive impairment with no dementia (CIND)
conﬁrmed by a battery of cognitive tests, occurring after year 3. A linear mixed model was used for
assessing the association with changes in 4 cognitive function domains, including global, memory,
processing speed, verbal ﬂuency, and a composite score from baseline to the end of follow-up.

Results
The analysis included 9,846 individuals (median [interquartile range] age: 73.9 [71.7–77.3] years,
54.9% female). 509 incident dementia and 1,760 CIND events were recorded over a median
follow-up of 5.8 and 5.4 years after variability assessment. The hazard ratios (95% CI) comparing
the highest and lowest quartiles of TC and LDL-c variability were 1.60 (1.23–2.08) and 1.48
(1.15–1.91) for dementia and 1.23 (1.08–1.41) and 1.27 (1.11–1.46) for CIND. Higher TC and
LDL-c variability was also associated with a faster decline in global cognition, episodic memory,
psychomotor speed, and the composite score (all p < 0.001). No strong evidence was found for an
association of HDL-c and triglyceride variability with dementia and cognitive change.

Introduction
Dementia and cognitive decline are major health issues dis-
proportionately aﬀecting older adults and have an insidious
onset. Early detection and treatment can slow disease pro-
gression. Dyslipidemia at midlife has been identiﬁed as a risk
factor of cognitive decline and dementia later in life.1-4
However, the impact of lipid levels measured in older age on
neurocognitive outcomes is less deﬁned. Previous research
yielded mixed results, with many suggesting no signiﬁcant
association,5-7 while others found that low cholesterol may
increase the dementia risk.8,9 Most studies used cholesterol
values measured at a single time point, which fails to account
for what the level was in the past and ﬂuctuations over time.
Lipid levels in older individuals are more dynamic, inﬂuenced
not only by factors such as physical activity and diet but also
by reduced physiologic reserve, morbidities, functional de-
cline and sarcopenia, and more frequent use of lipid-lowering
medications.10 Consequently, lipid measurements taken in
later life may reﬂect transient rather than enduring values,
potentially under/overestimating their long-term impact and
cumulative risk exposure from midlife onward.

Monitoring cholesterol ﬂuctuations through repeated meas-
urements could provide complementary risk information on
dementia and cognitive decline, particularly in older people.11
Despite such potential, the clinical value of monitoring lipid
changes measured in late life for identifying high-risk individ-
uals for dementia and cognitive decline has been largely
understudied. Few studies investigating this relationship have
often been limited by short follow-up periods, inclusion of
younger adults, small sample sizes, and lack of administration of
cognitive tests.12-17 This study leveraging the extensive data
from a large-scale randomized trial—the ASPirin in Reducing
Events in the Elderly (ASPREE), with its post-trial observa-
tional phase, ASPREE-eXTension (ASPREE-XT)—addressed
these limitations and examined the association between the
change (measured by year-to-year variability) in various lipid
metrics and subsequent risk of cognitive impairment and in-
cident dementia (robustly adjudicated by an international ex-
pert panel rather than relying on hospital records) in an older
cohort.

Methods
Study Design
The ASPREE and ASPREE-XT studies have been described
previously.18-21 In brief, ASPREE (NCT01038583) was a double-
blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of low-dose
aspirin. A total of 19,114 community-dwelling individuals
aged 70 years and older (≥65 for US ethnic minorities) were
recruited from Australia (87%) and the United States
(13%). Participants had no history of cardiovascular disease
(CVD) events, diagnosed dementia, independence-limiting
physical disability, or signiﬁcant cognitive decline (Modiﬁed
Mini-Mental State [3MS] Examination score ≥78) at trial
entry. Participants were not excluded based on their cog-
nitive scores on other domains. The intervention phase of
the ASPREE trial ended in June 2017. ASPREE-XT is an
ongoing post-trial observational study following those
(>80%) who consented to be followed for further 5 years.
For this analysis, we used data from both ASPREE and
ASPREE-XT (data cut until 2021) with a maximum follow-
up of 11 years. No informed consent was required for this
post hoc analysis.

Setting and Participants
At baseline and each annual visit, participants were required to
fast overnight and their blood samples were collected in a local
clinic or pathology center the following day for lipid and
glucose measurements. Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol
(LDL-c) was calculated using the Friedewald equation in
most cases and only measured directly if triglyceride is too
high.22 Participants who had cholesterol values measured at
baseline and year 1, 2, and 3 annual visits were included in this
analysis. Because we aimed to study change in lipid levels
unrelated to changes in lipid-lowering treatment (com-
mencement or cessation per se), those who initiated or dis-
continued the medication during the measurement period
were excluded. Because doses of lipid-lowering therapy were
unknown, the eﬀect of dose changes on lipid variability could
not be investigated. Participants were asked to bring all cur-
rently used prescription medications or a list of these to their
baseline and annual visits. When this was not possible, med-
ication use was ascertained by self-report and subsequently

possible.

cognitive score was lower than 1.5 SD were excluded from the
CIND analysis.

Lipid Variability
The main exposure of interest is year-to-year intraindividual
variability of total cholesterol (TC), which represents the
ﬂuctuations in TC annually within a single individual over
time. Analyses were also conducted for the intraindividual
variability of other lipid metrics including LDL-c, high-density
lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c), and triglycerides. Lipid
variability was quantiﬁed using 4 consecutive measurements
at baseline and at year 1 through year 3. Diﬀerent indices
were considered12,23,24: (1) SD; (2) coeﬃcient of variation;
(3) average real variability, deﬁned as the average absolute
diﬀerence between consecutive measurements; and (4) vari-
ability independent of the mean (VIM). Spearman correlation
analysis was used to describe the pairwise associations between
diﬀerent indices of TC variability and average mean TC values.
Because there was a high correlation between these indices, we
chose to use VIM to deﬁne variability in our analysis because it
is least correlated with the mean cholesterol values (eFigure 1).
VIM was calculated as VIM = k × SD  ðlipidÞ
mean  ðlipidÞm, where m is
computed from ﬁtting a power model SD(lipid) = constant ×
mean(lipid)m and k is the mean value of (mean(lipid))m.12
Mean(lipid) and SD (lipid) are the mean value and its SD
of 4 lipid measurements at baseline and at year 1, 2, and 3
annual visits. Formulas for other variability indices can be
found in eMethods 1.

Outcomes and Follow-Up
The main end point was incident all-cause dementia, a pre-
speciﬁed component of the primary outcome in ASPREE.
The diagnosis of dementia was adjudicated by an expert panel
who were blinded to the randomized study drug assignment
according to the criteria of the Diagnostic and Statistical
Manual of Mental Disorders,
fourth edition (details in
eMethods 2).25 Other end points included cognitive impair-
ment with no dementia (CIND) and changes in domain-
speciﬁc cognition. The latter include global cognitive function
measured by the 3MS Examination,26 episodic memory by the
Hopkins Verbal Learning Test–Revised27 Delayed Recall
task, psychomotor speed by the Symbol Digit Modalities
Test,28 and language and executive function by the single-
letter (F) Controlled Oral Word Association Test.29 The
cognitive test battery was administered at baseline and at years
1, 3, and 5, followed by a ﬁnal visit (which could have been
a given participant’s third, fourth, ﬁfth, sixth, or seventh an-
nual visit depending on the year of their recruitment), and at 4
subsequent ASPREE-XT annual visits (at the ﬁrst-year follow-
up of ASPREE-XT, only 3MS Examination was measured). A
composite z score for cognition was computed to integrate
these domains, as described previously, to reduce ceiling and
ﬂoor eﬀects.30,31 For all cognitive domains, a higher score
denotes better function. CIND was deﬁned as a >1.5-SD in-
dividual decline in the cognitive score of any domain, in the
absence of a dementia diagnosis. Participants whose baseline

For dementia and CIND, the follow-up started from year 3.
Those who had dementia (or CIND) or reached the end of
follow-up during the lipid variability measurement period
were excluded from the analysis for dementia (or CIND).
Participants were censored if they experienced the event of
interest (dementia for the dementia analysis and CIND for
the CIND analysis), reached the end of follow-up, or died,
whichever occurred ﬁrst. For cognitive change, the follow-up
started from baseline by assuming a bidirectional relationship
between cholesterol ﬂuctuation and cognitive change.

Statistical Analysis
Baseline descriptive statistics are presented as medians
(interquartile range; IQR) for continuous variables and fre-
quency (percentage) for categorical variables. To better show
the cumulative magnitude of lipid ﬂuctuations, we calculated
the total year-over-year absolute change in lipid levels
during the variability measurement period (|year 1 lipid level −
baseline lipid level | + | year 2 lipid level – year 1 lipid level | + |
year 3 lipid level − year 2 lipid level|) and the absolute change
between the fourth and the ﬁrst measurement, stratiﬁed by
each lipid metric quartile and use of lipid-lowering medications.

We used Cox proportional hazards regression models to assess
the association with subsequent incident dementia and CIND:
model 1 was adjusted for baseline sex and age; model 2 was
adjusted for sex, age, baseline race/country, body mass index
(BMI) categories, smoking status and alcohol consumption,
years of education, systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP/
DBP), use of antihypertensive and lipid-lowering medication,
diabetes, chronic kidney disease, family history of dementia,
Fried frailty criteria,32 randomized treatment assignment (as-
pirin/placebo), and 3MS Examination score, as well as mean
values of TC, HDL-c, and triglycerides from baseline through
year 3. For brevity, we only report model 2 results in the fol-
lowing text. Lipid variability was modeled as either a categorical
(by quartiles) or a continuous (per 1-SD increase) variable. For
the primary analysis of dementia, cumulative incidence curves
were plotted by the quartiles of each individual lipid variability.
Subgroup analysis was performed by age, sex, BMI categories,
smoking status, alcohol consumption, education, hypertension,
chronic kidney disease, lipid-lowering medication use, diabetes,
randomized treatment (aspirin/placebo), family history of de-
mentia, APOE e4 carrier status, 3MS Examination score (be-
low/above median), and frailty status (analysis was not
performed for race and country because of <20 dementia events
in US and non-Caucasian participants). Restricted cubic splines
with 3 prespeciﬁed knots based on Harrell recommended
percentiles (10th, 50th, 90th) were plotted to visualize the
potentially nonlinear association between lipid variability and
incident dementia. To aid in interpretation, we also assessed
whether the association with dementia was moderated by the
overall trend of lipid ﬂuctuation (ascending/descending) and

the baseline values (low, medium, high by tertile). The as-
cending (descending) trend was deﬁned as a higher (lower)
lipid level at year 3 than at the baseline.

To assess the association between lipid variability and cognitive
change over time, we used a linear mixed-eﬀect model for
repeated measures over time including random eﬀect for par-
ticipants and ﬁxed eﬀects of time (visit), lipid variability, the
interaction between lipid variability and visit, and covariates.

Two ancillary analyses were performed. First, we repeated all
analyses in participants who initiated or discontinued their
lipid-lowering treatment during the time of lipid variability
measurements, so as to compare the impact of drug-induced
and no drug-induced changes in lipid values on risks of neu-
rocognitive outcomes. Second, we replaced the lipid vari-
ability with mean value of each lipid metric measured from
baseline through year 3, to investigate whether the mean
values also associate with risk of our study end points.

Four sensitivity analyses were conducted. First, we further ad-
justed for SBP and DBP variability from baseline to year 3 in the
outcome models to explore the existence of indication bias
(e.g., hemodynamic disturbance caused by progression of
morbidities or declined physiologic reserve). Second, we fur-
ther adjusted for BMI change from baseline to year 3 to explore
whether the association between lipid variability and dementia
risk is a result of reverse causality. Early-stage dementia com-
monly leads to unintentional weight loss due to changes in
dietary habits that could potentially inﬂuence lipid levels. Third,
we further adjusted for APOE e4 carrier status in the model
(data available in 83% of participants), the strongest genetic risk
factor of Alzheimer disease (AD), to examine the robustness of
ﬁndings from our main analysis. Last, we repeated the outcome
analyses excluding 35 participants who developed stroke before
year 3 because this group was at a higher risk of dementia.

All analyses were performed using Stata/SE version 17.0
(StataCorp., College Station, TX) and were 2-sided. p Values
less than 0.05 were considered statistically signiﬁcant for main
analyses of associations with dementia and CIND. An ad-
justment for multiple comparisons was made for the cogni-
tion analysis and subgroup analyses to reduce type I error in
which case a p value less than 0.01 (0.05/5) and 0.003 (0.05/
15) was considered statistically signiﬁcant, respectively.

Results
Baseline Characteristics
Of the 19,114 ASPREE participants, we excluded 2,630 who
started/ceased lipid-lowering medications, 3,402 who stopped

follow-up before year 3, and 3,236 with missing data on lipids.
The remaining 9,846 participants were included in the ana-
lytic cohort (median [IQR] age: 73.9 [71.7–77.3] years,
54.9% female). Participant selection ﬂowchart is presented in
eFigure 2. Table 1 presents the baseline characteristics of the
entire cohort and subgroups based on TC variability. Partic-
ipants in the lower TC variability quartiles were more likely to
have a higher education level, lower baseline TC and tri-
glyceride levels, and fewer diabetes and frailty and less likely
to use lipid-lowering medications. Baseline characteristics
including lipids and cognition were comparable between the
included participants and those who were excluded because of
missing data on lipids (eTable 1).

The cumulative annual absolute change in each lipid metric
and the absolute change between the ﬁrst and last measure-
ments are presented in eTable 2. In the highest quartile, the
total absolute change in TC, LDL-c, HDL-c, and triglycerides
was 2.36, 2.07, 0.81, and 1.46 mmol/L, respectively, and the
absolute change between the ﬁrst and last measurement was
1.02, 0.92, 0.35, and 0.57 mmol/L, respectively.

Risk of Incident Dementia
For dementia analysis, 140 participants who had diagnosed
dementia, ended follow-up, or died before year 3 were further
excluded. After year 3, 509 participants (5%) developed in-
cident dementia during a median (IQR) follow-up of 5.8
(4.5–7.1) years.

Participants in the higher quartile of TC variability had a higher
incidence rate of dementia (Q4 vs Q1: 11.3 vs 7.1 cases per
1,000 person-years). Compared with the lowest quartile of TC
variability, the risk of dementia in the Q2, Q3, and Q4 was
increased by 37%, 44%, and 60%, respectively (p for linear
trend = 0.001). Similar to TC variability, there was a stepwise
increase in dementia risk with higher quartiles of LDL-c vari-
ability, with hazard ratios (HRs) of 1.17, 1.26, and 1.48 for the
Q2, Q3, and Q4, respectively (p for linear trend = 0.002)
(Table 2). The cumulative incidence curves by the quartiles of
TC and LDL-c variability are presented in Figure 1.

Every 1-SD increase in TC and LDL-c variability was asso-
ciated with a 13% and 12% increased risk of dementia, re-
spectively (p = 0.002 and p = 0.004). Restricted cubic splines
revealed a consistently positive relationship between TC and
LDL-c variability and dementia risk but no evident association
for HDL-c and triglycerides (Figure 2).

When further stratifying the variability groups by the overall
trend of lipid ﬂuctuation (descending/ascending trends) and
by baseline values (low/medium/high), the results showed that
higher TC or LDL-c variability was associated with a greater
risk of dementia, regardless of the trend and the baseline values.
The risk of dementia seemed to be highest in participants with
high TC/LDL-c variability with an ascending trend and a high
baseline value over time (Figures 3 and 4). No signiﬁcant
modiﬁcation by covariates was found (eTable 3).

Figure 1 Cumulative Incidence Curves for Incident Dementia by the Quartiles of Total Cholesterol and LDL Cholesterol

(A and B) The cumulative incidence rate of dementia event
occurring after the variability measurement period (from
year 3) by quartile groups of total cholesterol and LDL cho-
lesterol variability. Participants in the higher quartile groups
(greater variability) had a higher rate of incident dementia
events over a maximum of 8-year follow-up. LDL = low-
density lipoprotein.

No signiﬁcant association with incident dementia was ob-
served for HDL-c and triglycerides (Table 2, Figures 1 and 2).

Risk of Incident CIND
After excluding 2,794 who developed CIND, ended follow-
up, or died before year 3 or had a baseline cognitive score
lower than 1.5 SD compared with the overall population, 7,052
were included in the CIND analysis. 1,760 incident CIND
cases (25%) were identiﬁed from year 3 during a median (IQR)
follow-up of 5.4 (4.1–6.5) years. Participants in the highest
quartile of TC and LDL-c variability had the greatest risk of
CIND, with HRs of 1.23 (95% CI 1.08–1.41) and 1.27
(1.11–1.46) when compared with the lowest quartile. Higher
quartiles of triglyceride variability were also associated with
a greater risk of CIND. Per 1-SD increase in the variability of

TC, LDL-c, and triglycerides was associated with a respective
7%, 7%, and 8% increased risk of CIND. There was no asso-
ciation between HDL-c variability and CIND (Table 2).

Cognitive Change Over Time
Table 3 lists the results of the association between lipid vari-
ability and change in each cognitive domain and their composite
over time with a maximum follow-up of 11 years (mean mea-
surement times: 5–7 times across domains). Compared with the
lowest quartile, higher quartiles of TC and LDL-c variability
were associated with a more rapid decline in global cognition,
episodic memory, and psychomotor speed as well as the com-
posite cognition (p < 0.001), but not in language and executive
function. No signiﬁcant association with cognitive change was
found for HDL-c variability or triglyceride variability, except for

that our ﬁnding is aﬀected by indication bias or reverse causality
(eTables 8 and 9). Adjusting for APOE e4 carrier status and
excluding participants with the stroke events before year 3 also
yielded similar results as our main analysis (eTables 10 and 11).

Ancillary Analysis
Analysis limiting to participants who initiated or ceased their
lipid-lowering medications found no signiﬁcant association
between lipid variability, dementia, CIND, and cognitive
change over time, suggesting a diﬀerentiated role between
natural and artiﬁcial ﬂuctuation of TC and LDL-c in neuro-
cognition and dementia risk (eTables 4 and 5). The variability
in TC and LDL-c in participants who switched lipid-lowering
medication was almost doubled than in the included partic-
ipants (Table 2). The mean value of lipids from baseline
through year 3 was not associated with risk of any outcome,
except for the association of mean TC and HDL-c with change
in the composite cognitive score over time (eTables 6 and 7).

Sensitivity Analysis
Repeating the analysis by further adjusting for SBP and DBP
variability or BMI change from baseline through year 3 yielded
results similar to the main analysis, suggesting a low probability

Discussion
In this post hoc analysis of 9,846 initially healthy older adults
free of dementia and major cognitive impairment, higher TC
and LDL-c variability was associated with a greater risk of
dementia (median follow-up: 5.8 years), CIND (median
follow-up: 5.4 years), and faster cognitive decline over time
(mean measurement times: 5–7 times across domains). The
associations were independent of the overall trend of cho-
lesterol ﬂuctuation and baseline levels and were not modiﬁed
by study covariates. No signiﬁcant association was found
between variability in HDL-c and triglycerides, dementia, and
cognitive change over time. However, higher triglyceride
variability seemed to be associated with increased risk of
CIND. No association with any outcome was found for
possibly drug-induced variations in lipids and the mean value
of lipids during the variability measurement period. Our study
suggests that cholesterol variability may represent a novel

biomarker or risk factor for identifying older individuals at risk
of dementia, outperforming the actual lipid values.

Previous studies mainly focused on the relationship between
visit-to-visit (time intervals varied between visits ranging from
several months to years) cholesterol variability and risk of
major adverse cardiovascular events and death.35-37 Only
a handful of studies have investigated the relationship be-
tween lipid variability and neurocognitive outcomes.12-17
None of them has distinguished the change in lipids with and
without drug-induced alternation, which are expected to have
a distinct role in dementia risk. Other limitations of historical
studies include a short follow-up, inclusion of younger adults,
using 3 measurements to construct variability index, small
sample sizes, lack of administrating cognitive assessments, and
ascertainment of dementia outcomes.

By analyzing data from 4,428 dementia-free participants older
than 70 years with high CVD risk, a post hoc analysis of the
PROSPER trial (PROspective Study of Pravastatin in the
Elderly at Risk) reported that higher visit-to-visit variability in
LDL-c was associated with worsened attention, processing
speed, and memory over a 2.5-year follow-up, independent of
mean LDL-c levels and use of statins.13 Its subcohort analysis
on 535 participants with brain MRI data found that higher
LDL-c variability was associated with a slower cerebral blood
ﬂow and greater white matter hyperintensity volume. More
recently, a cohort study including 11,571 individuals aged
60 years or older who were free of AD and AD-related de-
mentia (ADRD) found that the highest quintile of variability
for TC and triglycerides was associated with the greatest risk
of incident AD/ADRD over 10 years.12 However, this study
used linkage data and International Classiﬁcation of Diseases

The mean (SD, range) of low, medium, and high baseline values for total cholesterol was 4.3 (0.5, 2.2–4.8), 5.2 (0.2, 4.9–5.6), and 6.3 (0.6, 5.7–10.3) mmol/L; for
LDL cholesterol was 2.2 (0.4, 0.6–2.7), 3.1 (0.2, 2.8–3.4), and 4.0 (0.5, 3.5–7.5) mmol/L; for HDL cholesterol was 1.2 (0.2, 0.1–1.4), 1.6 (0.1, 1.5–1.7), and 2.1 (0.3,

codes to ascertain dementia cases, which may lead to under-
diagnosis. The time interval between each lipid measurement
is not ﬁxed (could vary from days to years) that might in-
ﬂuence the results. Because AD/ADRD progresses along
a continuum from subclinical disease to mild cognitive im-
pairment to clinically manifested AD, our results support this
study and extend the ﬁndings to include an association be-
tween lipid variability and cognitive changes that may precede
the development of dementia.

The mechanisms underlying the association between cho-
lesterol variability and dementia are uncertain. Several hy-
potheses are proposed. One proposed hypothesis is that
ﬂuctuations in cholesterol levels might be an epiphenome-
non accompanying chronic diseases linking to an increased
risk of dementia, potentially due to disrupted homeostasis.37
This hypothesis was supported by our subgroup analysis
observing the stronger association between TC variability
and incident dementia in prefrail/frail participants. Variation

in cholesterol levels may serve as a surrogate of body’s in-
ability to maintain homeostasis with advancing age and in-
creasing disease burden and, hence, a higher
risk of
dementia. Adjusting for blood pressure variability and BMI
change did not alter our results, suggesting that the choles-
terol variability is less likely caused by changes in dietary
patterns and hemodynamic disturbance, but other factors
such as neuropathologic factors, genetic factors, and physical
disability might be at play.

Another possibility is that the association of lipid vari-
ability with dementia was moderated by frailty (although
not statistically signiﬁcant), rather than lipid variability
being directly inﬂuenced or accompanied by it. Previous
studies have found that individuals living with frailty and
prefrailty had an increased risk of dementia,38 which means
that they are also more likely to be inﬂuenced by choles-
terol ﬂuctuation on dementia risk. A stronger association
between TC variability and dementia risk was also seen in
those with family history and who are APOE e4 carriers,
the subgroup of participants who are more susceptible to
dementia.

Furthermore, our analysis revealed no signiﬁcant association
between mean cholesterol values during the variability mea-
surement period and any of our study end points, which is in
line with many previous studies investigating cholesterol
measured in late life and dementia risk.6,7,39 This ﬁnding
suggests that the instability of cholesterol performs better
than actual values in providing insights into individuals’ risk of
levels
dementia development. Fluctuations in cholesterol
have been suggested to induce damage on brain vasculature
by destabilizing atherosclerotic plaques (primarily composed
of LDL-c), altering their composition, and increasing the
likelihood of rupture and growth. Consequently, this process
could lead to the narrowing or obstruction of cerebral blood
vessels.12,35,40 Epidemiologic evidence supporting this hy-
pothesis comes from studies demonstrating reduced cerebral
blood ﬂow in individuals with high LDL-c variability13 and
a signiﬁcant association between high LDL-c variability and
accelerated coronary atheroma progression in patients with
atherosclerotic CVD undergoing serial intravascular ultraso-
nography.41 These ﬁndings might also explain the lack of
association between HDL-c and triglyceride variability and
dementia. Moreover, cholesterol variation might contribute
to cognitive impairment by inducing vascular endothelial
dysfunction and a proinﬂammatory and high oxidative stress
milieu that are implicated in the pathologic process of de-
mentia development.42-44

Routine screening of lipids in older adults is common in most
high-income countries such as Australia and the United States,
with the data easily accessible through the electronic medical
record system. The feasibility of calculating lipid variability
using electronic health records to predict adverse events has
been demonstrated.45 Monitoring cholesterol change over
to identify
time of older people can help clinicians

asymptomatic at-risk individuals who are likely to beneﬁt
from the early detection and treatment. Because the causes
of cholesterol variability can vary and coexist, it is crucial for
clinicians to discern any pathologic factors that contribute to
this variation. Our stratiﬁed analysis by cholesterol ﬂuctua-
tion and baseline levels, despite reduced statistical power,
revealed a dose-dependent relationship between higher
cholesterol variability and increased dementia risk, regard-
less of the trend or baseline values. Individuals with an as-
cending cholesterol trend and high baseline levels exhibited
the highest risk, suggesting that those with suboptimal
cholesterol control over time may beneﬁt most from inter-
ventions. Such interventions could include lifestyle change
and persistent statin use to prevent further cholesterol ele-
vation and potentially reduce dementia risk.

Like variability in other biomarkers, a major limitation of
cholesterol variability is its nonstandardized assessment
methods. It remains unclear which variability index, mea-
surement frequency, and thresholds would provide best pre-
dictability. This might not matter if lipid variability was used as
a harbinger of impending adverse neurocognitive outcomes,
particularly in high-risk dementia groups, rather than for risk
prediction. Future studies may also need to ascertain whether
reducing cholesterol variation could translate into neuro-
cognitive beneﬁts.

This study has several limitations. First, although we in-
tentionally excluded participants who initiated or dis-
continued lipid-lowering agents during the measurement
period of lipid variability, it is possible that the variation was
caused by nonadherence to lipid-lowering medication or
change in dosage.46 However, because all participants who
reported statin use at baseline were likely prevalent users
rather than new users, we would expect that dose changes
and nonadherence would be less likely to explain lipid var-
iability. Furthermore, owing to our exclusive focus on lipid
variability independent of medication eﬀects, our ﬁndings
are not applicable to individuals who discontinue or initiate
statin therapy for whatever reason. Second, clinical trials
such as ASPREE are likely to enroll healthier participants
compared with the general population regarding burden of
frailty, morbidity, and polypharmacy. Whether our study
ﬁndings are generalizable to broad, unselected groups of
older population is unknown. The reasons for lipid ﬂuctu-
ation can vary and coexist, and some may not necessarily
contribute to dementia risk. It is also unknown whether the
predictive value of lipid variability changes when the un-
derlying reasons diﬀer. Third, the study did not adjust for
dietary patterns, physical activity, and other potential con-
founders that may inﬂuence lipid variability and dementia
risk. In addition, subgroup analyses and some analyses by
lipid quartile may have reduced study power and wide CIs, in
which they were unable to rule out clinically meaningful
HRs. Last, there remains the potential for reverse causation.
However, we have adopted robust analytical approaches to
minimize this.

Despite these limitations, our study has several strengths.
First, to enhance data accuracy, our study used lipid data from
4 time points to better identify trends and patterns of lipid
ﬂuctuations over time while minimizing the impact of ran-
dom and diurnal variations. Our study investigating year-to-
year variability of diﬀerent lipid metrics over a ﬁxed period
of 3 years has made study participants more comparable
between each other. This study also beneﬁted from the
utilization of high-quality prospective data derived from a
large-scale, contemporary randomized trial and its post-trial
follow-up phase. The data collection process was executed
rigorously and systematically, encompassing fasting lipid
levels and other covariates. A lack of dementia history signed
oﬀ by participants’ GP or primary care physician and ad-
ministering 3MS Examination to every participant at en-
rollment excluded individuals with possible dementia at
baseline, hence minimizing the possibility of reverse cau-
and
sality. Serial neurocognitive
throughout the follow-up period was protocol-driven, and
the dementia outcomes were meticulously adjudicated by
expert panels.

testing at baseline

Greater variability in TC and LDL-c was associated with
higher risk of dementia, CIND, and faster cognitive decline in
community-dwelling older adults,
independent of average
mean lipid levels. Further large, well-designed, prospective
cohort studies in older adults are needed to verify our results
and explore whether lipid variability identiﬁes a high-risk
group or directly contributes to cognition and dementia risk
in this age group.
