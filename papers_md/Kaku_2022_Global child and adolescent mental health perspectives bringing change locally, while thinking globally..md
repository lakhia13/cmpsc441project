Abstract
Child and adolescent mental health (CAMH) are a global priority. Different countries across the globe face 
unique challenges in CAMH services that are specific to them. However, there are multiple issues that are also 
similar across countries. These issues have been presented in this commentary from the lens of early career 
CAMH professionals who are alumni of the Donald J Cohen Fellowship program of the IACAPAP. We also present 
recommendations that can be implemented locally, namely, how promoting mental health and development of 
children and adolescents can result in better awareness and interventions, the need to improve quality of care and 
access to care, use of technology to advance research and practices in CAMH, and how investing in research can 
secure and support CAMH professionals and benefit children and adolescents across the globe. As we continue 
to navigate significant uncertainty due to dynamic circumstances globally, bolstering collaborations by “bringing 
change locally, while thinking globally” are invaluable to advancing global CAMH research, clinical service provision, 
and advancement of the field.

Introduction
Child and adolescent mental health (CAMH) is a global 
priority.  The  World  Health  Organisation  (WHO)  sup-
ports “development and implementation of multisectoral, 
evidence-informed  and  human-rights-based  strategies 
for  the  promotion  of  mental  health,  prevention  of  men-
tal  health  conditions  and  provision  of  mental  health 
care  for  children,  adolescents  and  their  families”  [1]. 
Every  endeavor  towards  improving  CAMH  services  and 
research  should  be  country-specific  but  should  contain 
the  best  evidence  from  across  the  globe  [2].  There  is  a 
drive  towards  improving  global  health  and  a  slight  but 
not enough momentum in the areas of CAMH and allied 
specialties [3, 4].

The  International  Association  for  Child  and  Adoles-
cent Psychiatry and Allied Professions (IACAPAP) which 
brings  together,  professionals  working  across  the  globe 
in  areas  of  CAMH,  states  its  mission  as  –  “to  advocate 
for the promotion of the mental health and development 
of children and adolescents through policy, practice, and 
research”  [5].  The  IACAPAP  has  mentoring  programs 
such  as  the  Donald  J.  Cohen  Fellowship  Program  for 
International  Scholars  in  Child  and  Adolescent  Mental 
Health  and  Helmut  Remschmidt  Research  Seminars  for 
young professionals in CAMH. These awards help foster 
the  professional  development  of  emerging  leaders  and 
inspire  young  CAMH  colleagues  to  engage  in  CAMH 
research, respectively [5].
Aims and methods:
We, CAMH professionals who were participants of the 
Donald  J  Cohen  Fellowship  Program  (DJCFP)  at  vari-
ous times in the last decade (Range: 2010–2020, Median: 
2014), contributed to this manuscript. Authors are from 
the backgrounds of adult psychiatry, child and adolescent 
psychiatry,  public  health,  clinical  psychology,  neurosci-
ences,  prevention  and  implementation  science  and  sev-
eral  have  multi-country  work  experiences.  The  DJCFP 
program  helped  bolster  discussions  about  the  global 
nature  of  CAMH  and  made  an  impact  on  all  of  us. The 
enriching  experience  got  us  thinking  about  similari-
ties  and  differences  in  CAMH  scenarios  in  our  respec-
tive countries and brought insights on how we can bring 
about  change  at  the  local  stage  while  thinking  globally. 
This paper aims to contribute further to these discussions 
by  presenting  CAMH  perspectives  from  11  countries 
(Bangladesh, Chile, France, India, Italy, Nigeria, Panama, 
Singapore, South Africa, Sri Lanka, and Taiwan), review-
ing how they can influence global CAMH and presenting 
the way forward. These are the home countries of authors 
where they studied and trained in CAMH. Though we are 
presenting  perspectives  from  countries  that  are  diverse, 
we  believe  that  this  weakness  is  overcome  by  the  ideas 
we  present  for  all  countries  to  engage  with  one  another 
and set up collaborative care and research. The content of 

this commentary was derived from write-ups from each 
author’s  perspective,  to  answer  common  questions  such 
as prevalence, awareness, resources, clinical services and 
research,  barriers  to  implementations,  manpower  train-
ing,  policy  initiatives,  and  experiences  as  early-career 
professionals.  These  write-ups  were  collated  to  identify 
common issues, key take aways, potential recommenda-
tions and the way forward in CAMH.

Current CAMH scenarios across 11 countries
African countries

  • Nigeria

In Nigeria, over the last few years, there has been mini-
mal  but  increased  awareness  on  CAMH  issues. There  is 
an enormous shortage of CAMH practitioners [6] made 
worse  by  highly  skilled  professionals  leaving  the  coun-
try. Though more has been done to improve services for 
CAMH, the country still needs to do more in organizing 
services for CAMH. There is a need for national surveys 
on the burden of child mental health problems to encour-
age  advocacy  and  increase  funding  for  CAMH  service 
provision.

  • South Africa

Data  on  the  prevalence  of  CAMH  problems  in  South 
Africa  is  limited,  but  findings  from  an  epidemiological 
study  from  one  of  the  nine  provinces  found  the  overall 
prevalence to be at 17%, with the most common problem 
being  generalized  anxiety  disorder  in  adolescence  [7]. 
Considering that almost 40% of the country’s population 
is under 18 years of age, this figure translates into a sig-
nificant public health burden.

European countries

  • France

In  France,  epidemiological  data  in  CAMH  are  scarce. 
Data from INSERM (national institute of medical health 
research)  indicates  that  one  in  eight  have  mental  health 
disorders,  5%  of  children  under  12  suffer  from  anxiety 
disorders,  1–2%  attention  deficit  hyperactivity  disorders 
(ADHD),  and  0.5%  depression.  In  adolescence,  mood 
disorders affect 3% of 13–19-year-old [8]. Mental health 
issues  are  better  addressed  through  earlier  and  more 
accurate diagnosis and increased recognition. There is, in 
fact, better awareness in the French population regarding 
the  mental  health  needs  of  children  and  a  greater  soci-
etal demand with more and more families seeking profes-
sional help on various topics, including ADHD, learning 
disorders,  Autism  Spectrum  Disorder  (ASD),  school 
refusal, bullying, and eating disorders.

  •

Italy

The prevalence of child and adolescent mental disorders 
in Italy is estimated at around 8% (presence of at least 1 
Diagnostic  Statistical  Manual  diagnosis,  10–14  years) 
[9].  This  is  comparable  with  other  European  regions, 

Kaku et al. Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and Mental Health           (2022) 16:82 Page 3 of 8

although  lower  for  specific  conditions  (e.g.,  Italy  has  a 
low suicidal behavior rate). CAMH services are however 
responsible  for  the  assessment,  and  treatment  of  both 
psychiatric and neurological conditions.

Asian countries

  • Singapore

In  Singapore,  there  is  no  prevalence  study  on  the  esti-
mates  of  CAMH  disorders,  although  studies  on  adults 
and  the  elderly  suggest  childhood-onset  of  several  con-
ditions  [10].  One  community-based  study  examining 
mental health issues in school-going children between 6 
and 12 years old reported a comparable prevalence figure 
of  12.5%,  with  more  internalizing  problems  than  exter-
nalizing  problems  being  reported  by  parents[11].  Eco-
nomically, ASD is on the top in terms of disease burden 
followed by ADHD and depressive disorders for children 
under  the  age  of  14  [12].  An  area  of  increasing  concern 
pertains  to  the  use  of  the  internet  and  social  media 
among  adolescents.  A  study  estimated  the  prevalence 
of  pathological  gaming  to  be  8.7%  [13],  but  this  figure 
is  merely  the  tip  of  an  iceberg  given  that  the  impact  of 
technology use is not fully understood currently, but one 
would postulate an increased risk for the development of 
mental and physical health concerns.

  • Taiwan

The  Prevalence  rate  of  psychiatric  disorders  in  children 
and adolescents in Taiwan ranges from 14.8 to 22.7%. For 
example, the prevalence rate of ADHD is around 7.5% in 
Taiwan [14].

  • Bangladesh

The prevalence of mental disorders in Bangladesh is 13.4 
to 22.9% among children and adolescents [15, 16]. Gov-
ernment expenses 0.5% of the total health budget in men-
tal  health.  There  are  ongoing  efforts  to  expand  training 
and research in CAMH.

  •

India

Though  quite  variable  in  many  studies,  a  systematic 
review reported the prevalence rate of child and adoles-
cent psychiatric disorders in the community to be 6.46% 
[17]. Efforts such as setting up child guidance clinics and 
setting  up  specialized  fellowship  training  did  help  to 
improve the infrastructure and expertise. However, only 
0.06%  of  the  total  national  health  budget  is  allocated  to 
mental  health  and  a  small  portion  of  this  tiny  budget  is 
given for CAMH services. Such low budgetary allocation 
that  is  lower  than  most  low-  and  middle-income  coun-
tries (LMIC) has resulted in specialized care being diffi-
cult to access and limited. It is estimated that < 1% of the 
children and adolescents suffering from mental disorders 
receive treatment [18].

  • Sri Lanka

Sri Lanka has an established network for maternal and child 
health services governed by a national policy [19]. However, 

the  development  of  child  psychiatric  services  lags  with 
limited  research  in  this  population.  A  nationwide  survey 
estimated that 18.9% of children aged 13–19 years have sig-
nificant emotional and behavioral issues and another study 
estimated the prevalence of ASD to be 1:93 [20, 21]. Evolv-
ing  socio-cultural  changes  have  impacted  family  systems, 
education, values, and mental health needs.

South american countries

  • Chile

In  Chile,  the  general  prevalence  of  mental  disorders  in 
children  and  adolescents  is  22.5%,  higher  in  females 
(25.8% compared to 19.3% in males), and in children aged 
4–11 years (27.8%) compared to adolescents (16.5%)[22]. 
Compared  to  other  international  epidemiological  stud-
ies these numbers show that mental disorders in children 
and adolescents, alcohol and drug abuse and suicide rates 
in  adolescents  have  a  higher  prevalence  in  Chile  com-
pared  to  the  rest  of  the  world.  These  epidemiological 
findings reflect the inequalities that are present in Chile, 
the  most  unequal  country  among  the  Organization  for 
Economic Cooperation and Development group [23].

  • Panama

Research  on  CAMH  in  Panama  is  scarce.  A  study  con-
ducted  in  2009  suggested  that  the  most  prevalent  dis-
orders  in  primary  school  children  (6–12  years  old)  are 
learning  difficulties  (20.6%)  and  anxiety  (15.3%).  The 
prevalence  of  depression  is  5.3%.  This  same  study  sug-
gested  that  only  one  in  ten  children  with  a  disorder  has 
had  contact  with  mental  health  services.  Low  access  to 
mental health services has to do with a lack of investment 
and trained professionals in public services to cope with 
the demand of cases. Only 3% of the Ministry of Health’s 
total budget is directed towards mental health [24]. There 
are 3.47 psychiatrists per 100,000 inhabitants and only 2 
outpatient  facilities  for  children  and  adolescents  in  the 
whole  country,  considering  that  33%  of  users  are  chil-
dren.  Given  the  high  rate  of  disorders,  preventive  pro-
grams are becoming more popular.

Common issues across the globe
Armed conflicts and social unrest:

Many  children  in  low-  and  high-income  countries  with 
ongoing armed conflicts and social unrest are frequently 
exposed  to  poor  physical,  mental,  and  social  conditions 
that  impact  their  emotional  development.  It  exposes 
them to violence, lack of education, illnesses, torture and 
sexual  violence,  displacement,  social  isolation,  discrimi-
nation,  and  many  times  poor  long-term  prognosis  due 
to  anxiety,  depression,  post-traumatic  stress  disorder 
(PTSD), and substance abuse. Striking examples include 
incidents in Nigeria (the Chibok girls), France, India (ter-
rorism) and war (Sri Lanka, India and even the ongoing 
Russian-Ukraine war) in many parts of the world.

Kaku et al. Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and Mental Health           (2022) 16:82 Page 4 of 8

CAMHS are responsible for the care of patients up to 
17  years,  and  once  18  years  old,  patients  are  referred  to 
adult  services.  Literature  suggests  that  around  one  in 
five adolescents in contact with CAMHS moved to adult 
services,  pointing  out  gaps  in  the  continuity  of  care  for 
youths across local services [41].

Most countries do have a national association or soci-
ety for child and adolescent mental health that are mem-
bers  of  the  IACAPAP  and  have  been  trying  to  build  a 
platform for child mental health professionals.

Funding and research for early career professionals

Difficulties specifically encountered by early-career CAMH 
professionals  include  limited  funding  and  inequalities  in 
research  opportunities  [42–45].  As  many  governments  do 
not prioritize child mental health research or have allocated 
budget in their ‘areas of interest’, research in CAMH is pre-
dominantly restricted to popular university hospitals, expe-
rienced and well-established researchers, and their students. 
When  professionals  transition  to  become  independent 
researchers outside of these settings, the opportunities are 
almost nil, thus encouraging the vicious cycle of brain drain 
to the global North. Most non-university departments, child 
guidance  clinics,  and  non-governmental  organizations  do 
not have either resources or means to do research. 

Work-life integration and well-being

Work-life integration is a challenge for early career pro-
fessionals  in  most  countries.  Early  career  CAMH  pro-
fessionals,  like  all  other  specialties,  typically  are  settling 
down with their families and often have young children. 
The heavy workload due to lack of specialized resources, 
poor  work  schedules,  limited  leaves,  lack  of  funds  and 
facilities  for  childcare  and  self-care  add  to  the  burden 
[46–48].  Lack  of  mentors  to  support,  and  facilities  that 
address  these  challenges  also  add  to  the  poor  mental 
health of early career professionals [49].

Way forward

Based on our experiences as professionals working 
in  CAMH,  we  offer  recommendations  that  are  an 
offshoot  of  the  global  challenges  discussed  above. 
Bolstering  local  initiatives,  improvising  strategies 
to  address  CAMH,  and  supporting  professionals 
at  the  grassroot  level,  can  empower  and  improve 
services and research. We discuss these in four sec-
tions  that  over  arch  the  common  issues  across  the 
globe,  while  understanding  the  need  to  have  com-
mon solutions to work at our home countries.

Poverty and social inequalities

The focus of child healthcare in most LMIC countries has 
been  on  the  childhood  ‘killer’  diseases  such  as  diarrhoea, 
acute  respiratory  infections,  and  malaria  almost  excluding 
the  mental  aspect  of  child  health  [2].  Specific  risk  factors 
include  widespread  family  poverty  and  social  inequalities 
(based on caste, color, ethnicity, and religion).

Studies  have  shown  links  between  family  poverty  and 
the risk of child neglect [3, 4]. Poverty often leads to mal-
nutrition,  deprivation  of  neighborhood  and  educational 
opportunities, and poor parental mental health. Millions 
of  children  and  adolescents  are  still  growing  up  in  cir-
cumstances of significant adversity. Many are exposed to 
substance abuse and violence as well as HIV infection and 
risk for orphanhood – all of which increase vulnerability 
to mental health problems (like in South Africa) [25]. For 
example,  children  orphaned  by  AIDS  have  higher  lev-
els of depression, anxiety, and PTSD when compared to 
other orphaned and non-orphaned children [26].

Many  high-income  countries  are  fighting  societal 
inequalities  that  impact  childhood  development,  social 
bonding,  sense  of  autonomy,  independence,  self-esteem, 
and  self-confidence  [27,  28].  Racism,  religion,  and  caste 
system-based  factors  impact  access  to  health  services, 
educational  and  economic  opportunities  [29,  30].  They 
also  impact  brain  development  and  result  in  poor  psy-
chological development due to chronic stress [28, 31].

Child guidelines and policies

Though  national  policies  are  in  place  in  many  coun-
tries,  the  implementation  of  the  national  plans  are  hin-
dered  by  the  unavailability  of  provincial-level  resources 
or policies [10, 25, 32–35]. Most countries still focus on 
maternal  care,  immunization,  nutritional  support,  and 
early  education.  In  the  majority  of  cases,  there  is  a  lack 
of  ‘political  will’  since  the  focus  is  mainly  on  mortality 
data from maternal and child health. There is also a lack 
of  resources  to  formulate,  motivate  or  co-ordinate  the 
implementation  of  child  mental  health  programs  [7,  36, 
37].  In  those  countries  where  they  do  exist,  these  pro-
grams have a plethora of roadblocks at the levels of pre-
vention services, budget allocation and other priorities in 
childcare service pathways.

Clinical services

The  health  system  of  most  countries  is  severely  con-
strained, with an estimated < 0.5 psychiatrists per 100,000 
population [2, 17, 38–40]. This translates into just a small 
fraction  of  children  and  adolescents  accessing  needed 
CAMH services, thus requiring transfer of skills and task 
sharing  between  professionals  and  community  health 
workers,  and  traditional  healers  [37].  The  territorial 
distribution  of  CAMH  professionals  is  also  marked  by 
strong disparities in many countries.

Promoting mental health and development of children and 
adolescents

More and more countries are turning into “Social Invest-
ment Welfare States” aiming to invest in the potential of 
children today to ensure the welfare state tomorrow. This 
requires  the  implementation  of  comprehensive  national 
policies  to  promote  the  mental  health  and  development 
of  children  and  adolescents  [16,  33,  34,  50–52].  These 
policies adopt a holistic view combining children’s social 
protection and CAMH.

Yet, some CAMH professionals reported spontaneously 
that in their country, mental health promotion programs 
rely  mostly  on  local  initiatives  despite  national  mental 
health  guidelines  or  policies.  E.g.,  India’s  recent  Mental 
Healthcare  Act  2017  recognizing  the  special  needs  of 
young  people  [50]  period  In  Bangladesh,  national  men-
tal health policy included school mental health programs 
that  recommended  the  inclusion  of  mental  health  cur-
riculum in science text books [53].

Fighting stigma through literacy

Improving  literacy  levels  of  the  population  is  a  global 
challenge  to  fight  the  stigma  around  mental  illness  and 
solve  the  problem  of  underutilization  of  mental  health 
services  [54].  Five  CAMH  professionals  reported  that 
in  their  country  the  information  on  childhood  psychiat-
ric  disorders  such  as  Intellectual  Disability,  ADHD,  and 
ASD  are  still  limited  to  the  general  public  which  results 
in  stigma,  hence  more  effort  needs  to  be  spent  on  psy-
choeducation programs [55–59].

adolescence  and  adulthood  [60–64].  This  particularly 
highlights factors influencing CAMH that are global and 
emphasizes that it should be approached as such.

Improving access to quality care

Lack  of  access  to  specialized  CAMH  care  or  important 
delay  due  to  the  shortage  of  CAMH  professionals  is  a 
shared  concern  across  the  globe.  More  funding,  more 
training,  more  valorisation,  and  more  resources  are 
needed  to  improve  both  access  and  quality  of  CAMH 
care.

While many countries have ongoing training programs, 
some countries have developed specific programs focus-
ing on training professionals so to increase manpower in 
CAMH services. Example:

  •

  •

In Nigeria, the inception of the Centre for Child 
and Adolescent Mental Health at the University 
of Ibadan - with funding from the John D. and 
Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation has led to 
increased manpower training [6, 65].
In Singapore, even if the number of child 
psychiatrists remained small, the number of 
allied services has flourished exponentially (both 
specialized services -e.g., Neuro-Behavioural Clinic 
for neurodevelopmental disorders- and community 
teams) [39].

  • A revalorization of the Child and Adolescent 

Psychiatry specialty appear to be also necessary, 
especially among countries with an aging population 
[14].

Community-level interventions

Accurate and adequate clinical practice

Many countries are investing in early childhood interven-
tions  such  as  parenting  or  psychoeducation  programs 
and community-level (very often school-based) interven-
tions  in  their  country.  Indeed,  school-based  interven-
tions are less stigmatizing and are effective in promoting 
mental  health,  including  in  LMIC  settings  [36,  53].  It  is 
also  important  to  reinforce  collaborative  care  between 
CAMH  professionals  and  health  specialists  or  physi-
cians in the community while upscaling skill sets of allied 
health  professionals,  community  nurses  and  educators 
to  screen,  identify  and  manage  CAMH  disorders.  This 
would  help  address  the  shortage  of  professionals  and 
constitute  to  a  stepped-care  model  which  is  currently 
being adopted by many countries.

Targeting non-mainstream problems

When discussing CAMH, as part of the holistic approach, 
interventions and research in relevant areas such as child 
abuse,  maltreatment,  the  mental  health  of  orphan  and 
street children, children in conflict with the law, have to 
be taken into consideration as these can have long-lasting 
mental and physical health benefits that extend into later 

Adopting a culturally sensitive approach and developing 
interventions  targeting  uncovered/  insufficiently  cov-
ered  issues  would  help  develop  and  improve  the  qual-
ity  of  CAMH  services  [66–68].For  instance,  in  France, 
the  recent  terrorist  attacks  raised  many  concerns  about 
post-traumatic stress disorder and led to the creation of 
the  CN2R  (Centre  national  de  resource  et  resilience)  to 
deepen  and  improve  knowledge  about  PTSD  and  resil-
ience [69].

Expanding the use of technology

Embracing  innovation  and  advances  in  technology  to 
improve  prevention  and  mental  health  outcomes  can 
benefit children and adolescents globally. In many coun-
tries:, technology is increasingly being used in awareness 
campaigns,  screening  patient  consultations,  improving 
follow-up, training of professionals, and research [70, 71]. 
Technology can also be used to achieve population-level 
benefits and enhance efforts at task shifting, for instance 
using  digital  mental  healthcare  model  tool  to  deliver 
quality  psychiatric  care  by  non-specialists  in  remote 
areas [72].

Kaku et al. Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and Mental Health           (2022) 16:82 Many research laboratories all over the globe are incor-
porating new technologies in areas such as artificial intel-
ligence,  machine  learning,  and  robotics  into  child  and 
adolescent  psychiatric  care,  especially  neurodevelop-
mental disorders, thus facilitating early identification and 
early intervention [73, 74].

In  the  past  two  years  of  the  COVID-19  pandemic, 
CAMH services in many countries have been developing 
teleconsultations,  online  interventions  and  self-directed 
resources for children and their parents as well [75–79].

Investing in Research

Research  in  CAMH  is  gradually  increasing  worldwide, 
from interests in basic neuroscience, translational psychi-
atry, research in treatment approaches, etiology and clin-
ical trials. Many countries have state-funded and private 
centres  of  excellence  for  ASD  and  neurodevelopmen-
tal  disorders.  However,  lack  of  resources  and  research 
funding  remains  the  main  obstacle,  especially  for  LMIC 
countries  but  also  in  high-income  countries  like  Italy 
where there is a lack of time dedicated to doing research 
for  clinicians.  Early  career  CAMH  professionals  often 
do research as secondary activity aside from the clinical 
work and only a few envision a career in pure research.

There is a need for research to focus on establishing the 
efficacy  and  cost-effectiveness  of  care  and  services.  Last 
but  not  the  least,  the  role  of  patients  and  their  parents 
in  their  medical  management  radically  evolves.  More 
collaborative  practices,  that  consider  the  patient’s  per-
spective in this process, are progressively replacing pater-
nalistic medicine. Qualitative research is in line with this 
societal  evolution  and  is  booming  in  biomedical  clini-
cal  studies.  For  example,  in  France,  Anne  Revah-Levy’s 
research  group  has  developed  expertise  in  their  use  for 
exploring complex questions around the lived experience 
of mental disorders and their treatment among children 
and adolescents [80].

Conclusion
The  DJCFP  gave  us  a  platform  to  come  together,  main-
tain these network connections, and discuss and inspire 
each other in what we do, which we believe is a return on 
investment  of  the  fellowship  program  itself.  The  alumni 
have also been in leadership roles across various national 
and global organizations, organizing meetings in CAMH 
themes and even volunteering at the forefront of war and 
pandemics.

In  summary,  though  there  are  differences  in  treat-
ment  models,  prevalence  rates,  availability  of  resources, 
and cultural practices, we believe the challenges we face 
are  similar.  The  need  to  address  armed  conflicts,  social 
unrest,  social  inequalities,  pushing  for  child  mental 
health  guidelines  and  policies,  and  improving  the  qual-
ity  of  clinical  care  and  services  cannot  be  emphasized

enough.  Strategies  to  improve  research  funding,  with  a 
focus  on  early  career  CAMH  professionals,  opportuni-
ties  for  work-life  integration  along  with  appropriate  use 
of manpower and technology will go a long way. We con-
clude  by  highlighting  that  bringing  change  locally  while 
thinking globally will undoubtedly bolster CAMH.
