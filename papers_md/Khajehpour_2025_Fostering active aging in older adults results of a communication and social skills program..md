Abstract
Background  Active aging empowers older adults to maintain physical, social, and psychological well-being as 
they age, enabling them to participate in social activities according to their preferences and capabilities. However, 
many older adults face communication and social skills challenges, necessitating interventions to minimize social 
communication barriers and promote active aging. Despite the importance of communication and social skills in 
active aging, further studies are essential to explore older adults’ perspectives and develop strategies that support 
active aging and address potential barriers. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the effect of communication 
and social skills training on the active aging of older adults.

Methods  This quasi-experimental trial with randomized allocation study involved 80 older adults from two daycare 
centers in southeastern Iran in 2024. Participants were randomly assigned to either a control or an intervention group. 
The intervention group received an eight-session communication and social skills training program, conducted twice 
a week for two hours in groups of 20. Both groups completed the Iranian Active Aging Measurement Instrument 
before and one month after the intervention.

Results  The mean ages of participants in the intervention and control groups were 68.94 ± 7.27 and 67.13 ± 5.09 
years, respectively. Training in communication and social skills led to a significant increase in the total score of active 
aging (98.18 ± 17.77) and its dimensions (mindfulness, active insight, physical-functional dynamics, interactionism, 
role-playing, and social participation) during the post-test stage compared to the pre-test (148.97 ± 13.19), (t = -25.87, 
p < 0.001) and the control group (1.101 ± 8.18), (t = 1.35, p = 0.18).

Conclusion  This study contributes valuable evidence supporting psychosocial interventions for active aging. To 
advance this field, further research should focus on the long-term impact, cultural adaptability, and multimodal 
strategies that comprehensively address physical, cognitive, and social domains.

Introduction
The  global  population  of  older  adults  is  on  the  rise, 
attributable  to  increased  life  expectancy  and  decreased 
mortality  rates.  Data  indicates  that  in  2020,  there  were 
727  million  individuals  aged  65  and  older  worldwide,  a 
figure anticipated to exceed 1.5 billion by 2050 [1]. Con-
currently,  Iran  is  undergoing  significant  demographic 
transformations,  with  forecasts  suggesting  that  the  pro-
portion  of  the  older  population  will  reach  between  25% 
and  30%  by  the  year  2030  [2,  3].  By  2050,  individuals 
aged  65  and  older  are  projected  to  constitute  21.7%  of 
the Iranian population [4]. In response to this challenge, 
numerous  countries  have  endeavored  to  make  the  older 
adult period more active by mitigating the negative con-
sequences associated with demographic shifts [3]. Active 
aging  is recognized  as a crucial  element in  reducing the 
incidence  of  disability  and  morbidity  among  the  elderly 
population  [5].  The  World  Health  Organization  (WHO) 
defines active aging as the process of maximizing oppor-
tunities  for  the  health,  participation,  and  safety  of  older 
adults, thereby improving their overall quality of life [6]. 
The  goal  of  active  aging  is  to  empower  older  adults  to 
become  active  participants  in  their  healthcare.  There-
fore, comprehensive and precise planning is essential for 
enhancing active aging [7].

Aging  can  impair  communication  due  to  illness,  neu-
rological issues, or physical decline [8]. Beyond its social 
impact, aging also affects cognitive function, which influ-
ences  how  individuals  communicate  [9].  As  the  aging 
grows,  this  can  lead  to  consequences  such  as  physi-
cal  frailty,  loneliness,  isolation,  reduced  social  support, 
decreased  ability  to  perform  daily  activities,  and  dimin-
ished  communication  skills.  These  challenges  can  result 
in reduced active participation of older adults in society 
and  diminished  their  social  roles,  ultimately  disrupting 
social  development  and  overall  health  [10–13],  while 
imposing significant costs and financial burdens on older 
adults, their families, and the healthcare system [14].

Social  participation  in  various  aspects  of  life  such  as 
social, professional, and family interactions is crucial for 
active aging [15]. Quality of life for older adults is closely 
tied  to  their  ability  to  maintain  independence  in  daily 
activities,  especially  in  social  interactions  [16].  Effective 
communication  plays  a  key  role  in  enabling  social  par-
ticipation and is essential for active aging [17], yet many 
older adults struggle to communicate effectively, particu-
larly in noisy environments [18–20]. Communication dif-
ficulties  can  pose  significant  barriers  for  older  adults  in 
accessing healthcare services and addressing health con-
cerns  effectively.  Healthcare  providers  should  recognize 
and  understand  the  specific  communication  needs  of 
older patients to ensure effective interactions [21, 22].

Various  researchers  have  implemented  and  evaluated 
active  aging  programs  in  different  countries,  such  as 

active  aging  programs  in  nursing  homes  in  Spain  [23], 
facilitating an active old age through Danish co-creation 
initiatives in Denmark [24], green care informal learning 
program in Italy [25], promotion of active aging through 
artificial agents in Portugal [26], video games designed to 
promote  active  aging  in  Spain  [27],  the  e-VITA  project 
in  Europe  [28],  the  RESILIEN-T  in  Italy  [29].  Moreover, 
Agustí  et  al.  (2023)  reported  that  the  levels  of  physical 
activity,  functional  skills,  frequency  of  use  of  social  and 
health services, and physical-emotional state are predic-
tive  variables  of  health  satisfaction  among  active  older 
adults  in  Spain  [30].  The  goal  of  these  programs  is  to 
enhance  the  well-being  of  older  adults  and  to  investi-
gate factors associated with active aging, such as physical 
and cognitive function, nutrition, and quality of life. This 
is  achieved  by  improving  social  communication  skills, 
which enable them to adapt their communication strate-
gies to various situations [31].

Communication  and  social  skills  can  be  learned, 
practiced,  and  integrated  for  use  in  social,  clinical,  and 
healthcare  settings  [32].  By  recognizing  older  popula-
tions as a valuable resource, the population aging can be 
seen as more than just a social and economic burden; it 
can be viewed as a valuable social asset. Aging can be a 
stage  of  productivity  characterized  by  lifelong  personal 
growth and development. Older adults have their poten-
tial to actively address community challenges, meet their 
own  needs,  and  maintain  independence  [33].  However, 
research  on  the  impact  of  communication  and  social 
skills  training  on  active  aging  in  Iran  remains  limited. 
Given  the  importance  of  active  aging  and  the  limited 
research  on  interventions  to  improve  it,  further  studies 
are needed to investigate active aging from the perspec-
tive of older adults and to develop strategies to promote 
active  aging  and  address  future  challenges.  This  study 
aimed  to  investigate  the  effect  of  communication  and 
social skills training on the active aging of older adults.

Methods
Design and participants

This  quasi-experimental  trial  with  randomized  alloca-
tion and equivalent groups was conducted in two daycare 
centers for older adults in Kerman, Iran. There were three 
daycare centers in Kerman and one of them was not par-
ticipated in the research because it provided nursing and 
rehabilitation services, counseling, health education, and 
physical  check-ups  to  the  elderly  at  home.  The  selected 
daycare  centers  offered  various  programs,  including 
counseling,  health  education,  physical  check-ups,  recre-
ational  activities,  thanksgiving,  yoga,  and  social  events 
(reading  poems  and  books,  listening  to  music,  watch-
ing  films,  and  exercising).  While  there  was  no  gender 
restriction  for  membership  in  the  daycare  centers,  the 

Khajehpour et al. BMC Geriatrics          (2025) 25:626 Page 3 of 13

majority  of  older  adults  were  women.  The  study  lasted 
from August 2023 to February 2024.

Sample size and sampling

The study population consisted of 200 older adults from 
the  two  mentioned  above  centers.  The  sample  size  was 
calculated  according  to  a  previous  study  [34]  and  the 
sample  size  formula.  Considering  the  parameters  of 
α = 0.05,  test  power  of  80%,  and  a  moderate  effect  size 
(Cohen  d = 0.5),  a  sample  size  of  40  was  required  for 
each of the intervention and control groups. Participants 
were  randomly  assigned  1:1  to  the  intervention  or  con-
trol  group  using  a  computer-generated  random  num-
ber  sequence  (via  https://www.random.org/).  To  ensure 
balanced  allocation  across  centers,  randomization  was 
performed separately for each center. To minimize selec-
tion  bias,  an  independent  researcher  (not  part  of  the 

study  team)  generated  the  randomization  sequence  and 
maintained allocation concealment using sealed, opaque 
envelopes.  This  process  resulted  in  80  participants  (40 
per  group),  with  equal  representation  from  each  center 
(20 intervention and 20 control participants per center). 
Recruitment  concluded  when  we  reached  our  predeter-
mined  sample  size  target  that  provided  adequate  power 
while allowing for rigorous intervention implementation 
and  outcome  assessment.  To  minimize  assessment  bias, 
trained  research  assistants  who  were  blinded  to  group 
allocation conducted all outcome measurements. Partici-
pants were instructed not to discuss their group assign-
ments  during  the  assessments.  The  randomization  key 
remained  concealed  from  both  assessors  and  analysts 
until the completion of data collection and primary anal-
yses.  Figure  1  illustrates  the  CONSORT  diagram  of  the 
study.

Inclusion  criteria  included  the  ability  to  communicate 
and  complete  a  questionnaire  or  respond  to  an  inter-
viewer (by self-declaration), absence of mental illness or 
psychoactive  drug  use  (by  self-declaration),  willingness 
to  participate,  and  familiarity  with  mobile  technology 
and  social  media  such  as  telegram  and  WhatsApp  (by 
self-declaration).  Exclusion  criteria  included  substance 
abuse  or  dependency  that  could  affect  participation  or 
adherence to the program (by self-declaration or observ-
able behavior). Simultaneous engagement in comparable 
programs: individuals who are currently participating in 
alternative interventions designed to enhance communi-
cation  or  social  skills  to  mitigate  potential  confounding 
effects.  Non-availability  for  Follow-up:  participants  who 
plan  to  relocate  or  are  unavailable  during  the  study  and 
follow-up  assessments.  Living  in  institutionalized  set-
tings  or  under  legal  guardianship,  where  daily  routines, 
support  systems,  and  communication  dynamics  differ 
significantly  from  those  of  community-dwelling  older 
adults [35].

Data collection instruments

The study used a two-part questionnaire to collect data. 
The  first  part,  demographic  information,  included  ques-
tions  about  age,  gender,  marital  status,  living  arrange-
ment,  education,  employment,  income  level,  chronic 
diseases,  type  of  chronic  diseases,  health  insurance,  and 
number of children.

The  second  part  used  the  Iranian  Active  Aging  Mea-
surement  Instrument  (IAAMI).  The  IAAMI,  developed 
by  Mohammadi  et  al.  (2018),  is  rooted  in  the  Iranian 
cultural  understanding  of  active  aging,  which  empha-
sizes  both  objective  and  mental  dimensions.  This  mea-
sure consists of 40 expressions organized into six factors, 
demonstrating  strong  validity  and  reliability.  In  contrast 
to  other  measures,  that  predominantly  focus  on  objec-
tive and behavioral aspects while overlooking the mental 
dimension, this approach is specifically designed for the 
Iranian elderly community and acknowledges the impor-
tance  of  the  mental  dimension  of  active  aging  alongside 
objective-behavioral  factors.  Structural  validity,  assessed 
through  exploratory  factor  analysis,  revealed  that  the 
final measure includes 40 questions across six subscales: 
socialization  (particularly  social-institutional  partici-
pation)  (4  item),  mind  exercise  (6  item),  interactivity  (7 
item),  active  insight  (7  item),  role-playing  (8  item),  and 
physical-functional dynamics (8 item), explaining 56% of 
the  total  variance  in  active  aging.  Each  item  is  rated  on 
a  5-point  Likert  scale  (1  to  5).  The  IAAMI  has  a  maxi-
mum score of 200 and a minimum score of 40. A higher 
score indicates a more active aging style. Based on these 
parameters, a score of 40 to 93 is considered unfavorable 
active  aging,  94  to  147  is  considered  relatively  favorable 
active aging, and 148 to 200 is considered favorable active 

aging.  The  IAAMI’s  validity  and  reliability  were  estab-
lished in a sample of 350 Iranian older adults. The valid-
ity  was  assessed  using  the  content  validity  ratio  and  the 
content validity index, with a total content validity index 
of  0.90.  Face  validity  was  confirmed  through  expert  and 
senior  reviews  of  the  scale’s  clarity,  simplicity,  appear-
ance,  and  grammar,  and  construct  validity  was  verified 
using  exploratory  factor  analysis.  Reliability  was  dem-
onstrated by a Cronbach’s alpha coefficient of 0.88 and a 
test-retest with correlation coefficient of 0.95 [36].

Intervention

A senior geriatrics nurse and an associate professor from 
the  department  of  Community  Health  Nursing  at  Razi 
School of Nursing and Midwifery, Kerman University of 
Medical Sciences, conducted an intervention program at 
daycare centers for older adults. Before the first training 
session,  all  participants  provided  their  written  informed 
consent  and  received  instructions  on  how  to  complete 
the  questionnaires.  In  cases  where  individuals  were 
unable to read or write, the researcher conducted inter-
views  and  filled  out  questionnaires  on  their  behalf.  For 
these  individuals,  fingerprint  impressions  were  utilized 
as a substitute for signatures to document informed con-
sent  in  the  presence  of  a  witness,  thereby  ensuring  that 
ethical  standards  and  participant  autonomy  were  main-
tained. One month after the intervention, the researcher 
contacted  both  the  intervention  and  control  groups  to 
complete the questionnaires.

The  intervention  group  received  an  eight-session  in-
person communication and social skills training program, 
with  sessions  conducted  in  groups  of  20  participants 
twice a week for two hours. The educational content was 
delivered  by  two  researchers  who  were  a  senior  geriat-
rics nurse and an associate professor (JF and MHK). The 
training methods included a mix of theoretical and prac-
tical elements such as lectures and tutorials, PowerPoint 
presentations, case reports sharing, video clips and short 
movies, audio-visual materials, films, role-playing, group 
discussions, and questions and answers. Participants and 
their  caregivers  (for  illiterate  older  adults)  also  received 
an  educational  brochure  covering  communication  and 
social skills, personal and family interactions, and follow-
up strategies. Table 1 indicates the training content. The 
research  team  utilized  existing  resources,  including  lit-
erature  review  [17,  37–51]  and  the  guide  to  improving 
the lifestyle of older adults, proposed by the Ministry of 
Health and Medical Education of Iran [52]. The program 
was  developed  collaboratively  by  medical,  and  educa-
tional professionals, and social workers and validated by 
two  geriatricians  and  experts  in  social  and  communica-
tion skills at Kerman University of Medical Sciences. The 
first  face-to-face  training  session  played  an  important 
role  in  increasing  participants’  willingness  to  learn  the

impact  of  social  and  communication  skills  training  on 
active aging.

Each training session was divided into three phases: (a) 
an introductory phase, (b) an experiential phase, and (c) 
a final evaluation phase. Due to potential cognitive chal-
lenges, the educational content was repeated throughout 
the sessions. The researchers provided emotional support 
to  older  adults,  including  active  listening,  reassurance, 
and  encouragement.  Older  adults  and  caregivers  could 
ask  any  questions  they  had  through  phone  or  virtual 
platforms  like  WhatsApp  and  Telegram.  Weekly  phone 
calls were conducted to assess progress and schedule the 
next  session.  Follow-up  evaluations  after  the  final  ses-
sion allowed for ongoing nursing care and psychological 
support.  Phone  calls  reinforced  the  educational  content 
and  monitored  participants’  active  aging  and  progress. 
The  researcher  encouraged  older  adults  to  use  social 
networks  such  as  Telegram  and  WhatsApp  in  order  to 
provide  educational  videos  available  to  them.  The  con-
trol  group  received  routine  care,  including  counsel-
ing,  health  education,  physical  check-ups,  recreational 
activities,  thanksgiving,  yoga,  and  social  events.  To  pre-
vent information sharing, the groups were kept separate 

throughout the study. We also asked older adults to limit 
interactions with those outside their designated group to 
isolate the effects of the intervention and control condi-
tions.  Furthermore,  other  methodological  precautions 
were  recommended  to  minimize  potential  bias,  such  as 
treating  both  groups  equally  and  measuring  outcomes 
objectively. To ensure ethical compliance and educational 
fairness, the control group was managed as a waiting list 
control  group.  All  control  group  participants  received 
the full educational content after final data collection, to 
ensure  fairness  and  reduce  any  harm  to  this  vulnerable 
group.

Data analysis

Data  were  analyzed  using  SPSS27.  Descriptive  statistics 
(frequency,  percentage,  mean,  and  standard  deviation) 
were  used  to  summarize  the  data.  The  Kolmogorov-
Smirnov  test  assessed  normality,  while  chi-square  (or 
Fisher’s exact test) and independent samples t-tests were 
used to compare demographic variables between groups 
at baseline. Independent samples t-test was used to com-
pare active aging scores between groups before and after 
the  intervention,  and  paired  t-test  was  used  to  compare 

Khajehpour et al. BMC Geriatrics          (2025) 25:626 Page 6 of 13

scores  within  each  group.  Cohen’s  d  was  calculated  to 
assess  effect  size,  and  a  significance  level  of  ≤ 0.05  was 
used.

Results
Demographic information

Of  the  80  participants,  76  older  adults  completed  the 
study.  Four  participants  were  dropped  out  (two  partici-
pants from the control group and two from the interven-
tion  group)  due  to  unstable  physical  conditions  (acute 
changes in vital signs and hospitalization), lost to follow-
up,  failure  to  attend  more  than  two  sessions,  and  incor-
rect  responses  (with  a  response  rate  of  95%).  The  mean 
ages  of  participants  in  the  intervention  and  control 
groups  were  68.94 ± 7.27  and  67.13 ± 5.09  years,  respec-
tively. In addition to reporting age as a continuous vari-
able, we categorized age into four groups (60–65, 66–70, 
71–75, and > 75 years) to facilitate comparisons between 
the  intervention  and  control  groups.  This  approach  was 
adopted  due  to  the  non-normal  distribution  of  age  and 
the relatively small sample size, which limited the statis-
tical  power  of  parametric  tests  on  continuous  variables. 
The  selected  age  bands  represent  clinically  meaning-
ful  categories  commonly  used  in  geriatric  research  and 
helped ensure adequate subgroup sizes  for  analysis. The 
groups  were  comparable  in  terms  of  demographic  char-
acteristics (P > 0.05) (Table 2).

Outcomes
Comparison of changes in the aging active

The following analysis compares changes in active aging 
scores  between  intervention  and  control  groups  before 
and after a targeted training program, shedding light on 
the  impact  of  such  programs  on  older  adults’  engage-
ment  levels.  Table  3  presents  the  levels  of  active  aging 
and  subscale  scores  for  both  the  intervention  and  con-
trol  groups  before  and  after  the  training  program.  Ini-
tially, there was no significant difference in the scores of 
active aging between the intervention (98.18 ± 17.77) and 
control  groups  (103.84 ± 15.18).  Active  aging  scores  of 
both groups were at a relatively favorable level (94–147) 
based on the aging active questionnaire scoring (t =−1.49, 
p = 0.14).

After  the  training  program,  the  intervention  group 
(147.97 ± 13.19)  showed  a  significant  increase  in  the 
score  of  active  aging  compared  to  the  control  group 
(101.1 ± 8.18),  with  a  large  effect  size  (Cohen  d = 4.36, 
t = 19, p = < 0.001). Furthermore, the intervention group’s 
subscale scores of active aging improved after the train-
ing program, with effect sizes ranging from 1.85 to 3.24, 
indicating  a  favorable  level  of  active  aging  (148–200) 
based on the questionnaire.

The total mean aging score remained relatively stable in 
the control group, with no significant difference between 

the  pre-test  (103.84 ± 15.18)  and  post-test  (101.1 ± 8.18) 
scores.  Participants  in  the  control  group  maintained  a 
relatively  favorable  active  aging  level  throughout  the 
study (Table 3).

An  ANCOVA  was  conducted  to  account  for  potential 
pretest  effects.  The  results  revealed  that  the  significant 
increase  in  active  aging  among  the  intervention  group 
was due to the communication and social skills training 
(Table 4).

Discussion
This  study  examined  the  effect  of  communication  and 
social skills training on active aging in older adults. Our 
findings indicated that the training program significantly 
enhanced  the  level  of  active  aging,  shifting  participants 
in  the  intervention  group  from  a  relatively  favorable 
to  a  favorable  status.  While  these  results  underline  the 
importance  of  such  interventions,  it  is  crucial  to  criti-
cally  contextualize  them.  Consistent  with  the  results 
of  the  present  study,  several  studies  reported  the  effec-
tiveness  of  educational  interventions  on  active  aging  in 
older  adults  [53–55].  Our  improvements  align  with  the 
findings  of  Ying-Chen  Chi  et  al.  (2021),  who  reported 
sustained  benefits  from  a  cross-disciplinary  interven-
tion over 19 weeks, our study did not evaluate long-term 
outcomes [55]. However, a study by de Souto Barreto et 
al.  (2021)  revealed  that  multidomain  interventions  had 
minimal  effects  on  functional  health  and  social  partici-
pation among older adults. This finding suggests that not 
all intervention models are equally effective, particularly 
when  participant  motivation  and  program  adherence 
are low. The study conducted an intervention that relied 
heavily  on  self-guided  online  participation,  with  limited 
interpersonal  interaction  and  real-time  social  support 
[56].  Notably,  their  program  may  have  lacked  culturally 
adapted content and a clear focus on social skills. These 
are key features of our intervention and may explain the 
stronger  outcomes  we  observed.  In  contrast,  our  study 
likely  benefited  from  having  facilitators,  peer  support, 
and  culturally  relevant  materials.  These  aspects  could 
have  contributed  to  enhancing  the  motivation  and  the 
interest  of  the  participants.  The  gap  in  results  could  be 
explained  by  the  differences  in  the  delivery  of  the  pro-
grams  as  well  as  by  the  variances  in  the  supervision 
and  motivation.  On  the  whole,  this  evidence  shows  the 
importance  of  integrating  social  interaction  and  orga-
nized support. This approach may be more effective than 
fully web-based formats, especially for older adults with 
limited digital skills.

Our  program’s  delivery  method  emphasized  interper-
sonal  interaction.  Participants  described  the  daycare 
centers  as  familial  spaces.  Hsu  et  al.  (2019)  found  that 
person-to-person  interventions  led  to  improved  adapta-
tion  and  coping  compared  to  digitally  assisted  methods

[57]. While our findings align with this research, we did 
not  conduct  a  direct  comparison,  which  limits  our  abil-
ity  to  make  conclusive  recommendations.  Czaja  et  al. 
(2018)  demonstrated  the  potential  of  technology-based 
interventions  to  enhance  social  connectivity  and  reduce 
loneliness  among  older  adults  [58].  Furthermore,  the 
approach  utilized  by  Czaja  et  al.  [58]  emphasized  inde-
pendent  technology  use,  which  provided  limited  oppor-
tunities for structured social interaction. In contrast, we 
combined digital skills training with emotional and social 
support. This gave participants immediate opportunities 
for  connection  and  reinforcement—elements  that  are 
essential for sustaining behavioral change. Future studies 
should compare different delivery formats and use hybrid 
methods  that  match  participants’  preferences  and  tech-
nological skills, in order to increase generalizability.

Our study found improvements in mindfulness dimen-
sions  within  the  intervention  group,  supporting  the 
notion  that  enhanced  mental  health  promotes  health-
responsible behaviors. However, we did not directly mea-
sure  variables  such  as  self-efficacy  or  perceived  health 
threats, which are central to behavior modification mod-
els like the Health Belief Model (HBM) and Social Cog-
nitive  Theory  (SCT).  These  constructs  could  have  been 
assessed using validated scales. For instance, the General 
Self-Efficacy  Scale  (GSE)  could  be  employed  to  evalu-
ate confidence in health behavior change, while the Per-
ceived Susceptibility/Severity Scale (derived from HBM) 
could  assess  risk  perception  [59,  60].  Within  the  HBM 
framework,  perceived  threats  and  self-efficacy  serve  as 
catalysts  for  action.  SCT  also  highlights  self-efficacy  in 
sustaining  behavior  change  [61]. The  literature  supports 
these  psychological  components  as  catalysts  for  active

aging [62]. Two studies demonstrated that utilizing stress 
management  techniques  and  coping  skills  significantly 
improved  mental  health,  mindfulness,  and  social  par-
ticipation [63, 64]. These enhancements highlight the sig-
nificance of mental and social engagement in promoting 
overall  well-being.  Recognizing  health  risks  (a  key  part 
of HBM) can motivate self-care, which is crucial as indi-
viduals  age.  Additionally,  strong  family  connections  and 
good mental health, both emphasized in SCT, help older 
adults to adopt and maintain health-promoting behaviors 
[65].  Future  research  should  incorporate  these  theoreti-
cal mediators to clarify their mechanistic roles in mind-
fulness-based interventions. Choi et al. (2014) found that 
problem-solving therapy delivered via telehealth resulted 
in  short-term  reductions  in  depressive  symptoms;  how-
ever, it did not lead to long-term improvements in social 
engagement  or  mindfulness  [66].  Similarly,  Lenze  et  al. 
(2022)  reported  no  significant  long-term  cognitive  ben-
efits  from  mindfulness  or  exercise  interventions  over 
an  18-month  period  [67].  One  possible  explanation  for 
these null findings is that these studies may have lacked 
culturally  adapted  content.  Additionally,  they  did  not 
explicitly address communication, social interaction, and 

emotional support, which are distinctive components of 
the present intervention.

Our  study  significantly  enhanced  older  adults’  active 
insight,  improving  their  ability  to  critically  evaluate  life 
experiences and apply the lessons learned. This enhance-
ment  likely  stemmed  from  educational  sessions  focused 
on  problem-solving,  emotional  expression,  and  inter-
generational  dialogue,  with  intergenerational  activities 
further  enriching  participants’  perspectives.  Our  find-
ings  align  with  those  of  Dumitrache  et  al.  (2017),  who 
reported  that  reflective  thinking,  cognitive  stimulation, 
and  structured  group  activities  enhance  older  adults’ 
adaptability,  resilience,  and  cognitive  function  [68]. 
These  outcomes  underline  the  importance  of  structured 
group activities. However, research by Wang et al. (2022) 
indicates  that  such  interventions  necessitate  intrinsic 
motivation  and  community  support  to  achieve  lasting 
behavioral  change  [69].  Our  participants  were  already 
relatively  socially  active  and  cognitively  capable,  which 
may have enhanced the effectiveness of the intervention. 
These  differences  in  the  study  population,  the  nature  of 
social  engagement,  and  the  methodological  approach 
likely  account  for  the  variation  in  results.  This  suggests 

Khajehpour et al. BMC Geriatrics          (2025) 25:626 Page 10 of 13

that,  in  addition  to  structured  training,  creating  oppor-
tunities  for  ongoing  peer  interaction  and  meaningful 
engagement is essential.

variation in outcomes. These findings confirm that digi-
tal interventions are most effective when combined with 
interpersonal interaction and structured support.

Our  results  showed  that  there  was  a  significant 
improvement 
in  the  domain  of  physical-functional 
dynamics.  This  enhancement  may  be  attributed  to  the 
motivational  and  behavioral  activation  effects  of  the 
training.  The  communication  techniques  taught  during 
the sessions, including verbal and non-verbal expression, 
assertiveness,  and  stress  management,  can  indirectly 
enhance  self-care  and  functional  autonomy.  Previous 
research  supports the notion that psychological engage-
ment and enhanced social functioning positively contrib-
ute to the physical capabilities and independence of older 
adults [70–73].

Our  study  significantly  enhanced  older  adults’  social 
participation  and  role-playing  capacities.  The  integra-
tion  of  information  and  communication  technology  is 
increasingly recognized as a vital enabler of active aging. 
By teaching older adults to use internet-based tools such 
as  WhatsApp  and  Telegram,  the  program  empowered 
participants to access health information, engage in cog-
nitive activities, and maintain ongoing connections with 
family and friends. These digital tools extended commu-
nication  opportunities  beyond  the  classroom,  support-
ing peer interaction and continuity of social engagement. 
Complementing  the  digital  component,  role-playing 
activities  such  as  storytelling,  mentoring  younger  gen-
erations, and sharing cultural experiences offered partici-
pants meaningful opportunities to assert identity, express 
themselves,  and  reinforce  intergenerational  ties.  These 
outcomes  are  consistent  with  prior  research  indicating 
that  both  structured  social  involvement  and  digital  lit-
eracy significantly contribute to improved mental health 
and  active  aging  [8,  74,  75].  However,  Goodarzi  et  al. 
(2023) found that while low to moderate levels of online 
social  participation  reduced  loneliness  among  older 
adults,  high  levels  of  online  engagement  could  intensify 
feelings  of  loneliness,  suggesting  a  U-shaped  relation-
ship.  This  indicates  that  excessive  reliance  on  online 
interactions without adequate offline social participation 
may  not  yield  the  desired  benefits  and  could  potentially 
exacerbate  feelings  of  isolation.  They  also  find  that  the 
impact of social participation modes varies considerably 
between younger and older groups [76]. While our study 
proved  effective  among  relatively  healthy  and  socially 
active older adults, its generalizability to more vulnerable 
or digitally inexperienced populations remains uncertain. 
This implies that online tools are to facilitate, rather than 
to completely substitute in-person interactions. Our par-
ticipants used digital tools purposefully and under guid-
ance,  which  mitigated  the  risk  of  isolation.  In  contrast, 
Goodarzi et al. [76] examined unstructured, independent 
online  usage.  This  difference  likely  contributed  to  the 

The  review  of  these  studies  reveals  both  consistent 
themes  and  key  differences.  The  discrepancy  between 
results  of  the  above-mentioned  studies  and  the  present 
study can be due the differences in community, sampling 
method,  participants’  previous  skills,  study  design  and 
educational content, data collection tools and conditions. 
The  results  highlight  practical  implications  for  improv-
ing  the  active  aging  of  older  adults  through  interven-
tions,  and  future  research.  Healthcare  providers  should 
develop integrated communication and social skills train-
ing  healthcare  service  to  promote  active  aging  of  older 
adults.

Strengths and limitations

The  study  offers  several  strengths.  One  of  the  key 
strengths 
is  the  group-based  educational  program 
designed  to  enhance  healthy  living,  social  participation, 
and  active  aging  among  older  adults.  Furthermore,  the 
intervention  program  was  developed  collaboratively  by 
medical, educational professionals, and social workers to 
address the specific needs of the community.

Despite  these  strengths,  several  limitations  should 
be  considered  when  interpreting  the  findings.  First,  the 
results  were  specific  to  older  adults  in  two  daycare  cen-
ters  in  southeastern  Iran,  and  contamination  between 
two groups may have affected the results. Despite efforts 
to  reduce  contamination,  differences  in  results  between 
the  groups  suggest  that  the  intervention  was  still  effec-
tive.  Second,  the  majority  of  participants  (89.5%)  were 
women,  which  may  limit  the  generalizability  of  the 
results.  Other  variables  such  as  relationships  between 
children  and  the  older  adults,  experiences  with  or  with-
out  children  were  not  examined.  Third,  the  evaluation 
relied  on  self-reported  measures  and  the  short  duration 
of  the  intervention  may  not  capture  long-term  effects 
of  the  intervention  on  active  aging  indicators.  Further 
research  is  needed  to  explore  the  lasting  impact  of  the 
intervention.  Fourth,  the  study  focused  on  older  adults 
attending  daycare  centers  in  Kerman,  which  may  limit 
the  generalizability  of  the  results  to  the  broader  Iranian 
older  adult  population.  Fifth,  while  our  sample  size  met 
power  requirements,  larger  studies  may  be  needed  to 
detect  smaller  effect  sizes  and  enhance  generalizability. 
However,  the  educational  content  was  tailored  for  Ira-
nian older adults, providing a starting point for adapting 
the program to different populations. While the program 
may have modest impact on some outcomes due to these 
limitations,  it  serves  as  an  initial  step  in  evaluating  the 
effectiveness of communication and social skills training 
in promoting active aging across cultures.

Khajehpour et al. BMC Geriatrics          (2025) 25:626 Conclusion
This  study  provides  valuable  evidence  supporting  com-
munication and social interventions aimed at promoting 
active  aging.  The  intervention,  which  emphasized  facili-
tator-guided support, significantly improved participants’ 
active aging status by enhancing mindfulness, social con-
nectedness,  and  stress  management.  The  findings  sug-
gest that integrating digital literacy with real-world social 
activities  not  only  enhances  participation  but  also  pre-
vents over-reliance on technology. Therefore, it is recom-
mended  that  this  model  be  implemented  in  elderly  day 
care  centers  and  senior  centers  as  part  of  community-
based aging support strategies. The results highlight that 
increased  interpersonal  engagement,  structured  group 
activities,  and  the  integration  of  culturally  adapted  edu-
cational content are key elements in fostering psychologi-
cal, functional, and social well-being among older adults. 
Predictors such as enhanced social affiliation, emotional 
support, and functional autonomy are essential contribu-
tors  to  health  satisfaction  and  the  likelihood  of  healthy 
active  aging.  The  expanded  use  of  such  interventions, 
supported  by  longitudinal  research  and  comparative 
studies  can  facilitate  sustainable  active  aging  and  pro-
mote behavioral change across diverse aging populations.
