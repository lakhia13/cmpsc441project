Can psychopathology and neuroscience 
coexist in psychiatric classifications?
Marc-Antoine Crocq, MD

DSM vs RDoC?

  This  article  is  part  of  an  issue  of  Dialogues  in 

Clinical Neuroscience that is devoted to current contro-
versies in psychiatry. Over the last decades, the psychi-
atric community has been agitated by renewed doubts 
about the utility of our current diagnostic classifications. 
This “validity  crisis”  culminated  when  the  publication 
of  Diagnostic  and  Statistical  Manual  of  Mental  Disor-
ders (DSM-5) was greeted by the concurrent announce-
ment of the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC)1 proj-
ect by the NIMH. The RDoC project aims at providing 
a framework for translational research into several do-
mains (negative valence, positive valence, cognitive sys-
tems,  social  process,  arousal  and  modulatory  systems) 
at  several  levels  of  analysis  (genes,  molecules,  cells, 
circuits,  physiology,  behaviors,  self-report,  paradigms). 
With  respect  to  DSM,  the  RDoC  project  was  initially 
perceived  as  a  rival  claim  to  the  throne  rather  than  a 
joint  effort.  Criticism  of  DSM  focused  on  the  hetero-
geneity  of  numerous  categories,  which  was  cited  as  a 
major  hindrance  for  research.  It  is  true  that  the  obvi-
ous  diversity  of  patients  recruited  on  the  basis  of,  say,

A crisis of confidence was triggered by the disappoint-
ment that diagnostic validity, an important goal, was 
not  achieved  with  the  publication  of  Diagnostic  and 
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5). The Re-
search Domain Criteria (RDoC) project, which provides 
a framework for neuroscientific research, was initially 
conceptualized  as  an  alternative  to  DSM.  However, 
RDoC and DSM are complementary rather than mutu-
ally exclusive. From a historical perspective, this article 
argues that the debate opposing psychology and brain 
in psychiatric classification is not new and has an air of 
déjà  vu.  We  go  back  to  the  first  classifications  based 
on a scientific taxonomy in the late 18th century with 
Boissier de Sauvages, which were supposed to describe 
diseases as they really existed in nature. Emil Kraepelin 
successfully associated psychopathology and brain re-
search, prefiguring the interaction between DSM and 
RDoC.  DSM  symptoms  remain  valuable  because  they 
are the only data that are immediately and directly ob-
servable. Computational science is a promising instru-
ment  to  interconnect  psychopathological  and  neuro-
scientific data in the future.

DSM-5 criteria for Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) 
or  Posttraumatic  Stress  Disorder  (PTSD),  is  likely  to 
have  contributed  to  the  inconclusive  results  of  many 
drug trials. In parallel to the heterogeneity within cate-
gories, a categorical classification is not ideally suited to 
conducting research on dimensional or trans-diagnostic 
traits that may be common to different clinical entities. 
The  object  of  the  debate  is  now  whether  our  current 
diagnostic  categories,  as  defined  by  DSM-5,  and  soon 
by  the  International  Classification  of  Diseases  (ICD-
11), are still useful, or should they be discarded? In that 
case, is there a meaningful alternative? Should we: (i) 
remain faithful to DSM, (ii) embrace RDoC totally, or 
(iii)  try  to  reconcile  both?  Psychiatry’s  history—both 
recent and remote—suggests that the last proposition is 
the only viable one. The debate about the basis of classi-
fications—ie, whether classifications should be descrip-
tive, or whether they should be based on an etiological 
theory—has  resurfaced  whenever  psychiatric  knowl-
edge was at a critical juncture or made new leaps.   

Proximal roots of the current validity crisis

We may summarize the recent events in psychiatry by 
stating that DSM-III introduced reliability, in the form 
of a common vocabulary, after the era of psychoanalysis 
and antipsychiatry (both of which did not view classifi-
cation as primordial). Clinicians and scientists supposed 
that this newly restored reliability was the long-expect-
ed prerequisite that would pave the way for future re-
search, ultimately leading to validity. The current crisis 
of confidence was triggered by the disappointment that 
diagnostic validity, an important goal, was not achieved 
with the publication of DSM-5, despite optimistic prom-
ises and high expectations. In order to enhance validity, 
many  proposals  were  circulated  during  the  prepara-
tory phase of DSM-5. One such suggestion was to rely 
more  on  dimensions  and  less  on  categories.  However, 
dimensions were ultimately rejected because they were 
perceived as too cumbersome for use in everyday clini-
cal practice; as is well-known, the dimensional model of 
personality was finally relegated to Section III. Another 
idea was to select markers derived from the wealth of 
data  contributed  by  the  very  productive  research  into 
genetics, brain imaging, neurocircuitry over the last two 
decades. The  Research Agenda  for  DSM-5,  published 
in  2002,  contained  a  proposal  by  Charney  et  al2  for  a 
possible  multiaxial  system  capable  of  accommodating 

neuroscientific parameters (Axis I: Genotype [eg, genes 
related  to  disease,  resiliency,  or  therapeutic  response]; 
Axis II: Neurobiological phenotype [eg, neuroimaging, 
cognitive functions, emotional regulation]; Axis III: Be-
havioral genotype; Axis IV: Environmental modifiers or 
precipitants; Axis V: Therapeutic targets and response). 
After  the  abandonment  of  dimensions  and  biological 
markers,  the  publication  of  DSM-5  in  2013  certainly 
gave  us  a  very  valuable  instrument.  However,  disap-
pointment  was  felt  because  the  final  product  did  not 
correspond to the paradigm shift that had been prom-
ised, and disappointment unleashed criticism.  

What is a good classification?

Classifications  are  primarily  judged  according  to  their 
reliability and validity. In addition, they should be use-
ful and practical. Validity means that our diagnostic cat-
egories describe real entities and not flawed concepts. 
This is a difficult endeavor if we take into account that 
we still ignore the etiology of most psychiatric disorders. 
Robins  and  Guze3  proposed  a  five-phase  method  for 
achieving  diagnostic  validity  including:  (i)  clinical  de-
scription; (ii) laboratory studies; (iii) delimitation from 
other  disorders;  (iv)  follow-up  studies;  and  (v)  family 
study. Step 3 is traditionally a cornerstone of classifica-
tion; it postulates that a diagnostic category should be 
homogeneous,  and  that  “patients  with  other  illnesses 
are not included in the group to be studied.” A cognate 
concept is that a valid diagnostic category should have 
distinct boundaries and should be separated both from 
normality  and  from  other  diagnostic  categories  by  a 
“zone of rarity.” For example, PTSD should be distinct 
from the normal response to adversity, and patients with 
PTSD should not usually have major depression or anx-
iety  disorders.4  More  refined  procedures  to  guarantee 
validity  have  been  proposed  more  recently.  Kendler5 
differentiated  antecedent,  concurrent,  and  predictive 
validators.  Andreasen6  suggested  validators  contrib-
uted by findings from genetics, neurochemistry, neuro-
anatomy, neurophysiology, and cognitive neuroscience. 
Andreasen’s proposals look like a harbinger of RDoC’s 
units  of  analysis. Validity  is  not  the  sole  requirement, 
and other qualities such as utility7 and complexity8 also 
must be taken into account. Utility designates the prac-
ticable information that is conveyed by the diagnosis in 
terms of treatment planning, outcome, and sometimes 
etiology. An  ideal  classification  should  also  be  able  to

cope with the complexity of psychiatric disorders, which 
refers  to  the  multiple  reciprocal  interactions  between 
the various etiological factors.  
  Finally, classifications have to cope with the necessi-
ty to accommodate a large spectrum of disorders, rang-
ing  from  quasi-neurological  diseases  to  ailments  that 
are  heavily  influenced  by  psychosocial  factors. At  the 
extreme,  because  of  reimbursement  issues,  classifica-
tions have to provide diagnoses for normal persons who 
consult psychotherapists to sort daily life problems. In-
terestingly, in his General Psychopathology (Allgemeine 
Psychopathology), published in 1913, exactly 100 years 
before DSM-5 and RDoC,9  Karl Jaspers proposed that 
some  psychiatric  disorders  followed  the  traditional 
medical  model,  whereas  other  psychiatric  disorders, 
such  as  abnormal  reactions  or  neurotic  syndromes, 
were not medical disorders but variations of normality, 
which he placed in a so-called “Group III.”
  Finally, a classification should be meant for the whole 
international scientific community and not confined to 
a  country. This  does  not  go  without  saying.  Indeed,  a 
study10 showed that France was one of the few countries 
where more than 30% of clinicians felt the need for a 
national  classification  of  mental  disorders  (along  with 
Cuba, Russia, India, Japan, and the People’s Republic 
of China) whereas less than 5% of interviewed persons 
shared this need in other European countries (eg, Ger-
many, Spain, or the United Kingdom). A revised version 
of the Latin American Guide for Psychiatric Diagnosis 
(GLADP-VR)11 was published in Spanish in 2012, and 
a revised French Classification of Mental Disorders12 in 
2015. 

It is very simple: we do not know what the 
universe is

The main obstacle to validity is the sad fact that we ig-
nore  the  ultimate  causation  of  most  mental  disorders. 
In  1952,  the Argentine  writer  Jorge  Luis  Borges13 de-
scribed a fictitious Chinese encyclopedia, entitled “Ce-
lestial  Empire  of  Benevolent  Knowledge”  that  classi-
fied  animals  as  follows:  (a)  belonging  to  the  emperor; 
(b) embalmed; (c) tame; (d) suckling pigs; (e) sirens; (f) 
fabulous; (g) stray dogs; (h) included in the present clas-
sification; (i) frenzied; (j) innumerable; (k) drawn with a 
very fine camelhair brush; (l) et cetera; (m) having just 
broken the water pitcher; (n) that from a long way off 
look like flies. These categories are not mutually exclu-

sive. For instance, a Chinese emperor might own a tame 
suckling pig, and ask a scribe to trace his name with a 
delicate camelhair brush. Though tame, this piglet, still 
young  and  playful,  might  one  day  shatter  the  water 
pitcher when gamboling. Obviously, the suckling pig is 
included in this classification (h), which means that the 
young  animal  would  finally  qualify  for  categories  a,  c, 
d, h, k, and n. This is an image of the comorbidity that 
afflicts DSM-III, -IV and -5. Borges used the system de-
vised by this apocryphal Chinese encyclopedist to illus-
trate the point that every classification in the universe 
is “arbitrary and full of conjectures.” Most importantly, 
he further stated that “the reason for this is very simple: 
we  do  not  know  what  the  universe  is.”  (“La  razón  es 
muy  simple:  no  sabemos  qué  cosa  es  el  universo”).  It 
is true that we know little about the etiology of mental 
disorders, and to cut a long story short, that’s why we 
are stuck with our diagnostic categories. In spite of that, 
Borges’ definition would boast correct reliability (if we 
were to use it, most of us would classify various animals 
in the same way).

There is nothing new under the sun

An examination of the early history of psychiatry sug-
gests that the controversy about nosology, ie, the debate 
about  whether  classifications  should  be  based  on  ob-
servable symptoms or on putative etiologies, is consid-
erably older that the rift between DSM and RDoC. J. de 
Leon described the current debate as a feeling of déjà 
vu after 100 years.14 We may therefore conjecture that 
this debate is long-lasting and inherent to our discipline. 
  At  the  juncture  between  the  epochs  known  as  the 
Scientific  Revolution  and  the  Enlightenment,  the  first 
modern medical classifications were based on the sys-
tem  of  scientific  taxonomy  developed  by  Carl  Lin-
naeus  (1707–1778).  Boissier  de  Sauvages  (1706–1767) 
maintained correspondence with him. He used Latin to 
compile  his  “Methodical  Nosology”  (1763),  a  system-
atic classification of all known diseases (2400 individual 
diseases), “in  accordance  with  the  method  of Thomas 
Sydenham  and  Linnaean  taxonomy.”15  The  foreword 
to the posthumous French edition (1771) explains that 
observable features that exist only in the given disease, 
and distinguish it from all others, designate each disease. 
It was assumed that diseases could be captured as they 
existed in nature, and that “zones of rarity” separated 
them from one another. In Boissier de Sauvages’ nosol-

157

ogy (Table I),16 mental illnesses (Vesaniae) made up the 
8th class of diseases; they were divided into four orders 
(Hallucinations, Morositates, Deliria, Folies anomales). 
Each  order  comprised  several  illnesses  that  were  fur-
ther  subdivided  into  various  types.  Table  I  shows  that 
each group comprises illnesses that are postulated to be 
caused  by  a  common  mechanism;  an  exception  is  the 
4th order that seems to be a residual category (a kind of 
“Not Otherwise Specified” box). 
  The  Encyclopedia  compiled  by  Diderot  and 
d’Alembert, the most influential publication of the En-
lightenment,  had  an  entry  about “nosology”  that  was 

written in 1765 by Jean Joseph Menuret de Chambaud 
(1739-1815),  a  physician  interested  in  the  fields  of  se-
miotics and mental illnesses. As an adept of “neo-Hip-
pocratism,” he believed that a physician should follow 
the  method  of  directly  observing  the  facts  and  should 
not get misled by theories. Menuret writes in the Eny-
clopedia that illnesses can be classified only according 
to their symptoms, since the knowledge acquired from 
the etiologies is always uncertain because it is specula-
tive. Therefore, Menuret states that nosology should be 
simply equated with symptomatology. In his words, this 
approach is similar to the method used by the natural-

ist who creates a solid and clear classification of plants 
on the basis on the visible shape of fruits, flowers and 
leaves,  instead  of  basing  his  system  on  the  intimate 
structure of plants as seen with a microscope.   
  This botanical taxonomy, which was supposed to de-
scribe real diseases as present in nature, was demolished 
by Philippe Pinel (1745–1826), who criticized Boissier de 
Sauvages for his arbitrary choices, for mistaking isolated 
symptoms  for  proper  illnesses,  and  for  unduly  expand-
ing the number of categories (the same criticism was also 
made of DSM). Pinel17 narrated that he decided to dis-
regard theoretical classifications and to rely on his own 
observations.  Interestingly,  Emil  Kraepelin  broke  with 
the past in a similar way, and decided, after reproducing 
published knowledge in the first editions of his textbook, 
that it was time to start constructing a new system based 
on  his  own  data  (“Krankheitsbilder”).  Kraepelin  was 
painfully aware that his diagnostic categories were only 
syndromes (“Symptomenkomplexe”) and that the state 
of science did not yet allow him to describe real diseases 
(“Krankheitsformen”).  In  the  very  first  edition  of  his 
textbook  (1883),  then  called  Compendium,  Emil  Krae-
pelin wrote “These syndromes will only acquire a deeper 
scientific basis when we will be able to establish that each 
of them has an understandable relationship with abnor-
malities  of  the  brain  cortex.”  („Eine  tiefere  pathologi-
sche  Begründung  werden  diese  Symptomenkomplexe 
erst dann gewinnen, wenn es gelingt, ihre gesetzmäßige 
Abhängigkeit von krankhaften Störungen der Hirnfunk-
tionen im einzelnen nachzuweisen.“)
  At a time when we are learning how to derive the 
best from both DSM-5 and RDoC, Kraepelin remains 
a guiding figure. He was confronted with a concurrent 
school of all-brain nosology, but he combined different 
currents  within  a  non-dogmatic  and  flexible  frame.  In 
fact, before RDoC, there has been a previous endeavor 
to map mental illnesses on the brain. Theodor Meynert 
(1833-1892)  in Vienna  was  the  first  major  representa-
tive  of  that  current.  Under  his  influence,  his  brilliant 
young  student,  Carl  Wernicke  (1848-1905),  pursued 
the idea of localizing various brain lesions and deduc-
ing their clinical consequences. Wernicke published his 
seminal  article  on  aphasia  in  1874  when  he  was  just 
26  years  old.18  It  took  Meynert  10  more  years  (1884) 
to publish a book with the revealing title: “Psychiatry; 
clinical  aspects  of  the  illnesses  of  the  forebrain.”  Ar-
thur  Schnitzler  and  Sigmund  Freud  were  residents  in 
Meynert’s  clinic  but,  as  is  known,  they  decided  to  fol-

low a different path. As  Kendler19 wondered, “What if 
Wernicke, the one genuine competitor with Kraepelin 
for  prominence  in  German  psychiatry  at  the  turn  of 
the  20th  century,  had  not  died  from  a  bicycle  accident 
at the age of 52 in 1905?” Nevertheless, Kraepelin held 
Wernicke in high esteem,20 and he recruited a few of his 
disciples  (eg,  Robert  Gaupp  in  Munich,  or  Karl  Lud-
wig Bonhoeffer as successor in Heidelberg). Kraepelin 
knew  that  his  nosological  system  was  temporary  and 
was bound to incorporate new data and undergo trans-
formation.  Even  though  Kraepelin  thought  that  brain 
pathology was not advanced enough in his times to sus-
tain  a  valid  nosological  classification,  he  consistently 
tried to connect psychopathology and brain pathology. 
When that became possible, he attracted the best brain 
pathologists to his clinic (Alzheimer, Nissl, Spielmeyer, 
and Brodmann) and the successive editions of his text-
book contained precise descriptions of brain research.21

The way forward is reconciliation

Even  though  DSM  and  RDoC  have  been  viewed  as 
antagonistic, most clinicians would consider today that 
they  are  complementary  and  synergistic  approaches. 
The title of this article is a controversial question—can 
psychopathology  and  neuroscience  coexist  in  psychi-
atric  classifications?—that,  in  our  opinion,  can  be  an-
swered most positively. 

Jablensky22 recently expressed the thoughtful opin-
ion that the way forward will be found in the concep-
tual reconciliation of both approaches. Realistically, we 
cannot function without a DSM-like classification. Cli-
nicians  prefer  diagnostic  categories,  even  though  they 
are aware that categories are not valid in the sense that 
they  are  not  discrete,  and  that  they  are  only  concepts 
and  not  real  entities.  However,  diagnostic  categories 
possess “utility” by virtue of the practical information 
they convey about treatment strategy and because they 
can be used for effective communication and decisions. 
On the other hand, the RDoC project is fascinating. It 
has been dubbed a “promissory note” and, in all likeli-
hood,  the  note  will  be  honored  in  a  sumptuous  man-
ner, even though the period of time is unknown. RDoC 
has attracted considerable interest as a research frame-
work. A  March  2017  search  of  the  NIH  Reporter  en-
gine returned over 300 hits for funded research grants 
with “RDoC” as a search term, almost all in the clinical/
translational area.

  Also, the growth of computational science, and the 
ability  to  handle  and  decipher  voluminous  amount  of 
data,  will  probably  facilitate  the  integration  of  DSM 
and  RDoC.  DSM  symptoms  remain  valuable  in  re-
search because they are the only elements that we can 
observe  directly.  Strategies  for  the  formal  integration 
of  DSM  categories  and  RDoC  dimensions  have  been 
delineated, for instance in a paper whose last author is 
Joshua A. Gordon, the current director of the National 
Institute of Mental Health.23 This paper discusses math-
ematical models where pathophysiological mechanisms, 
hidden from direct observations, may be inferred from 
their observed outcomes (ie, DSM symptoms and diag-
noses, that are treated as observations). 
  Another  reason  to  keep  DSM,  while  making  the 
most out of RDoC, is to break the pattern of destructive 

“wipeouts” in psychiatry described by Edward Shorter, 
a renowned historian of psychiatry. In lectures on “The 
fragility  of  psychiatric  knowledge,”24  Shorter  reminds 
us that psychiatry is the only medical specialty that has 
endured two “total knowledge wipeouts.” In the 1920s, 
the  triumph  of  psychoanalysis  wiped  out  the  previous 
century  of  research  in  biological  psychiatry.  Psycho-
analysis  was  similarly  displaced  by  the  return  of  bio-
logical thinking in psychiatry in the 1970s. As a mature 
discipline,  psychiatry  should  be  able  to  admit  change 
without breaking, keeping up with the pace of neurosci-
entific  research  without  throwing  overboard  centuries 
of precious psychopathological knowledge. o

¿Pueden coexistir la psicopatología y las 
neurociencias en las clasificaciones psiquiátricas?

Psychopathologie et neurosciences peuvent-elles 
coexister dans les classifications psychiatriques ?

El que no se haya cumplido el importante objetivo de la 
validez diagnóstica con la publicación del Manual Diag-
nóstico  y  Estadístico  de  los  Trastornos  Mentales  (DSM-
5),  ha  provocado  decepción  y  una  crisis  de  confianza. 
El proyecto Research Domain Criteria (RDoC), que pro-
porciona un marco para la investigación neurocientífica, 
se  conceptualizó  inicialmente  como  una  alternativa  al 
DSM. Sin embargo, RDoC y DSM son complementarios 
en  lugar  de  excluirse  mutuamente.  Este  artículo  argu-
menta,  desde  una  perspectiva  histórica,  que  el  debate 
entre la psicología y el cerebro en la clasificación psiquiá-
trica no es nuevo y tiene un aire de déjà vu. Las primeras 
clasificaciones  del  siglo  XVIII  (de  Boissier  de  Sauvages) 
basadas en la taxonomía científica debían describir las 
enfermedades  tal  cual  existían  en  la  naturaleza.  Emil 
Kraepelin asoció con éxito la psicopatología y la inves-
tigación  del  cerebro,  anticipando  la  interacción  entre 
DSM y RDoC. Los síntomas del DSM siguen siendo valio-
sos porque son los únicos datos que se pueden observar 
de forma inmediata y directa. La ciencia computacional 
es un instrumento prometedor para interconectar, en el 
futuro, datos psicopatológicos y neurocientíficos.          

Une crise de confiance a été déclenchée par la déception 
que la validité diagnostique, un objectif important, n’ait 
pas été atteinte avec la publication du DSM 5. Le projet 
des critères de domaines de recherche (RDoC), qui fournit 
un cadre pour la recherche neuroscientifique, a d’abord 
été  conçu  comme  une  alternative  au  DSM.  Cependant, 
le RDoC et le DSM sont complémentaires plutôt que mu-
tuellement exclusifs. D’un point de vue historique, cet ar-
ticle soutient que le débat opposant la psychologie et le 
cerveau dans la classification psychiatrique n’est pas nou-
veau et a un air de déjà-vu. Nous revenons aux premières 
classifications  fondées  sur  une  taxonomie  scientifique 
à  la  fin  du  XVIIIe  siècle  avec  Boissier  de  Sauvages,  qui 
étaient censées décrire les maladies, telles qu’elles exis-
taient réellement dans la nature. Emil Kraepelin a associé 
avec succès la psychopathologie et la recherche sur le cer-
veau, préfigurant l’interaction entre le DSM et le RDoC. 
Les symptômes du DSM restent valables parce qu’ils sont 
les  seules  données  qui  sont  immédiatement  et  directe-
ment  observables.  La  science  computationnelle  est  un 
instrument prometteur pour interconnecter les données 
psychopathologiques et neuroscientifiques à l’avenir.
