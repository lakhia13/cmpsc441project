BACKGROUND: The World Health Organization (WHO)
categorizes alcohol consumption according to grams con-
sumed into low-, medium-, high-, and very-high-risk
drinking levels (RDLs). Although abstinence has been
considered the ideal outcome of alcohol treatment, reduc-
tions in WHO RDLs have been proposed as primary out-
comes for alcohol use disorder (AUD) trials.
OBJECTIVE: The current study examines the stability of
WHO RDL reductions and the association between RDL
reductions and long-term functioning for up to 3 years
following treatment.
DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: Secondary data analysis
of patients with AUD enrolled in the COMBINE Study and
Project MATCH, two multi-site, randomized AUD clinical
trials, who were followed for up to 3 years post-treatment
(COMBINE: n = 694; MATCH: n = 806).
MEASURES: Alcohol use was measured via calendar-
based methods. We estimated all models in the total sam-
ple and among participants who did not achieve absti-
nence during treatment.
KEY RESULTS: One-level RDL reductions were achieved
by 84% of patients at the end of treatment, with 84.9% of
those individuals maintaining that reduction at a 3-year
follow-up. Two-level RDL reductions were achieved by
68% of patients at the end of treatment, with 77.7% of
those individuals maintaining that reduction at a 3-year
follow-up. One- and two-level RDL reductions at the end
of treatment were associated with significantly better
mental health, quality of life (including physical quality
of life), and fewer drinking consequences 3 years after
treatment (p < 0.05), as compared to no change or in-
creased drinking.
CONCLUSION: AUD patients can maintain WHO RDL
reductions for up to 3 years after treatment. Patients
who had WHO RDL reductions functioned significantly

INTRODUCTION

Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is highly prevalent and has high
social and economic costs,1 yet most individuals with AUD
never seek treatment.2 A primary reason reported by individ-
uals with AUD for not seeking treatment is that they were not
ready to stop drinking.2 Thus, a commitment to a goal of
abstinence is an extremely high criterion for engaging indi-
viduals in treatment for AUD and determining whether alco-
hol treatment is successful.3 Drinking reductions, short of
abstinence, are associated with considerable improvements
in both health and functioning in general population and
treatment samples.4–9 Broadening the definition of “success”
in AUD treatment to include reduced drinking could decrease
the public health burden of AUD by engaging more individ-
uals in treatment for the disorder,3,10 and would provide more
options for clinicians to offer patients, beyond recommending
abstinence from alcohol.

Defining “Success” in AUD Treatment
The Food and Drug Administration11 recommends sustained
abstinence or no heavy drinking days (defined as more than 3
drinks in a day for women and 4 drinks in a day for men) as
indicators of success for AUD treatment. The European Med-
icines Agency12 (EMA) recommends abstinence, but also
considers reduced drinking as a successful intermediate out-
come. The EMA outcome includes reductions in total alcohol

consumption, heavy drinking days, or World Health Organi-
zation (WHO) risk drinking levels (RDLs),13 which are de-
fined by the number of grams (g) of alcohol consumed per
day, including abstinent (0 g males/females), low risk (1 to
40 g males/1 to 20 g females), medium risk (41 to 60 g males/
21 to 40 g females), high risk (61 to 100 g males/41 to 60 g
females), or very high risk (101+ g males/61+ g females). The
WHO RDLs provide concrete guidance for defining levels of
drinking (see Fig. 1 for daily and weekly US approximate
standard drink equivalents) associated with specific levels of
risk and, relatedly, offer targets for reducing drinking (e.g., a
two-level reduction from very high risk to medium risk).
Recent studies have shown that reductions in WHO RDLs
are associated with improvements in health and functioning
among population samples5,6,8 and individuals in AUD
treatment.4,7,9

Current Study

Abstinence has long been considered a stable outcome for
individuals with AUD,14,15 and numerous studies have
questioned whether “controlled” drinking can be main-
tained.15–17 The debate over whether controlled drinking is
achievable has been considered in the academic literature for
nearly 50 years,18 but concrete guidance has not emerged on
the magnitude of the reduction that is necessary for sustained
health benefits. More recent work has shown that drinking
reductions, as assessed by the WHO RDLs, are often seen over
the first post-treatment year,7 but whether these reductions can
be maintained for longer periods and whether WHO RDL
reductions, short of abstinence, are associated with sustained
improvements in functioning remain unclear. Given the com-
mon perception that individuals with severe AUD have diffi-
culty sustaining reduced drinking,3,19 it is also unknown
whether the severity of AUD at baseline moderates these
effects. To address these gaps in the literature, we examined
whether WHO RDL reductions of at least one level (e.g., very
high to high) or at least two levels (e.g., very high to medium)
can be maintained and whether these reductions in drinking
are associated with long-term improvements in functioning.
We hypothesized that one- and two-level reductions in WHO
RDLs, even among individuals who did not achieve absti-

nence, would be maintained and associated with better mental
health, quality of life, and functioning 3 years following
treatment.

METHODS

Participants and Procedures
We used data from the COMBINE Study20 and the outpatient
sample of Project MATCH,21 two multi-site randomized clin-
ical trials. Participants in the current analyses met criteria for
AUD, received outpatient treatment, and constituted the sub-
group of participants who were followed for up to 3 years
post-treatment (COMBINE: n = 694; MATCH: n = 806). Ex-
clusion criteria for both studies included a current drug use
disorder (other than nicotine or cannabis), a psychiatric disor-
der requiring medication, or an unstable medical condition.

COMBINE Study. Participants in the COMBINE Study (n =
1383) met criteria for alcohol dependence based on the
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders
(DSM) (fourth edition)22 and engaged in heavy drinking prior
to the baseline assessment. Participants were randomized into
one of nine treatment cells and received 16 weeks of treatment
via a 2 × 2 × 2 design with eight of nine cells receiving (1)
active naltrexone (100 mg/day) or placebo naltrexone, (2)
active acamprosate (3000 mg/day) or placebo acamprosate,
and (3) medication management (MM) or combined behav-
ioral intervention (CBI) with MM. The ninth cell received CBI
and no pills.

Follow-up assessments were completed at the end of treat-
ment (16 weeks post-randomization) and at 156 weeks post-
randomization. Of the 1383 participants in the COMBINE
trial, 874 patients from nine sites (n = 1144; 76.4%) consented
to a longer-term follow-up,23,24 of whom 694 (79%) provided
data at the 3-year assessment.

Project MATCH. Participants in the outpatient sample of
Project MATCH (n = 952) met the criteria for alcohol abuse
(4.6%) or alcohol dependence (95.4%) based on the DSM
(third edition-revised)25 and were actively drinking prior to

the baseline assessment. Participants were randomized to
receive 12 weeks of treatment with cognitive behavioral
therapy,26 motivational enhancement therapy,27 or twelve-
step facilitation.28

Follow-up assessments were completed at the end of treat-
ment (12 weeks post-randomization) and at 156 weeks post-
randomization. Of the 952 outpatients in MATCH, 806 pa-
tients (84.7%) completed the 3-year follow-up assessment.

In Project MATCH, drinking consequences were assessed
with the Drinker Inventory of Consequences (DrInC)37 and
psychosocial functioning was assessed using the Psychosocial
Functioning Inventory (PFI).38 The DrInC37 is a 50-item
measure on which higher scores indicate more consequences
(α = 0.97). The PFI38 social behavior subscale includes 10
items that assess the frequency of problematic social behavior
and social interactions. Higher scores on the PFI indicate
better social functioning (α = 0.83).

Measures

Alcohol Dependence Severity. The Alcohol Use Inventory
(AUI)29 was administered as a measure of dependence
severity in MATCH. The Alcohol Dependence Scale
(ADS),30 which is a modified version of the AUI, was
administered in COMBINE. For the current study, we
included the 23 items from the ADS and the AUI that were
overlapping (Supplementary Table 1) assessing alcohol de-
pendence severity in both studies31 (α = 0.85).

Alcohol Consumption. Standard drinks (14 g of absolute
alcohol) were measured using calendar-based methods32,33
to document daily drinking amounts. WHO RDLs (abstinent,
low risk, medium risk, high risk, very high risk) were calcu-
lated based on the average grams of alcohol consumed per day
over 1-month time periods in the month prior to the baseline
assessment, in the month prior to the end of treatment, and in
the month prior to the 3-year follow-up. We then calculated
reductions in RDLs from baseline to the end of treatment
(predictor) and from baseline to the last month of the 3-year
follow-up (outcome), defined by either a one-level reduction
(i.e., reducing from very high to high, high to medium, medi-
um to low, or low to abstinent) or a two-level reduction (i.e.,
reducing from very high to medium, high to low, or medium to
abstinent). A one-level reduction was distinguished from no
change or an increase in the WHO RDL from baseline to the
treatment/follow-up months. A two-level reduction was dis-
tinguished from a one-level reduction, no change, or an in-
crease in the WHO RDL from baseline to the treatment/
follow-up months. The one- and two-level reductions are not
mutually exclusive categories, because anyone who achieved
at least a two-level reduction also achieved a one-level
reduction.

Functioning Outcomes at 3 Years Following Treatment. In
COMBINE, mental health was assessed using the 6-item
mental health subscale from the 12-item Short Form Health
Survey (SF-12),34 with higher scores indicating better mental
health functioning (α = 0.82). Quality of life (QoL) was
assessed by a 25-item version of the WHO QOL-BREF,35 a
measure of general QoL36 that covers physical, psychological,
environmental, and social health domains. Higher scores indi-
cate better QoL.

Statistical Analysis

The primary analyses examined the maintenance of one-level
and two-level WHO RDL reductions and the association be-
tween such WHO RDLs in the last month of treatment and
functioning at the 3-year follow-up. To test the maintenance/
stability of reductions, we examined the association between
WHO RDL reductions achieved in the last month of treatment
(predictor) and WHO RDL reductions achieved at the 3-year
follow-up (outcomes) using logistic regression. Given both stud-
ies provided the same data for the logistic regression, we com-
bined the data from the two studies to obtain a pooled estimate of
the stability of WHO RDL reductions. We used linear regression
to test the associations between WHO RDL reductions from
baseline to the end of treatment (predictors) and functional out-
comes at the 3-year follow-ups (outcomes). Because the two
studies had different functional outcome measures at 3-year
follow-ups, we conducted the linear regression analyses within
each study separately. Unstandardized regression coefficients
from the linear regression models can be interpreted as the
differences in outcomes for patients with, versus without, one-
or two-level RDL reductions, controlling for covariates. We also
examined whether the severity of alcohol dependence at baseline
moderated the relations between RDL reductions and functional
outcomes.

All models were estimated with Mplus version 8.239 using
maximum likelihood with robust estimation to account for
clustering within sites.40 Missing drinking and functional out-
come data at the end of treatment and 3-year follow-up were
accommodated via multiple imputation with 50 imputed
datasets.41 Thus, we included all individuals who completed
the 3-year follow-up assessments for both studies (MATCH
n = 806; COMBINE n = 694). All variables examined in the
current study were included in the imputation models. Con-
sistent with prior analyses in the COMBINE Study data,4,9 we
controlled for the following covariates in all analyses: age, sex,
race, alcohol dependence severity, smoking status, and base-
line WHO RDL.

Non-abstinent Reductions. To evaluate the effect on the
results of individuals with total abstinence, the primary
analyses were repeated with abstainers excluded from the
models.

RESULTS

Descriptive Analyses

Demographic characteristics and descriptive statistics for all
measures from both studies are provided in Table 1. Most
participants (90.3%) were at the medium, high, or very high
RDL at baseline, so a one-level reduction was possible for all
participants and a two-level reduction was possible for nearly
all participants. There were no significant demographic differ-
ences and no significant differences in baseline WHO RDLs
between individuals based on whether they completed the 3-
year follow-up.

Primary Analyses

We used logistic regression to examine the odds of maintain-
ing one- and two-level reductions in WHO RDLs at the 3-year
follow-up. In a pooled analysis of data from both studies,
83.8% and 68.0% achieved at least one-level or two-level
reductions, respectively, at the end of treatment, and 84.9%
and 77.7% of those participants maintained at least one-level
or two-level reductions, respectively, at the 3-year follow-up.
Patients with RDL reductions at the end of treatment had a
significantly higher odds of achieving the RDL reduction at
the 3-year follow-up for both the one-level (OR = 1.74; 95%

CI: 1.59, 1.88; p < 0.001) and the two-level reductions (OR =
1.72; 95% CI: 1.60, 1.85; p < 0.001), indicating an ability to
maintain/sustain the end of treatment RDL reductions at the 3-
year follow-up. The logistic regression models indicated no
significant interaction effects with alcohol dependence sever-
ity in predicting the maintenance of RDL reductions at the 3-
year follow-up (all p > 0.08).

Next, we used linear regression to examine the association
between achieving at least one- and two-level reductions in
WHO RDLs at the end of treatment and functional outcomes
at the 3-year follow-up in each study separately. Full results
from regression analyses are provided in Supplementary
Table 2. Figure 2 shows functional outcomes among those
who did and did not achieve drinking reductions in the last
month of treatment, adjusted for covariates. Achieving at least
a one-level RDL reduction in the last month of treatment,
versus no change or an increase in RDL, was associated at
the 3-year follow-up with significantly better mental health;
greater environmental, social, psychological, and physical
QoL; and significantly fewer drinking consequences; but no
difference in psychosocial functioning. Achieving at least a
two-level RDL reduction in the last month of treatment, versus
a one-level RDL reduction, no change, or an increase in RDL,
was associated with significantly better mental health and

cantly better psychosocial functioning.

The linear regression models indicated significant interac-
tion effects between dependence severity and one- and two-
level RDL reductions in predicting social QoL and between
dependence severity and two-level reductions in predicting
physical QoL (Supplementary Table 2). The interaction effect
showed that reductions in the WHO RDL conferred the
greatest benefits in social and physical QoL at the 3-year
follow-up among individuals higher in dependence severity
at baseline (Fig. 3 panels a–c), perhaps because their quality of
life was lower prior to treatment.

Non-abstinent Drinking Reductions

Next, we re-estimated all models with abstainers excluded
from the analysis (N = 432 for COMBINE and N = 461 for
MATCH). Reductions in WHO RDLs, short of total absti-
nence, in the last month of treatment were significantly asso-
ciated with one- and two-level reductions in WHO RDLs at
the 3-year follow-up. In a pooled analysis of data from both
studies, 73.1% and 54.4% of non-abstainers achieved at least
one-level or two-level reductions, respectively, at the end of
treatment, and 82.6% and 73.0% of those participants main-
tained at least one-level or two-level reductions, respectively,
at the 3-year follow-up (odds of risk drinking reduction at
3 years predicted by risk drinking reduction at end of treat-
ment = 1.70 for a one-level reduction (95% CI: 1.53, 1.87; p
< 0.001) and 1.57 for a two-level reduction (95% CI: 1.41,
1.72; p < 0.001)).

Regression analyses that removed abstainers from the anal-
yses yielded findings similar to the prior analyses (Fig. 2 and
Supplementary Table 2), although the effects on functional
outcomes were smaller and the effects of two-level reductions
on physical QoL and psychosocial functioning were not sig-
nificant with abstainers excluded. There were also significant
interaction effects between dependence severity and one- and
two-level RDL reductions in predicting social QoL, and be-
tween dependence severity and two-level RDL reductions in
predicting mental health (Supplementary Table 2). Non-
abstinent drinking reductions during the last month of treat-
ment conferred the greatest benefits in social QoL and mental
health at the 3-year follow-up for individuals highest in de-
pendence severity (Supplementary Fig. 1 panels a–c).

DISCUSSION

We examined whether reductions in WHO RDLs were main-
tained and associated with improvements in how patients feel
and function, both physically and mentally, up to 3 years
following treatment in two large alcohol clinical trials. The
one- and two-level WHO risk reductions at the end of treat-
ment were largely maintained and were associated with sig-
nificantly better health functioning at up to 3 years following
treatment. A large majority (76–87%) of individuals who
achieved one- or two-level WHO risk reductions by the last
month of treatment maintained those reductions at the 3-year
follow-up. Moreover, individuals who achieved one- or two-
level reductions in WHO RDLs by the last month of treatment
had significantly better mental health and physical QoL and
fewer drinking consequences at the 3-year follow-up than
those who failed to achieve such reductions.

Additional analyses that excluded abstainers and tested
interactions with alcohol dependence severity were largely
consistent with the primary findings, with a few exceptions.
Removing abstainers from the models rendered the effects of a
two-level WHO RDL reduction on physical QoL and psycho-
social functioning non-significant; although the size of the
effects was similar. Participants with the most severe alcohol
dependence had the most to gain in social and physical QoL
and mental health by reducing their drinking during treatment,
even short of full abstinence.

The results from the current study are consistent with recent
studies showing that WHO RDL reductions are maintained for
up to 1 year following treatment7 and significantly associated
with better patient functioning.4,5 The current study extends
these findings by providing evidence that WHO RDL reduc-
tions are maintained for up to 3 years following treatment and
associated with concomitant improvements in functioning.
Consistent with recent reviews on drinking reductions,3,10,42
the current findings indicate that among treatment seekers with
AUD, reductions in drinking are achievable, maintained, and
associated with long-term improvements in functioning.

The current study depended upon available data and the
inclusion/exclusion criteria used in the COMBINE Study and
Project MATCH. Both studies included treatment seekers with
AUD who received some form of AUD treatment (psychoso-
cial or medications) and excluded individuals with a drug use
disorder or severe psychiatric and medical conditions. Wheth-
er these findings would generalize to patients with more or less
severe presentations, to patients with comorbid substance use
or severe psychiatric or medical disorders, or to non-treatment
seekers cannot be determined from the current study. Yet, data
from a large general US adult sample have shown that reduc-
tions in WHO RDLs over a 3-year period correlate with
reduced odds of current alcohol dependence, drug use disor-
ders, depression, and anxiety disorders.5,8,43 Future studies
should recruit more diverse patient populations and extend
the current analyses by examining the maintenance of WHO
RDL reductions in association with more objective markers of

how patients feel and function, including physical health
measures, biomarkers of alcohol consumption and organ func-
tion, medical expenditures, employment data, and functioning
as reported by family/friends.

Consistent with a growing body of findings from other
reports3–5,9,42–44 and clinical guidelines,45–47 our results sug-
gest that reduced drinking, as measured by the WHO RDL
reduction metric, is associated with good clinical outcomes
and can be sustained over time. Some clinicians might prefer
suggesting at least a 1-level reduction for patients, whereas
others might prefer suggesting at least a 2-level reduction. The
current study provides evidence that either recommendation is
likely to be sustained and associated with meaningful im-
provement in how patients feel and function. This information
should be disseminated to inform clinical providers and the
public. The information could encourage individuals with
AUD who are reluctant to participate in abstinence-focused
treatment to set goals with their clinical providers that are short
of abstinence yet capable of providing substantial clinical
benefit.
