Abstract 
Background  Both attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are 
complicated illnesses that sometimes co-occur in children and adults with significant negative influence on a person’s 
life and general well-being.

Aim  This study aims to conduct a systematic review that investigates the comorbidity of PTSD and ADHD in the adult 
population.

Methods  A comprehensive search was conducted across five electronic databases (PsycNET, Cochrane, PubMed, 
Google Scholar, and ClinicalTrials.gov) between October 5 and 20, 2023, using predefined keywords including “ADHD,” 
“PTSD,” and “comorbidity.” Studies were included if they involved adult participants (≥ 18 years) with both ADHD 
and PTSD diagnoses. Two independent reviewers conducted screening and data extraction. No meta-analysis 
was performed due to heterogeneity in study designs. The results were synthesized qualitatively.

Results  Out of 818 identified studies, 21 met the inclusion criteria. Studies reported an increased risk of developing 
PTSD in individuals with ADHD, with the prevalence of comorbidity ranging between 28 and 36%. ADHD in PTSD 
patients was associated with greater psychosocial impairment, more severe PTSD symptoms, and functional difficul-
ties. Treatment approaches, including pharmacotherapy (atomoxetine, Vyvanse) and mindfulness training, showed 
potential benefits for managing comorbid symptoms.

Conclusions  ADHD and PTSD commonly co-occur in adults, leading to more severe clinical outcomes. Early diagno-
sis and effective treatment of ADHD may reduce the risk of developing PTSD. Further research is needed to explore 
the underlying mechanisms and optimal treatment strategies for individuals with ADHD/PTSD comorbidity.

Introduction
Attention-deficit  hyperactivity  disorder  (ADHD)  is  a 
complicated clinical illness that has been difficult to diag-
nose  and  assess.  Between  1  and  20%  of  kids  are  said  to 
have ADHD, according to estimates [14]. Academic chal-
lenges  are  common  in  children  with  ADHD,  and  these 
include  math  underachievement  as  well  as  reading  and 
math  developmental  issues.  Additionally,  they  could  act 
rudely  to  other  students,  be  uncooperative,  and  engage 
in disruptive and inattentive behavior [18]. Despite being 
frequently  linked  to  childhood,  ADHD  can  also  have  an 
impact  on  adults.  Adults  with  ADHD  frequently  strug-
gle  with  issues  related  to  concentration,  impulsivity, 
and  hyperactivity,  which  can  have  a  significant  negative 
effect  on  a  variety  of  aspects  of  their  lives.  They  could 
have trouble staying organized, managing their time, and 
maintaining their attention on assignments. Adults with 
ADHD  may  also  struggle  in  their  relationships,  careers, 
and intellectual endeavors [8].

Post-traumatic  stress  disorder  (PTSD)  is  a  mental 
health  condition  that  can  develop  in  individuals  who 
have  experienced  or  witnessed  a  traumatic  event.  It  is 
distinguished  by  a  variety  of  symptoms  that  linger  after 
the traumatic incident and seriously impair normal func-
tioning [46–48]. Invading thoughts or recollections of the 
event, nightmares, flashbacks, severe emotional discom-
fort,  avoiding  reminders  of  the  incident,  hypervigilance, 
and changes in mood or cognition are all common symp-
toms  of  PTSD.  These  symptoms  can  be  crippling  and 
have  a  significant  negative  influence  on  a  person’s  rela-
tionships, career, and general well-being [23].

A clear link between ADHD and PTSD has been seen 
in recent work. Clinical and epidemiological research has 
repeatedly  demonstrated  a  strong  link  between  PTSD 
and  ADHD  in  adult  populations.  For  instance,  Shura 
et  al.  [40]  observed  that  war  veterans  with  PTSD  were 
more  likely  to  have  ADHD,  indicating  that  ADHD  may 
be a risk factor for the development of PTSD. According 
to  Bolstad,  Lien,  and  Bramness  [11],  adults  with  PTSD 
experienced ADHD symptoms when they were children, 
compared  to  people  without  PTSD.  Furthermore,  there 
was  a  strong  link  between  childhood  ADHD  levels  and 
PTSD  scale  scores.  According  to  Biederman  et  al.  [9], 
the  sample  showed  a  bidirectional  and  significant  risk 
between PTSD and ADHD, demonstrating that bias can-
not account for the link.

The  prevalence  rates  of  ADHD  range  from  1  to  4%  in 
adults  [17].  On  the  other  hand,  psychological  trauma  is 
thought  to  be  prevalent  across  a  range  of  sociodemo-
graphic,  national,  and  cultural  groups,  with  a  preva-
lence  of  33  to  50%.  According  to  research,  people  with 
ADHD  are  more  likely  to  experience  psychological 
stress.  According  to  a  recent  study,  people  with  ADHD 

had a much higher risk of developing PTSD than people 
without the disorder. The rates of psychiatric comorbid-
ity  were  also  greater  in  PTSD  patients  with  ADHD  [44, 
46, 48]. Similar trends have been seen in pediatric stud-
ies, which suggests that PTSD and ADHD are both more 
prone  to  develop  in  young  people.  Youth  with  ADHD 
have  a  significantly  higher  chance  of  developing  PTSD 
than controls without the disease, according to a longitu-
dinal follow-up study of children with ADHD [9].

Significant clinical, scientific, and public health ramifi-
cations result from a greater comprehension of the con-
nection  between  PTSD  and  ADHD.  If  ADHD  makes 
people  more  likely  to  experience  PTSD  following  trau-
matic events, this is important information for clinicians 
who  work  with  children  and  adults  who  have  ADHD. 
Additionally,  it  would  affect  how  comorbid  ADHD  and 
PTSD  clients  are  diagnosed  and  receive  services  [32]. 
Adults  with  ADHD  should  be  regarded  as  a  high-risk 
population for acquiring PTSD given the high frequency 
of  the  disorder  and  its  correlation  with  impulsivity  and 
mishaps.  From  a  scientific  standpoint,  this  information 
might  help  improve  investigations  into  the  underlying 
mechanisms of PTSD connected to ADHD [37].

The  link  between  ADHD  and  PTSD  in  children  has 
been the subject of a sizable body of systematic reviews; 
however,  the  same  cannot  be  stated  for  adults.  The  co-
occurrence,  symptom  profiles,  and  clinical  implications 
of ADHD and PTSD in pediatric populations have been 
the subject of numerous systematic reviews [10, 13, 29]. 
The  lack  of  systematic  studies  focusing  on  this  issue  in 
adults, however, points to a considerable knowledge gap 
in the field today. For thorough evaluation, precise diag-
nosis,  and  efficient  treatment  planning,  it  is  essential  to 
comprehend  how  ADHD  and  PTSD  interact  in  adult 
populations.

The purpose of this review is to improve the knowledge 
of  ADHD/PTSD  comorbidity  in  order  to  offer  crucial 
insights for diagnosis and treatment approaches. The sci-
entific literature that currently exists investigating ADHD 
in adults with PTSD is critically analyzed in this review. 
The  literature  search  and  subsequent  evidence  synthesis 
were guided by the central question: (i) Is there a connec-
tion  between  ADHD  and  PTSD  in  adults?  Additionally, 
the  review  addresses  the  following  research  inquiry  in 
order to fully analyze the evidence: (ii) Does the degree of 
ADHD correlate with how severe PTSD symptoms are?

Aim

The  current  work  aims  to  conduct  a  systematic  review 
that investigates the comorbidity of PTSD and ADHD in 
the  adult  population.  The  review  will  look  at  the  preva-
lence of comorbidity, the clinical traits and symptom pro-
files of people who have both PTSD and ADHD, and how 

Magdi et al. Systematic Reviews           (2025) 14:41

this co-occurring condition affects many aspects of func-
tioning  and  quality  of  life.  This  review  aims  to  increase 
our  knowledge  of  the  connection  between  adult  PTSD 
and  ADHD,  identify  possible  shared  underlying  mecha-
nisms, and highlight the implications for the evaluation, 
diagnosis, and treatment of people with this comorbidity.

Methods
This  systematic  review  followed  the  Preferred  Report-
ing  Items  for  Systematic  reviews  and  Meta-Analyses 
(PRISMA)  guidelines  (Supplement  1)  [35].  The  process 
included the following: (i) developing research questions, 
(ii)  conducting  a  comprehensive  literature  search,  (iii) 
selecting  studies  based  on  predefined  inclusion  criteria, 
(iv)  extracting  relevant  data,  and  (v)  synthesizing  and 
reporting the findings.

Literature search

A  comprehensive  search  was  conducted  across  the  fol-
lowing  electronic  databases:  PsycNET,  Cochrane,  Pub-
Med,  Google  Scholar,  and  ClinicalTrials.gov.  between 
October  5  and  20,  2023.  The  search  aimed  to  identify 
studies  that  reported  on  comorbid  ADHD  and  PTSD 
in  adults.  Keywords  used  in  various  combinations  with 
Boolean  operators  (“AND,”  “OR”)  included  the  follow-
ing:  “Attention  Deficit  Hyperactivity  Disorder,”  “ADHD,” 
“Post-Traumatic  Stress  Disorder,”  “PTSD,”  “comorbidity,” 
“association,” and “relationship.” The search was restricted 
to peer-reviewed articles published in English. Additional 
studies were identified by reviewing the reference lists of 
selected articles. A full search strategy, including the spe-
cific search strings used for each database, is available in 
the supplementary materials (supplement S2).

Study selection

This review covered all research on ADHD/PTSD comor-
bidity, regardless of the publication year. Studies have to 
meet the following requirements in order to be included: 
(i) peer-reviewed journal publication, (ii) original empiri-
cal research reporting, and (iii) publication in English or 
detailed  English  abstract.  The  current  review  employed 
all  papers  which  studied  clients  from  the  adult  popula-
tion  (18  years  old  or  more)  who  had  confirmed  diagno-
sis  or  showing  clinical  symptoms  of  ADHD  and  PTSD. 
Researchers  excluded  studies  that  only  studied  children 
(under 18 years of age). Whenever there was a question 
as to whether a study satisfied the inclusion criteria, the 
researchers reexamined the paper’s title and abstract and 
came to a decision together.

PICO framework

The  systematic  review  was  structured  using  the  PICO 
(population,  intervention,  comparison,  and  outcome) 

framework  to  guide  the  literature  search  and  data 
extraction.

•  Population (P): Adult individuals (aged 18 years and 
older) with confirmed diagnoses of attention-deficit/
hyperactivity  disorder  (ADHD)  and  post-traumatic 
stress disorder (PTSD). Studies focusing on children 
or adolescents under 18 were excluded.

•  Intervention/exposure  (I):  The  presence  of  ADHD 
symptoms or diagnosis in individuals diagnosed with 
PTSD,  assessing  the  impact  on  symptom  severity, 
psychosocial functioning, and quality of life.

•  Comparison (C): Studies comparing individuals with 
comorbid  ADHD/PTSD  to  those  with  only  PTSD, 
only ADHD, or healthy controls without these disor-
ders, if available.

•  Outcomes (O): Primary outcomes included the prev-
alence  and  severity  of  ADHD/PTSD  comorbidity, 
impact  on  psychosocial  and  functional  impairment, 
and  treatment  outcomes  (e.g.,  symptom  reduction, 
quality-of-life 
interventions 
improvement)  using 
such  as  pharmacological  or  non-pharmacological 
therapies.

Data extraction

Data  extraction  was  conducted  using  a  standardized 
form  in  Microsoft  Excel.  Information  was  extracted  on 
the  following  variables:  authors,  title,  publication  year, 
journal,  sample  size,  study  population,  study  design, 
ADHD/PTSD  comorbidity  rates,  key  results,  and  con-
clusions  related  to  the  ADHD/PTSD  comorbidity.  Two 
authors  independently  performed  data  extraction  from 
all  included  studies  to  ensure  consistency  and  accuracy. 
Any  discrepancies  between  the  authors  were  resolved 
through  discussion  and  consensus,  with  a  third  author 
consulted  when  necessary.  This  process  minimized  bias 
and ensured the reliability of the extracted data.

Data sought and handling of missing data

In  this  systematic  review,  the  primary  outcomes  sought 
included the prevalence of comorbid ADHD and  PTSD, 
the severity of symptoms, and the effectiveness of inter-
ventions.  Specifically,  data  were  extracted  on  the  preva-
lence  of  co-occurring  ADHD  and  PTSD,  measured 
through validated diagnostic tools, as well as the severity 
of  both  conditions  using  standardized  symptom  scales. 
Additionally,  functional  impairment,  as  reflected  in  par-
ticipants’  psychosocial  functioning,  was  recorded  where 
available. For treatment outcomes, we sought data on the 
effects  of  both  pharmacological  interventions  and  non-
pharmacological approaches with an emphasis on symp-
tom  reduction  and  improvements  in  quality  of  life.  For 

 Magdi et al. Systematic Reviews           (2025) 14:41 

Page 4 of 14

studies  with  missing  or  unclear  data,  several  strategies 
were employed. In cases where data for certain outcomes 
were  not  reported,  these  outcomes  were  considered 
missing  and  were  excluded  from  the  final  synthesis.  No 
attempts were made to impute missing data.

Data synthesis

A  qualitative  synthesis  was  performed  to  analyze  the 
findings  of  the  included  studies.  Given  the  significant 
heterogeneity  in  study  designs,  sample  populations,  and 
outcome  measures,  a  meta-analysis  was  not  feasible. 
Instead,  we  identified  key  themes  and  patterns  related 
to  ADHD  and  PTSD  comorbidity,  including  the  preva-
lence  of  co-occurrence,  symptom  severity,  psychoso-
cial  impairments,  and  the  effects  of  different  treatment 
approaches.  The  results  were  synthesized  narratively  to 
provide  a  comprehensive  understanding  of  the  relation-
ship between ADHD and PTSD in adult populations.

Critical appraisal

To assess the quality and risk of bias in the included stud-
ies,  a  critical  appraisal  was  performed.  For  randomized 
controlled trials, we used the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool, 
while  the  Newcastle–Ottawa  scale  (NOS)  was  applied 
to  evaluate  observational  studies.  The  appraisal  focused 

on study design, sample size, measurement of outcomes, 
and  control  for  confounding  factors.  Any  discrepancies 
between  reviewers  were  resolved  through  discussion. 
Additionally, the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, 
Assessment,  Development,  and  Evaluations)  framework 
was  employed  to  assess  the  certainty  of  evidence  across 
studies. The  GRADE  evaluation  considered  factors  such 
as  study  limitations,  consistency  of  results,  precision, 
and  risk  of  publication  bias.  The  results  of  this  critical 
appraisal are summarized in Supplement S3.

Results
The search identified 816 articles, of which 810 endured 
after eliminating duplicates. The selection development is 
indicated as a flow chart in Fig. 1 (according to PRISMA). 
The final number of articles included in this review was 
21 articles.

The  studies  included  in  the  review  were  created 
between 2004 and 2024 and has three identified themes: 
(i)  Studies  with  direct  investigation  of  the  comorbid-
ity of ADHD and PTSD in adults (n = 14) [1, 2, 4, 12, 15, 
22, 24, 28, 30–32, 36, 41, 44], (ii) studies with a sample of 
comorbid  ADHD/PTSD  diagnosis  examining  the  effect 
of treatment on the symptoms of both ADHD and PTSD 
(n = 4)  [7,  26,  39,  43],  and  (iii)  studies  investigating  the 

Fig. 1  Flow diagram of the search strategy, modified from Moher et al. (2009). A search across 5 databases turned up a total of 818 items.

relationship  between  ADHD  and  other  psychological 
disorders  including  PTSD  (n = 3)  [27,  34,  38].  Addition-
ally, the results are arranged based on whether bivariate 
analyses  or  more  advanced  analytical  techniques  that 
accounted  for  potential  confounding  variables  in  the 
relationship  between  ADHD  and  CSA  were  used  in  the 
research. See Table 1 for detailed information about the 
listed  research,  and  a  critical  appraisal  of  the  included 
studies’ risk of bias is summarized below and detailed in 
Supplement S3.

Sociodemographic and clinical characteristics

The range of participants for the studies included in the 
review  was  1  in  case  studies  to  79,006  adults  in  large 
national surveys. Of these, 2 studies (9.5%) are case stud-
ies  with  only  1  case  of  comorbid  ADHD/PTSD  diagno-
sis,  3  studies  (14.3%)  included  a  number  of  participants 
smaller  than  100  (with  a  range  between  11  and  44),  14 
studies  (66.7%)  a  number  between  100  and  600  (with  a 
range  between  123  and  551),  and  4  studies  (9.5%)  were 
much  larger,  with  4612  and  2,082,118  participants 
(Table 1).

Germany [32], Turkey [36], and Norway [38]. Two more 
studies  with  a  sample  from  Europe  [41]  and  an  interna-
tional sample were added [12].

In regard to age and gender, 15 studies (71.4%) frankly 
mentioned the age of participants either by range, mean, 
or  median.  The  age  ranges  were  all  between  18  and  68 
years  of  age.  Four  studies  (19%)  either  just  mentioned 
that  their  sample  included  adults  or  participant’s  age 
were  implied  in  the  form  of  them  being  veterans,  army 
personnel,  smokers,  or  university  students  [24,  28,  32, 
44].  For  gender,  while  most  studies  used  a  mixed  gen-
der  approach,  the  two  case  studies  (9.5%)  included  in 
the review had female subjects [7, 26], and three studies 
(14.3%) focused predominantly on male subject [1, 2, 27].
Regarding  subjects’  background,  one  study  (4.8%)  was 
conducted on university students [36], two studies (9.5%) 
used  alcohol-dependent  inpatients  [15,  32],  seven  stud-
ies  (33.3%)  employed  outpatient  clients  and  individuals 
from  the  public  [4,  7,  26,  31,  34,  38,  44],  and  nine  stud-
ies  (42.9%)  focused  principally  on  veterans,  new  army 
recruits, and military personnel on active duty [1, 2, 22, 
24, 27, 28, 30, 39, 43].

Additionally,  concerning  study  location,  all  studies 
were  conducted  in  the  USA  except  for  six  studies  con-
ducted in France [15], Korea [30], Northern Finland [31], 

Moreover,  all  included  studies  had  participants  with 
predetermined  diagnosis  of  either  ADHD,  PTSD,  or 
both or with either one officially diagnosed and the other

condition being assessed against the criteria of the Diag-
nostic  and  Statistical  Manual  of  Psychiatric  Disorders 
(DSM). One study (4.8%) had children participants diag-
nosed with ADHD and their parents who met the crite-
ria for both ADHD and PTSD diagnosis but were not in 
point of fact diagnosed [31]. Two studies (9.5%) included 
the genetic profiles from previous samples [12, 41].

Seven  studies  (33.3%)  refrained  from  mentioning  the 
type  of  trauma  participants  had  [4,  12,  30–32,  39,  41]. 
Other studies included the specific type of trauma partic-
ipants experienced, including the following: Afghanistan 
war started in 2001, Iraq war started in 2003 [1, 2, 22, 24, 
27, 43],sexual and physical assault [7], domestic violence 
[26], the September 11, 2001; attacks on the World Trade 
Center  in  New  York,  USA  [28],  the  Van  earthquake  in 
Van, Turkey, in 2011 [36], and other nonspecific traumas 
[15, 34, 38, 44].

ADHD/PTSD comorbidity

Overall, all studies reported association between ADHD 
and PTSD, either those with an official diagnosis or who 
fit  the  criteria  of  the  DSM  for  either  or  both.  The  rela-
tionship  between  ADHD  and  PTSD  along  with  a  sum-
mary of the noteworthy results for each study is shown in 
Table  2.  On  that  dimension,  authors  divided  the  studies 
included in the review into four dimensions.

 (i)  Studies  examine  the  comorbidity  of  ADHD  in  a 

sample with PTSD (n = 8, 42.1%).

 (ii)  Studies  examine  the  comorbidity  of  PTSD  in  a 

sample with ADHD (n = 4, 21.1%).

 (iii)  Studies  examine  a  sample  with  comorbid  ADHD/

PTSD (n = 5, 26.3%).

 (iv)  Studies examine the genetics behind ADHD/PTSD 

comorbidity (n = 2, 10.5%) (Table 2).

The data from various research were integrated in the 
systematic  review  to  estimate  the  average  comorbidity 
rates of PTSD and ADHD. The current research revealed 
that  the  prevalence  of  ADHD  was  roughly  28%  in  peo-
ple  with  PTSD  and  approximately  36%  in  people  with 
ADHD. These figures show how often the two disorders 
overlap  and  emphasize  how  important  it  is  for  profes-
sionals to check both conditions thoroughly when one is 
diagnosed.

ADHD in a sample with PTSD

Eight studies were found to examine a sample with PTSD 
for symptoms of ADHD. In the study of Adler et al. [2], 
in a sample of veterans (n = 47), researchers found among 
two groups of PTSD (n = 25) and panic disorder (n = 22) 
matching  criteria  for  childhood  ADHD  (36%  vs.  9%) 
and  current  ADHD  (28%  vs.  5%). Those  with  childhood 

ADHD  began  to  exhibit  symptoms  of  ADHD  before 
developing  PTSD,  perhaps  as  a  result  of  the  military-
related nature of their trauma. On the other hand, none 
of  the  PTSD  patients  had  a  history  of  severe  childhood 
trauma. These results offer strong evidence that in com-
parison to patients with panic disorder, those with PTSD 
were  significantly  more  likely  to  have  had  ADHD  as  a 
child.

Furthermore,  the  study  of  Harrington  et  al.  [22] 
(n = 222)  found  that  those  who  matched  the  criteria 
for  current  PTSD  (n = 121,  54.5%)  also  met  the  criteria 
for  current  adult  ADHD  (n = 14,  6.2%).  The  intensity  of 
ADHD  and  the  extent  of  trauma  exposure  were  impor-
tant  indicators  of  the  severity  of  present  PTSD.  As  well 
as  this,  Howlett  et  al.  [24]  uncovered  that  premilitary-
placement  ADHD  was  linked  to  a  higher  risk  of  post 
placement occurrence of PTSD after controlling for other 
risk variables. Also, in the study of Kimbrel et al. [27], the 
sample of male veterans (n = 140), compared to veterans 
without  PTSD  (n = 62,  44.3%)  and  veterans  with  PTSD 
(n = 78,  55.7%),  had  a  considerably  higher  likelihood  of 
reporting symptoms of ADHD (36% vs. 11%).

Knight  et  al.  [28]  (n = 313)  discovered  that  on  trails-
number  sequencing,  veterans  with  both  ADHD  and 
PTSD proceeded noticeably worse than any other group. 
In  comparison  to  other  groups,  veterans  with  PTSD 
alone  (n = 140,  44.6%)  and  with  PTSD/ADHD  (n = 27, 
8.6%)  comorbid  symptoms  reported  much  lower  func-
tional status. Aside from this, another study by Lee et al. 
[30] on new army recruits in Korea (n = 224) showed that 
PTSD  symptoms  during  the  first  week  of  basic  military 
training were significantly predicted by both past (n = 44, 
19.6%) and present (n = 4, 1.8%) ADHD symptoms. After 
5 weeks of basic military training, the first week’s PTSD 
symptoms were also a significant risk factor for develop-
ing PTSD. Considering these results, authors were able to 
confirm the relationships between PTSD symptoms and 
previous and present ADHD symptoms.

In  nonmilitary-base  samples,  the  study  of  Luderer 
et  al.  [32]  is  on  alcohol-dependent  long-term  inpatients 
in Germany (n = 341). Patient’s ADHD diagnosis (n = 66, 
19.4%) had higher frequency of potential traumatic expo-
sure than those without ADHD (88% vs. 65%). They pro-
posed that probabilities of PTSD were greater in patients 
with  ADHD  than  in  patients  without  ADHD.  Addition-
ally,  there  was  a  higher  level  of  functional  impairment 
and  PTSD  severity  among  ADHD  individuals.  Moreo-
ver,  Mitchell  et  al.  [34]  studied  a  public  sample  with 
nonspecific  traumas  (n = 123)  and  found  that  the  group 
of  smokers  with  PTSD  (n = 55,  44.7%)  scored  higher  in 
Conners  Adult  ADHD  Rating  Scale  (CAARS)  and  sig-
nificantly more severe symptoms of DSM-IV inattentive 
(mean ± SD,  11.47 ± 5.76  vs.  5.50 ± 3.79)  and  hyperactive

ADHD  (mean ± SD,  11.31 ± 4.71  vs.  6.82 ± 3.60)  than  the 
group without PTSD (n = 68, 55.3%).

PTSD in a sample with ADHD

Four  studies  investigated  PTSD  in  samples  of  patients 
with ADHD; all of them were nonmilitary-based samples. 
The study of Antshel et al. [4] investigated a sample of the 
public (n = 329) and found that among participants with 
ADHD  (n = 206,  62.6%)  and  without  ADHD  (n = 123, 
37.4%), the prevalence of PTSD was higher in the ADHD 
group  (9.7%  vs.  1.6%).  They  also  confirmed  that  com-
pared  to  control  participants,  adults  with  ADHD  had  a 
considerably  greater  lifetime  incidence  of  PTSD.  Adults 
with co-occurring PTSD and ADHD have higher levels of 
clinical severity when it comes to psychosocial function-
ing and mental comorbidity.

In addition, the study conducted by El Ayoubi et al. [15] 
on clients with alcohol abuse in France (n = 551) revealed 
that  between  case  (n = 109,  19.8%)  and  control  samples 
(n = 442, 80.2%), the incidence of PTSD was higher with 
ADHD  case  sample  (84%  vs.  40%).  When  age,  gender, 
and marital status were considered, the intensity of PTSD 
was  connected  with  symptoms  of  adult  ADHD  and  was 
linked to more traumatic occurrences. As well as this, the 
study  of  Ozdemir  et  al.  [36]  also  studied  a  public  sam-
ple  of  university  students  (n = 317)  and  revealed  a  link 
between  signs  of  ADHD  to  PTSD.  Taking  into  account 
the  multidimensional  relationships  among  dissociation, 
PTSD, and ADHD, symptom overlaps led to strong con-
nections between PTSD and ADHD.

Also, in Peleikis et al. [38]’s study, the outpatient sam-
ple  with  ADHD  in  Norway  (n = 250)  had  subjects  with 
PTSD  (n = 21,  8.4%)  who  have  been  found  to  have  high 
prevalence  of  childhood  trauma  more  than  other  sub-
jects  without  PTSD  (85%  vs.  44%).  These  results  imply 
that  knowledge  of  childhood  and  adolescent  trauma  is 
clinically  significant  among  young  to  middle-aged  adult 
ADHD patients, as prevalence of childhood traumas was 
associated  with  considerable  functional  impairment  and 
a  higher  chance  of  concurrent  panic  disorder,  anxiety 
disorders, PTSD, and two or more comorbid psychiatric 
disorders.

A sample with comorbid ADHD/PTSD

Five  studies  had  participants  with  comorbid  ADHD/
PTSD  diagnosis.  In  the  study  of  Adams  et  al.  [1]  study-
ing combat veterans (n = 160) to consider cue-dependent 
learning  and  response  inhibition  as  behavioral  and  neu-
rocognitive factors underpinning PTSD and ADHD, they 
revealed that the most pronounced were the cue reliance 
effects  in  the  control  and  PTSD + ADHD  groups.  The 
majority  of  indicators  of  inhibitory  functioning,  reac-
tion  time,  and  reaction  time  variability  showed  group 

differences, with PTSD-only and ADHD + PTSD subjects 
showing deficits compared to controls. No matter the cue 
condition,  participants  in  the  ADHD-only  and  PTSD-
only  groups  showed  comparable  percentage  of  inhibi-
tory  failures  to  no-go  trials.  Accordingly,  they  relied  on 
limited power as the reason for the absence of expected 
group differences for the ADHD-only group.

Two studies examined the effect of ADHD medication 
on the symptoms of PTSD in two female cases of comor-
bid ADHD/PTSD diagnosis. Studies of Barreto et al. [7] 
and Kasahara et al. [26] investigated the effect of Vyvanse 
and  atomoxetine,  respectively.  Both  studies  showed 
promising  results  on  the  outcomes  and  the  possibility 
of using psychostimulants off-label to treat PTSD symp-
toms such as anxiety, depression, catastrophic thoughts, 
and quality of life in the case of Vyvanse, and the possi-
bility of atomoxetine to enhance cerebral blood flow and 
chronic discomfort associated with PTSD.

Similarly,  Wang  et  al.  [43]  examined  the  effect  of  ato-
moxetine on a sample of veterans (n = 44) with comorbid 
ADHD/PTSD  diagnosis  and  revealed  that  atomoxetine 
showed a moderate degree of efficacy in treating ADHD 
symptoms  in  veterans  who  also  had  PTSD;  quality-of-
life  assessments  and  PTSD  symptoms  were  unaffected. 
Such  studies  on  medications’  effect  on  both  symptoms 
enhance  the  understanding  of  co-occurrence  of  both 
ADHD  and  PTSD  diagnoses  in  the  light  of  biological 
theories.

Rice  et  al.  [39]  also  investigated  the  effect  of  mindful-
ness  training,  virtual  versus  in  person,  on  a  sample  of 
comorbid ADHD/PTSD diagnosis (n = 133) and revealed 
that  the  in-person  and  virtual  groups’  post-training  lev-
els  of  ADHD  symptoms  decreased  (22.73 ± 19.19  to 
13.47 ± 13.36  and  18.49 ± 18.98  to  14.40 ± 16.56,  respec-
tively),  while  the  control  group  experienced  no  change 
in  symptoms  (8.63 ± 10.14  to  12.12 ± 12.57).  Likewise, 
particularly  for  the  IP  group,  the  data  demonstrated 
significant  and  useful  decreases  in  PTSD  symptoms 
(37.27 ± 17.72 to 32.73 ± 16.47) with no change in the con-
trol  group  (30.15 ± 14.25  to  29.80 ± 14.76). The  research-
ers also expanded the results by merging the two groups 
into  a  unified  mindfulness  training  group.  Attendees  in 
the  training  program  who  had  strong  beginning  symp-
toms of ADHD improved, but the control group did not.

Genetic composition of ADHD and PTSD

The  genetic  foundations  of  the  comorbidity  of  PTSD 
and  ADHD  are  starting  to  become  clearer  according  to 
recent  studies.  The  implications  of  this  comorbidity  are 
profound, necessitating a thorough understanding of the 
interplay  between  these  disorders.  Four  studies  exam-
ined  the  genetics  associated  with  ADHD  and  PTSD.  In 
the  family-based  sample  (n = 630)  of  Lu  et  al.  [31]  who 

Magdi et al. Systematic Reviews           (2025) 14:41 

Page 11 of 14

explored  the  genetic  relationship  for  ADHD  in  families 
(a  child  with  ADHD  and  their  parents),  they  found  the 
CNR1 gene to possibly cause ADHD/PTSD comorbidity. 
While  Wendt  et  al.  [44]  found  that  in  their  population-
based  sibling  comparison  study  (n = 2,082,118)  a  causal 
link between ADHD genetic predisposition and a higher 
incidence  of  PTSD.  They  could  not,  nevertheless,  dis-
cover  any  reliable  links  between  the  risk  of  ADHD  and 
PTSD genetic liability. PTSD was more common in peo-
ple with ADHD diagnoses than in their siblings without 
the  diagnosis.  Their  results  provide  evidence  in  favor  of 
the necessity of treating ADHD patients early and effec-
tively because they have a markedly increased chance of 
developing PTSD in the future.

Moreover, the study of Cao et al. [12] identified signifi-
cant  genetic  overlap  between  ADHD  and  PTSD,  as  well 
as  specific  genetic  loci  contributing  to  their  comorbid-
ity.  Despite  this  overlap,  distinct  genetic  profiles  were 
also  observed,  indicating  that  while  these  disorders 
share some genetic risk factors, they also possess unique 
genetic  components.  Another  recent  evidence  from  a 
study  by  Song  et  al.  [41]  has  provided  deeper  insights 
into  the  genetic  associations  between  ADHD,  ASD,  and 
PTSD.  Their  research  utilized  genetic  correlation  and 
Mendelian randomization analyses to explore these rela-
tionships. They found significant positive genetic correla-
tions between PTSD and both ADHD (r = 0.70) and ASD 
(r = 0.34).  Furthermore,  their  Mendelian  randomization 
analysis  indicated  that  genetic  liabilities  to  ADHD  and 
ASD are associated with an increased risk of developing 
PTSD, with odds ratios of 1.14 and 1.04, respectively.

Certainty of the evidence

The  certainty  of  evidence  for  the  included  studies  was 
evaluated  using  the  GRADE  approach,  which  considers 
factors like study design, risk of bias, consistency, preci-
sion,  and  publication  bias.  Randomized  controlled  trials 
started  with  a  high  certainty  rating,  while  observational 
studies began with a low rating. Adjustments were made 
based on identified study limitations. Key findings on risk 
of bias include the following: low risk of bias, studies with 
well-defined  randomization,  comprehensive  reporting 
(e.g.,  [39,  41]),  and  high  risk  of  bias,  studies  with  small 
sample sizes or insufficient control for confounders (e.g., 
[7]). Overall, most included studies were rated as having 
moderate  certainty  of  evidence.  Variability  in  treatment 
protocols  and  small  sample  sizes  were  common  limita-
tions.  Detailed  risk-of-bias  assessment  is  available  in 
Supplement  S3.  The  GRADE  approach  highlighted  that 
findings on ADHD and PTSD comorbidity were consist-
ent  across  most  studies,  but  some  variability  in  results 
due to differences in study design and participant charac-
teristics impacted overall certainty. Confidence intervals 

for some outcomes were wide, reflecting lower precision. 
No  strong  evidence  of  publication  bias  was  found.  Fur-
ther  research,  especially  larger  randomized  controlled 
trials, is needed to strengthen the evidence and increase 
confidence in the findings.

Discussion
The  present  systematic  review  focuses  on  examin-
ing  the  co-occurrence  of  PTSD  and  ADHD  in  the  adult 
population  by  providing  a  comprehensive  analysis  of 
the existing literature on this comorbidity. The inclusion 
characteristics revealed a consistent, albeit limited, num-
ber of research articles addressing this topic published in 
peer-reviewed  journals.  Nineteen  studies  documented 
this  phenomenon  over  the  past  19  years;  however,  it 
is  worth  noting  that  there  has  been  a  recent  upsurge  in 
interest  regarding  the  relationship  between  ADHD  and 
PTSD.  This  is  exemplified  by  the  fact  that  13  of  these 
studies (n = 13, 68.4%) were published within the last 10 
years  and  8  in  the  last  5  years  (n = 8,  42.1%).  Moreover, 
a substantial proportion of studies utilized a sample with 
PTSD (n = 13, 68.4%) who were mostly veterans and mili-
tary personnel (n = 9, 47.4%). The focus on males in some 
studies were attributed to the genetic differences and lia-
bility, which were well-established in the case of ADHD 
[5].

The majority of studies (n = 17, 89.5%) identified a sig-
nificant correlation between PTSD and ADHD or symp-
toms of one with the other. Despite the well-established 
high  rates  of  co-occurrence  between  ADHD  and  PTSD 
in children [42], two studies (n = 2, 10.5%) did not report 
a  significant  association.  To  explore  potential  reasons 
for  the  lack  of  significance  in  the  remaining  studies, 
one  possible  explanation  could  be  the  insufficient  sta-
tistical  power  of  the  studies  for  the  various  tests  in  one 
study  and  no  effect  of  atomoxetine  on  patients  with  co-
diagnosis  in  the  other.  Atomoxetine’s  selective  effective-
ness on ADHD symptoms may be explained by its mode 
of  action,  which  mainly  affects  noradrenergic  pathways 
linked  to  attention  and  impulse  control  without  signifi-
cantly  altering  the  complex  brain  networks  responsible 
for PTSD symptomatology.

Crucially, research on the risk of PTSD in people with 
ADHD  has  consistently  demonstrated  that  people  with 
ADHD  have  a  markedly  increased  risk  of  getting  PTSD. 
This  detection  implies  that  a  higher  rate  of  exposure  to 
traumatic events in this group is not the only reason why 
people  with  ADHD  have  an  elevated  risk  of  developing 
PTSD. Additionally, compared to controls who had expe-
rienced  equal  degrees  of  stress,  those  with  PTSD  had  a 
twofold increased risk of ADHD [44]. This suggests that 
the  increased  prevalence  of  ADHD  in  PTSD  not  only 
is  a  result  of  exposure  to  trauma  but  also  linked  to  the 

 Magdi et al. Systematic Reviews           (2025) 14:41 

Page 12 of 14

presence  of  PTSD  itself.  The  finding  that  the  onset  of 
ADHD was consistently earlier than the commencement 
of  PTSD  in  studies  assessing  the  temporality  of  the  two 
diseases  supports  the  concept  that  ADHD  is  a  prede-
cessor  risk  factor  for  PTSD  [29],  even  though  statistical 
relationship  does  not  suggest  interconnection.  Together, 
these results show that while trauma exposure may be a 
necessary component, it is not sufficient to fully explain 
the relationship between PTSD and ADHD.

Mutually, most of studies examined in this review indi-
cate  that  ADHD  is  prevalent  among  individuals  with 
PTSD  and  appears  to  be  associated  with  more  severe 
PTSD symptoms. There was an association between not 
only  ADHD  and  PTSD  symptomatology  seen  in  objec-
tive  neuropsychological  testing  but  also  PTSD  patients 
self-reported  this  relationship.  As  a  result,  it  seems  that 
PTSD  sufferers  with  ADHD  both  subjectively  perceive 
and  objectively  assess  the  condition.  When  investigat-
ing attention problems in individuals with PTSD, current 
research  mostly  highlights  particular  forms  of  atten-
tion  based  on  the  different  elements  of  attention,  such 
as  divided,  selective,  focused,  and  alternating  attention 
[16,  20,  45].  Studies  on  ADHD  in  PTSD  must  carefully 
address the various types of criteria of ADHD relying on 
different assessment tests and distinguish between these 
aspects  in  order  to  fully  understand  the  specific  deficits 
and  their  implications  for  PTSD  symptomatology,  given 
the diversity of features of ADHD diagnostic component 
and their involvement in various functional-connectivity 
networks at the neuroscientific level.

Prior studies have indicated that trauma is linked to the 
emergence  of  ADHD,  or  that  ADHD  may  play  a  role  in 
a person’s susceptibility to developing PTSD. These theo-
ries, however, are mostly based on research showing that 
people with ADHD have an increased chance of acquir-
ing  PTSD  [3],  and  that  those  with  PTSD  have  higher 
levels of (childhood) ADHD [33]. However, it is possible 
that  there  is  additional  complexity  to  the  co-occurrence 
of these two disorders. Adults with PTSD may receive a 
diagnosis  of  ADHD,  particularly  when  they  exhibit  pro-
nounced hyperarousal symptoms that include significant 
attentional  difficulties.  Research  has  shown  that  poor 
sustained attention is not unique to ADHD and can also 
be shown in a number of other mental illnesses, includ-
ing  PTSD  [25].  Thus,  by  early  detection  and  treating 
ADHD,  there  is  a  chance  that  symptoms  and  affective 
elements of PTSD may be lessened. It is imperative that 
future research explore these concepts further, especially 
in relation to PTSD, given the hypothesized relationship 
between the intensity of PTSD symptoms and ADHD.

Regarding  genetics,  studies  investigating  medication 
and  therapy  effect  of  patients  with  comorbid  ADHD/
PTSD  along  with  other  studies  suggesting  genetic 

predisposition  in  co-occurring  diagnosis  can  be  used 
as  evidence  of  genetic  association  between  ADHD  and 
PTSD.  Recent  findings  from  preclinical  studies,  neu-
roimaging  research,  and  genetic  investigations  have 
started  to  shed  light  on  the  underlying  factors  contrib-
uting  to  the  vulnerability  to  PTSD  in  individuals  with 
ADHD.  In  a  Finnish  study,  it  has  been  observed  that 
nicotine  exposure  leads  to  ADHD  characteristics  in  off-
spring, which is also impaired in individuals with PTSD 
[21].  This  suggests  a  potential  link  between  ADHD  and 
PTSD  vulnerability  and  raise  the  possibility  that  spe-
cific  neural  circuits  affected  in  ADHD  may  contribute 
to an increased susceptibility to both ADHD and PTSD. 
Genetic  factors  may  also  play  a  role  in  explaining  the 
association  between  ADHD  and  PTSD.  Both  disorders 
have  a  heritable  component,  and  genome-wide  studies 
have revealed significant shared genetic variations among 
various  psychiatric  disorders  [6].  ADHD  and  PTSD  also 
share  specific  genetic  risk  factors,  such  as  variations  in 
the  dopamine  transporter  gene’s  3′-untranslated  region 
and the cannabinoid receptor gene [19].

Importantly, genetic studies did not find evidence that 
genetic  liability  to  PTSD  increases  the  risk  of  ADHD 
or  ASD.  Findings  suggest  that  ADHD  may  predispose 
individuals  to  PTSD,  highlighting  the  importance  of 
early  intervention  and  tailored  treatment  strategies  for 
individuals  with  these  neurodevelopmental  disorders. 
Such findings underscore the importance of considering 
genetic factors in the diagnosis and treatment of comor-
bid ADHD and PTSD. Further research is needed to fully 
understand the clinical implications of the shared genetic 
and  neurobiological  foundations  of  ADHD  and  PTSD. 
These  studies  may  aid  in  the  identification  of  brain  cir-
cuits that are susceptible to damage, which may guide the 
creation of PTSD prevention and treatment plans.

Conclusion
In  conclusion,  the  evaluated  studies  consistently  show 
a  strong  correlation  and  possible  genetic  properties 
between PTSD and ADHD. The results show that people 
with  PTSD  are  more  likely  to  have  experienced  signs  of 
ADHD as children. Furthermore, higher degrees of func-
tional impairment, greater psychosocial impairment, and 
more severe PTSD symptoms are all linked to the exist-
ence  of  ADHD  in  PTSD  patients.  Reducing  the  chance 
of acquiring PTSD later in life may require early and effi-
cient treatment of ADHD. Moreover, a higher frequency 
of  childhood  trauma  and  a  higher  chance  of  acquiring 
multiple  comorbid  psychiatric  disorders  are  also  associ-
ated  with  the  co-occurrence  of  ADHD  and  PTSD.  For 
those  with  co-occurring  PTSD  and  ADHD,  treatment 
approaches  like  mindfulness  training  and  medication

(atomoxetine  and  Vyvanse)  show  promise  in  symptom 
reduction and quality-of-life enhancement.

Limitations

However,  our  review  does  have  certain  limitations.  There 
is  always  a  chance  that  some  studies  will  be  unintention-
ally missed due to database selection, search strategy limi-
tations, or screening process errors, even with best efforts 
to  include  all  pertinent  studies  (using  major  databases 
and  having  proper  search  strategy).  Furthermore,  authors 
were unable to perform a meta-analysis, look at significant 
moderators,  or  determine  the  strength  of  the  connection 
between ADHD and PTSD due to the heterogeneity of the 
included studies’ measurements, samples, and designs.
