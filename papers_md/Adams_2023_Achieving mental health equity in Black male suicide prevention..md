Despite a steady decrease in suicide rates in the United States, the rate among
Black males has increased in recent decades. Moreover, suicide is now positioned
as the third leading cause of death in this population, signaling a public health crisis.
Enhancing the ability for future suicide prevention scholars to fully characterize
and intervene on suicide risk factors is an emerging health equity priority, yet
there is little empirical evidence to robustly investigate the alarming trends in Black
male suicide. We present fundamental areas of expansion in suicide prevention
research focused on establishing culturally responsive strategies to achieve mental
health equity. Notably, we identify gaps in existing research and offer future
recommendation to reduce suicide death among Black males. Our perspective
aims to present important and innovative solutions for ensuring the inclusion of
Black males in need of suicide prevention and intervention efforts.

Introduction

The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) report that suicide is now the third leading
cause of death for Black male adolescents and young adults. The crisis of suicide among
Black Americans is inherently gendered, with Black boys and men accounting for the vast
majority (81%) of completed suicides in this population (1). A recent study revealed that, in
the past two decades, suicide attempts rose by 73% between for Black adolescents (boy and
girls), while injury by attempt increased by 122% for Black adolescent boys (2). Moreover, in
this same time span, rates of suicide death among Black men increased by 25.3%, signaling
a public health crisis for this population (1). These alarming suicide trends warrant more
eﬀective understandings of the cumulative phenomena that Black boys and men, herein
referred to as Black males, face throughout the lifecourse.

This crisis has recently garnered growing national recognition as a public health priority
facing Black males, as evidenced by the recent eﬀorts by the National Institutes of Health and
the 2018 report from the Emergency Task Force on Black Youth Suicide and Mental Health
(3, 4). These calls to action highlight the need for unique direction to address suicide among
Black males through preventive approaches. Yet, the suicide prevention ﬁeld has often
overlooked this population in past eﬀorts and targeted approaches to curtail fatal (death by
suicide) and non-fatal (suicidal thoughts and behavior-STBs) outcomes (5–9). To advance
scientiﬁc contributions toward equitable solutions for suicide prevention, researchers must
incorporate the diverse perspectives of Black males.

Given that the life expectancy for Black males is among the
lowest of all racial and ethnic and gender groups (10), obtaining
more robust indicators of risk among Black males is an important
public health objective and a critical ﬁrst step toward reducing
suicide. To that end, the goal of our perspective is 2-fold. First,
we identify critical research gaps in conducting suicide prevention
research with Black males, an underrepresented demographic
in prevention science. Next, we oﬀer recommendations
to
advance the ﬁeld of suicide prevention to more equitably beneﬁt
Black males.

Knowledge gaps in understanding
suicide prevention for Black males

Much of the extant research investigating suicidality has been
conducted among persons of European descent, thus masking
the unique population-level risk factors that are present for this
population (11). When Black males are included in research
studies focusing on suicide, their numbers are usually small
and are oftentimes compared to White, middle-class participants
in assessing suicidal risk and protection. In these comparisons,
assumptions, values, and methodologies used for interpreting
results are generalized to Black Americans without attention to
diﬀerences in culture, gender norms, and sociocultural realities that
may inﬂuence risk. Thus, creating equitable strategies to better
inform structural and cultural factors related to the increased risk
of suicide among Black males is a critical need in the ﬁeld of
suicide prevention.

In order to fully contextualize pathways to suicide prevention
for Black males,
researchers much ﬁrst contend with the
detrimental role of racism. Racism is a multilevel construct
that encompasses all aspects of society and results in the
diminished availability of resources to support wellbeing. This
marked disadvantage has an inﬂuence on health outcomes, with
racialized populations consistently demonstrating shorter lifespans
and poorer physical and mental health than their advantaged
counterparts (12, 13). As an organized system of oppression, racism
exists and operates synergistically at multiple levels, including the
level (14,
interpersonal, community, and societal or structural
15). To this end, structural racism encompasses the “totality of
ways in which multiple systems and institutions interact to assert
racist policies, practices, and beliefs about people in a racialized
group” (16).

Despite recent advancements in the study and measurement
of structural racism in the lives of Black Americans (13, 16,
its application in suicide prevention research remains in
17),
its infancy. Certainly, structural racism is both an acute and
chronic presence in the lives of Black males, resulting in
unintended consequences on their mental wellbeing. A recent
systematic review, conducted by Addison et al. (18), highlighted the
interplay of structural racism and mental health outcomes among
Black men who have experienced incarceration, with signiﬁcant
associations between past incarceration history and poor mental
health, including higher levels of psychological distress, increased
severity of depressive and PTSD symptoms, and delayed mental
health treatment. By positioning structural racism as a central
determinant of suicide risk for Black males, researchers may

be more equipped to consider inventive solutions to determine
understand and mitigate psychological distress in the context of
pervasive racialized experiences.

A recent review, conducted by Kiara Alvarez et al., highlighted
the need for a multi-sector approach in suicide prevention
and identiﬁed settings in which structural racism may permeate
and exacerbate mental wellbeing,
including outpatient mental
health settings, schools, and crisis response interventions (e.g.,
the intersection of law enforcement, emergency services, and
inpatient psychiatric settings) (19). The interplay of multi-level
exposures of racism across sectors may ultimately thwart existing
suicide prevention eﬀorts, particularly in the healthcare setting.
Incidentally, the barriers that presently exist in the healthcare
system as a result of structural racism ultimately result in lower
utilization of mental health services for Black males in need
of mental health services (18, 20, 21). Experiences of racism
at the structural and interpersonal level that are embedded in
healthcare settings also limit the motivation for Black males to
view this system as a supportive environment when experiencing
mental health crisis (22–25). The systemic challenges that limit
Black males’ ability to seek adequate mental health care in the
moments leading up to crisis create limitations in the utility
of electronic health record (EHR) and medical claims data as
a primary method of health information for suicide prevention
among Black males.

Lack of uniformity of these data sources also obscure reliable
information on the social determinants that precede mental
health challenges. Outside of research participation, the health
and safety of Black males who elect to participate in studies
focused on their mental wellbeing is of paramount importance.
In considering this population and the frequent racialized threats
that encompass their lived experiences, the nature of mental
health crisis support
itself must be re-examined to provide
inclusive safety considerations for Black males at high risk
of suicide.
the
criminal
justice system and police involvement has resulted
in a disproportionate amount of state-sanctioned violence and
racialized trauma (26–29). These experiences have a direct
inﬂuence on the mental wellbeing of communities where Black
males reside (18, 26).

Indeed for Black males,

Recommendations to support equity
in Black male suicide prevention

The current landscape of suicide prevention research is primed
for novel approaches to ensure that Black males live to their fullest
potential. Accordingly, by noting evidentiary gaps, we can prioritize
areas of targeted opportunity for future initiatives to support Black
males in crisis. Although the need for innovative solutions to
curtail Black male suicide is clear (3, 4, 30), systematic eﬀorts
are lacking that address the challenges researchers experience in
achieving equitable solutions to reduce suicide outcomes. Our
recommendations below serve as a pioneering eﬀort to highlight
the future needs of the ﬁeld to address the rising rates of suicide
among Black males.

Recommendation #1: Prioritize funding
and strategic frameworks centered on
Black male suicide prevention

The current shortage of scholars in the ﬁeld focused on Black
male suicide may also yield limited research on the topic itself.
Notably, Black researchers who may be more inclined to address
such topics are less likely to receive funding from federally funded
organizations (31, 32). A recent strategic framework to address
youth mental health disparities was recently launched by the
National Institute on Mental Health (NIMH), in coordination with
other NIH institutes, with the goal of advancing evidence that can
inform the reduction of mental health disparities among youth
(ages 24 and younger) in the next decade (33). A promise of this
emerging initiative is embedded in its goals of addressing known
knowledge gaps, expanding research opportunities, extending and
supporting stakeholder engagement, and the growth of future
scholars in the youth mental health disparities workforce. In
concert with these recent funding initiatives, additional examples
of priority setting and sponsorship attributed to enhancing research
on Black male suicide from both advocacy and government
stakeholders are warranted.

The paucity of available literature on Black male suicide
prevention also demonstrates the need for more research to
establish conclusive linkages that catalyze suicidal thoughts and
behaviors in this vulnerable population. As evidenced by the
Congressional Black Caucus’ recent Emergency Task Force Report
(4), there are additional protective factors that could be explored
including familial support, religious and
in future research,
spiritual engagement, community and social support, personal,
and structural factors (e.g., stable family housing, income and
employment). Emphasizing the role of these factors for Black
males should be speciﬁcally prioritized in future research initiatives.
By clarifying risk and protective factors for suicide among Black
males, researchers, policy makers, and other key stakeholders
will have key evidence to develop more culturally informed
preventive approaches.

Recommendation #2: Address innovative
solutions to maintain continuity of care for
Black males in the healthcare sector

The healthcare sector is a vital institution for characterizing
and treating emerging psychiatric distress and subsequent suicidal
thoughts and behaviors. Yet, Black males often lose contact with
health care services following the utilization of emergency services
for suicide (34, 35). Thus, the need for equitable continuity of
care following discharge from the hospital for a mental health
crisis is critical. Advances in smartphone-based technologies
may provide one such opportunity to enhance continuity of
services and therapeutic support, post-discharge with the use
of experience sampling assessments (e.g., ecological momentary
assessments, EMA) (36, 37). These approaches can be culturally
tailored and targeted tp Black males to enhance real-time pathways
of identifying acute crisis and delivering brief interventions in

the development and
the community setting (38). To date,
implementation of such approaches among Black males at high
risk of suicide is limited and necessitates directed funding in the
development of such smartphone-based adaptive interventions to
support this population in times of crisis.

Enhancing brief interventions that leverage smartphones to
support Black males in real-time may also support the therapeutic
alliance with the healthcare setting. Research suggests that Black
Americans are the most active mobile phone users in the
United States, adopting and using smartphones at much higher
rates than other racial and ethnic groups. Additionally, 67% of
Black Americans have used their phone in the past year to seek
health information, compared to 58% of White respondents (39,
40). Future studies should investigate the suitability of smartphones
and other mobile devices (e.g., smartwatches, activity trackers)
to deliver supportive messages and support continuity of care
following a suicide attempt.

Recommendation #3: Enhance research
approaches to better capture the
heterogeneity of Black males in suicide
research

A critical extension of current literature requires a within-
group focus on the unique risk factors that inﬂuence suicide risk
among Black males (41). To investigate unique risk and protective
factors for Black males further, inclusion of validated measures
of racism at the structural and interpersonal level in future data
collection eﬀorts is needed (17). Indeed, although measurement
of structural racism is still rapidly developing, researchers should
consider the inclusion of such measures as well as other macro-
level indicators of structural disadvantage, such as racial residential
segregation, criminal justice involvement, and access to quality
health services.

Our recent data on suicide increases among Black Americans
have largely positioned Black males as a homogenous group.
This sampling decision across studies has the potential to omit
the diverse African diasporic communities that are present in
the United States. By expanding study samples to account for
heterogeneity in the Black male suicide experience (42), researchers
have the potential to translate evidence-based research to support
populations most at risk of experiencing mental health crises,
including but not limited to nativity, ethnicity, sexual orientation,
and gender identity.

Recommendation #4: Leverage
advancements in crisis support hotlines and
safety planning to better serve Black males

With the recent national implementation of the 988 Suicide and
Crisis Lifeline, there are more opportunities to reach Black males
in crisis and connect them to timely care. Thus, it is imperative
that these initiatives also prioritize enhancing the diversity of the

counseling workforce to better serve the emergent needs of Black
males that may rely on this resource. Moreover, the occupational
composition of such crisis teams should be carefully considered to
ensure that resulting responses do not further place Black males at
risk of criminal justice involvement or state-sanctioned violence by
police oﬃcers.

In many instances of mental health crises there is an emergent,
but ultimately unmet, need that occurs when armed police
encounter Black males. The potential harm of such interactions
outweighs the beneﬁt when considering mental health crisis
support care for Black males. Safety planning interventions oﬀer
a promising approach to identify resources for psychiatric crisis
before it occurs (43, 44). Future work in reﬁning safety planning
interventions should incorporate resources that include trained
mental health counselors and avert police or criminal
justice
involvement in the immediate outreach for mental health support
in times of crisis (45).

Recommendation #5: Place community
stakeholders at the forefront of
solution-driven suicide prevention research

Finally, community stakeholders are critical in ensuring the
mental wellbeing of Black males at risk of suicide. To this end,
placing community leaders in the driver’s seat of suicide prevention
eﬀorts is a natural next step in enhancing trust in prevention
eﬀorts and reducing cultural stigma related to mental health help-
seeking for Black males. These engaged eﬀorts will center the
needs of Black males and move beyond comparative models in the
development of future suicide prevention interventions. Guided
by participatory practices that ensure a co-learning structure
between researchers and community, these partnerships will have
a more sustainable approach for identifying and dismantling
pathways in which structural racism limits opportunities for
Black males
to thrive. Targeting areas where Black males
live, work, and play, such as gyms, churches, barbershops,
to participate
and outdoor activity spaces may bolster trust
in suicide prevention eﬀorts. Consequentially, eliciting the
direct perspectives of Black males at risk for suicide using
qualitative and engaged approaches may be critical early step
in understanding targeted areas of improvement and reducing
mistrust in research participation.

Community-based involvement would require an intentional
approach to maintain successful partnerships over time and
maintain contact with research participants beyond the duration
of the study. In previous studies, these approaches have included
directed follow-up communication via calls or email, home visits,
or holiday or birthday notes (46). For Black males at risk of suicide,
these outreach eﬀorts may also include caring and supportive
communication to maintain a supportive relationship with the
research participant over time. Indeed, research has identiﬁed
brief caring contacts as an understudied but eﬀective approach
in maintaining social connectedness with individuals at high risk
for suicide (47). This approach is especially critical in longitudinal
studies, where maintained connection between researchers and
participants becomes a measurable goal.

Conclusion

Our perspective highlights key gaps in our understanding
of Black male suicide and oﬀers preliminary recommendations
to engage stakeholders in action-oriented advancement in the
ﬁeld of suicide prevention. Consistent with ongoing eﬀorts that
highlight the alarming rates of suicide in the Black community
(4, 8, 48), we oﬀer innovative and evidence-based approaches to
progress equitable suicide prevention eﬀorts. Formal integration
of structural racism within the suicide prevention framework is
crucial and will bring much needed clarity to bolster public health
eﬀorts that comprehensively assesses the etiology of suicide. Our
recommendations also support a more nuanced understanding of
the guiding forces that contribute to suicide among Black males
and may ultimately provide insight on targetable areas of future
intervention. By providing a uniﬁed, multi-sector approach to
addressing these complex social challenges, future scholars in the
ﬁeld will the ability to further cultivate and sustain the mental
wellbeing of Black males.
