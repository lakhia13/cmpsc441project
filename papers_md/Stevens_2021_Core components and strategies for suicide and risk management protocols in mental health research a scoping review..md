Abstract

Background: Suicide and risk management protocols in mental health research aim to ensure patient safety,
provide vital information on how to assess suicidal ideation, manage risk, and respond to unexpected and expected
situations. However, there is a lack of literature that identifies specific components and strategies to include in
suicide and risk management protocols (SRMPs) for mental health research. The goal of this scoping review was to
review academic and grey literature to determine core components and associated strategies, which can be used
to inform SRMPs in mental health research.
Methods and analysis: The methodological framework outlined by Arksey and O’Malley was used for this scoping
review. The search strategy, conducted by a medical librarian, was multidisciplinary and included seven databases.
Two reviewers independently assessed eligibility criteria in each document and used a standardized charting form
to extract relevant data. The extracted data were then examined using qualitative content analysis. Specifically,
summative content analysis was used to identify the core components and strategies used in SRMPs. The data
synthesis process was iterative.

Results: This review included 36 documents, specifically 22 peer-reviewed articles and 14 documents from the grey
literature. Five core components of SRMPs emerged from the reviewed literature including: training; educational
resources for research staff; educational resources for research participants; risk assessment and management
strategies; and clinical and research oversight. Potentials strategies for risk mitigation within each of the core
components are outlined.
Conclusions: The five core components and associated strategies for inclusion in SRMPs will assist mental health
researchers in conducting research safely and rigorously. Findings can inform the development of SRMPs and how
to tailor them across various research contexts.

Background
Suicide and risk management protocols (SRMPs)
in
mental health research “document procedures for identi-
fication of, and care for, suicidal participants within the
context of a research study” ([1], p.2).
Importantly,
SRMPs also aid in ensuring patient safety, provide vital
information on how to assess suicidal ideation and man-
age other types of risk, and respond to adverse events [2,
3]. Mental health researchers and their research staff
may need to intervene in risk situations such as suicidal
ideation, and disclosing of harm to self and/or others
interviews. Without
during
broader guidelines on how to prepare for, and manage
risk, within mental health research protocols, both re-
searchers and Research Ethics Boards (REBs) may strug-
gle with creating individualized SRMPs that meet the
needs of study participants. While it is necessary to
tailor these standardized procedures for suicide and risk
management
to local clinical and research contexts,
study populations and study-specific needs, researchers
would benefit from evidence-informed guidelines that
specify the core components of a SRMP and guide re-
searchers [1].

research visits

and/or

Researchers communicate a study’s alignment with na-
tional and international safety and ethical standards
through the development of SRMPs. These protocols
should be consistent with the content of the Inter-
national Conference on Harmonization who developed
the Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice [4]. Widely
recognized and used in clinical trials, standardized pro-
tocols describe safe practices to: (a) develop consistency
within research teams; (b) identify roles and responsibil-
ities during specific events; and (c) promote the smooth
functioning of the day-to-day activities of research pro-
jects [5]. There is a multiplicity of terms in the literature
that refer to SRMPs including standard operating proce-
dures (SOPs), safety protocols, crisis protocols, and
safety management procedures, among others. To ad-
dress this inconsistency in terminology and be inclusive
of suicide risk and other types of risk, we will use the
term SRMP throughout this review.

It is important to acknowledge that the risk of suicide
may require intervention as a part of the SRMP, and
participants may require a clinical intervention [2]. This
unknown and controversial territory of risk for partici-
pants can lead to a complex and ambiguous REB review
process that can precipitate confusion between REBs
and researchers. To assist research teams in navigating
the REB review process, there has been some literature
addressing effective ways to communicate potential risks
in mental health research using SRMPs [3, 6]. However,
according to Schatten et al. [2], there is substantial vari-
ability in the identification and management of suicide
risk amongst different studies. For individual researchers

and their ethics committees, decision-making is typically

on

There have been significant collaborative efforts to
standardize REB processes across different countries
around the world. In the United Kingdom, Research Ethics
Services is the governing body that ensures standardization
of ethical research practices across all established research
committees. This includes establishment of a United
Kingdom-wide set of SOPs and providing operational
guidelines [7]. In Australia, the ‘national statement’ has
been developed by health and research organizations within
the country that defines regulations for ethical practices
and thus, assures standardization across research bodies
[8]. Similar to Australia, organizations such as the Food and
Drug Administration in the United States have developed
regulations as well as non-binding recommendations re-
garding ethical practices for institutions and Institutional
Research Boards [9]. In Canada, through open access, the
Canadian Association of Research Ethics Boards and Net-
work of Networks provide collaboratively developed, stan-
dardized, Canadian REB SOPs [10]. These standardized
procedures are specific to health sciences REBs and aim to
encourage the maintenance of a single universal standard
for REBs. Such efforts are in response to reported variations
among REBs in assessing the same clinical research proto-
col [11–13]. In some cases, there were no requirements
outlined by a REB for researchers to implement a SRMP.
Thus, once a study has received REB approval, it is at the
discretion of research teams to develop relevant SRMPs for
mitigating risk and prioritizing the safety of research partic-
ipants. This activity is particularly important where there is
including studies where the
a real or perceived risk,
population may be at higher risk of self-harm or sui-
cidal ideation, or death from suicide [14, 15]. Having
standardized expectations for the content of SRMPs
interest of researchers,
across REBs is in the best
REBs, and research participants [16]. Yet, a prelimin-
ary review of the literature revealed a lack of studies
that identified specific components and strategies to
include in SRMPs for mental health research where
there is a risk of suicide and harm to self and others.
To address this knowledge gap, a scoping review was
conducted on SRMPs, used in mental health research
documents that assess and manage risk and safety for re-
search participants. The objective of this review was to
identify (a) core components and (b) strategies of SRMPs
to assess and manage the risk and safety of participants
in mental health research. The findings will be used to
investigate, review, and inform the development of rec-
ommended guidelines that clinicians, researchers, REBs,
and academics can adopt when developing SRMPs for
their mental health research studies where there is a risk
of harm.

Methods / analysis
A scoping review was conducted to identify key gaps in
the literature and broadly scope existing scientific and
grey literature to provide a greater understanding of key
constructs in this area of research [17]. The scoping re-
view protocol followed the methodological framework
outlined by Arksey and O’Malley [18]. This five-stage
approach is described below. To ensure transparency
and methodological rigour throughout this scoping re-
view,
followed the Preferred Reporting
Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses exten-
sion for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) checklist [19].

this protocol

Stage 1: identifying the Research question
The following research question was the foundation for
this scoping review:

1. What are the (a) core components and (b)

strategies of SRMPs to assess and manage the risk
and safety of adult (> 16 years of age) participants in
mental health research?

Fixsen et al. [20] define core components as “the most
essential and indispensable components of an implemen-
tation practice or program” (p.24). This definition which
was utilized by Cleverley et al. [21] in a recent mental
health scoping review will also be used to define core
components and strategies in this scoping review.

Stage 2: identifying relevant documents
Eligibility criteria
All research studies (experimental, quasi-experimental,
observational, qualitative) and grey literature (standard
operating procedures, guidelines, narrative reviews, con-
ference papers and proceedings, government reports,
community agency/group reports, editorials, policy doc-
uments, theses) examining protocols in mental health re-
search for risk and safety assessment and management
were included. We did not restrict studies based on pub-
lication date or study design. The population was re-
stricted to those aged 16 years and up, to make the
important distinction between mental health research
studies involving children and adults. Due to time con-
straints and financial resources, we also restricted the
language of studies to English. Eligible studies and docu-
ments were specific to mental health and included the
broad term ‘standard operating procedure’ or a syn-
onymously related concept (e.g., SRMP, crisis protocol,
standard work procedure).

Search strategy
The search strategy was iteratively developed by an ex-
perienced medical librarian (FI) who has extensive ex-
in
pertise

health

consultation with the research team. This strategy was
initially built in Medline and then translated as required
for the other databases (see Additional file 1 for the full
Medline strategy). We searched the following databases:
Medline (including Epub Ahead of Print, In-Process and
Other Non-Indexed Citations), EMBASE, PsycINFO,
Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (all OVID
interface), CINAHL (EBSCO), Sociological Abstracts
(ProQuest), and Web of Science Core Collection. This
specific range of databases produced a comprehensive
‘Standardized operating
and multidisciplinary search.
procedures’ and ‘risk’ are defined in different ways
within mental health research and across disciplines that
are of interest. As a result, the search strategy included
both subject headings and keywords related to the con-
cepts of SOPs, research subjects and risk of harm (see
Additional file 1). In addition, an extensive grey (unpub-
lished) literature search was conducted (VT) through
consultation with an experienced research librarian and
informed by “Searching the Grey Literature: A Handbook
for Searching Reports, Working Papers, and Other Un-
published Research” [22]. This search was conducted
using the Open Gray Repository, Google Advanced, Pro-
Quest Dissertations and Theses Global, and the methods
outlined in the Canadian Agency for Drugs and Tech-
nologies in Health search tool, ‘Grey Matters’ [23]. Ex-
perts in the field were also contacted to identify any
additional relevant documents. The results from the
searches were exported into the citation manager End-
Note to retrieve bibliographic details and perform de-
duplication. A total of 178 peer reviewed documents and
20 grey literature documents were retrieved from the
database search after removing 72 duplicates. (see Fig. 1
for PRISMA diagram).

Stage 3: study selection
Eligibility criteria were pilot tested on a random sample
of 25 abstracts until substantial
inter-rater agreement
was reached between the two reviewers (VT, KS); κ ≥
0.70 [24]. The eligibility criteria were continuously re-
fined to ensure both reviewers were aligned. The study
selection process underwent two layers of screening: (1)
title and abstract and (2) full-text review. In both stages,
two reviewers (VT, KS) independently reviewed the arti-
cles and determined eligibility using the set inclusion /
exclusion criteria. Throughout this process, both re-
viewers used Covidence [25] - an online software recom-
mended by Cochrane that serves as a screening and data
extraction tool for literature reviews. When consensus
was not achieved, the two reviewers consulted with the
senior author (KC) to resolve disagreements. The search
strategy results and eligibility screening process are re-
ported in detail using the PRISMA flow diagram for
[19]. Following title and abstract
scoping reviews

Stevens et al. BMC Psychiatry           (2021) 21:13

screening of 198 documents, 151 were removed as they
did not meet the inclusion criteria. A total of 47 full-text
documents were examined; of these, 11 were ineligible
(see Fig. 1 for PRISMA diagram) leaving 36 for inclusion
in this review.

Stage 4: data items and data collection process
Based on our research question, a standardized charting
form was developed by our research team to capture
relevant data in Excel. The following information was
extracted from each document and entered into the
form:

a. Descriptive information about the document:

authors, title of publication, year of publication,
country of origin, publication type, aims / purpose /
goals of study, research study design and
methodology, study population and setting, disease
type, method of data collection (e.g. in-person,
online), and study limitations.

b. Suicide and risk management protocols: presence of
SRMP, term used in document (e.g. SRMP, SOP),
the core components of the SRMP, and the

strategies within the SRMP indicating how the
SRMP manages risk and safety for research
participants and research staff.

Prior to data extraction, the data charting form was
independently
piloted with two reviewers (KS, VT)
charting three articles, followed by meeting with the re-
search team. This process was iterative as the research
team revised the form as needed throughout data extrac-
tion as new themes emerged and new categories of
interest were identified.

Stage 5: synthesizing and reporting the results
The extracted data from the data charting form under-
went qualitative content analysis [26]. Content analysis
generally refers to a family of analytic approaches that
provide meaning to the content of the data [27]. Sum-
mative content analysis, a specific type of content ana-
lysis, involves determining the frequency of key words or
content that then permits interpretation of the data
within a specific context (e.g. core components and
strategies use in SRMPs) [27]. This analysis was appro-
priate given the nature of available data extracted from

Stevens et al. BMC Psychiatry           (2021) 21:13 

Page 5 of 14

the scoping review documents. The overall synthesis
process was iterative to ensure that we captured data
emerging from the academic and grey literature.

Results
Characteristics of documents
A total of 36 documents (22 peer reviewed articles and
14 grey literature documents) were included in this
scoping review. The 22 peer reviewed articles were pub-
lished between 1988 and 2020 with 9/22 (41%) being
published in the past 5 years. In total, 17/22 (77%) arti-
cles were from the United States with the remainder
from Canada (2), Australia (1), England (1), and the
Netherlands (1). Of the 22 peer reviewed articles, there
were qualitative (n = 4), quantitative (n = 3), and mixed
(qualitative and quantitative) (n = 7) methods utilized,
and one was a meta-analysis. The remaining (n = 7) were
commentary or recommendation documents. The grey
literature consisted of guidance documents (n = 9) and
reports (n = 5). All 14, except one unknown, grey litera-
ture documents were published between 2006 and 2019
with 7/14 (50%) being published in the past 5 years. In
total, 9/14 (64%) documents were published from the
United States with the remainder from Canada (2),

Australia (1), and England (1). All 36 documents focused
on mental health research, as per the inclusion criteria.
Study populations were most commonly adults diag-
nosed with a variety of mental health issues including
ideation, bipolar disorder, schizo-
depression, suicidal
phrenic
disorder,
personality
borderline
disorder,
amongst others. The 36 documents specified either hos-
pital or community health settings. Multiple data collec-
tion methods were utilized with the vast majority
including face-to-face methods (e.g. self-report paper-
based measures or qualitative interviews),
telephone
communication, and online methods (e.g. use of elec-
tronic safety and risk management protocol, online
questionnaires).

SRMP Core components and strategies
In this section, core components and strategies of a
SRMP that were identified in the reviewed documents
will be described (see Table 1). Consistent with the def-
inition by Fixsen et al. [20], core components in this re-
view were identified as those components that were
essential in the development of a protocol to successfully
assess and manage suicide and risk for participants in
mental health research. A total of five core components

were identified, including: (1) training; (2) educational
resources for research staff; (3) educational resources for
research participants; (4) risk assessment and manage-
ment strategies; and (5) clinical and research oversight.
For each core component, a variety of implementation
strategies were identified.

Component 1.0: training
Training included strategies to prepare researchers and
research staff with the knowledge, skills, and compe-
tency to assess and manage risk of participants in mental
the 36 documents reviewed, 19
health research. Of
(53%) included training as a core component (see Table
1). A total of four different training strategies were de-
scribed across the documents. Specific training strategies
described in the documents included: (1.1) research staff
training; (1.2) team building; (1.3) establishing relevant
experience, delineating roles, and ensuring qualifications
for the research team; and (1.4) follow-up debriefing
with staff. Each of these are described below with refer-
ence to key supporting documents.

Training strategies
1.1: Research staff training: The reviewed documents in-
dicated that research staff need to be trained on suicide and
risk assessment [2, 3, 6, 28–35] and in the implementation
of a safety protocol [36]. Specifically, there ought to be a
plan for initial and ongoing training on the use of SRMPs
and how to respond in different situations [6]. Several doc-
uments (see Table 1) referred to training methods that fo-
cused on both the research participants and the trainer. For
example, Campbell et al. [29], conducted an extensive
three-day workshop for all staff collecting study data. The
workshop included educational and interactive sessions that
provided detailed information regarding conducting suicide
risk assessments and role-playing activities where trainees
participated in mock interviews with research staff. Herbeck
Belnap et al. [30] had a study psychologist conduct a one-
day staff training session with study staff about suicidal
ideation and embedded time to practice using the SRMP
[30]. Lastly, Hom et al. [3] included reading key scientific
papers, shadowing and observation experiences, reviewing
training videos with mock participants, annual evaluation
of competence in risk assessment using standardized role
play, routine reviews using audiotapes, video tapes or obser-
vation by a clinical supervisor.
1.2: Team building: Only one author described the im-
portance of team building as a strategy. Ensuring the re-
search study
cohesively was
team is developing
suggested by Campbell et al. [29] who included strat-
egies such as; rapport-building with research participants
and cultivating relationships with participating sites, to
facilitate identification and testing of suicide assessment
and management strategies.

1.3: Establishing relevant experience, delineating roles,
and ensuring qualifications for the research team:
Determining the experience, qualifications, and know-
ledge of the research team is essential [3, 6, 15, 37–41].
Based on variability in the knowledge and experience of
members of the research team,
individualized training
(e.g. implementation of study procedures and protocols,
administration of study assessments and interpretation
of results) is necessary so that the research team mem-
bers have the knowledge to deal with suicide risk [15,
38, 41]. To avoid potential confusion regarding the as-
research participants,
sessment and management of
study protocols should clearly outline roles and bound-
aries for research staff
[3]. Ghahramanlou-Holloway
et al. [37] explicitly stated which staff member was to
intervene at each point in the assessment. Upon aware-
ness of potential suicide risk for participants, study as-
sessors (who are defined as trained staff in administering
measures) were instructed to contact the study principal
investigator (PI) immediately. Similarly, Littlewood et al.
[38] mentioned their study was conducted by research
staff members with prior mental health research experi-
ence. For researchers conducting psychiatric research, a
formal education in research ethics to address complex
issues is necessary [39]. Most importantly, the research
team lead (i.e. PI; research manager) must be trained in
identifying elevated risk (e.g.
through suicide assess-
ments and clinical judgment) [15].
1.4: Follow-up and debriefing with research staff:
Follow-up and debriefing with research staff and study
participants is critical when training research staff on
how to implement a SRMP and after it has been imple-
mented. Staff need an opportunity to troubleshoot, ask
questions, and seek ongoing training, advice, and feed-
back [2, 6, 16, 28, 30, 37, 38, 40]. Examples of follow-up
and debriefing procedures consisted of: (a) one-on-one
or small group discussion between the PI and research
staff [28]; (b) a staff discussion with the study psycholo-
gist or other clinician [30]; and (c) researchers (e.g. PI or
Co-Investigator) set aside specific times for debriefing
and problem solving with research staff on AEs [16].

Component 2.0: educational resources - Research staff
Educational resources in the reviewed documents tar-
geted two different groups of stakeholders: research staff
and research participants. Strategies directed specifically
at research staff included: (2.1) resources, procedures,
and guidelines; (2.2) flow charts and algorithms; (2.3)
electronic prompts/pop-up alerts; and (2.4) templates
and general principals. Of the 36 documents reviewed,
14 (39%) included educational resources for research
staff (see Table 1). Each strategy is described in more de-
to the key documents
tail below with reference

Stevens et al. BMC Psychiatry           (2021) 21:13

describing them. Strategies directed specifically at re-
search participants are discussed in Component 3.0.

Educational resources - Research staff strategies
2.1: Resources, procedures, and guidelines: Research
staff strategies indicated in this review included educa-
tional resources, procedures and guidelines [29, 42].
Campbell et al. [29] suggested the use of an “On Call Clin-
ician Resource Guide” which consisted of local resources
(e.g. local research site clinical resources) and safety man-
agement procedures (e.g. risk management policies and
procedures for documentation and communication) for
on call study clinicians to use when needed. This “On Call
Clinician Resource Guide” also consisted of contact infor-
mation for on call personnel in the form of a wallet card
for easy access [29]. Luxton et al. [42] recommended the
use of tele-practice guidelines to determine appropriate-
ness of patients receiving care as well as SOPs consisting
of a series of steps to assess suicide risk level and respond
to psychiatric emergencies. In addition, pre-planned pro-
cedures for study clinicians (e.g. continuity of care plan
once a patient has completed treatment) were used to en-
sure patient safety [42].
2.2: Flow charts and algorithms: Several documents [1,
3, 6, 14, 29, 30, 43–46] recommended incorporating flow
charts and algorithms, into research staff’s SRMP educa-
tional resources. For example, Haigh and Witham [45]
developed a flow chart that provided step-by-step guide-
lines for managing participants’ distress in research
group interviews. This flow chart
included response
stages (e.g. where the researcher activated an interven-
tion based on the level of severity) followed by review or
follow up to identify whether another response is re-
quired. Hom et al. [3], also recommended the use of
evidence-based suicide risk assessment frameworks and
clinical decision trees that clearly described how the re-
search staff could determine risk level and subsequent
clinical actions.
2.3: Electronic prompts/pop-up alerts: The use of elec-
tronic prompts and pop-up alerts were identified in two
documents [30, 46]. The key features of electronic SRMP
used by Herbeck Belnap et al. [30] included use of auto-
matic prompts, electronic documentation, use of skip
patterns and availability of contact information of on call
clinical staff. These prompts and alerts included mea-
sures of risk assessment and risk determination. Based
on the responses recorded during risk assessment, the
SRMP automatically assigned a risk level for self-harm
behavior as well as indicated actions to be taken at each
level. This strategy is particularly useful for research staff
as it streamlines decision-making by providing clear in-
structions at each step and reducing additional question-
ing of participants [30].

2.4: Templates and general principles: The use of tem-
plates and general principles in SRMPs assist with
streamlining research processes and provide consistency
and clarity for research staff [1, 16, 33, 47]. Sample plain
language templates that include standardized informa-
tion about study requirements, potential risks, and the
right to withdraw from research activities should be
available to the research staff for use with participants
[16, 33]. General principles for responding to AEs (e.g.
the RA is to remain calm, reassure the patient, and con-
tact the supervisor for assistance) also have been in-
cluded in SRMPs [1].

including:

Component 3.0: educational resources: Research
participants
Similar to educational resources targeting research staff,
specific resources for research participants were sug-
gested for SRMPs,
(3.1) written materials;
(3.2) immediate support services; (3.3) available mental
health services; and (3.4) a social support person. Of the
36 documents reviewed, 25 (69%) included educational
resources for research participants as a core component
(see Table 1). Each of these resources are described in
more detail below with reference to the key documents
describing them.

Educational resources: Research participants strategies
3.1: Written materials: Written resources, such as infor-
mation sheets or help pages allow participants to access
mental health resources, if necessary [3, 15, 16, 32, 33, 35,
36, 42, 43, 48–51]. Hom et al. [3] indicated that resources
and referral information distributed to participants by re-
search staff can provide an opportunity for safety planning
and linking with existing social supports to reduce risk.
Other examples of written materials included: a suicide re-
ferral card [32], an information card with mental health
resources [36], and a list of referral information or a refer-
ral document [35, 51].
3.2: Immediate support services: Several documents
(see Table 1) recommended including information on
immediate support services for research participants
who may be in acute distress or require urgent mental
health interventions [1, 2, 14, 34, 40, 43, 44, 46, 47, 49,
50, 52, 53]. Immediate mental health support services
endorsed by research staff included the use of a 24-h
help-crisis line [52] and directing those in crisis to a
URL link that consists of relevant resources [47]. If such
strategies are deemed inadequate for the research team
to administer, mobilizing outside resources from a men-
tal health service provider may be a more appropriate
option [1, 53].
3.3: Available mental health services: In addition to
immediate support services, if a member of the research
team identifies a participant is at risk, several documents

Stevens et al. BMC Psychiatry           (2021) 21:13 

Page 8 of 14

included debriefing sessions or

describe the importance of ensuring research partici-
pants are provided with resources to indicate where they
can access available mental health services in a variety of
settings (i.e. hospitals, community agencies, and educa-
tional institutions) [2, 3, 14, 16, 41, 43, 49, 52–54]. More
specifically, Bucy et al. [52] described providing informa-
tion on available mental health resources for research
[49] described providing
participants; Stanton et al.
available mental health resources through individual dis-
cussion, written and oral announcements; and others ei-
ther
the option of
debriefing sessions with participants [43]. Wilson and
Christensen [54] recommended follow up with research
participants, who were identified as at risk for suicide
and self-harm, 1 week after their research assessment to
monitor suicidal
ideation and to further reinforce the
need to link with available mental health service pro-
viders, if necessary.
3.4: Social support person: The use of social support of-
fers research participants the opportunity to have a sup-
port person if needed such as family, peers, treatment
providers, or local community contacts [2, 3, 42, 52]. As
part of safety planning for participants who are at risk
for suicide, researchers encouraged participants to iden-
tify and provide contact information for an existing so-
cial support person [3, 42]. This individual should be
reachable during research assessments to assist with the
coordination or linking of participants to mental health
resources or other social supports in the event of an
emergency [3, 42].

Component 4.0: risk assessment and risk management
strategies
It is important for research teams to have the knowledge
and skills to identify potential suicide risk level and to
act, if required. Strategies include: (4.1) implementation
of a structured and explicit SRMP (4.2) identification of
risk level; and (4.3) utilization and scoring of validated
risk assessment measures. Of
the 36 documents
reviewed, 27 (75%) included risk assessment and man-
agement strategies as a core component (see Table 1).
Each of these strategies are described in more detail
below with reference to the key documents describing
them.

Risk assessment and risk management strategies
4.1: Implementation of a structured and explicit sui-
cide and risk management protocol: Several docu-
ments highlighted that when conducting mental health
research where suicide is a potential risk, research teams
should have a structured protocol in place to assess sui-
cidal ideation [6, 14–16, 29, 31, 32, 34, 36, 38, 50–52,
55]. According to Lakeman and FitzGerald [16] and
Bucy et al. [52], SRMPs are designed to ensure adequate

resources or a contingency plan to optimize participant
safety. The Committee for Protection of Human Subjects
[51] recommends frequent “check-in” notes embedded
within the instruments or questionnaires used. These
notes capture information including a research subject’s
desire to continue to participate in the study or to be
connected with a mental health professional that can
information. Another ex-
provide them with referral
ample of structured SRMP includes the University of
Washington Risk Assessment Protocol (UWRAP) that
provides guidelines on determining participant risk
level and interventions for staff to offer to partici-
pants [14, 15].
4.2: Identification of risk level: Luxton et al. [42] high-
light that suicide risk levels are dynamic and change fre-
quently. Thus, as highlighted in 12 documents [3, 30, 34,
36, 37, 39, 42, 44, 47, 50, 51, 54] risk assessment needs
to be an ongoing process during research assessments.
Three of the documents focused on assessing and allo-
cating established levels of risk to research participants
[30, 42]. For example, Luxton et al. [42] defined four
levels of risk ranging from low to high with specified
clinical response for each level. Furthermore, Wilson
and Christensen [54] recommended that assessing sui-
cide risk should include evaluating the frequency and in-
tensity of suicidal ideation, whether the participant has
formulated a plan for harming themselves, and their per-
ception of intention to self-harm. Research studies that
incorporated telephone interviews, established a set of a
pre-identified risk triggers and treatment session check-
lists to determine participants’ level of risk [42, 50].
4.3: Utilization and scoring of validated risk assess-
ment measures: In total, 11 documents utilized the ad-
ministration and scoring of a validated risk assessment
measure to assess for the presence of mental health con-
ditions (e.g. depression), suicidal ideation or self-harm
behaviours associated with increased risk of suicide at-
tempts and death by suicide [14, 30, 32, 33, 35, 37, 43,
46, 50, 52, 55]. The results of these measures provide re-
search staff with another level of information needed to
respond. Bucy et al. [52] emphasized that immediate
scoring of risk level using a validated measure is essen-
tial to ensure the safety of research participants. Specific-
ally, their protocol
includes immediate scoring of the
Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) to evaluate the
severity of depressive symptoms, the presence of suicidal
ideation, and participant needs. Based on the partici-
pants’ response, the protocol directs the RA to ask fol-
low up questions and to provide participants with
mental health resources. Similarly, clinical research staff
responsible for conducting study assessments including
reviewing the results of self-report risk assessment mea-
sures (e.g. Scale for Suicidal Ideation-Current [SSI-C])
the
are required to follow a stepped process

participant is identified as at imminent risk (e.g. self-
harm or suicide attempt) [37]. For instance, the study as-
sessor records all potential risks, suicide intent, and pro-
the participant’s
tective factors, and then informs
treatment team at the hospital [37].

Component 5.0: clinical and Research oversight
Ensuring that monitoring and oversight are established
in mental health research was described by 16 /36 (44%)
of the documents (see Table 1). Strategies to achieve
clinical and research oversight include: (5.1) the use of a
data and safety monitoring board (DSMB) or a data
monitoring plan; (5.2) safety and risk monitoring of re-
search participants; and (5.3) clinical back-up during re-
search assessments. Each of

documents describing them.

members.
5.3: Clinical back-up during research assessments:
Several documents [1, 6, 14, 29, 30, 37, 38, 44, 50, 54,
56] note that providing clinical back-up delivers timely
support and guidance to research staff during research
assessments if a participant is in crisis. Clinical back-up
by licensed clinicians (e.g. psychologist, physician, nurse,
social worker) provides access to timely clinical assess-
ment and management of high-risk participants [29]. As
well, Iltis et al. [6] recommend that PIs, team leads, or
senior investigators should be available for decision-
making and troubleshooting around emerging safety is-
sues. Crisis counsellors, to support the participant in
coping and developing a support plan, are also recom-
mended for research studies, which may recruit study
participants with a history of suicidal ideation [50].

Clinical and Research oversight strategies
5.1: Use of a Data and Safety Monitoring Board
(DSMB) or a data monitoring plan: Researchers con-
ducting mental health research are often mandated by
their institution to use a DSMB [1–3, 6, 29, 31, 56]. The
monitoring of study documents and study data is con-
ducted as described within the study protocol to ensure
participant safety (e.g. through the identification of ad-
verse events and accuracy and consistency of data collec-
tion) [56]. Hom et al. [3] described that DSMBs can
offer valuable insight regarding conducting research with
participants at risk. Specifically, they recommend that
researchers should consult and seek approval regarding
their SRMPs from their established DSMBs prior to their
use.
5.2: Safety and risk monitoring: In total, six documents
highlighted the need for research staff to conduct regular
monitoring of participants [6, 16, 29, 37, 46, 56]. This in-
assessments/check-ins
follow-up
cludes
throughout the course of the study period to identify po-
tential mental health concerns and ensure participant
safety [29]. The National Institute of Mental Health
(NIMH) [56] highlights that this responsibility could be
assigned to a medical monitor whose role would be de-
scribed within the detailed study protocol. If there is
concern that the research participant’s mental health is
deteriorating or they have been identified as high risk
for potential suicide, a defined risk assessment with
timely and appropriate follow-up procedures should be
conducted [56]. More
specifically, Ghahramanlou-
Holloway et al. [37] describe how they employ safety and
risk monitoring during a telephone follow up interview
when research staff
(e.g. research assistant) become
aware of a participant’s imminent risk for suicide. They
follow emergency procedures and request assistance,
first from the PI followed by the research coordinator. A

conducting

Discussion
This scoping review identified 22 peer-reviewed articles
and 14 grey literature documents that aimed to identify
core components and strategies included in SRMPs to
assess and manage risk and safety for research partici-
pants. Acknowledging a need for and creating accepted
guidelines for SRMPs to address suicide and risk for
mental health studies should not be mistaken with the
false notion that there is an inherent risk in conducting
mental health research. Beliefs about exaggerated risk
are maintained through assumptions that participating
in mental health research, particularly suicide-related re-
search, increases the risk of suicidal ideation and behav-
iour [57–62]. A meta-analysis by Blades et al.
[48]
demonstrated that asking participants about suicide pro-
vided small, yet significant, benefits to participants. Mis-
conceptions on the degree of risk in mental health
research has negative implications on research proposal
submissions to REBs, where participant safety is the pri-
mary concern.

There are many collaborative efforts to standardize re-
search processes around the world. However, specific
components and strategies to include in SRMPs to miti-
gate suicide and risk in mental health research are lack-
ing. This review revealed that SRMPs provide vital
information for research teams on how to assess and
manage risk and respond to research participants in cri-
sis. Our review identified five core components that re-
searchers,
commonly
identified as essential in the development and adminis-
tration of SRMPs. These components included: (1) train-
ing;
(3)
(2) educational resources for research staff;
educational resources for research participants; (4) risk
assessment and management; and (5) clinical and re-
search oversight. All five core components should be

considered when conducting mental health research to
ensure the safety of the research participant and rigor of
the research. An array of strategies related to each com-
ponent were identified that could be selected or tailored
across a variety of research contexts. However, there are
few documents that collectively recommended imple-
menting all five core components and relevant strategies
[3, 16]. This is surprising given the importance of ensur-
ing participant safety and highlights the need for REBs
within organizations to standardize SRPMs across re-
search projects. More research is required to verify the
core components and strategies, including how to tailor
them across different stakeholder groups and contexts.

Training was identified as an essential component of
SRMPs for all research teams conducting mental health
research on participants at risk for suicide [3]. Training
in achieving
is generally seen to have a vital part
organizational goals in healthcare [63] and is a catalyst
to staff efficiency, career development, and job satisfac-
tion [64]. In mental health research, training needs to in-
clude specific direction on risk assessment and how to
handle a variety of different situations such as partici-
pant’s report of suicide ideation and/or action [29]. Re-
search team leads (e.g. PI, research associate) need to
ensure all research staff are trained in how to respond to
suicide and assess risk. Campbell et al. [29] stress that
training activities need to be extensive and varied. They
strongly recommend that sufficient funds are allocated
for development of suicide and risk management learn-
ing resources.

While some training strategies were frequently cited in
the reviewed documents (e.g. follow-up and debriefing
with research staff [2, 28, 30]), others were only men-
tioned in a single document (e.g. team building [29]).
This lack of consistency in identifying specific training
strategies could suggest that SRMPs are at different
stages of development based on the type of study being
conducted, source of funding, and organizational train-
ing requirements. SRMPs may also be utilized differently
depending on the expertise and availability of the re-
search staff. Furthermore, while some training strategies
were described in depth (e.g. three-day workshop [29]),
others lacked clarity and precise details (e.g. establishing
relevant experience, delineating roles, and ensuring qual-
ifications for the research team [38]). Inconsistencies in
training details provided throughout the reviewed docu-
ments highlights the need to determine the aspects of
training that are of greatest benefit across diverse re-
search settings in order to develop standardized training
modules for assessing and responding to suicide risk that
can be implemented similarly to training in other re-
search procedures.

Strategies addressing the essential qualifications for re-
search team members to assess risk of suicide, was

primarily targeted towards the PI or team lead (e.g. re-
search associate). Specific research and/or clinical quali-
fications (e.g. professional licensure) and experience for
team member roles (e.g. research assistant, research co-
ordinator, trainees) was either absent or vague [38]. The
sufficiency of
required knowledge for various team
members was also not specified. Better descriptions of
qualifications and knowledge requirements for all team
member roles would assist with tailoring the research
training for
individual projects. Ongoing leadership
training also needs to occur to ensure that an indi-
vidual with the required qualifications and know-
ledge is appropriately designated to identify training
needs, provide training for the research team mem-
bers and build in time for follow-up of the research
activities. Davidson et al. [65] suggest that successful
leaders in health research organizations need to be
skilled and competent
collaboration,
communication, team effectiveness, data quality, and
scientific productivity.

to enhance

the successful

Educational resources are another key component
recommended and used in the reviewed documents,
to contribute to a safe environment for both individ-
uals (e.g. research staff and research participants) and
organizations (e.g. REBs) [14]. The use of evidence-
based protocols and educational resources is consist-
ent with effective knowledge translation strategies
that support
implementation of re-
search evidence in practice [66]. Hom et al. [3] draw
attention to the fact that even though individuals and
organizations may be wary about research involving
participants at risk for suicide, evidence-based proto-
cols to assess and manage this risk can be effectively
adapted for different research contexts. The evidence
supporting educational strategies and resources needs
to be updated regularly by a responsible person to
conduct the updates. This individual will need a de-
gree of information literacy to decipher and interpret
the immense amount of knowledge that is generated
through healthcare research [67].

Educational resources have been developed for re-
search staff to support their knowledge of, and use of,
study procedures that outline to manage and respond to
participants in crisis [1, 29]. Strategies such as flow
charts and algorithms (Strategy 2.2) promote a standard-
ized approach to managing the research processes and
aid in decision making. Vannoy et al. [1] state that al-
though flow charts for managing suicide risk and man-
agement are rare,
in
outlining decision-making around “specific actions to be
taken, when, and by whom” (p. 5). Automatic assign-
ment of risk mentioned in Strategy 2.3 [30] also supports
standardized decision making. However, this strategy
could be prone to malfunction (and require technical

if

[43, 52]

Educational resources for research participants are also
important to ensure they are well informed about the
study and its potential risks, and that they have know-
ledge about how to access immediate support and avail-
able mental health services,
required. Written
educational strategies (Strategy 3.1) have similar limita-
tions for participants as for research staff. They need to
be developed, specifically targeting the participant stake-
holder group, written in plain language, and address key
messages of importance for this group [16, 68]. Strat-
egies that address the need for immediate or available
mental health services
should be well
researched, current, and accurate. Providing this infor-
mation to participants may be considered a co-
intervention that may impact study results. Achieving a
balance between providing mental health information to
keep the participant’s safe and maintaining the study
rigor may be challenging. The content of the informa-
tion given to research participants is important for re-
searchers to track and disclose. Identification of a social
support person is also appealing, however studies do not
clearly provide information on social support or “sup-
port person” or how participants may benefit
from
reaching out for this support [3, 42]. Operationalization
of social support as part of SRMPs is also not well de-
scribed in the reviewed documents and the logistics for
implementation are lacking.

This review highlights the need for research staff to be
trained on how to identify suicide risk level and to re-
spond accordingly. Strategies that could assist in achiev-
ing this would include developing a structured and
explicit SRMP (Strategy 4.1) within the study proposal
and utilization of validated risk assessment measures
(Strategy 4.2). These strategies, however, depend on hav-
ing knowledgeable and capable researchers and clini-
cians as part of the research team to develop SRMPs and
to conduct training with research staff. This training
should take into consideration different levels of risk
and diverse levels of research staff knowledge and quali-
levels of risk were
fications [69]. Across documents,
mostly matched with required interventions [30, 42].
Strategies tailored to risk severity can be advantageous
to ensure participants receive adequate treatment while
to make decisions with
also allowing research staff
confidence.

Among the components and strategies identified in
this review, there was a lack of input from research par-
ticipants and/or stakeholders described in the develop-
ment of SRMPs. This is an important consideration for
future SRMPs in order to be participant-oriented and
align with their needs. Manafo et al. [70] highlighted sig-
nificant momentum for engaging patients in all phases

of the research process. Working collaborations between
patients and researchers has been shown to improve pa-
tient and health care outcomes [71]. With increased
focus on patient engagement in clinical research [70], it
is imperative to include participant perspectives in the
development of research documents such as SRMPs. En-
hancing the value of SRMPs will largely depend on care-
ful evaluation by multiple stakeholders.

While this review found two articles reporting best
practices for online SRMPS [30, 47], there remains a lack
of literature on how to adequately prepare researchers
and REBs for conducting mental health research involv-
ing e-health applications [72, 73]. As mental health re-
search is rapidly evolving, the utilization of technology
and online clinical research studies has become more
common as care delivery approaches [74]. Specifically,
research involving e-health interventions, while promis-
ing as sustainable and scalable [74], raises questions on
how to ensure participant safety when in-person and
face-to-face interactions do not occur [72]. With online
administration of e-health applications in mental health
research, there is a need to have appropriate safeguards
in place to clearly lay out the best course of action dur-
ing unanticipated and crisis situations. Defining specific
criteria required in SRMPs used in e-health research
studies, including online administered and digital inter-
ventions, could eliminate uncertainties and relieve the
burden currently placed on both REBs and mental health
researchers.

Limitations
While this review has several strengths,
including the
use of an iterative search strategy and a range of data-
bases, there are limitations to note. First, the use of vary-
ing terminology to describe SRMPs in the literature (e.g.
SOP, action plan, safety protocol, high risk management
procedures, suicide risk assessment) may have contrib-
uted to the limited number of documents identified for
this review. Inconsistent terminology can also impede
the development of standardized SRMPs where there
needs to be clarity on processes such as risk assessment
and determination of adverse effects. Second, the lan-
guage of included documents was limited to English;
therefore, relevant non-English documents may have
been missed. Third, the study participants of included
documents was limited to age 16 years and up. Import-
ant considerations from younger populations (e.g. under
16 years of age) may have contributed more information
about potential strategies to support the implementation
of SRPMs for children and adolescents at risk.

Conclusions
This scoping review, including peer reviewed academic
literature and grey literature documents, identified five

Stevens et al. BMC Psychiatry           (2021) 21:13

core components to include in the development of
SRMPs for mental health researchers. Multiple docu-
ments described a range of strategies to address individ-
ual core components. There are few documents that
collectively implement all
five core components and
relevant strategies. Ideally, these findings could inform
the development of SRMBs for research teams and
REBs.
