Integrating Mindfulness and
Acceptance Into Traditional
Cognitive Behavioral Therapy
During the COVID-19
Pandemic: A Case Study of an
Adult Man With Generalized
Anxiety Disorder

Alisa R. Garner1  and Gregory L. Stuart1

Abstract
Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) can be chronic and impairing, highlighting the need for
effective treatments. Although Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT) is an effective treatment for
GAD, a number of patients continue to report GAD symptoms treatment. Integrating evidenced-
based treatment components into CBT treatments, such as mindfulness- and acceptance-based
treatment components found in Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), may help improve
the efﬁcacy of treatment. Emerging interventions and research suggest that the cognitive re-
structuring aspect of CBT and acceptance stance of ACT (e.g., cognitive defusion) can be im-
plemented into treatment concurrently from a stance of increasing a patient’s coping skills
repertoire and psychological ﬂexibility. This systemic case analysis examined the efﬁcacy and
clinical utility of integrating ACT into a manualized CBT treatment for GAD. Furthermore, this
study examined treatment efﬁcacy and therapeutic alliance as the treatment rapidly and unex-
pectedly transitioned from in-person to telehealth due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Pre- to post-
treatment and time-series analyses showed signiﬁcant decreases in anxiety symptoms, worry,
depressive symptoms, and emotion dysregulation. Although there was an initial
increase in
depressive and anxiety symptoms, worry, and emotion dysregulation following the switch from in-
person to telehealth services, these quickly subsided and resumed a downward trend. The
therapeutic relationship did not deteriorate during the transition to telehealth. This case study
provides evidence of feasibility and efﬁcacy of an integrated CBT/ACT approach in treating GAD.
It also suggests that despite some temporary increase in symptoms, therapeutic alliance and
treatment efﬁcacy were not impacted by the switch to telehealth.

1 Theoretical and Research Basis for Treatment
Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is characterized by excessive, difﬁcult to control, and
psychosocial impairing anxiety and worry regarding multiple aspects of one’s life (American
Psychiatric Association, 2013). This anxiety and worry can manifest in symptoms such as
restlessness, difﬁculty concentrating, muscle tension, fatigue, irritability, and difﬁculty sleeping.
These symptoms occur most of the time over the course of six or more months. GAD has high
comorbidity with other psychological disorders including major depressive disorders (American
Psychiatric Association, 2013). Approximately 3–4% of adults in the United States experience
GAD in the past year and 7.8% report experiencing GAD in their lifetime (Ruscio et al., 2017).
GAD tends to be chronic in nature, following a course of periods of full or partial remission and
relapse of symptoms. Over the course of 8 years, 43% of men and 36% of women will experience
another episode of GAD (Yonkers et al., 2003). Of respondents who reported a lifetime history of
GAD, 48% reported experiencing GAD in the past year (Ruscio et al., 2017). The high-risk of
GAD recurrence highlights the need for effective treatments.

There are numerous cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) protocols and manuals to treat GAD.
The CBT model of GAD suggests that uncontrollable worry associated with GAD is the result of
threatening and catastrophic thoughts about future events (LeBlanc et al., 2021). This worry serves
as means of avoiding threatening, unpleasant experiences (Lee et al., 2010). For example, the
worry of the future threatening event causes an individual to engage in excessive checking
behaviors or distract themselves from negative internal experiences. The worry is then maintained
via negative reinforcement as it provides immediate relief and prevents the individual from
engaging in effective coping strategies. Since the feared event did not occur, the worry creates a
sense of control and predictability. CBT approaches focuses on changing the threatening thoughts
through cognitive restructuring by evaluating the evidence and developing alternatives, as well as
strengthening the patient’s belief that they can cope with unpleasant events (Craske & Barlow,
2006). CBT protocols focus on psychoeducation about anxiety and worry, relaxation, cognitive
restructuring, behavioral experimentation, and imaginal exposure (LeBlanc et al., 2021). Meta-
analyses showed CBT to be an effective treatment of GAD (Carpenter et al., 2018; Hoffman et al.,
2012). However, not all who complete treatment report remission of symptoms. For example, 62%
of GAD patients had clinically signiﬁcant improvement post-treatment which reduced to 56% at
one year follow-up ( ¨Ost & Breitholtz, 2000). This has resulted in a call for enhancing the efﬁcacy
of existing CBT therapies for GAD with empirically supported treatment components (Behar
et al., 2009).

Integrating mindfulness and acceptance treatment elements to existing CBT manuals may
enhance the effectiveness of the treatment. The worry associated with anxiety can be concep-
tualized as a form of experiential avoidance. Experiential avoidance is the attempt to control or
alter internal experiences even when it causes psychological suffering (Hayes et al., 2012). This
avoidance can result in the paradoxical effect of an increase in the avoided internal experiences
(Luoma et al., 2007). Hayes et al. (2012) developed Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT)
and suggested that addressing experiential avoidance involves developing a stance of mindfulness
and acceptance. That is, to be aware of and experience fully, without judgment or defense, present-
moment experiences. Mindfulness and acceptance, rather than avoidance, of internal experiences
allows for ﬂexibility in response and increasing behaviors that are in accordance with the patient’s
values (Luoma et al., 2007). Techniques such as cognitive defusion are utilized to help patients

122

Clinical Case Studies 22(2)

view thoughts as something they experience without literal meaning and implications. Mind-
fulness- and acceptance-based therapies, such as ACT, are effective treatments of GAD. A
randomized controlled trial study compared CBT and ACT and found that both resulted in a
reduction in GAD symptoms (Stefan et al., 2019). Treatment components of mindfulness/
acceptance therapies such as mindfulness exercises and valued actions are common in CBT
treatments for GAD (LeBlanc et al., 2021).

A mindfulness and acceptance stance within ACT emphasizes changing the relationship and
reaction to thoughts (e.g., cognitive defusion). Since thoughts are experiences without literal
meaning, the focus of treatment is not on the content of the thought but acceptance of the ex-
perience of thoughts coming and going. A CBT approach emphasizes changing the anxiety-
provoking thought (e.g., cognitive restructuring). It may seem conﬂicting to incorporate these two
perspectives into therapy. For example, Roemer & Orsillo (2007) developed Acceptance-Based
Behavior Therapy for GAD with the speciﬁc purpose of blending CBT with ACT, but they did not
include cognitive restructuring in their treatment and instead focused on acceptance of internal
experiences. However, incorporating both approaches is possible. Ciarrochi and Bailey (2008)
proposed an integrated approach where ACT and CBT techniques are offered to patients as a
means of increasing the reservoir of coping skills. Patients develop the skill to identify under
which circumstances ACT versus CBT techniques may be more helpful. When combining these
two approaches therapists should explain to patients that these techniques promote thinking about
thoughts differently and encourage whichever strategy is the most beneﬁcial and thus promote
psychological ﬂexibility (Blackledge, 2018; Wenzel, 2018). Case studies provide support for the
successful implementation of a blended ACT/CBT approach for other problems including de-
pression, chronic pain, and emotional difﬁculties (Lunde & Nordhus, 2009; Marino et al., 2015;
Pavlacic & Young, 2020). One small study found that combining CBT with ACT resulted in
improvements in GAD symptoms (Carrier & Cˆot´e, 2010).

COVID-19 and the Rapid Switch to Telehealth Services

The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent lockdowns resulted in in-person
psychotherapy services being quickly shifted to telehealth (i.e., phone or video sessions). Tel-
ehealth is an effective method of treating mental health problems, including GAD, and its ef-
fectiveness is often comparable to in-person psychotherapy (Poletti et al., 2021). However,
previous studies on its effectiveness involved treatment where telehealth was provided for the
entire course of therapy rather than treatment that shifted modalities during the therapy. This
leaves questions on the impact this rapid switch had on the therapeutic relationship and the
efﬁcacy of treatment. Preliminary ﬁndings showed that the transition did not negatively impact the
therapeutic relationship from the therapist’s perspective (Stefan et al., 2021).

The following case study details the implementation of a traditional CBT manualized treatment
for GAD while incorporating mindfulness- and acceptance-based principles in the treatment of a
white, American male with GAD. Treatment involved use of the Mastery of Your Anxiety and
Worry manual (Craske & Barlow, 2006), an empirically supported CBT treatment for GAD
(Zinbarg et al., 2006), while integrating mindfulness and acceptance components from Learning
ACT: An Acceptance and Commitment Therapy Skills-Training Manual for Therapists (Luoma
et al., 2007). Furthermore, this case study details the implementation of this treatment as it shifted
from in-person to telehealth due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

2 Case Introduction
The client’s name and identifying details were altered for conﬁdentiality; however, the client’s
symptoms and course of treatment remain the same. “Fred” was a 28-year-old, White, cis-gender,
straight man, and graduate student, who self-referred to a large, southeastern university psy-
chological clinic for relationship and anxiety-related concerns. Fred and his girlfriend of over one
year had ended their relationship approximately one month prior to intake. The therapist was a
female clinical psychology doctoral student who was under the supervision of two licensed
clinical psychologists during this case.

3 Presenting Complaints
At intake, Fred reported symptoms of anxiety including excessive and difﬁcult to control worry,
restlessness, difﬁculty concentrating, muscle tension, and difﬁculty sleeping. These symptoms
persisted for over the past year. Fred described a long history of anxiety, beginning in childhood,
and his most recent exacerbation in anxiety symptoms coincided with his relationship with his
girlfriend at the time. He explained he would become highly anxious regarding multiple aspects of
the relationship including how he and his girlfriend would spend their time together and he was
excessively concerned with his girlfriend’s wellbeing. Fred would attempt to alleviate and control
the anxiety and worry. For example, before spending time with his girlfriend he would thoroughly
plan out their activities. He would often leave his home in the middle of the night to console his
girlfriend when she was upset. He described being preoccupied by and frequent rumination on his
anxious thoughts to the point that he was unable to think about anything else or engage in other
activities. Fred would often come to catastrophizing conclusions about himself while ruminating
on his anxious thoughts and experience fear and panic that these evaluations about himself were
true. Fred also noted when his anxiety was particularly high this would result in avoidance. He
would worry that he was not a “good” boyfriend resulting in urges to end the relationship and
eventually became overwhelmed to the point he ended the relationship. While Fred was primarily
concerned with the anxiety and worry related to his relationship, he also described a history of
anxiety and worry, along with attempts to control or avoid the anxiety, in other contexts including
school performance and familial relationships.

Fred described several depressive symptoms including a saddened mood, loss of interest in
pleasurable activities, and loss of appetite, as well as difﬁculty concentrating and sleeping. He
reported the onset of these symptoms began when he ended the relationship with his girlfriend one
month prior. Fred did not report any difﬁculties with substance use and did not report any suicidal
ideation or intent. There were no concerns regarding personality disorders or traits.

4 History

Fred was raised by biological, married parents who eventually divorced when Fred was in his mid-
20’s. Fred is the youngest child with one older brother. He reported meeting all developmental
milestones on time and no signiﬁcant physical health problems. He noted a family history of
mental health difﬁculties including anxiety and depression. He described a consistently positive
relationship with his family; however, he noted feeling as if he was his mother’s caretaker, even as
a child, when it came to her mental and physical health struggles.

Fred’s anxiety symptoms began in childhood. He described anxiety whenever he was separated
from his family, worry about his performance in school, and difﬁculty sleeping due to rumination.
As a teenager, Fred would experience anxiety regarding romantic relationships, speciﬁcally worry
that he would not be/was not a good enough partner, which prevented him from obtaining and

124

Clinical Case Studies 22(2)

developing long-term, intimate relationships. As an adult Fred’s anxiety was primarily related to
relationships, his performance in school compared to his peers, and his mother’s health. He
engaged in psychotherapy twice prior to intake due to his anxiety and difﬁculty obtaining and
maintaining intimate relationships. Fred was prescribed Valium (benzodiazepine) in his early 20’s.
He stated they were prescribed “as needed” to help him sleep.

Fred began his graduate studies in his mid-20’s. During his second year, he began his rela-
tionship with his ﬁrst serious, long-term girlfriend who attended the same graduate program. Fred
noted his anxiety regarding the relationship increased as the relationship continued. He stated that
towards the end he and his partner were having verbal arguments at least once a week. Fred
described the relationship as unstable and “too hard.” He noted his ability to handle his anxiety
related to other stressors began to diminish. He felt overwhelmed by these worries and ended his
relationship of over one year with his girlfriend despite still having intimate feelings.

5 Assessment
Fred’s psychosocial history was gathered over the course of two intake sessions. Fred completed a
clinical interview and the Diagnostic Interview of Anxiety, Mood, and OCD and Related
Neuropsychiatric Disorders (DIAMOND, Tolin et al., 2018) along with the following measures:
the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9; Kroenke & Spitzer, 2002), the Generalized Anxiety
Disorder-7 (GAD-7; Spitzer et al., 2006), the Difﬁculties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS;
Gratz & Roemer, 2004); the Acceptance and Action Questionnaire-II (AAQ-II; Bond et al., 2011),
and the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales-21 (DASS-21; Lovibond & Lovibond, 1995). The Penn
State Worry Questionnaire (PSWQ; Meyer et al., 1990) and the Working Alliance Inventory-Short
Form Revised (WAI-SR; Hatcher & Gillaspy, 2006) were administered one month after the
beginning of treatment. These seven measures were also administered throughout treatment,
termination, and one month post treatment at varying frequencies to reduce patient burden. The
PHQ-9 and GAD-7 were administered prior to every therapy session, as well as at termination and
one month post treatment. The DERS, PSWQ, and WAI-SR were administered monthly, as well as
at termination and one month post treatment. The AAQ-II was administered at termination and one
month post treatment, while the DASS-21 was administered at termination.

The DIAMOND (Tolin et al., 2018) is a semi-structured clinical interview that assesses for
symptoms that meet diagnostic criteria for several Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
Disorders, ﬁfth edition (DSM-5; American Psychiatric Association, 2013) disorders. Patients are
queried on different DSM-5 symptoms and any associated distress or impairment due to the
endorsed symptoms. A diagnosis may be warranted when the patient endorses all the listed
symptoms and criteria for a given disorder. The DIAMOND is a reliable and valid semi-structured
diagnostic interview for DSM-5 disorders (Tolin et al., 2018).

The PHQ-9 (Kroenke & Spitzer, 2002) is a nine-item, self-report measure of depressive
symptoms. The nine depressive symptom items are rated on a 4-point Likert scale ranging from 0
(Not at all) to 3 (Nearly every day). Total scores range from 0 to 27, with higher scores indicating
greater depression severity. Cutoff points of 5, 10, 15, and 20 indicate mild, moderate, moderately
severe, and severe depression, respectively. The PHQ-9 is a reliable and valid measure of de-
pressive symptoms (Beard et al., 2016).

The GAD-7 (Spitzer et al., 2006) is a seven-item, self-report measure of GAD symptoms.
Scored items on GAD-7 are rated on a 4-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (Not at all) to 3 (Nearly
every day) with total scores ranging from 0 to 21. High scores on the GAD-7 suggest more severe
GAD symptoms. The GAD-7 includes cutoff points of 5 (mild anxiety), 10 (moderate anxiety),
and 15 (severe anxiety). This measure demonstrated good psychometric properties among clinical
populations (Spitzer et al., 2006).

The DERS (Gratz & Roemer, 2004) is a 36-item, self-report measure of emotional dysre-
gulation. Respondents rate items on the DERS on a 5-point Likert Scale ranging from 1 (almost
never [0–10%]) to 5 (almost always [91–100%]). Responses are summed to obtain a total score
ranging from 36 to 180 with higher scores suggesting greater emotional dysregulation. The DERS
is a reliable and valid assessment of emotional dysregulation (Hallion et al., 2018).

The AAQ-II (Bond et al., 2011) is a seven-item, self-report measure of lack of acceptance,
avoidance, and psychological inﬂexibility related to emotions, memories, and experiences that
may make living life according to one’s values difﬁcult. Items on the AAQ-II are rated on a 7-point
Likert scale ranging from 0 (never true) to 7 (always true). Total scores range from 0 to 49, with
higher scores indicating greater psychological inﬂexibility. The AAQ-II demonstrated good
psychometric proprieties among a variety of populations (Bond et al., 2011).

The DASS-21 (Lovibond & Lovibond, 1995) is a 21-item, self-report measure comprising of
three subscales measuring the symptom severity of depression, anxiety, and stress. Items are rated
on a 4-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (did not apply to me at all) to 3 (applied to me very much
or most of the time). The respective items for each subscale are summed and then multiplied by
two to obtain each subscale’s total score, ranging from 0 to 42. High scores on the subscales reﬂect
greater symptom severity. The cutoffs for the Anxiety subscale are 8 (mild), 10 (moderate), 15
(severe), and 20+ (extremely severe). The cutoffs for the Depression subscale are 10 (mild), 14
(moderate), 21 (severe), and 28+ (extremely severe). Last, the cutoffs for the Stress subscale are 15
(mild), 19 (moderate), 26 (severe), and 34+ (extremely severe). The DASS-21 is a reliable and
valid measure within clinical samples (Antony et al., 1998).

The WAI-SR (Hatcher & Gillaspy, 2006) is a 12-item, self-report measure of therapeutic
alliance. Respondents rate items on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (never) to 5 (always). A
mean total score is achieved by summing items and dividing the sum by 12 with scores ranging
from 1 to 5. Higher scores indicate greater therapeutic alliance. The WAI-SR demonstrated good
psychometric properties among clinical populations (Munder et al., 2010).

The PSWQ (Meyer et al., 1990) is a 16-item, self-report measure of worry that is typically
present with GAD. Items are rated on a 5-point Likert Scale ranging from 1 (not ta all typical of
me) to 5 (very typical of me). Items are summed to obtain the total score, ranging from 16 to 80,
with higher scores indicating greater worry. The PSWQ displayed good psychometric properties
among clinical samples (Fresco et al., 2003).

6 Case Conceptualization
Fred’s clinical presentation was consistent with a DSM-5 (American Psychiatric Association,
2013) diagnosis of GAD. While he reported several depressive symptoms, given the overlap in his
depressive symptoms with his GAD symptoms (e.g., difﬁculty sleeping, difﬁculty concentrating),
assessment data, and the situational nature, a mood disorder diagnosis was not provided at intake
nor during treatment. Fred’s case conceptualization is based on the Mastery of Your Anxiety and
Worry: Therapist Guide (Zinbarg et al., 2006) which is derived from the theoretical models by
Barlow (2002) and Zinbarg (1998). Fred’s developmental learning history reinforced a belief that
he was “not good enough,” “incompetent,” and “bad.” As a child, Fred felt responsible for the
needs of his emotionally and physically ill mother but felt his attempts were unsuccessful as her
illnesses continued. In his teenage years, Fred’s attempts to obtain and maintain intimate rela-
tionships were equally unsuccessful despite putting forth a great deal of effort. This sense of
failure despite his efforts created a sense of uncontrollability and unpredictability in his life. This
resulted in a cognitive bias to scan for threats, interpreting ambiguous events as threatening, and
automatic thoughts that were catastrophizing and “all or nothing” which resulted in anxiety and
worry. To control this anxiety and worry, Fred engaged in preventative behaviors (e.g., thoroughly

126

Clinical Case Studies 22(2)

planning his time with his girlfriend to ensure she was happy) or avoidance behaviors (e.g.,
immediately going to his girlfriend whenever she was upset). These behaviors would provide Fred
with immediate relief and a sense of controllability over his feelings, thus maintaining the cycle of
anxiety/worry and avoidance. Fred viewed any amount of anxiety and worry as “pathological” and
would experience distress at its presence. This resulted in a cycle of worry about worrying as an
attempt to control the worry and anxiety.

Treatment Plan
Fred’s reported goals for treatment included reducing his symptoms of anxiety, especially anxiety
related to intimate relationships and gaining the ability to have an intimate relationship. He also
wanted to understand the nature of his catastrophizing thoughts about himself without fear of what
these thoughts mean about himself. In order to address his treatment goals, intervention began
utilizing the Mastery of Your Anxiety and Worry manual (Craske & Barlow, 2006) and incor-
porated mindfulness- and acceptance-based interventions from Learning ACT: An Acceptance and
Commitment Therapy Skills-Training Manual for Therapists (Luoma et al., 2007) when needed
and upon completion of the manual.

7 Course of Treatment and Assessment of Progress

Treatment consisted of 29 weekly and every-other-week sessions over 10 months. Treatment
began in-person with 11 sessions. Four months into treatment the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in
therapy sessions being moved to phone sessions for 15 sessions and then videoconferencing
sessions for 3 sessions to termination. Fred remained on his prescription of Valium throughout
treatment, using “as needed,” once or twice a month, as a sleep aid.

In-Person Sessions: Pre–COVID-19
Sessions 1–4: Introduction to Treatment and Psychoeducation. Treatment began with clarifying Fred’s
treatment goals, developing a treatment plan, and introducing him to the manual. Fred learned
about the nature and function of anxiety, as well as developed insight into his learning history that
contributed to his anxious beliefs about himself and the world. Fred acknowledged struggling with
the concept of automatic thoughts but agreed to engage in the self-monitoring assignments in-
cluding the “Worry Record” to help him recognize and identify his automatic thoughts, as well as
develop insight into his avoidance behaviors. Throughout the remainder of treatment, Fred
diligently completed his homework assignments and self-monitoring assessments. During this
time, Fred’s ex-girlfriend had asked if they could remain friends, which Fred declined. Fred came
to the realization that this decision was an example of his avoidance behaviors. He decided to
remain friends with his ex-girlfriend to better address his anxiety and improve his relationship with
his ex-girlfriend, especially since he would have to regularly see his ex-girlfriend as they attended
the same graduate program.

Sessions 5–8: Relaxation and Cognitive Restructuring. Fred was introduced to progressive muscle
relaxation training. It was explained to him that the goal of progressive muscle relaxation training
was to help Fred develop the ability to physically relax by focusing attention on the physical
sensation of tensing and relaxing various body parts. The importance of following the practice
outlined in the manual was stressed and that the beneﬁts would include eventually developing the
ability to relax his entire body in one step. Through use of the “Worry Record,” Fred noticed a
tendency to over-estimate his anxiety. He began noticing situations which would previously evoke

Garner and Stuart

127

a high anxiety rating were now eliciting lower levels of anxiety. Fred began developing the skills
to identify his automatic anxious thoughts. Initially, Fred struggled to understand why the au-
tomatic thoughts he identiﬁed in his Worry Records would provoke anxiety. For example,
thoughts that if he did not study he would fail the test did not feel particularly distressing. Fred was
encouraged to ask, “if this thought is true, what would it mean about me?” to get at the underlying
meaning and worry. Fred noticed themes of perfectionism, that he is not “good enough,” “un-
worthy” of others, “incompetent,” and “bad,” and responsible for the wellbeing of his loved ones,
in his anxious thoughts. Fred learned to identify the assumed risk associated with, and the
tendency to catastrophize within, his anxious thoughts. Fred began considering the probability of
these risks and worst-case-scenarios coming true and developing alternative possibilities. While
he noticed reduction in his anxiety after engaging in these cognitive restructuring skills, he would
occasionally report distress that his anxiety was not “going away.” The therapist would highlight
how the same themes of perfectionism and tendency to catastrophize were resulting in anxious
thoughts about his anxiety and encouraged Fred to utilize his cognitive restructuring skills when
experiencing these thoughts.

Sessions 9–11: Imagined Exposure. Fred continued to practice the progressive muscle relaxation
training. He reported improvement in his relaxation ratings warranting moving to the one-step,
cued recall relaxation. He initially found that he did not achieve as much relaxation with the one-
step practice and would occasionally revert to the four-muscle group practice. Fred was introduced
to imagery exposure, or the practice of imagining the worst-case scenarios without avoidance to
reduce the anxious response these images can cause. Fred picked an image to practice in session
that corresponded to an anxious thought from the prior week. Fred described the scenario in
session and rated his anxiety and the vividness of the image on a 0 (None) to 100 (Extreme) scale.
By the end of the exercise, Fred reported high levels of vividness, a 50 or higher on the 1 to 100
scale, but only achieved the highest rating of 30 on the anxiety scale. Fred was encouraged to
continue practicing the imagery exposure and to utilize memories and take the memory to the
extreme scenario to help elicit an anxious response. Fred continued to practice at home, but despite
high levels of vividness of the images (highest of 75 on a 1 to 100 scale) his anxiety levels peaked
at 40, on a 1 to 100 scale, and in subsequent practices his anxiety did not get higher than 40. Fred
and the therapist brainstormed these issues, checking that Fred was not engaging in avoidance and
that his images were speciﬁc and vivid. The therapist noted how through the process of identifying
the probability of these scenarios and developing alternative plans, these images may not be
evoking heightened anxiety because Fred has already recognized that they were not likely to occur
or were manageable. This is consistent with the inhibitory learning approach of exposure therapy
which suggests that the anxiety/fear response is due to the consistent pairing of a neutral stimulus
with an adverse stimulus (Craske et al., 2014). Thus, an important aspect of exposure therapy from
this perspective is for the patient to notice the discrepancy between their expectation and the
outcome. Craske et al. (2014) note that cognitive interventions such as cognitive restructuring
being utilized prior to or during exposure could lessen the effectiveness of exposure due to
reducing the severity of the patient’s expectations and creating a decreased mismatch between
expectancy and outcome. As a result, Craske et al. (2014) recommended such cognitive inter-
ventions occurring after the exposure portion of therapy. After several weeks of practice, without
producing high levels of anxiety, Fred and the therapist agreed Fred could discontinue the practice
to devote more time to coping skills Fred found more useful.

Fred continued to examine his anxiety utilizing the “Worry Record.” When he had difﬁculty
getting to the personal meaning of his anxious thoughts, Fred would make a point to bring these
“Worry Records” into the session to brainstorm with the therapist the personal meaning. Fred
continued to engage in his friendship with his ex-partner. He noticed urges to engage in previous

128

Clinical Case Studies 22(2)

safety behaviors such as go to her home when she was upset but would not act on these urges. Fred
began to discuss with the therapist uncertainty and confusion that his hesitancy in rekindling his
relationship with his ex-girlfriend was due to avoidance and anxiety, or a lack of intimate feelings
for her. The therapist lead Fred in a values clariﬁcation exercise where Fred described what actions
he would be engaging in if he were living a life in line with his values. The therapist noted that at
times following his values would be anxiety provoking, as often our values reveal our vulner-
abilities (Wilson & Sandoz, 2008). The therapist had Fred reﬂect on the difference between
anxiety from engaging in valued action versus anxiety from a place of worry and avoidance. Fred
was encouraged to consider his values and if a relationship with his ex-partner felt like it was
moving towards or away from those values to clarify if his hesitancy was coming from avoidance,
anxiety from trying something new but values consistent, or a lack of intimate feelings for his ex-
partner.

Phone Sessions: COVID-19

At this point in treatment, the COVID-19 pandemic hit the local area of the university psy-
chological clinic resulting in its closure. With the uncertainty of the situation, the clinic created the
policy that clients would receive the following based on level of client’s need: temporary pause in
treatment, 15-minute phone check-ins, or phone sessions. Given that Fred was two or three
sessions away from completing the manual, the therapist was allowed to complete the ﬁnal
sessions via phone sessions. Fred agreed to this plan.

Sessions 12–14: Behavioral Changes and Completion of the Manual. Fred initially reported increased
and “constant” anxiety symptoms due difﬁculties regarding his ex-girlfriend, ﬁnals, family
medical issues, and changes related to the COVID-19 pandemic including the suddenness of the
upcoming ending of treatment. He noted that he continued to practice the cued recall relaxation but
due to the increased anxiety was ﬁnding it difﬁcult to notice the reduction in physical tension.
Fred’s anxiety symptoms subsided as he continued to practice his cognitive restructuring skills.
Fred had begun to examine the behaviors he engaged in when worried and anxious, particularly
his tendency to immediately leave anxiety provoking situations or engage in safety checking
behaviors. He developed and began engaging in alternative behavioral practices such as staying in
the anxiety provoking event until he engaged in one of his coping skills (e.g., cognitive re-
structuring, cued recall relaxation). Fred and the therapist discussed information from the manual
on goal setting and problem solving to develop a plan of implementing his coping skills in anxiety
provoking situations. Fred developed a plan to continue to practice his copings skills after therapy
was terminated, including utilizing the “Worry Records” and the cued recall relaxation. The
therapist highlighted the improvements Fred had made over the course of treatment and en-
couraged him to enact his plan after treatment.

Sessions 15–21: Reinforcing Skills and Incorporating Mindfulness and Acceptance. At this point in
treatment, the university’s psychological clinic’s policy shifted so that telehealth sessions would
be the norm. Fred agreed to continue treatment and his treatment continued without interruption.
With the completion of the manual, the therapist and Fred agreed treatment would focus on Fred’s
continued practice of his cognitive restructuring and relaxation skills, while also developing and
incorporating mindfulness and acceptance into his coping skillset.

While Fred and his ex-girlfriend had explored the possibility of resuming their intimate re-
lationship, after consideration of his values Fred concluded that he did not want to resume an
intimate relationship. Fred reported he was sad about this decision, but he was comfortable in
continuing being friends with her. Fred continued to examine his anxious thoughts and utilized his

cognitive restructuring skills. Fred and the therapist began discussing mindfulness and acceptance.
Fred was introduced to mindfulness as the practice of present moment awareness with curiosity
and acceptance. He learned that acceptance is the opposite of avoidance and is an attitude of
allowing all experiences to occur without trying to control or change the experiences. Fred
explored how being caught up in his anxious thoughts prevented him from experiencing life and
kept him in the same pattern of anxiety and avoidance. He recognized his avoidance behaviors
were often inconsistent with his values. The therapist acknowledged the difference in taking an
acceptance stance compared to cognitive restructuring. The therapist encouraged Fred to consider
which approach felt most beneﬁcial in the moment, try it, and then move onto another if the ﬁrst
coping skill was not effective. It this way, Fred would develop ﬂexibility in his approach to his
anxiety rather than remain in the same ridge pattern.

Fred began practicing mindfulness and acceptance of his anxious thoughts and emotions. As he
noticed anxious thoughts, he would acknowledge the thought and remind himself that it is “just a
thought” and something separate from himself. Fred noted ﬁnding it easier to allow and accept the
anxiety related to things such as school and his future; however, he continued to experience his
anxiety with “relationships” as “bad.” In session, Fred explored the negative associations linked
with “relationships” including that he will always fail in relationships and that relationships were
ﬁlled with uncertainty. Fred realized how the fusion of these rules and judgments to “relation-
ships” was resulting in avoidance of developing and fostering intimate relationships. He began
practicing the ACT defusion technique of repeating the word “relationship” for a minute to
disentangle the meaning he had placed on the word “relationship” and open space to act according
to his values rather than avoidance. Fred also began to practice using the phrase “I’m having the
thought…” when he noticed experiencing words or thoughts that evoked painful emotions to
separate himself from his thoughts.

Sessions 22–26: Values and Flexibility in Utilizing Coping skills. Fred and the therapist returned to a
discussion about Fred’s values. Fred developed an understanding that there are times in his life
where living according to his values came with anxiety, but he accepted this anxiety because it
meant moving in accordance to his values. Fred reﬂected on the different thoughts and feelings
that were evoked when he experienced anxiety while moving towards his values versus when he
was trying to move away from the anxiety with avoidance. Fred was introduced to and encouraged
to practice “willingness” or making the choice to sit with the thoughts and emotions that comes
with choosing acceptance and working towards his values. Fred began to develop committed
actions that were in line with his values and he and the therapist would reﬂect on his committed
actions in session. Fred continued to utilize the coping skills developed throughout treatment
including cognitive restructuring, cued relaxation recall, mindfulness, and acceptance, in a ﬂexible
manner. He considered which coping skill would be most beneﬁcial given the circumstances and
which would help him move towards his values. Fred reported improvements in managing his
anxiety and a decrease in his view of remaining anxiety as “bad” or pathological. Fred and the
therapist agreed to move towards termination.

Videoconferencing Sessions: COVID-19
Sessions 27–29: Wrap Up and Termination. Fred and the therapist agreed to conduct sessions via
videoconferencing in line with the change in the clinic’s policy. Fred discussed his plans and the
coping skills he could utilize to handle anxiety as he pursues a new relationship, completes
graduate school, and completes therapy. Fred told his ex-girlfriend that he was ready to begin
dating other women. He noted the conversation was sad and difﬁcult, but he was able to sit with
those feelings and realize they were the result of mourning the end of his relationship rather than an

130

Clinical Case Studies 22(2)

indication there was something wrong with him. Fred signed up on dating applications and though
he experienced nervousness and anxiety as he began taking steps towards dating again, he reported
willingness to engage in these committed actions and move towards his values. Fred went on a
date and noted that he was able to accept the anxiety he experienced while on the date. Fred also
experienced sadness and anxiety regarding nearing completion of his graduate program but he
again reported being able to accept and not be overwhelmed by the anxiety and willingly engage in
the next steps of looking for a job. He noted feeling “bittersweet” that therapy was coming to an
end, feeling both nervous but ready to practice his skills on his own. Fred reported the biggest
changes he saw in himself was his understanding of his anxious thoughts and his increased
acceptance. Fred expressed his appreciation for the therapist’s ﬂexibility in treatment modalities
that ﬁt his needs.

Assessment of Progress

Baseline Assessment. At intake, Fred reported mild (PHQ-9 = 9) and moderate (DASS-21 De-
pression = 16) depression symptoms, and moderate (GAD-7 = 11; DASS-21 Anxiety = 12)
anxiety symptoms. He scored in the normal range for stress (DASS-21 Stress = 12). Fred scored
below average among clinical samples on the DERS (88; M = 89.33, Hallion et al., 2018) and
AAQ-II (24; M = 28.34, Bond et al., 2011), suggesting slightly better than average emotion
regulation and psychological ﬂexibility compared to clinical samples. At one month into
treatment, Fred scored below average compared to clinical samples on the PSWQ (60; M = 68.11,
Fresco et al., 2003) and WAI-SR (3.42; M = 3.8, Munder et al., 2010), suggesting slightly lower
than average symptoms of worry and therapeutic alliance compared to clinical samples.

Post-Treatment Assessment. For measures only administered at baseline and termination, Reliable
Change Index (RCI) scores were calculated to assess clinically signiﬁcant and reliable change.
Statistical signiﬁcance in changes were determined by comparing his baseline and termination
scores to means reported by general and clinical populations (Jacobson & Truax, 1991). The
difference in baseline and termination scores was divided by the standard error of measurement to
obtain the RCI. An RCI score that exceeds the z score for the 97th percentile ((cid:1)1.96 or 1.96)
indicates a change that is statistically signiﬁcant (p < .05). Fred’s termination assessment showed
signiﬁcant improvements in depression, anxiety, and stress (see Figure 1). His scores on the
DASS-21 Depression (0) and Anxiety (0) subscales dropped to the normal range, while his score
on the DASS-21 Stress (2) remained in the normal range. These changes showed statistically
signiﬁcant reductions in depression (RCI = 3.78, p < .05), anxiety (RCI = 5.20, p < .05), and stress
(RCI = 3.94, p < .05) symptoms. While Fred’s AAQ-II score reduced to 18 at termination, this
change was not statistically signiﬁcant (RCI = 6.43).

For measures administered regularly throughout treatment, Simulation Modeling Analysis
(SMA; Borckardt et al., 2008) was utilized to examine linear change in assessments through the
course of treatment. SMA is a time-series analysis technique for short time-series data which
accounts for autocorrelations among values. Slope vectors were examined to assess the linear
change in assessments. Linear regression using SPSS 27.0 were then examined to conﬁrm the
SMA results. See Figure 2 for weekly assessments (PHQ-9, GAD-7) and Figure 3 for monthly
assessments (DERS, PSWQ). For Fred’s PHQ-9 assessments, results of the regression analyses
showed time in treatment explained 55% of the variance, R2 = .551, F(1, 28) = 34.34, p < .001, and
signiﬁcantly associated with a decrease in PHQ-9 scores (β = (cid:1).742, p <.001). Fred’s PHQ-9 score
was 0 at termination, indicating “None/Minimal” depressive symptoms. Analysis of Fred’s GAD-
7 scores showed time in treatment explained 63% of the variance, R2 = .628, F(1, 28) = 47.27, p <
.001, and signiﬁcantly associated with a decrease in GAD-7 scores (β = (cid:1).792, p <.001). Fred’s

GAD-7 score of 2 at termination suggested “None to Minimum” anxiety symptoms. Fred’s PSWQ
analysis results showed time in treatment explained 75% of the variance, R2 = .752, F(1, 10) =
30.25, p < .001, and signiﬁcantly associated with a decrease in PSWQ scores (β = (cid:1).867, p <.001)
with a score of 38 at termination. Time in treatment explained 77% of the variance, R2 = .769, F(1,
10) = 33.28, p < .001, and signiﬁcantly associated with a decrease in DERS scores (β = (cid:1).877,
p <.001) with a score of 51 at termination. Last, results of the regression analysis for the WAI-SR
showed time in therapy did not signiﬁcantly associate with change in WAI-SR scores (β = (cid:1).457,

p =.135). While Fred initially showed a slightly lower than average therapeutic alliance compared
to clinical samples at the beginning of treatment, the remainder of his scores were above average.
Additionally, examination of these assessments showed increased scores on the PHQ-9, GAD-
7, PSWQ, and DERS during the time of transition from in-person therapy to phone sessions as a
result of COVID-19. However, Fred’s scores quickly returned to similar or lower levels than they
were before the switch and resumed their downward trend. Fred’s WAI-SR were not impacted
during the switch to telehealth services.

8 Complicating Factors

While Fred actively engaged in treatment, there were occasions when the therapist and Fred would
decide to spend additional sessions on a chapter of the manual rather than move forward. Fred
reported struggling with identifying his automatic anxious thoughts, especially ones that were
meaningful. As a result, the therapist and Fred agreed to spend additional sessions focusing on
identifying meaningful automatic anxious thoughts. When engaging in imagined exposure, Fred
would experience highly vivid images, but the images would not provoke equally anxious re-
sponses. Fred engaged in the practice for several weeks and he and the therapist spent several
sessions brainstorming the reason for the difﬁculty. However, he was never able to produce a
heightened anxious response. The therapist and Fred agreed that Fred could discontinue the
practice since it did not appear to be an effective exercise for Fred.

The largest complicating factor of this case is the disruption in treatment due to the COVID-19
pandemic. There were several weeks of uncertainty in the situation which caused a rush in
completing the manual via phone sessions. During the termination session, Fred noted the
difﬁculties in the shift from in-person to phone sessions including not being able to see body
language and not having a physical location that was solely dedicated to therapy. He added that
therapy felt like it improved after switching to videoconferencing session.

9 Access and Barriers to Care
Fred’s graduate program provided ﬁnancial support for their students to receive care through the
university psychological clinic, thus eliminating ﬁnancial costs as a barrier for care. As Fred and
the therapist were both students, their schedules only overlapped by one day. Thus, if either could
not meet on their scheduled day, then they were unable to reschedule for a different day that week.
Furthermore, Fred would often use breaks in the university schedule to return home to visit his
family. This resulted in several cancelations over the course of treatment.

10 Follow-Up

A follow-up session was conducted one month after termination. Fred reported managing his
anxiety utilizing his coping skills and has continued to willingly engage in committed actions
despite anxieties related to dating and his future career. He added that he has accepted that anxiety
is a part of his life rather than something he wished was gone from his life. Fred reviewed his plans
to continue managing his anxiety and engage in committed action.

Analyses of follow-up assessments showed Fred’s AAQ-II score slightly increased with a score
of 18 at termination to 19 at one-month follow-up. The change in his AAQ-II score from baseline
assessment was not signiﬁcant (RCI = 6.43). SMA and corresponding linear regression analyses
were examined to see linear progression of assessments from beginning of treatment to one-month
follow-up (See Figures 2 and 3). Time in treatment signiﬁcantly associated with a decrease in
PHQ-9 scores (β = (cid:1).717, p <.001) and GAD-7 scores (β = (cid:1).764, p <.001). Fred’s anxiety (GAD-
7 = 2) and depression (PHQ-9 = 0) remained at “None to Minimal” levels at one-month follow-up.
Time in treatment also signiﬁcantly associated with a decrease in PSWQ scores (β = (cid:1).832,
p <.001) and DERS scores (β = (cid:1).825, p <.001), but was not signiﬁcantly associated with change
in WAI-SR scores (β = .044, p =.902). Fred’s worry and emotion dysregulation rose slightly from
termination (PSWQ = 38; DERS = 51) at one-month follow-up (PSWQ = 46; DERS = 56), while
his WAI-SR score remained the same (4.67).

11 Treatment Implications of the Case
Both CBT and mindfulness- and acceptance-based therapies demonstrated efﬁcacy in the
treatment of GAD (Carpenter et al., 2018; Hoffman et al., 2012; Stefan et al., 2019). Blending the
two approaches may be beneﬁcial in that it increases the patient’s coping skills repertoire and
psychological ﬂexibility (Blackledge, 2018; Ciarrochi & Bailey, 2008; Wenzel, 2018). The current
case study provides evidence of the feasibility and efﬁcacy of a blended CBT/ACT approach for
GAD. Fred’s depressive and anxiety symptoms, emotion dysregulation, and worry signiﬁcantly
decreased throughout treatment and at follow-up. His AAQ-II score reduction did not signiﬁcantly
change and increased slightly at follow-up, suggesting Fred may have beneﬁted from additional
time devoted to ACT interventions. Only one prior study demonstrated the feasibility and beneﬁt
of incorporating ACT into CBT for GAD (Carrier & Cˆot´e, 2010). However, this study only had
three participants. Future research should examine the efﬁcacy of an integrated approach in larger,
diverse samples. Additionally, this case study examined the efﬁcacy of treatment and the ther-
apeutic alliance during the switch from in-person to telehealth. Fred did show a slight increase in
depressive and anxiety symptoms, emotion dysregulation, and worry during the transition from in-
person to telehealth, but this temporary increase quickly subsided. The therapeutic alliance was
not impacted during the transition. This suggests that the shift from in-person to telehealth did not
negatively impact the efﬁcacy of treatment or the therapeutic relationship. It should be noted that
the therapeutic alliance was high prior to the shift. It is possible that the strength of the therapeutic

134

alliance and frequent communication with Fred regarding the changes in clinic policy helped
ameliorate potential problems.

12 Recommendations to Clinicians and Students
The current case study suggests students and clinicians should consider using a ﬂexible approach
in treating GAD. Students and clinicians should consider the techniques in CBT and ACT that
would beneﬁt the patient given their case conceptualization and treatment plan. Both cognitive
restructuring and cognitive defusion skills can be incorporated within the same treatment when
they are framed as different ways of approaching thoughts that may be beneﬁcial in certain
situations versus others. Clinicians and students should take the time to address any confusion by
their clients when incorporating both approaches and help their patients develop an understanding
of when one technique may be more beneﬁcial than the other. Furthermore, ﬂexibility in how the
treatment is implemented whether it is in-person or telehealth should be considered given the
patient’s case conceptualization, treatment plan, and other external factors.
