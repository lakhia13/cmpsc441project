Abstract

Adult attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) often co-occurs with substance use 
disorders (SUD) and is associated with early onset and more severe development of SUD and with 
reduced treatment effectiveness. Screening tools allow for a good recognition of possible ADHD 
in adults with SUD and should be used routinely, followed by an ADHD diagnostic process 
initiated as soon as possible. Simultaneous and integrated treatment of ADHD and SUD, using a 
combination of pharmaco- and psychotherapy, is recommended. Long-acting methylphenidate, 
extended-release amphetamines, and atomoxetine with up-titration to higher dosages may be 
considered in patients unresponsive to standard doses. This paper includes evidence- and 
consensus-based recommendations developed to provide guidance in the screening, diagnosis and 
treatment of patients with ADHD-SUD comorbidity.

Introduction

Comorbidity of Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder and Substance Use Disorders

Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a childhood neurodevelopmental disorder 
that can persist into adulthood [1]. ADHD is strongly associated with the development of 
substance use disorders (SUD), often at a very early age and with a faster transition from 
less severe to more serious SUD [2]. Patients with ADHD-SUD comorbidity show more 
complex and chronic patterns of substance use, including more poly-substance use, than 
adults with SUD without comorbid ADHD [1, 3]. They also present with greater psychiatric 
comorbidity, such as antisocial personality disorder, borderline personality disorder, anxiety 
disorders, bipolar disorders and/or post-traumatic stress disorders [4]. Despite being in 
treatment more often, adults with ADHD-SUD comorbidity have more difficulties remaining 
abstinent [5] and report a reduced quality of life with more professional, social and personal 
problems [6]. On a pharmacological level, several studies report lower effectiveness of 
standard-dose pharmacotherapy for the treatment of ADHD in patients with ADHD-SUD 
comorbidity [7].

In summary, ADHD-SUD comorbidity is associated with multiple problems and reduced 
effectiveness of standard treatments, making proper diagnosis and successful treatment in 
adults with ADHD and SUD a challenge.

Prevalence of ADHD and SUD

ADHD is associated with an increased risk of developing SUD later in life [8]. ADHD-SUD 
comorbidity is highly prevalent in addiction care: in a meta-analysis of 29 studies, 23.1% of 
patients with SUD also had adult ADHD [9]. The prevalence of ADHD depends on the type 
of substance of abuse, the setting (e.g., outpatient versus inpatient) and the diagnostic 
procedure (e.g., screening questionnaire versus structured clinical interview). In a large 
international study, 13.9% of treatment seeking SUD patients had a DSM-IV diagnosis of 
adult ADHD [10]. Age, gender, ethnicity and primary substance of abuse do not seem to 
systematically impact the prevalence rate of ADHD in SUD patients [10].

Aim and Objective of the Consensus Statement

This consensus statement was developed as a practical guide to assist professionals with the 
screening, diagnosis and treatment of adult patients with SUD and ADHD. The consensus 
statement is for patients and clinicians: general practitioners, psychiatrists, psychologists and 
other health professionals involved with alcohol and/or drug-dependent patients.

PubMed, Cinahl and Psychinfo were searched for articles published January 1994 to 
December 2015 using the terms “drug abuse,” “substance use,” “addiction,” “dependence” 
and “ADHD,” limited to articles published in English, French and Dutch. Simultaneously, 
we searched for existing guidelines in Clinical Evidence, CEBAM, NHS Guideline finder, 
Cochrane library, NICE, National Guideline Clearinghouse and GIN database. All retrieved 
articles and relevant cross-references were reviewed.

A flowchart of the search of articles is presented in Figure 1. Publications were discarded if 
they did not include adults; if ADHD or SUD was not the primary diagnosis; if they were 
reviews prior to a meta-analysis; if they were personal opinion papers; and if they were 
study protocols. The statements in this consensus text are based primarily on scientific 
evidence from available publications (n = 212; online suppl. Material 1, see 
www.karger.com/doi/10.1159/000487767). When scientific evidence was lacking, a 
consensus was sought from the opinions of experts in the field, which is stated specifically 
in the main text when this was the case. To provide guidance on the strength of the evidence, 
the final recommendations summarized in Table 1 are assigned a rating based on the 
evidence quality score from the SIGN grading system. In the addendum to this main text, the 
full list of references that constitute the basis of this consensus statement can be found.

This consensus statement covers 2 main topics, (i) screening and diagnosis of ADHD and 
SUD and (ii) treatment of ADHD and SUD. This consensus statement was primarily 
developed from the perspective of adults with SUD and underlying ADHD, assessed in 
addiction services. The statements below are also valid for ADHD patients with SUD 
assessed in other mental health services.

Work on this consensus statement started with a Belgian guideline for the treatment of 
ADHD and SUD, supplemented by a Dutch guideline for the treatment of adults with 
ADHD and a Dutch Guideline on ADHD-SUD in adolescents [11–14]. No other guidelines 
were retrieved from our search. The first draft was developed by the Belgian and Dutch 
representatives of the International Collaboration on ADHD and Substance Abuse (ICASA: 
FM, CLC, WvdB, GvdG) and was circulated to ICASA members present at meetings in 
Stockholm (13 experts), Brussels (18 experts) and Budapest (21 experts), where it was 
discussed. The final statement was written by the Belgian ICASA members (CLC, FM) and 
adapted and approved by the other members.

Consensus Statement for the Screening and Diagnosis of ADHD and SUD

Screening

ADHD has a significant impact on the development and course of SUD and early detection 
is of key importance for successful treatment. The high prevalence of ADHD in people with 
SUD, along with the fact that many patients will not spontaneously mention symptoms of 
ADHD and focus on their SUD problems, makes it important to always screen for the 
presence of ADHD. Several screening tools are available for use in adults with ADHD and

SUD comorbidity. In Table 1, we present an overview of the currently used and validated 
screening tools.

The Short Version of the Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale (ASRS-SV) screener is currently 
the most widely used and investigated screening tool in individuals with ADHD and 
comorbid SUD, with good sensitivity and specificity across studies (Table 1). Similarly, 
screening with Conners’ Adult ADHD Rating Scale, Wender Utah Rating Scale, or 
Attention Deficit Scales for Adults also allows for a good recognition of possible ADHD 
(Table 1), but they take longer to complete. A positive screening result should always lead to 
further diagnostic assessments. Nevertheless, up to 20% of patients with ADHD are missed 
when using a single screener. Therefore, if time and budget allow this within the health care 
service, we recommend combining 2 screening instruments. Patients clinically suspected of 
having ADHD – even with a negative screening result – should always receive an extended 
diagnostic assessment.

Difficulties and Concerns When Diagnosing Adult ADHD in Patients with SUD

The risk of both under-diagnosing and over-diagnosing ADHD in adult SUD populations is 
a point of concern. The strictness of the DSM-IV (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of 
Mental Disorders, 4th Edition) criteria, maintaining that ADHD had to occur independent of 
other disorders, could complicate the diagnosis of ADHD in adults with SUD and lead to 
under-diagnosis [15]. Also, adult patients with SUD often have more difficulties in 
remembering the early history of ADHD symptoms [15]. Therefore, ADHD can erroneously 
be overlooked in this population. Additionally, if an individual with SUD was not diagnosed 
with ADHD as a child, it is less likely that the behaviour as an adult will be linked to 
ADHD, because these are associated with intoxication, withdrawal or the (interpersonal) 
consequences of substance abuse [15]. As ADHD is mostly not the reason why patients with 
SUD seek treatment [16], it is the clinician’s task to address and recognize ADHD in these 
patients. Finally, many consequences of ADHD (job loss, poor school performance) are also 
seen in patients with SUD, and they can be erroneously attributed to substance abuse. Adults 
with ADHD are often dealing with the symptoms for many years and have developed 
compensation strategies that limit the impact and/or mask the symptoms [17]. Less frequent, 
but important, is the problem of over-diagnosing ADHD in SUD patients, that is, when SUD 
symptoms are erroneously attributed to ADHD. It is important that ADHD symptoms also 
occur in settings, situations and stages of life without substance use. Over-diagnosing can 
also occur when the continuity of symptoms from childhood to adulthood is overlooked or 
when substance-induced symptoms or withdrawal symptoms are perceived as ADHD 
symptoms. Therefore, it is recommended that developmental history, psychiatric co-
morbidity and family history are all addressed. Finally, patients may exaggerate ADHD 
symptoms to obtain prescription stimulants for abuse or diversion. For all these reasons, a 
follow-up evaluation of ADHD symptoms during SUD treatment is recommended in order 
to reduce the risk of misdiagnosis [18].

Diagnosis should consist of the following necessary steps similar to those needed for the 
diagnosis of ADHD in an adult population without SUD: an examination of current ADHD 
symptoms, ADHD symptoms during childhood, family history of ADHD and SUD, school

and occupational history, marriage, physical signs and comorbidity [19]. It is important to 
include environmental and psychosocial factors in the broad sense of the term in the 
diagnostic process. These are factors that could have protective or risk-enhancing effects on 
the functioning of the individual. Moreover, to be diagnosed with ADHD according to 
DSM-5, some symptoms are required to have occurred before age 12. For confirmation, a 
collateral history can be taken with someone who knows the patient well (e.g., parents or 
siblings).

Who Is Qualified to Make an ADHD Diagnosis?

An essential requirement for a correctly performed ADHD diagnosis is that the 
diagnostician must be knowledgeable and competent. The literature argues towards a 
targeted training on the dual-diagnosis of ADHD and SUD [20]. The expert group 
recommends that a physician or clinical psychologist can make the diagnosis of ADHD in 
SUD patients, provided he/she has received extensive training on the differential diagnosis 
of ADHD, has experience in addiction care, and has experience with adult ADHD 
populations.

When Should the Diagnostic Process Start?

The expert group suggests starting the diagnostic process as soon as possible: (i) when there 
are no serious withdrawal symptoms and (ii) when there is no serious intoxication. Clinical 
history taking, observation and screening can be started earlier. If feasible, one can include a 
period of abstinence, determined by the clinical experience of the diagnostician and taking 
into account the setting in which the patient is treated and the drug(s) abused. The 
preliminary diagnosis must be verified in the course of treatment, as the presentation of 
ADHD symptoms can change with successful SUD treatment. A good follow-up prevents 
over- or under-diagnosis and it is therefore essential to continue monitoring the patient.

Current ADHD Symptoms and Clinical History Taking in Adults with SUD

The diagnosis of ADHD should be part of a medical-psychiatric examination, and include a 
thorough investigation of current symptoms (using diagnostic instruments), (collateral) 
history taking (elements from childhood, family history, educational and occupational 
history, marriage, etc.) and additional examinations (for comorbidity and differential 
diagnosis).

Collateral history taking on current and childhood symptoms is essential to obtain 
information from another perspective. Memories are not always easy to recall, and involving 
family members (and significant others) may be helpful. Also, parents’ memory is not 
always reliable [21]. In a population of adults with SUD, obtaining information regarding 
past experiences is even more difficult. The patient may be reluctant to share their contact 
information or the family may be unwilling to cooperate. In such cases, objective childhood 
data can be obtained through, for example, school reports and by paying particular attention 
to comments made by former teachers [19]. Symptoms associated with the patient’s 
substance use may be erroneously identified as ADHD symptoms, and it is therefore 
recommended to focus on alcohol- and drug-free periods in the patient’s life.

Diagnostic interviews such as Conners’ Adult ADHD Diagnostic Interview for the DSM-IV 
(CAADID) can be used to aid the diagnosis. The CAADID is often used as the gold standard 
for the diagnosis of adult ADHD in patients with SUD [22]. The Diagnostic Interview for 
ADHD in adults (DIVA) can be administered in the presence of the partner and relatives to 
simultaneously collect past history and collateral past history information but is not yet 
validated in adults with SUD. The Psychiatric Research Interview for Substance and Mental 
Disorders (PRISM) is a semi-structured interview that focuses on comorbid psychiatric 
diagnoses and is based on the DSM-IV criteria for axis 1 and II disorders, including ADHD 
[22]. In 80 patients with SUD (40 with and 40 without ADHD), the PRISM had a sensitivity 
of 80% and a specificity of 88% for the detection of ADHD, compared to CAADID [22].

Assessing (History of) Substance Abuse in Adult ADHD Patients

Personal interview is the best way to establish a history of substance abuse and the related 
disruptions in different life domains (social, schooling, work). This may be supplemented by 
a toxicological confirmation, for example, in urine, blood or hair samples.

Two generally accepted screening instruments are the Drug Abuse Screening Test and the 
Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test. Both were investigated for their construct validity 
and reliability and results indicate they are acceptable screening instruments in adults with 
ADHD [23].

Consensus Statement for the Treatment of ADHD and SUD

Treatment of ADHD in Adults with SUD

Proper treatment of ADHD in people with SUD comprises several components, including 
psycho-education, pharmacotherapy, individual and/or group cognitive and behavioral 
therapy, as well as peer support [24]. In adults with ADHD and SUD, research suggests the 
usefulness of combined pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy [25–26].

The treatment of ADHD should be integrated in the treatment of SUD and vice versa [26]. 
This is important because ADHD symptoms can interfere with SUD treatment and/or SUD 
can complicate the treatment of ADHD. It is advisable to first start SUD treatment, followed 
by ADHD treatment as soon as possible thereafter [27]. When the SUD is too severe, brief 
residential treatment may be appro priate. One should keep in mind that effective treatment 
of ADHD would usually not result in improvement of SUD, hence the importance of 
effectively treating both disorders.

Pharmacotherapy

Studies show that medication is moderately effective in reducing ADHD symptoms in 
patients with ADHD-SUD comorbidity (mean standardized effect size 0.40–0.50). On the 
other hand, medication has more positive effects when combined with psychotherapy, while 
ADHD pharmaco-therapy by itself is generally not effective in reducing the use of 
substances and is associated with a higher frequency of adverse effects and treatment 
discontinuation [7, 27].

Non-randomized studies showed some promise for the improvement of both ADHD and 
SUD, but the more recent double blind and placebo-controlled trials were less positive. Open 
trials in ADHD-SUD patients provided some evidence for the effectiveness of bupropion to 
reduce ADHD symptoms, but this is contradicted in a small controlled study showing no 
effect over placebo in the treatment of ADHD with SUD [28]. In several studies, ADHD 
symptoms seemed to show improvement across all groups, indicating that there is an 
important placebo effect associated with either expectation and/or the effect of the 
psychotherapy provided in all treatment conditions.

Controlled randomized trials with short- and long-acting standard doses of methylphenidate 
either show to neither improve ADHD and SUD symptoms or to improve ADHD symptoms 
but not drug use [28–31]. However, caution should be taken with the interpretation of 
negative results, because some of these studies showed promise with regard to SUD 
outcomes in secondary analyses [31–33]. Two studies with higher doses of methylphenidate 
(up to 180 mg/day) showed a decrease in ADHD symptoms and a decrease in the reinforcing 
effects and the use of cocaine and amphetamines (and other drugs) in adult stimulant-
dependent ADHD patients [34–35]. Also, robust doses of extended-release mixed 
amphetamine (60 and 80 mg/day) showed substantial reductions in both ADHD and drug 
use in cocaine-dependent patients with ADHD [35]. Pemoline had a significant effect on 
ADHD symptoms, but not on drug use [33]. Atomoxetine resulted in a significant reduction 
on ADHD symptoms, and was associated with a decrease in alcohol craving and 
consumption [32].

Safety of Pharmacological ADHD Treatment in Adults with Comorbid SUD

Prescribing stimulants to individuals with SUD remains controversial and many clinicians 
are reluctant to prescribe proper ADHD treatment in individuals with SUD. While 
stimulants can be effective in treating those with ADHD and SUD, particularly at higher 
doses [34–35], there is the clear risk of misuse and diversion of stimulants and this cannot be 
overstated. It is also important to recognize that this risk may differ by patient 
characteristics. Two groups that are at substantial risk include adolescents and young adults 
[36], although adults are not immune from misusing or abusing their medication. 
Importantly, long-acting formulations, particularly osmotic-release oral system formulations 
of methylphenidate (OROS-MPH) and lisdexam-phetamine, have considerably lower rates 
of misuse and diversion compared to immediate-release preparations [37].

Adverse events are not increased in ADHD patients with SUD compared to when giving 
stimulants to ADHD patients without SUD [38]. The literature does not mention severe 
complications or increases in substance abuse with prescribing central stimulants in this 
patient population [27]. However, a dose-dependent interaction between disulfiram and 
methylphenidate resulting in psychotic episodes has been described [39]. Finally, the use of 
stimulant treatment for ADHD does not precipitate the onset of SUD in adults without 
previous SUD [40]. In SUD patients, treatment of ADHD can be useful to reduce ADHD 
symptoms without worsening the SUD [41] and should not be avoided.

Regarding prevention of SUD, stimulant treatment of children with ADHD may have some 
protective effects on the development of SUD if children receive stimulant treatment from a 
young age and for a long enough time [42].

Taken together, clinicians need to be circumspect when prescribing stimulants, particularly 
among high-risk populations. However, abuse and diversion can be reduced by close 
monitoring, use of longer acting formulations, and engaging in a discussion with patients on 
the importance of safeguarding their medication. As with any prescription of controlled 
substances, the clinician must weigh the risk of abuse/diversion versus the medication’s 
potential therapeutic benefit. After careful deliberation of these factors, the prescriber must 
use his/her clinical judgement regarding whether it is reasonable to initiate or to continue 
stimulant pharmacotherapy.

Treatment Retention

Treatment retention is an important difficulty in the treatment of SUD, particularly in SUD 
patients with ADHD [5]. Patients often regard ADHD treatment as a sign of recognition of 
their problems, potentially increasing treatment retention. Under-diagnosing ADHD in SUD 
patients may result in problems with compliance and SUD treatment retention. Medication 
that takes effect only after a few weeks (e.g., atomoxetine) may also be a reason for 
continued substance use and drop out.

In patients with ADHD, severity of SUD – rather than the mere presence of ADHD – is a 
predictive factor for treatment outcome [43]. Adult ADHD-SUD patients treated with 
methylphenidate have better retention in treatment than ADHD patients who receive placebo 
[44]. Higher doses of methylphenidate are also associated with better long-term treatment 
adherence [45].

Non-Pharmacological Interventions

There are few studies on non-pharmacological treatment of patients with both ADHD and 
SUD. Clinicians should consider therapy with a focus on overlapping symptoms as part of a 
multimodal treatment approach including psychotherapy and medication [25–26, 46]. Data 
collection of the first randomized controlled trial comparing integrated cognitive behavioral 
therapy (ICBT) with standard CBT for patients with both SUD and ADHD has been 
finalized and 2 case reports are available, while results are expected in 2018 [47]. In a 
qualitative study, patients with ADHD and SUD mention their wish for a coaching attitude 
[48]. A dialectic behavioral therapy-based skills training for adults with ADHD and SUD is 
also described, with varying results regarding efficacy [49]. A Belgian guideline that 
presents a practical approach for the non-pharmacological treatment of adult ADHD in 
patients with SUD was published [50]. Other non-pharmacological interventions, such as 
individual coaching, structured skills training, dialectic behavioural therapy and 
mindfulness-based therapy are not yet investigated in the context of ADHD-SUD 
comorbidity.

Discussion

Page 9

Given the high prevalence of ADHD in SUD patients, all patients in addiction care should be 
screened for the presence of adult ADHD. The ASRS, the Wender Utah Rating Scale and the 
Conners’ Adult ADHD Rating Scale have been sufficiently validated as screeners. If the 
screening result is positive or if ADHD is clinically suspected, a physician or clinical 
psychologist with specialist training on the differential diagnosis of ADHD and experience 
in addiction care should initiate a more extensive diagnostic examination. The use of 
questionnaires and semi-structured interviews can be useful for diagnosis. To date, no semi-
structured ADHD interview has been sufficiently validated in a population with ADHD and 
SUD. Diagnostic examination should be complemented with observation and (collateral) 
history taking, including a good follow-up to reduce the risk of over- or under-diagnosis. 
Partner and siblings can provide information on the patient’s former and current symptoms, 
but also school records and comments by former teachers can be useful. An extensive 
description of the patient’s current and past substance use can best be determined by 
focusing on drug- and alcohol-free periods in the patient’s life.

This consensus statement refers to the diagnosis and treatment of ADHD among treatment-
seeking SUD patients. However, more than one third of these patients are also affected by 
other comorbidities [4], which mostly have been clinically diagnosed or even systematically 
evaluated even before ADHD is considered. For example, van Emmerik-van Oortmerssen et 
al. [4] showed that having an ADHD diagnosis as a SUD patient doubles the likelihood of 
having an additional psychiatric diagnosis to more than 75%, making ADHD a highly 
relevant risk factor for additional comorbidities. Therefore, detecting and treating ADHD is 
the focus of this consensus statement.

Treatment of ADHD patients with SUD remains a challenge. Controlled trials show 
moderate improvements in ADHD symptoms upon pharmacological ADHD treatment in 
ADHD-SUD patients. However, pharmacotherapy should not be avoided and should be 
critically encouraged in patients with ADHD and SUD with a preference for high doses of 
long-acting stimulants in ADHD patients with stimulant use disorders or atomoxetine in 
patients with alcohol use disorder. Treatment of ADHD can be useful to reduce ADHD 
symptoms without worsening the SUD. One should consider treating both ADHD and SUD 
with their own medication simul taneously, that is, for patients with ADHD and an alcohol 
use disorder, one may consider treatment with atomoxetine and with naltrexone, nalmafene, 
acomprosate or topiramate. A multimodal integrated approach, combining pharmacotherapy 
(for ADHD and SUD) with a non-pharmacological intervention that targets both the ADHD 
and SUD, such as an integrated CBT, is warranted but further research is needed. Table 2 
summarizes the key diagnostic and treatment recommendations.

Summary of key points from the consensus statement

Table 2

Level of evidence* Recommendation level*

Diagnosis

The ASRS is the most extensively tested screener and performs well as a screening tool for 
ADHD in adults with SUD, but some other instruments have also shown promise (e.g., 
WURS).

2+

The diagnostic process should be started as soon as possible, keeping in mind that the 
diagnostic process is a continuous one. A good follow-up prevents over- or under-diagnosis 
of ADHD in patients with SUD.

A physician or clinical psychologist can make the diagnosis of ADHD provided that he/she 
has received extensive training on the differential diagnosis of ADHD, has experience in 
addiction care, and has experience with adult ADHD populations.

Clinicians should consider the diagnosis of ADHD unspecified and consider ADHD 
treatment when adult ADHD symptoms are present with sufficient severity.

If possible, involve the patients’ parents, partner and/or relatives to assess former and current 
symptomatology and assess functional impairments. Additional information can be gathered 
from school records and comments added by former teachers.

The diagnostic process should include current and past substance use (frequency and 
quantity of use, social context).

Focus on drug- and alcohol-free periods in the patient’s life during (collateral) history 
taking.

Treatment

Consider adequate medical treatment of both ADHD and SUD.

Always consider a combination of psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy.

Integrate the ADHD and other psychiatric comorbidity treatment with SUD treatment as 
soon as possible.

Psychotherapy, preferentially targeting the combination of ADHD and SUD, should be 
considered.

Long-acting methylphenidate, extended-release amphetamines, and atomoxetine are 
effective in the treatment of comorbid ADHD and SUD, and up-titration to higher dosages 
may be considered in some patients. The abuse potential is limited with long-acting agents.

Caution and careful clinical management is needed to prevent abuse and diversion of 
prescribed stimulants.

The recommendations are assigned a rating according to the quality of the evidence on which they are based, using the SIGN grading system 
based on level of evidence ranging from 1++ (meta-analyses or systemic reviews of RCTs) to 4 (expert opinion; SIGN, 2001). A, at least one meta-
analysis, systematic review, or RCT rated as 1++, and directly applicable to the target population or a body of evidence consisting principally of 
studies rated as 1+, directly applicable to the target population, and demonstrating overall consistency of results; B, body of evidence including 
studies rated as 2++, directly applicable to the target population, and demonstrating overall consistency of results or Extrapolated evidence from 
studies rated as 1++ or 1+; C, A body of evidence including studies rated as 2+, directly applicable to the target population and demonstrating 
overall consistency of results or Extrapolated evidence from studies rated as 2++; D, evidence level 3 or 4 or Extrapolated evidence from studies 
rated as 2+.
