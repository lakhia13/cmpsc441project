Abstract

Importance:  Impaired cognitive functioning is a core characteristic of schizophrenia, present 
from the onset of the illness and relatively stable thereafter. Despite evidence supporting 
the impact of early intervention services (EIS) on improving symptoms and functioning in 
first episode psychosis (FEP), controlled research has not examined its impact on cognitive 
functioning. To evaluate the longitudinal course of cognitive functioning in FEP patients 
participating in a large, controlled study comparing EIS with usual services.

Methods:  A total of 404 persons ages 15–40 years old with non-affective FEP participated in the 
Recovery After Initial Schizophrenia-Early Treatment Program. A cluster randomized controlled 
trial was conducted with 34 community mental health treatment centers across the US randomized 
to provide either an EIS program (NAVIGATE) or usual Community Care (CC) to FEP patients 
for 2 years. Cognitive functioning was assessed with the Brief Assessment of Cognition in 
Schizophrenia (BACS) at baseline and 1- and 2-years later.

Results:  Older participants (≥20 years old) in both treatment groups improved on all BACS tests. 
Younger participants (15–19) in NAVIGATE improved significantly more on Digit Sequencing 
(working memory) than those in CC, whereas both groups improved on most of the other 
BACS tests. Improvements in cognitive functioning occurred mostly over the first year and were 
correlated with reductions in symptom severity.

Discussion:  EIS do not improve cognitive functioning more than usual care for older FEP 
patients but may improve working memory in younger FEP patients. Interventions targeting 
cognition may be required to enhance cognitive functioning in most FEP patients.

1. 

Introduction

The first episode of non-affective psychosis (FEP) represents a unique opportunity for the 
delivery of interventions that have the potential to improve the long-term trajectory of 
schizophrenia (Birchwood et al., 1998; McGorry and Killackey, 2002). In recent years, 
consensus has emerged as to the critical elements of comprehensive treatment of FEP, 
referred to as coordinated specialty care (Heinssen et al., 2014) or early intervention 
for psychosis (McGorry, 2015) programs. The defining characteristics of these programs 
include a multidisciplinary treatment team focused on FEP that provides a coordinated 
set of interventions (Addington et al., 2018; Addington et al., 2013), typically including 
individualized pharmacological treatment, family psychoeducation, cognitive behavioral 
therapy, assistance with pursuing work and school goals, and case management.

Evidence supports the effectiveness of early intervention programs for the FEP population. 
A meta-analysis and meta-regression of ten randomized controlled trials including 2176 
patients comparing early intervention services with usual community treatment found 
that early intervention programs were more effective at retaining patients in treatment 
and preventing hospitalizations over 9–24 months of follow-up, as well as significantly 
greater improvements in overall symptom severity, positive and negative symptom severity, 
and work or school functioning programs (Correll et al., 2018). However, while research 
supports the beneficial effects of early intervention programs for FEP for a range of clinical 
and psychosocial outcomes, less is known about their impact on cognitive functioning. This 
is an important question for several reasons.

Impaired cognitive functioning is a cardinal feature of schizophrenia (Kahn and Keefe, 
2013). A decline in cognitive functioning precedes the onset of FEP (Carrión et al., 
2018; MacCabe et al., 2013), and by the time frank psychotic symptoms emerge marked 
cognitive impairments are already evident (Mesholam-Gately et al., 2009). Research on the 
longitudinal course of cognitive functioning in FEP indicates that the severity of cognitive 
impairment is relatively stable over two to ten years following the onset of psychosis 
(Bozikas and Andreou, 2011; Sánchez-Torres et al., 2018; Townsend and Norman, 2004), 
with the possible exception of worsening verbal memory (Barder et al., 2013; Torgalsbøen 
et al., 2015; Zanelli et al., 2019). Impaired cognitive functioning in FEP is a potent 
predictor of reduced social and role functioning, even after controlling for symptom severity 
and duration of untreated psychosis (Cowman et al., 2021). Thus, compromised cognitive 
functioning in FEP has important implications for functional recovery (Santesteban-Echarri 
et al., 2017). Despite this, treatments targeting cognition are not a defining component of 
early interventions for psychosis (Heinssen et al., 2014; McGorry, 2015).

Understanding the impact of early intervention programs for FEP on cognitive functioning 
could inform the need for cognitive remediation as an adjunctive intervention for this 
population. Although research documents the significant clinical and functional benefits of

early intervention programs compared to usual services (Correll et al., 2018), changes in 
cognitive functioning have not been reported in these studies. The present paper addresses 
this question by reporting the two-year cognitive outcomes of a large, controlled trial 
comparing an early intervention program for FEP to usual services.

2.  Methods

The data were drawn from the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) sponsored 
initiative, Recovery After an Initial Schizophrenia Episode – Early Treatment Program 
(RAISE–ETP) project, a cluster randomized controlled trial for FEP comparing the effects 
of an early intervention program (the NAVIGATE program) with usual community care 
over a two-year period for individuals with a recent FEP. The background to the project, 
description of the NAVIGATE program, and primary findings have been published (Kane 
et al., 2015; Kane et al., 2016; Mueser et al., 2015). The cognitive outcome data reported 
here have not been previously published. The study was approved by local Institutional 
Review Boards of the participating sites. All participants provided signed informed consent 
(or guardians provided consent for participants under age 18). Progress of the study was 
overseen by a NIMH Data Safety and Monitoring Board.

2.1.  Sites and Participants

A total of 34 sites providing routine community mental health services were randomly 
assigned to provide either the NAVIGATE program or continue to provide usual community 
care (CC) services (17 sites each condition). The sites were selected following a national 
search based on the following criteria: experience treating schizophrenia; interest in offering 
early intervention services for FEP; sufficient staff to implement the NAVIGATE program; 
ability to recruit a sufficient number of study participants; and institutional assurance that the 
research assessments would be conducted. Sites with existing early intervention programs 
for FEP and academic centers were excluded.

Inclusion criteria were: between ages of 16 and 40 years old; experiencing a first episode 
of psychosis (i.e., first experience of psychotic symptoms in absence of full symptom 
remission); ≤6 months of antipsychotic medication; diagnosis of schizophreniform disorder, 
schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, psychosis NOS, or brief psychotic disorder; and 
fluent in English. Exclusion criteria were: psychosis due to affective psychosis or a general 
medical condition; diagnosis of substance-induced psychosis; clinically significant head 
trauma; or other serious medical conditions. A total of 404 participants met inclusion/
exclusion criteria for the study. The characteristics of the study participants are provided in 
Table 1.

2.2.  Measures

Measures cited in this paper are described below; for the complete list of measures 
administered in the study, see Kane et al. (2016). Diagnostic assessment was conducted 
at baseline only, using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (First et al., 1996), 
by trained interviewers using two-way live video conferencing, which has been shown 
to be a reliable assessment format (Zarate et al., 1997). Symptom severity was similarly

assessed with video conferencing at baseline and every six months for two years with the 
Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) (Kay et al., 1987), with subscale scores 
(positive, negative, disorganized, depressed, excited) based on the Wallwork et al. (2012) 
factor structure.

Neurocognitive functioning was assessed at baseline, and one and two years later (using 
alternate forms) by trained research assistants at each site using the Brief Assessment of 
Cognition in Schizophrenia (BACS) (Keefe et al., 2004). The BACS assesses six areas of 
cognitive functioning and requires approximately 20–30 min to administer. For participants 
over age 20, age- and gender-normed T-scores were computed for each test and the overall 
composite score. No norms are available for the BACS for individuals under age 20.

Verbal learning/Verbal Memory was assessed with a list learning task in which 15 words 
were read aloud on each of 5 presentations; the total words recalled over all the 5 trials is the 
dependent measure (range: 0–75).

Working memory was assessed with a Digit Sequencing task in which participants were read 
increasingly longer strings of numbers and were required to recall the numbers and place 
them in order from lowest to highest; the number of number strings correctly recalled is the 
dependent measure (range 0–28).

Motor speed was assessed with a Token Motor task which required the participant to use 
both hands to place two tokens into a bucket at a time as quickly as possible in 60 s; the total 
number of tokens correctly placed into the bucket is the dependent measure (range: 0–100).

Verbal fluency was assessed with the Category Instances and Controlled Word Association 
Tests, which required the participant to name as many words as possible in 60 s within a 
given category (e.g., supermarket items); the total number of correct words from the three 
tasks is the dependent measure.

Attention and information processing speed were measured with Symbol Coding, which 
required participants to write numerals 1–9 as matches to symbols on a response sheet for 90 
s; the number of correct numerals is the dependent measure (range: 0–100).

Executive functioning was measured with the Tower of London task, in which participants 
are shown 2 pictures simultaneously, with each picture displaying 3 balls of different colors 
on 3 pegs, with the balls in uniquely arranged in each picture. Participants were required 
to determine the total number of times colored balls in one picture needed to be moved 
to match the arrangement in the opposing picture. Twenty items are presented, with an 
opportunity for 2 bonus trials of enhanced difficulty if all 20 trials are correct (range: 0–22).

2.3.  Treatments

The 34 participating sites were randomly assigned to provide either the NAVIGATE program 
or usual community care (CC) services.

intervention service for FEP designed to be implemented in typical community mental

health centers in the U.S. The aim of the program is to help clients with an FEP and their 
families navigate the complex and often confusing pathway from psychosis to recovery 
(Mueser et al., 2015). An emphasis is placed in the program on helping clients identify 
individual goals to pursue at the beginning of the program and linking all treatment to 
those goals, as well as supporting clients’ self-determination and autonomy (Ryan and 
Deci, 2000), including shared decision-making. NAVIGATE was usually implemented by a 
five-member interdisciplinary team of mental health professionals who meet regularly and 
coordinate the delivery of four interventions: individualized pharmacological management, 
family psychoeducation, supported employment and education (SEE), and individual 
resiliency training (IRT), which is the psychotherapy component of the program. Cognitive 
remediation is not incorporated into the NAVIGATE program, although SEE specialists 
sometimes taught cognitive self-management strategies to help clients pursue their education 
or work goals. Each of the four interventions is standardized in a manual, and there is a 
shared manual for all NAVIGATE team members.

The fidelity of sites providing the NAVIGATE program was evaluated for each of four 
interventions and for the organization of the program (e.g., staffing, team meetings). All 17 
sites met criteria for acceptable fidelity to NAVIGATE (Mueser et al., 2019).

2.3.2.  Community Care (CC)—Sites randomized to CC provided treatment determined 
by clinician choice and the availability of services. CC sites were provided guidance in the 
recruitment and retention of study participants and collection of research data but received 
no supervision or training in the treatment of FEP.

2.4.  Statistical Analyses

To examine baseline differences between the younger and older participant groups we 
conducted t-tests or χ2 tests on the raw scores of the BACS tests, the PANSS total score, 
duration of untreated psychosis, and demographic variables.

Separate analyses were conducted for participants under age 20 and those 20 and over to 
explore differences in change between the two age groups. For each age group, we formed 
composite scores across all the BACS tests by standardizing the raw scores of each test at 
each assessment point by creating Z-scores using the baseline mean and standard deviation, 
and averaging the Z-scores across the subtests within each time-period. Within each age 
group, mixed-effects linear regression models were conducted for the composite score and 
the raw scores of each BACS test to examine whether the two treatment groups differed in 
change in cognition over time. Each model tested the main effects for treatment group, time, 
and the treatment group by time interaction, and based on preliminary analyses included 
gender and race (not Black/African American or other) as random effects, with subject ID 
nested within site. For these analyses, the treatment group by time interaction is a test of 
whether one group improved in cognition more over time than the other group.

To evaluate whether changes in cognition from baseline to one-year were associated with 
improvements in symptoms, we computed Pearson correlations within each age group 
between changes on the BACS composite measure and the PANSS total score. We also 
conducted a multiple regression analysis for each age group predicting change the BACS

composite score from change in the five PANSS subscale scores. Data cleaning and analysis 
were conducted using R (R Core Team, 2020) accessed via RStudio using the tidyverse 
(Wickham et al., 2019), dplyr (Wickham et al., 2022a), stringr (Wickham, 2022), haven 
(Wickham et al., 2022b), tableone (Yoshida and Bohn, n.d.), lsr (Navarro, 2015), EMAtools 
(Kleiman, 2021), lme4 (Bates et al., 2015), and lmerTest (Kuznetsova et al., 2017) packages.

3.  Results

Comparisons between the younger and older age groups in cognitive, clinical, and 
demographic characteristics are summarized in Supplementary Table 1. The only difference 
between the two groups on the BACS was in the Digit Sequencing subtest, t(400) = −2.133, 
p = .034, d = .238, on which the older participants performed better than the younger 
participants. Longitudinal descriptive statistics for the raw scores on each BACS test and the 
composite score by treatment group are provided in Table 2 for participants 20 and over) and 
Table 3 for participants under 20. Age- and gender- normed T- scores for each BACS test 
and the overall composite score for participants over age 20 are provided in Supplementary 
Table 2,

3.1.  Participants Aged 20 and Over

Table 4a summarizes the results of the mixed-effects linear regression models on each BACS 
measure for participants aged 20 and over. There were significant effects of time (all ps < 
.042) for each BACS test and the composite score, with cognition improving from baseline 
to the one- and two-year assessments. There were no significant time by treatment group 
interactions, indicating that participants in both groups improved in cognition at comparable 
rates. The correlation between changes in the BACS composite score and the PANSS total 
from baseline to one-year was significant (r = −.160, p = .034), indicating that gains in 
cognitive performance were associated with reductions in symptom severity. The multiple 
regression predicting change in the BACS composite score from baseline to one year from 
changes in the five PANSS subscales indicated that changes in negative symptoms were the 
only significant predictor (t = 2.718, p = .007).

3.2.  Participants Under Age 20

Table 4b summarizes the results of the mixed-effects linear regression models on each BACS 
measure for participants under 20. There were significant effects of time for the composite 
score (p = .006), token motor (p = .011), symbol coding (p = .012), and Tower of London 
(p = .031) measures, where cognition again increased over time. In addition, the time by 
treatment group interaction was significant for digit sequencing (p < .038, d = .359), with 
participants in the NAVIGATE group improving more than those in CC. Figure 1a depicts 
changes over time in digit sequencing for participants under age 20 in the NAVIGATE vs. 
CC groups, and for comparison Figure 1b depicts the same changes over time for the two 
groups of participants aged 20 and older. The other time by treatment group interactions 
were not significant for the under 20 age group. Similar to the older group, the correlation 
between changes in the BACS composite and the PANSS total over the first year was 
highly significant (r = .356, p = .003). Also like the older group, in the multiple regression 
analysis changes in the negative symptom subscale of the PANSS was the only subscale

that significantly predicted changes in BACS cognitive composite score from baseline to one 
year (t = 2.478, p = .016).

4.  Discussion

Both the adult and younger (age 15–19 years old) FEP participants improved significantly 
in overall cognitive functioning over two years following entry into treatment, with most 
of the improvement occurring during the first year. Furthermore, the extent of improvement 
was not trivial, as indicated by the moderate effect size changes in the BACS composite 
cognitive score in the younger and older age groups (d = .493 and .541 respectively), 
exceeding the effects of cognitive remediation (Vita et al., 2021). Some prior research has 
also reported early improvements in cognitive functioning following entry into treatment for 
FEP (Addington et al, 2005; Albus et al., 2006; Rodríguez-Sánchez et al., 2008; Townsend 
et al., 2002; Zhou et al., 2017), while the general consensus is that impairments in cognitive 
functioning are relatively stable over the first several years following the onset of psychosis 
(Albus et al., 2002; Ayesa-Arriola et al., 2013; Barder et al., 2013; Bozikas and Andreou, 
2011; Haring et al., 2017; Rund et al., 2016; Sánchez-Torres et al., 2018; Stirling et al., 
2003; Zanelli et al., 2019).

The improvements in cognitive functioning may be the result of reduced symptoms 
following pharmacological treatment. Better cognitive functioning in FEP has been linked 
to more stable remission of symptoms (Barder et al., 2019; Rund et al., 2016). Indeed, 
in the present study most of the improvement in cognitive functioning occurred over the 
first year of treatment, and reductions in total PANSS symptom severity were significantly 
correlated with improvements in cognitive functioning over that year in both age groups. Of 
note, multiple regression analyses indicated that only reductions in negative symptoms were 
unique predictors of improved cognitive functioning in both age groups. This is consistent 
with numerous studies that have shown a strong association between negative symptoms 
and cognitive functioning in schizophrenia (Harvey et al.,1996, 2001; Zhu et al., 2021), 
including in FEP (Bergh et al., 2016).

No differences were found between adult participants in the NAVIGATE program and those 
in CC in changes in cognitive functioning. While this is the first randomized controlled trial 
to examine the effects of early psychosis intervention on changes in cognitive functioning, 
these findings are consistent with research in multi-episode populations of schizophrenia 
that have shown specific targeting of cognition (i.e., cognitive remediation) is required in 
order to improve cognitive functioning in adults (Vita et al., 2021). Cognitive remediation 
has also been found to improve cognitive functioning in early psychosis patients (Miley et 
al., 2020; Revell et al., 2015).

While individuals over age 20 in both treatment groups improved significantly on all of 
the BACS cognitive tests, those under age 20 improved on three of the tests (Token Motor, 
Symbol Coding, Tower of London), but not on the other three tests (Digit Sequencing, 
Verbal Memory, Verbal Fluency). Furthermore, the treatment group by time interaction was 
significant for Digit Sequencing, with participants in the NAVIGATE program improving 
performance over the two-year follow-up compared to those in CC who deteriorated slightly.

The treatment effect size for this interaction was in the medium-small range (d = .359), 
and while significant at the conventional p < .05 level did not meet the Bonferroni bounds 
correction level for multiple statistical tests (p < .007). Nevertheless, the uniqueness of this 
finding deserves some discussion.

Digit Sequencing most directly measures working memory, although the task (which 
requires the person to listen to clusters of numbers of increasing length and repeat them 
back from smallest to largest) also requires attention (to remember the numbers) and 
executive functions (to remember the rule and apply it: ordering the numbers in magnitude). 
Impairment in working memory is one of the most robust cognitive deficits in schizophrenia, 
and has been proposed to be an endophenotype of the disorder (Park and Gooding, 2014), 
both distinguishing persons at risk for psychosis from normal controls (Pflueger et al., 2007) 
and predicting which patients will transition to psychosis (Pukrop et al., 2007). The finding 
that the older group of participants who received usual care improved in Digit Sequencing 
over the two-year study whereas the younger group (Figures 1 and 2) did not, suggests 
that an earlier age of onset of schizophrenia may have a particularly pernicious effect on 
working memory and related abilities. The prefrontal cortex, which controls the full range 
of executive functions, and in particular the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), which 
is central to working memory, is the last part of the brain to fully mature, a process that 
does not complete until adulthood (De Luca et al., 2003; Selemon and Zecevic, 2015). The 
onset of schizophrenia in adolescence may arrest the normal development of the DLPFC and 
surroundings areas, resulting in greater impairments in working memory and more broadly 
reduced functional connectivity than in older individuals (Bittner et al., 2015; Karlsgodt et 
al., 2010). In support of this conjecture, in the present study Digit Sequencing was the only 
BACS subtest in which younger participants performed significantly worse than the older 
ones (d = 238; Supplementary Table 1).

The finding that younger participants who received usual care did not improve in 
Digit Sequencing over the next two years whereas those who received the NAVIGATE 
program did suggests a possible treatment effect of the more intensive intervention on 
the continued development of working memory and related abilities. All three of the 
psychosocial components of the NAVIGATE program (IRT, SEE, family education program) 
are cognitively stimulating and provide ample practice of working memory and other 
executive skills. For example, the individual therapy component of IRT is a highly structured 
program aimed at teaching individuals a broad range of information and skills for managing 
their illness and achieving their personal goals, with extensive educational materials 
(e.g., handouts, worksheets) incorporated into the teaching, and collaboratively set home 
assignments that are routinely assigned and followed-up. Such assignments typically include 
practice of individually tailored self-management strategies, and application of problem-
solving strategies, activities which are known cognitive enhancers (McGurk et al., 2013). 
SEE involves providing practical supports to help individuals pursue and achieve educational 
or work goals, including strategies for coping with the cognitive demands of assuming 
those roles. Poor performance on working memory in similarly young persons with FEP 
is associated with hypoactivation in the prefrontal areas (Bittner et al., 2015), as well as 
in persons with multi-episode schizophrenia (Barch and Csernansky, 2007). The improved 
performance on digit sequencing for the younger participants in NAVIGATE suggests that

their active engagement in cognitively stimulating activities, especially systematic work 
towards goals that requires the representation of information in working memory to guide 
ehavior referred to as “proactive control” y Barch and Ceasar (2012)) may have countered 
some of the effects of the disorder and facilitated continued development of these abilities 
through the program’s consistent engagement of these cognitive functions. Further research 
is needed to address this question.

Participants in both age groups improved in overall cognitive functioning in the two years 
after beginning treatment for FEP. For individuals 20 years and older, improvements 
corresponded to a change from “borderline” cognitive impairment at aseline to “low 
average” cognitive functioning at the follow-ups (based on changes in T-scores; see 
Supplementary Table 2). Although this change is clinically meaningful, it indicates that 
a proportion of participants continued to have cognitive impairment, and may thus benefit 
from more intensive cognitive intervention, such as provided by cognitive remediation 
(Miley et al., 2020; Revell et al., 2015), which would optimally be provided after a 
significant period of time to allow for symptom stabilization. Considering the strong 
association between improvements in cognitive functioning and negative symptoms in this 
study sample, and evidence that cognitive remediation improves negative symptoms (Cella 
et al., 2023) including in people with FEP (Ventura et al., 2019), the clinical benefits 
of cognitive remediation may be multifold for this group, extending beyond improving 
cognitive functioning.

Several limitations of the present study should be noted. First, the number of participants 
under the age of 20 was not high and therefore our statistical power to detect time and time 
by treatment group interactions was limited. Second, an analysis of missing data from the 
study has shown that dropouts from the CC program tended to be functioning worse than 
those who were retained, whereas the opposite was true for the NAVIGATE program (Sint et 
al., 2018). Thus, the statistical analyses may have underestimated any cognitive benefits of 
the NAVIGATE program.
