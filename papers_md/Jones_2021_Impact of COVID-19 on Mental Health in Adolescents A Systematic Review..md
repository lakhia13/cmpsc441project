Abstract: Due to lack of sufﬁcient data on the psychological toll of the COVID-19 pandemic on
adolescent mental health, this systematic analysis aims to evaluate the impact of the pandemic
on adolescent mental health. This study follows the PRISMA guidelines for systematic reviews
of 16 quantitative studies conducted in 2019–2021 with 40,076 participants. Globally, adolescents
of varying backgrounds experience higher rates of anxiety, depression, and stress due to the pan-
demic. Secondly, adolescents also have a higher frequency of using alcohol and cannabis during
the COVID-19 pandemic. However, social support, positive coping skills, home quarantining, and
parent–child discussions seem to positively impact adolescent mental health during this period of
crisis. Whether in the United States or abroad, the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted adolescent
mental health. Therefore, it is important to seek and to use all of the available resources and therapies
to help adolescents mediate the adjustments caused by the pandemic.

The COVID-19 pandemic has created a havoc across the world, which has resulted
in over 2 million deaths, globally and forced billions into isolation due to stay at home
orders [1]. As a result of social isolation, and the constant concern of infectivity, mental
health consequences that are associated with the COVID-19 crisis are monumental [2,3].
However, researchers are focusing more on the mental health impact of this rapidly evolv-
ing global crisis in the elderly population [4]. There has been very little attention to the
psychological toll of COVID-19 on adolescent mental health [5].

The psychological toll of COVID-19 among adolescents should be a focal point in
COVID-19 research due to the severe and enduring impact of mental health, which leads
to poor mental health outcomes and to poor physical health outcomes, such as the devel-
opment of cardiovascular diseases [6,7]. The mental toll of this impact serves as a greater
challenge for adolescents because this age range (characterized as young people between
the ages of 13–17) lack the psychological capabilities of resilience and coping and the
physiological development of adults [6,8]. The mental health challenges of adolescents are
even greater among adolescents with pre-existing mental health conditions during periods
of crisis, which may be a result of isolation, feelings of uncertainty, lack of daily routines,
lack of access to health services provided through schools, and lack of advanced emotional
development [9,10].

Globally, 10–20% of adolescents suffer from mental health conditions [11]. This statis-
tic is likely to be affected by the vulnerability of adolescents during the COVID-19 pan-
demic [12]. Due to the negative outcomes associated with poor mental health statuses
among adolescents, such as suicide, behavior problems, and emotional distress and the
need for quality research to build resilience and to reduce anxiety among adolescents, it is
imperative to review the impact of COVID-19 on adolescent health in the United States

and abroad in order to understand the global state of adolescent mental health and to pro-
vide strategies that prevent poor mental health outcomes, such as anxiety and depression,
presently and in the future [13].

The aim of this systematic review is to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic
on adolescent mental health. Distinctively, the objectives of this review are: (1) To identity
the state of adolescent mental health, globally; and (2) To provide quality research that will
provide insight into strategies that can be used to address poor mental health outcomes of
adolescents.

2. Materials and Methods

The systematic review included studies by following the PRISMA guidelines [11].
The study focused on published original quantitative studies on mental health issues in
adolescents due to COVID-19. The inclusion and exclusion of the review are mentioned in

2.2. Screening Guidelines

The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA)
guidelines (2009) was used as a guide to record the review process [14]. Selected abstracts
were reviewed to ensure their eligibility for inclusion. Full text articles of eligible ab-
stracts were retrieved and assessed on whether they answered the research questions and
fulﬁlled the inclusion criteria. Studies were included if consensus was reached by the
three researchers.

Research Information System (RIS) formatted references were exported from the
databases, where studies were automatically screened based on the inclusion criteria
and then imported into CADIMA. The 46 studies that were imported in CADIMA were
accessed based on title and abstracts. The researchers (Jones, Mitra and Bhuiyan) accessed
the studies two times before discussing if the studies should be chosen for full text review.
Conﬂicts were managed by group discussions between all three of the researchers of this
study. After the initial discussion, all of the researchers agreed that 46 studies should
be selected for further screening using the inclusion criteria. During this second phase
of screening for having articles with full text and for excluding review articles, the three
researchers again screened the 46 articles two times independently. Conﬂicts were managed
by group discussions. After discussion, 30 more articles were excluded because they did
not meet the inclusion criteria, and 16 articles were selected to be included in the systematic
review. The PRISMA ﬂow chart (Figure 1) exhibits the search and inclusion process for the
systematic review.

2.3. Quality Appraisal

Studies were appraised for quality using CADIMA. Through CADIMA, standards
for the critical appraisal and the rating scale of the studies were deﬁned. We followed
the critical appraisal tools for systematic reviews developed by the University of Ade-
laide, South Australia [15]. A rating scale from 0 to 4 was based on the following criteria:
(1) Study design—cross-sectional, case–control, or cohort study = 1, otherwise = 0; (2) Sam-
ple size—large = 1, small = 0; (3) Use of standardized instrument(s) for data collection,
such as assessment of mental health by using Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) or
Diagnostic Manual of Mental Disorders-IV (DSM-IV) = 1, not speciﬁc = 0; and (4) Selection
of participants—random selection or lack of bias = 1, non-random sample or convenience
sample or presence of bias = 0 point. Based on the above-mentioned criteria, the three
researchers rated each of the 16 studies independently from a range of 0 to 4. Due to having
no major inter-observer variations in the evaluation of the quality of the studies, an average
of the three scores was presented in Table 3.

3. Results

A summary of the methodology, characteristics of ﬁndings, impact of COVID-19
on mental health in adolescents, quality appraisal and the countries of the studies are
presented in Table 3. Of the 16 studies reviewed, 7 were conducted in China, 2 in the
United States, 2 in Canada, and 1 each in Denmark, Germany, Japan, the Philippines, and
the United Kingdom. All of the 16 studies utilized a quantitative methodology [16–31].
Among the studies, 12 (75%) were conducted online and 4 (25%) did not clearly report
the study format. The studies were conducted from February 2020–May 2020, with six
studies not reporting the date of data collection. Ten studies (62.5%) were conducted among
adolescents only, three studies (18.8%) were conducted among children and adolescents,
one study (6.3%) was conducted among adolescents and parents, and two studies (12.5%)
were conducted among adults, young adults, and adolescents. In this study, we evaluated
the data of adolescents only.

The total sample size used in the studies varied from 102 to 9554, having a median
sample size of 1054 (1st Quartile = 693 and 3rd Quartile = 3254); 10 out of 16 (63%) had
sample sizes of more than 1000. In terms of standardized tools, nine studies (56%) utilized
standardized tools, and seven studies (44%) did not use standardized tools.

An average score of 4 out of 4, meant excellent in seven (44%), 2–3, meant moderate in

seven (44%), and 0–1, meant poor in two (12%) studies.

3.1. Anxiety

Of the studies that addressed the impact of COVID-19 related anxiety for non-special
populations, several studies established an association between the COVID-19 pandemic
and rates of anxiety among adolescents [16–18,24,28,30]. One study in China [28] identiﬁed
that low support (Odds Ratio [OR] = 3.18, 95% Conﬁdence Intervals [CI]: 2.54 to 3.98)
and medium support (OR = 2.19, 95% CI: 1.94 to 2.48) increased the likelihood of anxiety.
However, Chen et al. [19] did not identify a signiﬁcant correlation between the COVID-19
and anxiety among adolescents.

3.2. Depression

Five studies (31%) addressed depression among non-special populations and iden-
tiﬁed an association between the pandemic and depression [17,25,27,28,30]. One study
in China conducted by Duan et al. [17] identiﬁed an association between depression
and COVID-19 related addiction in using social media, such as smartphone addiction
(OR = 1.844, 95% CI: 1.29 to 2.811), and internet addiction (OR = 3.107, 95% CI: 1.252 to
7.708). Guo et al. [23] identiﬁed an association between COVID-19 related stress and
depression (β = 0.33, t = 11.49, p < 0.001). However, the study conducted by Chen et al. in
China [19] failed to establish a signiﬁcant correlation between depression and COVID-19
related factors.

3.3. Other Psychological Disorders/Distress

Of the studies, several considered various other forms of psychological disorders and
other forms of psychological distress, such as burdensomeness, belongingness, psycho-
logical distress, stress and trauma, and drug abuse. One study in the United States [16]
revealed that speciﬁc motivation to practice social distancing led to burdensomeness and
belongingness among adolescents. Another study in the Philippines [27] identiﬁed that
16.3% of respondents experienced psychological impairments as moderate or severe due to
the pandemic. A Chinese study by Zhang et al. [30] found that negative coping skills are
risk factors for stress and trauma among junior high and high school students. A Canadian
study [31] recognized the increased frequency of drug usage, such as alcohol and cannabis
among adolescents during the pandemic.

3.4. Special Populations

Special populations among adolescents were assessed in several studies. These special
population included Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer (LGBTQ) adoles-
cents, adolescents diagnosed with anorexia nervosa, pre-pandemic maltreated adolescents,
seniors, females, and adolescents diagnosed with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
Through 31 synchronous text-based chats, LGBTQ adolescents expressed difﬁculty main-
taining mental health wellness due to being forced to stay at home with unsupportive
family members, and due to the lack of socialization that helps with identity [22]. Ado-
lescents diagnosed with anorexia nervosa reported 70% increases in poor eating habits
and increases in thoughts associated with eating disorders [21]. Pre-pandemic maltreated
adolescents experienced higher rates of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (effect size
beta = 0.16~0.27) and higher rates of anxiety (effect size beta = 0.32~0.47) [23]. Of the two
studies [24,26] that speciﬁcally evaluated seniors, both studies established associations
between poor mental health outcomes, such as psychological issues and anxiety, and factors
related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Both studies that discussed gender-related data [26,27]
established higher rates of COVID-19 related anxiety among females. The study [29]
that evaluated various groups of youth, including adolescents that were diagnosed with
OCD, established a worsening of symptoms (44.6%) for patients, who completed primary
treatment and for patients, who were currently in psychiatric treatment.

3.5. Beneﬁts

Of the 16 studies in this review, one study in China [24] identiﬁed both a negative
and a positive impact between COVID-19 related factors, such as home quarantining and
parent–child discussions with mental health outcomes. The positive beneﬁts were related
with coming in closer and having more family discussions between parents and their
children during home quarantining.

4. Discussion
4.1. Impact on Mental Health

In this systematic review, there was conclusive evidence to support the potential
negative impact of the pandemic on adolescent mental health. The stressors and motiva-
tions to practice social distancing due to the COVID-19 pandemic seem to be difﬁcult for
adolescents to process, which results in poor mental health outcomes [16]. The inefﬁcient
ability to process difﬁcult circumstances, such as the pandemic are due to negative coping
skills, which are risk factors for depression, stress and trauma among various ages of ado-
lescents [30]. The lack of positive coping skills among adolescents is not unusual because
adolescent must be provided with the tools to cope in order to be resilient and mentally
well during periods of adjustments. However, the exposure to and practice of positive
coping skills can lead to mentally well adolescents, who can easily adjust to rapid changes.
Social support was another major factor identiﬁed in this review in determining the
mental sustainability of adolescents during periods of crisis, such as the pandemic. Ado-
lescents had perceived high rates of low to moderate social support during the pandemic,

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 2470

7 of 9

which contributed to increases in anxiety and depression [28]. Despite the concept of social
support being expressed from the point of view of adolescents, which may or may not be
bias, adolescents are still experiencing authentic forms of psychological challenges, such
as anxiety and depression associated with the lack of social support and the pandemic.
Due to these challenges, it is imperative that support be greatly implemented in homes.
Studies have shown that the implementation of social support leads to positive mental
health outcomes [28].

Addiction is another concern for adolescent mental health during the pandemic. Due
to stay-at home orders, school closures, or new at home learning methods, students are
seeking ways to connect and to socialize in manners that may not be productive for optimal
health. The result of these behaviors are smartphone addiction and internet addiction. Both
forms of addiction lead to poor mental health outcomes for adolescents.

Despite being forced to remain at home, adolescents were identiﬁed as still engaging
in drug use during the pandemic. Rather adolescents were increasing their use of alcohol
and cannabis during the pandemic with 49.3% engaging in drug use alone [30]. An earlier
study [32] showed the link between the lack of positive coping skills and the possible
neurobiological pathways that may associate stress with the craving for drug use.

4.2. Impact on Mental Health of Special Populations

As the non-special populations of adolescents experience mental health challenges,
the special populations are experiencing a worsening of conditions, or experiences during
the pandemic, which are a result of physical and psychologically COVID-19 related factors.
These adolescents are forced to deal with unsupportive families due to sexual orientation,
with the lack of social and medical support in connection to various pre-pandemic disor-
ders, with an added stress concerning their futures, and with dealing with new and old
stress from previous traumas [21–23,26,29,33]. These groups of adolescents have always
experienced more challenges, but the pandemic has signiﬁcantly affected the quality of life
of these adolescents.

5. Conclusions and Recommendations

Whether in the U.S. or abroad, the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted adolescent
mental health. Stressful life events, extended home conﬁnement, worry, overuse of the
internet and social media are factors that could inﬂuence the mental health of adolescents
during this pandemic. Adolescents from across the world face mental challenges due to
COVID-19. Despite the uncertainty of the current crisis, it is important that adolescents
receive the physical and mental care that they need to develop, to grow, and to thrive.
Therefore, it is important to seek and to use all of the available resources and therapies
to help adolescents mediate the adjustments caused by the pandemic. More research is
needed on the improvement of adolescent mental health during COVID-19 and similar
disasters. Among many interventions, more emphasis may be suggested on the global
implementation of telemedicine to address the psychological needs of adolescents [34].
