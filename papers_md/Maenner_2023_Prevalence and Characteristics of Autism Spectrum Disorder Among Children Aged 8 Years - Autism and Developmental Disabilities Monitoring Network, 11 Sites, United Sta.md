Abstract

Problem/Condition: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD).
Period Covered: 2020.
Description of System: The Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring (ADDM) Network is an active surveillance 
program that provides estimates of the prevalence of ASD among children aged 8 years. In 2020, there were 11 ADDM Network 
sites across the United States (Arizona, Arkansas, California, Georgia, Maryland, Minnesota, Missouri, New Jersey, Tennessee, 
Utah, and Wisconsin). To ascertain ASD among children aged 8 years, ADDM Network staff review and abstract developmental 
evaluations and records from community medical and educational service providers. A child met the case definition if their record 
documented 1) an ASD diagnostic statement in an evaluation, 2) a classification of ASD in special education, or 3) an ASD 
International Classification of Diseases (ICD) code.
Results: For 2020, across all 11 ADDM sites, ASD prevalence per 1,000 children aged 8 years ranged from 23.1 in Maryland 
to 44.9 in California. The overall ASD prevalence was 27.6 per 1,000 (one in 36) children aged 8 years and was 3.8 times as 
prevalent among boys as among girls (43.0 versus 11.4). Overall, ASD prevalence was lower among non-Hispanic White children 
(24.3) and children of two or more races (22.9) than among non-Hispanic Black or African American (Black), Hispanic, and 
non-Hispanic Asian or Pacific Islander (A/PI) children (29.3, 31.6, and 33.4 respectively). ASD prevalence among non-Hispanic 
American Indian or Alaska Native (AI/AN) children (26.5) was similar to that of other racial and ethnic groups. ASD prevalence 
was associated with lower household income at three sites, with no association at the other sites.

Across sites, the ASD prevalence per 1,000 children aged 8 years based exclusively on documented ASD diagnostic statements 
was 20.6 (range = 17.1 in Wisconsin to 35.4 in California). Of the 6,245 children who met the ASD case definition, 74.7% 
had a documented diagnostic statement of ASD, 65.2% had a documented ASD special education classification, 71.6% had a 
documented ASD ICD code, and 37.4% had all three types of ASD indicators. The median age of earliest known ASD diagnosis 
was 49 months and ranged from 36 months in California to 59 months in Minnesota.

Among the 4,165 (66.7%) children with ASD with information on cognitive ability, 37.9% were classified as having an intellectual 
disability. Intellectual disability was present among 50.8% of Black, 41.5% of A/PI, 37.8% of two or more races, 34.9% of 
Hispanic, 34.8% of AI/AN, and 31.8% of White children with ASD. Overall, children with intellectual disability had earlier 
median ages of ASD diagnosis (43 months) than those without intellectual disability (53 months).

Interpretation:  For  2020,  one  in  36  children  aged  8  years 
(approximately 4% of boys and 1% of girls) was estimated to 
have ASD. These estimates are higher than previous ADDM 
Network  estimates  during  2000–2018.  For  the  first  time 
among  children  aged  8  years,  the  prevalence  of  ASD  was 

MMWR  /  March 24, 2023  /  Vol. 72  /  No. 2

in ASD prevalence observed in the past. Black children with ASD were still more likely than White children with ASD to have a 
co-occurring intellectual disability.
Public Health Action: The continued increase among children identified with ASD, particularly among non-White children 
and girls, highlights the need for enhanced infrastructure to provide equitable diagnostic, treatment, and support services for all 
children with ASD. Similar to previous reporting periods, findings varied considerably across network sites, indicating the need for 
additional research to understand the nature of such differences and potentially apply successful identification strategies across states.

Introduction
Autism  spectrum  disorder  (ASD)  is  a  developmental 
disability  characterized  by  persistent  impairments  in  social 
interaction and the presence of restricted, repetitive patterns 
of behaviors, interests, or activities (1) that can cause a wide 
array of difficulties in social interaction, communication, and 
participation in daily activities. CDC began monitoring the 
prevalence of ASD in metropolitan Atlanta, Georgia, in 1996 
as part of its Metropolitan Atlanta Developmental Disabilities 
Surveillance Program (2). CDC established the Autism and 
Developmental Disabilities Monitoring (ADDM) Network in 
2000 and used the model developed in metropolitan Atlanta 
to track ASD prevalence in additional areas of the country. 
Starting with the 2000 surveillance year, the ADDM Network 
has reported ASD prevalence for even-numbered years (3–12). 
This is the 11th surveillance summary published in MMWR 
and marks a period of 20 years of monitoring ASD in multiple 
U.S. communities.

During the past two decades, ASD prevalence estimates of 
children aged 8 years from the ADDM Network have increased 
markedly, from 6.7 (one in 150) per 1,000 in 2000 to 23.0 
(one in 44) in 2018 (3,12). In addition, overall ASD prevalence 
among  White  children  was  50%  higher  than  among  Black 
or African American (Black) or Hispanic children in earlier 
years. (Persons of Hispanic origin might be of any race but are 
categorized as Hispanic; all racial groups are non-Hispanic). 
These gaps narrowed over time until ASD prevalence among 
Black and Hispanic matched prevalence among White children 
for  the  first  time  in  2016  and  2018,  respectively  (11,12). 
Similarly, robust associations between autism prevalence and 
higher socioeconomic status were observed in ADDM Network 
sites  during  2002–2010  (13);  however,  this  association 
was much more variable in 2018 (12). These patterns have 
largely been interpreted as improvements in more equitable 
identification of ASD, particularly for children in groups that 
have less access or face greater barriers in obtaining services 
(including  diagnostic  evaluations).  However,  consistent 
disparities for co-occurring intellectual disability exist because 
among all children with ASD, Black children have the largest 
proportion identified with intellectual disability (10–12).

This  report  describes  ASD  prevalence  and  characteristics 
among  children  aged  8  years  from  11  ADDM  Network 
sites in 2020, including prevalence by site and demographic 
characteristics, median ages when children with ASD were first 
evaluated or identified, and the co-occurrence of intellectual 
disability.  These  data  can  be  used  by  service  providers, 
educators, communities, researchers, and policymakers to track 
trends and support efforts to ensure the equitable allocation of 
needed services and support for all children with ASD.

Methods

Surveillance Sites and Procedures
For 2020, the ADDM Network included 11 sites (Arizona, 
Arkansas,  California,  Georgia,  Maryland,  Minnesota, 
Missouri, New Jersey, Tennessee, Utah, and Wisconsin) that 
monitored ASD prevalence. Each site selected a geographic 
area of its state to monitor ASD among children aged 8 years 
(Table 1). Children included in this report were born in 2012 
and  lived  in  surveillance  areas  of  the  11  sites  during  2020. 
Sites  were  competitively  funded  and  functioned  as  public 
health authorities under the Health Insurance Portability and 
Accountability Act of 1996 Privacy Rule and met applicable 
local institutional review board, privacy, and confidentiality 
requirements under 45 CFR 46 (14).

Case Ascertainment and Surveillance 
Case Definition
The ADDM Network conducts active surveillance of ASD 
by using multiple sources of information within a community 
(Table  1). The  methods  for  collecting  information  and  the 
case  definition  were  unchanged  from  the  2018  surveillance 
year (12) and were modeled after those developed by CDC’s 
Metropolitan Atlanta Developmental Disabilities Surveillance 
Program (3). Sites request records from community medical, 
education,  and  service  providers  containing  specific  billing 
codes from the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth 
Revision  (ICD-9)  or  International  Classification  of  Diseases, 
Tenth  Revision  (ICD-10)  or  special  education  classification. 
The protocol allowed each site to select the ICD codes that 

Surveillance SummariesUS Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Preventionnecessitate record review if those codes closely aligned with 
program-recommended ICD codes (11). All ADDM Network 
sites used records from medical service providers that evaluated 
children with developmental disabilities and, for the first time, 
all sites had at least partial access to public school education 
records (Table 1). ADDM Network sites received information 
(including  demographic  data  and  ICD  codes  or  special 
education classifications) for children with one or more of the 
requested codes or classifications, and ADDM staff manually 
reviewed  the  contents  of  associated  (electronic  and  paper-
based) records when available. If any part of the child’s record 
contained information meeting the case definition, ADDM 
staff  abstracted  information  from  the  child’s  developmental 
evaluations, special education plans, and other documents (e.g., 
cognitive or IQ tests) from all data sources. At certain sites, full 
record review could not be completed for all records because of 
the COVID-19 pandemic or other restrictions on physically 
accessing the location where records were stored (Table 1).

Children  met  the  ASD  case  definition  if  they  were  aged 
8 years in 2020 (born in 2012), lived in the surveillance area 
for at least 1 day during 2020, and had documentation in their 
records that they ever received 1) a written ASD diagnostic 
statement from a qualified professional, 2) a special education 
classification of autism (either primary exceptionality of ASD 
or an evaluation reporting criterion for autism eligibility was 
met) in public school, or 3) an ASD ICD code (ICD-9 codes 
between 299.00 and 299.99 or ICD-10 codes in the F84 range 
except for F84.2, Rett syndrome) obtained from administrative 
or  billing  information.  Five  children  had  an  ICD  code  for 
Rett syndrome (F84.2) and no other indicators of ASD and 
did not meet the ASD case definition. ASD-related diagnostic 
conclusions  (including  suspected  ASD  or  ruled  out  ASD) 
were collected verbatim from evaluations and were reviewed 
and classified by ADDM Network staff with clinical expertise 
at each site.

Additional Data Sources and 
Variable Definitions
Population denominators were obtained from the U.S. Census 
vintage  2021  county-level  single-year-of-age  postcensal 
population estimates for 2020 (15). In this report, the Asian 
and  Native  Hawaiian  or  other  Pacific  Islander  categories 
were combined into Asian or Pacific Islander because current 
systems  often  combine  these  categories  or  are  not  explicit 
whether  “Asian”  at  a  given  data  source  includes  “Native 
Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander.” Population denominators 
include  categories  for  American  Indian  or  Alaska  Native 
(AI/AN), Asian or Pacific Islander (A/PI), Black, White, two 
or  more  races,  and  Hispanic  ethnicity.  In  previous  ADDM 

Network  reports,  the  denominator  data  were  based  on  the 
National Center for Health Statistics postcensal bridged race 
estimates  (also  produced  by  the  Census  Bureau)  (16);  the 
bridged race data set did not include a category for two or 
more races, which increased counts in the other categories.

Surveillance  areas  at  three  sites  (Arizona,  California,  and 
Minnesota) comprised subcounty school districts. For these 
sites,  county  population  estimates  were  adjusted  using  the 
National  Center  for  Education  Statistics  public  school 
enrollment counts and the American Community Survey tract-
level ages 5–9 years population estimates described previously 
(12). The primary race and ethnicity and sex information came 
from  medical  or  education  records  and,  when  missing,  was 
augmented by birth certificate linkages (among children born 
in the state of their residence at age 8 years), administrative, 
or  billing  information.  Children  with  missing  or  unknown 
race or ethnicity information were excluded from race- and 
ethnicity-specific prevalence estimates.

Census  tract-level  median  household  income  (MHI)  was 
measured using the 2020 American Community Survey 5-year 
estimates (17). Population counts of children aged 8 years were 
estimated by dividing the number of children aged 5–9 years by 
five for each census tract. The tracts included in the surveillance 
areas  were  classified  into  three  approximately  equal-sized 
population  groups  (i.e.,  tertiles)  of  low,  medium,  and  high 
MHI  by  using  data  from  all  sites.  Children  meeting  the 
ADDM Network case definition for ASD were geocoded and 
assigned to a socioeconomic status (SES) group corresponding 
to their 2020 address. Census tract information was available 
for 96.0% of children; the remainder could not be linked to a 
census tract but had service receipt or school attendance that 
indicated study area residence.

A  child  was  classified  as  having  intellectual  disability  if 
they  had  an  IQ  score  ≤70  on  their  most  recent  cognitive 
test or intellectual disability was indicated in a statement in 
a  developmental  evaluation  from  a  qualified  professional. 
Children were classified in the borderline range for IQ if the 
score on their most recent test was 71–85, and in the average or 
higher range with most recent IQ score >85 or with a statement 
their IQ was in the average range without a specific score. Age 
at first developmental evaluation was limited to children with 
information on the earliest collected or historically reported 
evaluation. Age at first ASD diagnosis was based on the earliest 
documented age when a qualified professional diagnosed ASD.

Analytic Methods
Prevalence was calculated as the number of children with 
ASD per 1,000 children in the defined population or group. 
Overall ASD prevalence estimates included all children with

Surveillance SummariesUS Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and PreventionASD from all 11 sites. Prevalence also was stratified by sex and 
by race and ethnicity using both the U.S. Census postcensal 
population estimates as well as the National Center for Health 
Statistics postcensal bridged race denominators. The Wilson 
score method was used to calculate 95% CIs. Pearson chi-square 
tests were used to compare proportions, and the Mantel-Haenszel 
(Woolf) test of homogeneity compared prevalence ratios across 
sites. Permutation tests were conducted to test differences in 
medians.  Cochran  Armitage  tests  were  used  to  detect  trends 
in  prevalence  across  SES  tertiles.  Prevalence  estimates  with  a 
relative SE >30% (and ratios calculated from those estimates) 
were considered to have limited statistical precision and were 
suppressed. Statistical tests with p values <0.05 and prevalence 
ratio 95% CIs that excluded 1.0 were considered statistically 
significant.  R  software  (version  4.2;  R  Foundation)  and 
additional packages were used to conduct analyses (12).

Results

ASD Prevalence
The overall ASD prevalence per 1,000 children aged 8 years 
was 27.6 (one in 36) and ranged from 23.1 in Maryland to 
44.9  in  California  (Table  2). The  overall  male-to-female 
prevalence ratio was 3.8, with overall ASD prevalence of 43.0 
among boys and 11.4 among girls. The same sites conducted 
ASD surveillance in 2018 and reported a combined prevalence 
of  23.0;  however,  certain  sites  changed  their  geographic 
areas  or  access  to  data  sources  for  the  current  reporting 
period (Supplementary Table 1, https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/
cdc/124397). The two sites with the largest relative changes 
(Missouri  [48.5%]  and  Wisconsin  [49.5%])  from  2018  to 
2020 had increased access to education records in 2020 but 
no change in the geographic areas.

Overall, ASD prevalence per 1,000 children aged 8 years 
differed  by  racial  and  ethnic  groups  (Table  3);  prevalence 
among  White  children  (24.3)  was  lower  than  prevalence 
among  Black,  Hispanic,  or  A/PI  children  (29.3,  31.6,  and 
33.4, respectively). Among AI/AN children, ASD prevalence 
was 26.5 overall and was similar to other groups, but estimates 
met the 30% relative SE threshold for statistical precision in 
just one site (Arizona). ASD prevalence among children of two 
or more races was 22.9, which was not different than among 
White children but was lower than prevalence among AP/I, 
Black, and Hispanic children. Missouri was the only site in 
which White children had higher ASD prevalence than another 
racial  or  ethnic  group  (White  compared  with  two  or  more 
races). Additional prevalence ratios comparing racial and ethnic 

4

groups are available (Supplementary Table 2, https://stacks.
cdc.gov/view/cdc/124397). Prevalence calculations using the 
bridged-race denominator racial and ethnic categories used in 
previous reports (Supplementary Table 3, https://stacks.cdc.
gov/view/cdc/124397) yielded similar findings of lower ASD 
prevalence among White children compared with that among 
Asian, Black, and Hispanic children.

In eight sites, ASD prevalence was not associated with census 
tract-level MHI, but in three sites (Arizona, New Jersey, and 
Utah), lower ASD prevalence was observed among children 
living in census tracts with higher MHI (Figure 1). When all 
sites were combined, prevalence of ASD was lower among census 
tracts with higher MHI; however, ASD prevalences for the low, 
medium, and high SES tertiles were all between 23.0–27.2.

ASD Identification
The  percentage  of  children  with  diagnostic  statements, 
special  education  classifications,  and  ICD  codes  varied  by 
site  (Table  4).  Across  sites,  the  percentage  of  children  with 
ASD  who  had  a  documented  ASD  diagnostic  statement 
was  74.7%  overall  (range  =  60.9%  in Wisconsin  to  94.7% 
in  New  Jersey).  ASD  prevalence  per  1,000  children  aged 
8  years  based  exclusively  on  documented  ASD  diagnostic 
statements  was  20.6  overall  (range  =  17.1  in  Wisconsin  to 
35.4  in  California)  (Figure  2). The  overall  percentage  of 
children  with  ASD  who  had  a  documented  ASD  special 
education classification was 65.2% (range = 44.9% in Utah 
to 84.9% in Minnesota) (Table 4). The percentage of children 
with  ASD  who  had  a  documented  ICD  code  was  71.6% 
(range  =  51.9%  in  Minnesota  to  82.7%  in  California).  A 
majority of (74.2%) children with ASD had at least two of 
the  three  types  of  ASD  identification  documented  in  their 
records  (i.e.,  ASD  diagnostic  statement,  special  education 
classification, and ASD ICD code) and 37.4% had all three 
(Figure 3). A majority of children with an ICD code (89.5% 
of  4,472  children)  also  had  a  documented  ASD  diagnostic 
statement or ASD special education classification; among all 
children with ASD, few (7.5% of 6,245 children) met the case 
definition through having an ICD code only. A majority of 
children with documents indicating an ASD diagnosis or ASD 
special education classification had these mentioned multiple 
times in their records (overall median number of diagnoses 
documented: two; range: one in Tennessee to six in New Jersey; 
overall median special education classifications documented: 
four, site-specific medians ranging from two in Wisconsin and 
Tennessee to six in California) (Supplementary Table 4, https://
stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/124397).

Total p<0.01.

Among children with ASD, 37.4% ever had an evaluation 
report  noting  that  ASD  was  suspected  but  not  confirmed 
(Table 4). Overall, 11.6% of children with ASD had an ASD 
diagnosis or special education eligibility ruled out (range = 4.3% 
in Georgia to 29.3% in California). For a majority of children, 
ASD  was  confirmed  after  ASD  had  previously  been  ruled 
out; however, 3.9% (range = 0.2% in New Jersey to 12.8% in 
California) of all children with ASD had an evaluation ruling 
out ASD more recently than one confirming ASD.

Cognitive Ability Among Children 
with ASD
Data on cognitive ability were available for 4,165 (66.7%) 
children aged 8 years with ASD (range: 39.7% in Wisconsin 
to 91.2% in Arkansas) (Table 5). Among children with data on 
cognitive ability, the median age of the most recent cognitive 
test  or  examiner  impression  was  67  months  (interquartile 
range:  51–81  months)  (Supplementary  Table  5,  https://

cognitive ability, 37.9% were classified as having intellectual 
disability at their most recent test or examination, 23.5% were 
classified in the borderline range (IQ 71–85), and 38.6% were 
classified in the average or higher range (IQ >85) (Table 5). The 
percentage of children classified as having intellectual disability 
varied  widely  among  sites  (range  =  21.7%  in  California  to 
51.0% in Tennessee). The median age of most recent test also 
varied by site (range = 55 months in Wisconsin to 79 months 
in Arizona) (Supplementary Table 5,  https://stacks.cdc.gov/
view/cdc/124397). Overall, girls with ASD were more likely 
to be classified as having an intellectual disability than boys 
with  ASD  (42.1%  versus  36.9%),  and  Black  children  were 
more likely than Hispanic and White children to be classified 
as having intellectual disability (50.8%, 34.9%, and 31.8%, 
respectively).  The  percentage  of  children  with  ASD  and 
intellectual disability among A/PI, two or more races, or AI/AN 
children was 41.3%, 37.8%, and 34.8%, respectively.

Age at First Evaluation and ASD Diagnosis
Among  5,744  children  aged  8  years  with  ASD  and 
recorded evaluations, 49% were evaluated by age 36 months 
(range = 38.5% in Utah to 59.5% in Maryland) (Table 6). The 
median age at first recorded evaluation ranged from 32 months 
in California to 44 months in Utah. Children with ASD with 
an intellectual disability were more likely to be evaluated by 
age 36 months compared with children with ASD without an 
intellectual disability (61.8% versus 46.0%).

Among  the  4,663  children  aged  8  years  with  ASD  who 
had an evaluation containing an ASD diagnostic statement, 
the  median  age  at  earliest  known  diagnosis  was  49  months 
(range = 36 months in California to 59 months in Minnesota) 
(Table 7). Children with ASD and intellectual disability had a 
lower median age at diagnosis (43 months) than children without 
an intellectual disability (53 months). When special education 
classifications of autism were considered with ASD diagnoses 
for  earliest  identification,  5,579  children  with  ASD  were 
identified with a median age of 52 months (range = 39 months 
in California and New Jersey to 60 months in Arizona).

For 2020, the prevalence estimate of ASD per 1,000 children 
aged 8 years was 27.6 (range: 23.1 in Maryland to 44.9 in 
California),  which  is  higher  than  previous  estimates  from 
the  ADDM  Network.  For  the  first  time,  the  overall  ASD 
prevalence for girls was >1% (11.4); in contrast, the prevalence 
among  boys  had  already  been  noted  to  be  higher  (11.5)  in 
the first ADDM Network report in 2002 (4). The continued 
variability  in  prevalence  across  ADDM  sites,  as  well  as  the 
shifting in differences between demographic groups, highlight 
an ongoing need to better understand the systems and practices 
that contribute to this variability.

In  its  earliest  years,  the  ADDM  Network  consistently 
reported  lower  overall  ASD  prevalence  among  Black  and 
Hispanic versus White children aged 8 years. The White-Black 
gap  in  ASD  prevalence  narrowed  in  2014,  and  there  was 
no  overall  difference  in  ASD  prevalence  in  2016  or  2018 
(Supplementary  Figure  1,  https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/
cdc/124397).  ASD  prevalence  among  Asian,  Black,  and 
Hispanic children was at least 30% higher in 2020 than 2018, 
and ASD prevalence among White children was 14.6% higher 
than in 2018. Although this was the first time the ADDM 
Network  reported  lower  ASD  prevalence  among  White 
children than among other groups for children aged 8 years, 
a similar pattern was observed among children aged 4 years 
in 2018 (18). In addition, similar patterns were reported in 
analyses of national special education data and of California 
Developmental Services data, illustrating the prevalence of ASD 
classifications  among Black and Hispanic  children catching 
up  and  eclipsing  that  of White  children  over  time  (19,20). 
These patterns might reflect improved screening, awareness, 
and access to services among historically underserved groups. 
ASD prevalence in 2020 also was associated with lower SES, 
the  opposite  of  what  was  observed  previously  (13),  further 
supporting progress in identifying children regardless of race 
and  ethnic  group.  As  evidence  grows  of  increased  access  to 
identification, attention might shift to what factors, such as 
social  determinants  of  health,  could  lead  to  higher  rates  of 
disability among certain populations.

Even with higher ASD prevalence among Black compared 
with  White  children,  Black  children  with  ASD  remained 
more  likely  to  have  co-occurring  intellectual  disability 
than White children, a finding that has been observed over 
multiple  ADDM  Network  surveillance  reports  and  among 
Black  compared  with  White  children  without  ASD  in  the 
United  States  (21).  If  Black  children  with  ASD  have  less 
access to services than White children with ASD, as has been 
previously  reported,  the  disproportionality  in  co-occurring 
intellectual disability might indicate an underascertainment 

of ASD among Black children without intellectual disability. 
Continued monitoring of trends is warranted, and it might 
be  appropriate  to  re-examine  potential  risk  or  protective 
factors  that  were  previously  studied  when  the  demographic 
composition of ASD was different.

During  this  period  of  changing  demographic  differences 
in ASD prevalence, the ADDM Network implemented two 
methodological  changes.  First,  a  new  ASD  case  definition 
was  adopted  for  the  2018  surveillance  year. The  previous 
case  definition  relied  on  reviewing  written  descriptions  of 
ASD  symptoms  that  were  documented  in  comprehensive 
developmental evaluations. It could classify children without 
any formal ASD identification as ASD cases and could exclude 
children  who  had  ASD  diagnosed  but  lacked  sufficient 
corroborating details in their records. An analysis found that 
non-White  children  were  more  likely  to  have  incomplete 
records,  which  could  lead  to  underascertainment  of  ASD 
compared with White children (22). However, a retroactive 
application  of  the  current  case  definition  to  the  2014  and 
2016 surveillance years indicates similar prevalence ratios by 
race and ethnicity as the previous case definition (23). The 
second  change,  implemented  in  2020,  is  using  population 
denominators with standardized racial and ethnic categories. 
The most important difference from the previous (bridged-race) 
denominators is the inclusion of a category for two or more 
races, which reduces the size of the denominators among the 
other racial groups. Nevertheless, prevalence estimates based 
on the previous bridged-race denominators produced a similar 
pattern  of  lower  ASD  prevalence  among  White  children 
compared  with  the  other  groups  (Supplementary Table  3, 
https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/124397). Thus,  there  were 
qualitatively similar patterns when consistent case definitions 
and denominator data sets were applied during 2014–2020.

Although ASD can be identified by age 1 year in certain 
cases (24,25), as described in this report, a majority of children 
aged 8 years living in ADDM communities were not identified 
until they were several years older. The reported median age of 
identification has not changed much over the years of ADDM 
Network  surveillance,  but  it  does  not  necessarily  indicate  a 
lack of progress in community early identification efforts. In 
a recent analysis of ADDM Network data during 2002–2016, 
the  median  age  of  diagnosis  might  mask  progress  in  early 
detection  if  more  children  are  identified  (i.e.,  prevalence 
increases) at all ages and does not include children who might 
have ASD diagnosed after age 8 years (26,27). Therefore, the 
ADDM  Network  now  reports  the  cumulative  incidence  of 
ASD by age 48 months as a measure of early identification 
and compares children aged 4 years and 8 years living in the 
same communities as a measure of progress (28,29). The 2020 
report on early identification of ASD found more children were

Surveillance SummariesUS Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and Preventionidentified at early ages than in the past, but many are still not 
identified until they are school-aged (30).

CDC maintains a list of peer-reviewed autism prevalence studies 
with similar metrics to ADDM surveillance reports  (https://
www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/data/autism-data-table.html). 
Other federal programs reporting ASD prevalence information 
in the United States include the National Survey for Children’s 
Health (NSCH) and the National Health Interview Survey. 
The ASD prevalence estimate based on the 2020 and 2021 
NSCH was 2.9% and the 95% CI (2.7%–3.1%) included the 
2020 ADDM Network ASD prevalence estimate (2.76%) (31). 
These  surveys  aim  to  produce  nationally  representative 
estimates among children aged 3–17 years old and ascertain 
information about ASD through parental report, whereas the 
ADDM Network estimates are not intended to be nationally 
representative and are generated from empirical data collected 
from multiple sources among participating communities. The 
active  surveillance  approach  used  by  the  ADDM  Network 
allows  reporting  of  when  and  where  children  are  identified 
with ASD and affords comparisons between and within diverse 
U.S. communities and is not dependent on parental survey 
participation  and  ASD  reporting. To  facilitate  comparisons 
between different data sources, CDC maintains an interactive 
website  that  presents  U.S.  state-based  ASD  prevalence  data 
from four data systems (ADDM Network, NSCH, Medicaid, 
and special education) (https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/
data/index.html).

Limitations
The  findings  in  this  report  are  subject  to  at  least  seven 
limitations. First, the methods rely on the availability, quality, 
and  completeness  of  existing  information  and  records  to 
ascertain ASD cases and other indicators. Although all sites had 
access to special education classification data, certain sites did 
not have access to education records for their entire population, 
limiting the ability to identify children with ASD exclusively 
identified  and  served  through  their  schools.  Sites  requested 
records  from  public  school  special  education  programs  but 
did not review private school education records. Incomplete 
information could lead to misclassifying children’s cognitive 
ability, overestimating the age when they were first evaluated 
or when ASD was diagnosed, or failing to ascertain that the 
children  were  identified  as  having  ASD.  Sex  information 
reflects  what  is  represented  in  children’s  records  and  might 
not reflect their gender identity. Second, the case definition 
for intellectual disability was measured using a child’s latest 
cognitive  test  or  examiner  statement  of  a  child’s  cognitive 
ability. Diagnostic and special education eligibility criteria for 

8 

MMWR  /  March 24, 2023  /  Vol. 72  /  No. 2

intellectual disability requires concurrent adaptive functioning 
deficits (32). IQ scores are not necessarily stable measures of 
intellectual ability over time, can increase among children with 
ASD in response to intensive early therapeutic interventions 
(33), and might be unstable during early childhood (34). The 
age at which children had their most recent test or examiner 
impression  of  cognitive  ability  varied  by  site. Third,  the 
ADDM Network sites are not intended to be representative 
of the states in which the sites are located. ADDM Network 
sites are selected through an objective and competitive process, 
and findings do not necessarily generalize to all children aged 
8  years  in  the  United  States.  Interpretations  of  temporal 
trends can be complicated by changing surveillance areas, case 
definitions, data source access, and diagnostic practices. Fourth, 
small numbers result in imprecise estimates for certain sites and 
subgroups, and estimates falling below the selected threshold 
for statistical precision were suppressed. Fifth, the surveillance 
data system does not collect the number of ASD ICD codes 
a child received at a specific source, limiting comparability to 
analyses of claims/billing databases that consider number of 
ICD codes received. Sixth, the COVID–19 pandemic resulted 
in  reduced  access  to  records  from  some  sources  at  certain 
sites; it was often possible to electronically obtain some data 
elements from these sources but not manually review the full 
contents of records. Disruptions in services and school closures 
during  2020  might  have  resulted  in  less  documentation  of 
ASD in records, which could decrease ASD ascertainment by 
ADDM sites. Finally, the prevalence of undetected ASD in 
each community as well as false-positive ASD diagnoses and 
classifications are unknown.

Future Directions
For  the  2022  and  2024  surveillance  years,  the  ADDM 
Network  will  continue  to  monitor  ASD  prevalence  among 
children  aged  8  years;  progress  in  early  ASD  identification 
among children aged 4 years; and the health status of, needs 
of,  and  planning  for  adolescents  with  ASD  as  they  prepare 
to  transition  to  adulthood. The  2020  early  identification 
ADDM  Network  report  documents  the  impact  of  the 
COVID-19  pandemic  on  early  evaluation  and  detection 
of ASD; the effects of the pandemic on ASD identification 
also will be examined among children aged 4 and 8 years in 
future years of surveillance. Additional analyses are needed to 
better understand changing patterns in ASD prevalence and 
differences  between  groups;  for  example,  changes  between 
2010 (when higher income was associated with higher ASD 
prevalence) to the present findings of higher prevalence among 
lower-SES  neighborhoods  are  comparable  to  studies  from 

Surveillance SummariesUS Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and PreventionFrance and Sweden (35,36). In the future, it might be possible 
to link the Social Vulnerability Index to children ascertained 
through  the  ADDM  Network  to  better  describe  disparities 
within communities.

Conclusion
Findings from the ADDM Network 2020 surveillance year 
indicate higher ASD prevalence than previous estimates from 
the ADDM Network and continuing evidence of a marked 
shift in the demographic composition of children identified 
with  ASD  compared  with  previous  years.  Although  earlier 
ADDM Network reports have shown higher prevalence among 
higher-SES White children compared with other groups, the 
latest data indicate consistently higher prevalence among Black 
and Hispanic children compared with White children, and no 
consistent association between ASD and SES. Furthermore, 
this is the first ADDM Network report in which the prevalence 
of  ASD  among  girls  has  exceeded  1%.  Since  2000,  the 
prevalence of ASD has increased steadily among all groups, 
but during 2018–2020, the increases were greater for Black 
and Hispanic children than for White children. These data 
indicate that ASD is common across all groups of children and 
underscore the considerable need for equitable and accessible 
screening, services, and supports for all children.
