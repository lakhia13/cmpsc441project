Abstract

Background. Approximately one-third of patients with psychotic disorders does not respond to
standard antipsychotic treatments. Consensus criteria for treatment resistance (TR) may aid the
identification of non-response and subsequent tailoring of treatments. Since consensus criteria
require stability of clinical status, they are challenging to apply in first-episode psychosis (FEP).
This study aims to investigate (a) if an adaptation of consensus criteria can be used to identify FEP
patients with early signs of TR (no early clinical recovery—no-ECR) after 1 year in treatment and
(b) to what extent differences in antipsychotic treatments differentiate between outcome groups.
Methods. Participants with FEP DSM-IV schizophrenia spectrum disorders were recruited
during their first treatment. A total of 207 participated in the 1-year follow-up. Remission and
recovery definitions were based on adaptations of the “Remission in Schizophrenia Working
Group” criteria and TR on adaptations of the “Treatment Response and Resistance in Psychosis”
(TRRIP) working group criteria.
Results. 97 participants (47%) could be classified as no-ECR, 61 (30%) as ECR, and 49 (23%) as
with partial ECR (P-ECR). Statistically significant baseline predictors of no-ECR matched
previously identified predictors of long-term TR. Only 35 no-ECR participants had two
adequate treatment trials and met the full TRRIP criteria. 21 no-ECR participants were using
the same medication over the follow-up year despite the lack of significant effects.
Conclusion. The difference in the percentage of FEP participants classified as no-ECR versus TR
indicates that we may underestimate the prevalence of early TR when using consensus criteria.

Introduction

Psychotic disorders have a heterogeneous outcome [1], with individual differences in treatment
response [2]. As many as 80% of first-episode psychosis (FEP) patients experience complete
remission of symptoms. Still, more than 50% experience intermittent long-term psychiatric
symptoms, and 20–30% develop stable poor outcomes despite adequate treatment [3]. The
outcome trajectories of individual patients are difficult to predict. Accumulating evidence,
however, indicates that clinical development over the first years of treatment is critical for
longer-term outcomes [4–6]. Identifying early indicators of treatment response is thus essential
to avoid prolonged exposure to ineffective treatments.

Until recently, outcome studies in FEP have been hampered by the lack of clear consensus
definitions of treatment response and treatment resistance (TR) [7, 8]. This lack has reduced the
consistency and reproducibility of study results. The Remission in Schizophrenia Working
Group (RSWG) and the Treatment Response and Resistance in Psychosis (TRRIP) working
group was established to standardize definitions [7, 8] (Table 1). The RSWG criteria define
remission as a state characterized by simultaneous scores of mild or less (e.g., Positive and
Negative Syndrome Scale [PANSS] item score ≤ 3) for items mapping positive, negative, and
disorganized symptom domains comprised by the diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia (e.g.,
PANSS items P1, delusions; P2, conceptual disorganization; P3, hallucinatory behavior; N1,
blunted affect; N4, passive social withdrawal; N6, lack of spontaneity; and G9, unusual though
content). This level of low severity should be maintained for a minimum of 6 months [7, 9].
A review of studies using RSWG criteria reported that remission rates still varied extensively
(17–78%), due to differences in sample compositions and follow-up lengths [10].

Clinical recovery (CR) is defined as stable symptom remission in
the context of regained function over a sustained period of at least
6 months by some- and up to 24 months by other criteria [11, 12,
13]. Recovery rates in FEP vary between 10 and 35%, depending on
the definition of recovery and the length of the follow-up period
[14, 15]. Long-term CR is predicted by good premorbid function-
ing, lower levels of psychopathology at baseline, and a shorter
duration of untreated psychosis (DUP) [14, 16–23]. Early response
to treatment, adherence to medication [14, 24], and signs of early
CR have also been found to predict longer-term CR [16, 17].

However, approximately one-third of FEP patients will not
benefit from traditional antipsychotic medications and are con-
sidered TR [8, 25, 26]. The TRRIP criteria define TR as a sustained
lack of remission with persistent functional loss in the context of
two adequate trials of different antipsychotic medications [8]. TR
is associated with a particularly poor clinical outcome and low
quality of life, thus representing a major therapeutic challenge
[27–29], and comprising a disproportionate share of the total
treatment cost for psychotic disorders [30, 31]. Several studies
find that an early lack of treatment response predicts poorer
outcomes [32].

Studies show that most TR patients do not respond from the
onset of their first treatment, while a smaller group appears to
develop TR later on [2, 33, 34]. Although clozapine can be effective
for some TR patients [34, 35], there are usually long delays before it
is used [1, 35, 36]. Some studies suggest that early initiation of
clozapine treatment in patients with early signs of TR may support a
better course of illness [2, 33, 37] with the possibility of a critical
time window for the clozapine effect [2, 8, 32, 38–40]. Studies imply
that such a critical time window in which clozapine is most effective
exists [32, 37, 39, 41]; however, the duration of that possible
window remains unclear [39]. Based on a reanalysis of a study of
clozapine-treated TR patients, Yoshimura et al. [39] suggested a
time window of approximately 3 years, analogous to the suggested
critical period of 2–5 years for FEP outcomes, based on the obser-
vation that 2.8 years delay in initiating clozapine was the most
predictive cut-off. Most treatment guidelines thus recommend
starting clozapine after two failures of traditional antipsychotic
medications. However, studies still show clinicians tend to increase

dosages of the standard antipsychotic and/or use polypharmacy
instead [33, 34, 42].

Identifying early signs of TR to revise treatment strategies at the
earliest possible time could improve treatment outcomes. Still, the
early identification of TR is less investigated than early signs of
CR. The TRRIP criteria for TR require at least moderate symptoms
(e.g., PANSS item scores > 3) and at least moderate functional loss
(e.g., GAF/GFS scores ≤ 60) for at least 12 weeks using an anti-
psychotic in adequate dosage, in the context of at least two previous
adequate treatment trials (e.g., more than 6 weeks on an adequate
dosage of two different antipsychotics). This implies observation
periods of at least 24 weeks on adequate antipsychotic dosages, in
addition to the time spent initiating and cross-tapering anti-
psychotics. It is thus likely that not all non-responding FEP patients
will be classified as TR by the TRRIP criteria at a 1-year follow-up.
However, the few existing studies of TR in the early phases of FEP
have used the standard TRRIP criteria [43].

Aims

The aims of this study were thus to examine if adapting the
consensus criteria, in the form of shortening the required observa-
tion periods, could be used to identify early signs of TR in FEP after
1 year of treatment. To answer this research question, we examined:
(a) The prevalence of three different early outcomes in a naturalistic
FEP sample followed-up after 1 year in treatment. Participants with
early signs of clinical recovery (ECR) indicating good treatment
response, participants without early signs of clinical recovery (no-
ECR) indicating a lack of treatment response, and participants with
in-between outcomes, i.e., in partial early clinical recovery (P-ECR).
(b) To what extent between-group differences in baseline clinical-
and demographic characteristics corresponded to known predict-
ors of longer-term outcomes, thus supporting the validity of the
early classification. In addition, we also examined and report on
(c) the antipsychotic treatment received over the first year in
treatment and (d) the prevalence of patients meeting the full TRRIP
criteria for TR, including adequate treatment attempts, at this time
point.

Methods

Setting and participants

The current study is part of the ongoing Thematically Organized
Psychosis (TOP) research study at the Norwegian Centre for Men-
tal Disorders Research (NORMENT). It has a prospective longitu-
dinal observational design using data from baseline and 1-year
follow-up.

Participants within the 18- to 65-year age range were recruited
from inpatient and outpatient psychiatric units at the major hos-
pitals in the Oslo area between 2002 and 2019. The hospitals cover a
catchment area of 660,000 inhabitants and about 88% of the total
population of Oslo. The participants met the DSM-IV criteria for
schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, schizoaffective dis-
order, and psychotic disorder NOS at baseline and were recruited
within their first year of treatment. We included individuals with
broad schizophrenia spectrum disorders since the study focuses on
the first year of treatment, where diagnosis still can be unstable
[44]. Exclusion criteria were the presence of pronounced cognitive
deficit (estimated IQ below 70), severe brain injury, or not speaking
a Scandinavian language. Due to the high prevalence of illicit
substance use in FEP, we have included patients both with and

European Psychiatry

without the use of illicit substances and examined the effect of illicit
substance use on outcomes.

A total of 387 participants completed baseline clinical assess-
ments and were eligible for participation in follow-up assessments.
Of these, 207 participants completed assessments at 1-year follow-
up. We found no significant differences in gender, baseline diag-
nosis, DUP, positive or negative symptoms at baseline, or pre-
morbid adjustment between completers and non-completers
(See Supplementary Figure S1 and Supplementary Table S2 for
an overview of attrition).

The study was conducted following the Helsinki declaration and
approved by the Regional Committee for Medical and Health
Research Ethics in Norway and the Norwegian Data Inspectorate.
The participants provided their written informed consent to par-
ticipate in the study.

Clinical assessments

Structured clinical assessments were carried out by trained clinical
psychologists and medical doctors or psychiatrists. After giving
informed consent, participants underwent comprehensive clinical
assessments, which took place over several meetings. Diagnoses
were established using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-
IV Axis I disorders (SCID-I), modules A-E (SCID I) [45]. Clinical
assessors were trained according to a program developed at UCLA
[46]. The inter-rater reliability from the program has previously
been found satisfactory, the TOP study had an overall kappa score
varying between 0.92 and 0.99 across different assessment teams
[47]. A full illness history with information about treatment history
journals, blood
was also gathered through interviews, medical
samples, and adherence questionnaires, in addition to information
about education, occupation, and marital status.

Symptoms at baseline and 1-year follow-up were measured
based on the Structured Clinical Interview for the Positive and
Negative Syndrome Scale (SCI-PANSS) [48], grouped according
to the Wallwork five-factor model consisting of a subset of items
constituting positive, negative, disorganized, excited, and
depressive symptoms [49]. This model is more appropriate than
the original three-factor model for assessing FEP populations
[49–51].

Premorbid social and academic functioning was measured with
the Premorbid Adjustment Scale (PAS) [52], a clinician-rated
seven-point scale assessing social- and academic performance over
different age groups and where the highest scores indicate the
poorest adjustment. The premorbid childhood phase is defined as
0–11 of age. We used only the childhood subscales to ensure that
PAS scores were not overlapping with any possible prodromal
period preceding the first episode.

DUP was established at baseline and measured in weeks from
the onset of psychosis until the start of adequate treatment. Psych-
osis was defined as having a score ≥4 on the PANSS positive items
P1, P3, P5, P6, and G9 for more than 1 week [53].

Functional assessment

All participants were assessed with the Global Functioning Scale
(GFS) [54, 55]. The GFS is a text-revised, two-part scale (split for
the level of functioning and symptom burden) corresponding to the
Global Assessment of Functioning Scale (GAF) [56, 57]. Partici-
pants with a GFS score ≥61 were assessed as having regained
functioning at the 1-year follow-up [14, 16]. A score of ≥61 implies
that the participant lives independently, takes care of basic needs, is

employed, and has meaningful social relationships [54]. In 21 cases,
the GFS score was missing at the 1-year follow-up. We then used all
available information from the assessments and interviews to clas-
sify these cases as above or below 61.

Outcome groups

The RSWG criteria were used to define remission of symptoms, that
is, scores equal to or below three on any of the following PANSS
items at the time of follow-up: P1 (delusions), P2 (disorganized
thought), P3 (hallucinatory behavior), N1 (affective flattening), N4
(passive social withdrawal), N6 (lack of spontaneity), G5 (bizarre
posture), or G9 (unusual thought content) [7]. We used a time
criterion for 12 weeks to ensure minimum stability and to mirror
the criteria for non-remission stated by the TRRIP instead of the
RSWG criterion of 24 weeks. ECR was defined as (a) meeting the
criteria for remission and (b) regained functioning, defined as a
GFS score ≥61. A time criterion for the latter was not applied.
No-ECR was defined as (a) not meeting the previously described
remission criteria for more than 12 weeks at follow-up and (b) not
regained functioning, defined as a GFS score <61.

P-ECR comprised participants not meeting these criteria, that is,
levels or high

either low symptom levels with low functional
symptom levels with high functional levels.

We also identified those meeting the TRRIP and RSWG-based
CR criteria, including requirements for symptom stability over time
and requirements of two adequate treatment trials. Based on the
recommendation in the relevant national guideline, we defined an
adequate treatment trial as using at least one defined daily dosage
(DDD) of antipsychotics [58] for at least 2 weeks or clozapine. The
DDD threshold used was based on FEP patients appearing to have a
better antipsychotic response than multi-episode patients [59],
with the TRRIP definition of adequate dosages higher than those
suggested for FEP in treatment guidelines (Figure 1).

Statistical analyses

We used the TSD (Tjenester for Sensitive Data) facilities at the
University of Oslo for safe data storage. For statistical analyses, we
used the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) for
Windows,
IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 28.0.
Armonk, NY: IBM Corp and STATA, version 17.0, StataCorp.
2021. Stata Statistical Software: Release 17. College Station, TX:
StataCorp LLC. Data were checked for normality, homogeneity of
variance, and outliers.

Group differences in premorbid, sociodemographic, and clin-
ical variables were examined with chi-square tests for categorical
variables and ANOVAs with Tukey post hoc tests for continuous
variables. Kruskal–Wallis tests were performed for nonparametric
continuous variables. Group differences in treatment were exam-
ined using chi-square tests with Bonferroni corrections.

Ordinal logistic regression analysis, Proportional Odds (PO)
model, was performed to investigate predictors of ECR, P-ECR,
and no-ECR. The PAS subscales were highly intercorrelated and we
chose the scale that differed most between outcome groups (social
adjustment). Significant factors that improved model fit were kept
for further analyses, using (cid:2)2 log likelihood, Akaike information
criteria (AIC), and Bayesian information criteria (BIC) to assess
and compare the model fit. The PO model fit the data better than a
multinomial logistic regression model.

We used the margins command in STATA to find predicted
probabilities. See Supplementary Table S3 for calculations of the

for specific scores on the independent variable.

Non-normally distributed variables were log-transformed
before inclusion in regression analyses. The predictor variables
were tested a priori to verify there was no violation of the multi-
collinearity assumptions. We used a likelihood ratio test and a Brant
test to test the proportional odds and parallel regression assump-
tions. Alfa was set at p < 0.05.

Results

Outcome groups as defined by adapted criteria
We identified two equally large groups of non-remitted (n = 110,
53%) and remitted (n = 97, 47%) FEP participants at 1-year follow-
up. These could be further subdivided into no-ECR (n = 97, 47%),
ECR (n = 61, 29%), and P-ECR (n = 49, 24%). The demographic
and clinical characteristics of the outcome groups are presented in
Table 2.

There were statistically significant differences between the
no-ECR and ECR groups for all investigated demographic, premor-
bid, and clinical variables, except for age, age of onset, BMI, relation-
ship status, illicit substance use, and alcohol use. The P-ECR group
was in-between the ECR and no-ECR groups in all investigated areas.
The ordinal regression analysis (Table 3) indicated that male
gender, poorer premorbid social adjustment, DUP, and more posi-
tive and negative symptoms at baseline had statistically significant
independent contributions to the predicted outcome group mem-
bership at 1-year follow-up ((cid:2)2LL = 341.170, x2 = 75.02, df. = 5,
p < 0.001). A schizophrenia diagnosis did not predict the outcome-
group membership after correcting for background variables. The
final model containing the complete set of predictors had an 18%
improvement in model fit relative to an intercept-only model
(McFadden pseudo R2 = 0.180).

Antipsychotic treatment

There were no statistically significant differences between the three
outcome groups in the number of adequate treatment trials, the

proportion of participants not using any medication at follow-up,
or the proportion of participants who had not tried any anti-
psychotic treatment (Table 4). Approximately one-third of the
sample (n = 67, 32.4%) was unmedicated at 1-year follow-up, with
10.6% (n = 22) reporting no previous use of antipsychotic medi-
cation. A significantly larger proportion of the ECR group used
the same medication from baseline to follow-up compared to the
no-ECR group. Still, 21 participants (22%) of the no-ECR group
used the same medication throughout the first year, despite the
lack of an adequate clinical response. Five participants used
clozapine, four in the no-ECR group and one in the ECR group.
There were no differences between the outcome groups regarding
which antipsychotic was the first or the second drug of choice
(Supplementary Tables S6 and S7 for further details on medica-
tion use).

Patients meeting the standard outcome criteria

We used information about the duration of the current clinical
status and information about medication history, as outlined above,
to assess how many would meet the standard RSWG and TRRIP
criteria at 1-year follow-up. We found that only 35 (17%) of
participants met the full TRRIP criteria for TR and 27 (13%) of
participants met the full RSWG-based criteria for CR at this point.
The main reason for being in the no-ECR group without meeting
the TRRIP criteria for TR was the lack of two adequate trials of
antipsychotics (Supplementary Tables S4 and S5 for details). A total
of 18 (19%) of the no-ECR group were in an ongoing antipsychotic
trial at 1-year follow-up, indicating that this classification might
change within the next year.

Discussion

There is a need to rapidly assess and re-assess treatment effects in
the early phases of the treatment for FEP [4, 5, 60]. We here
identified two distinct outcome groups showing clear signs of early
clinical non-recovery and early clinical recovery, respectively, and
a heterogeneous group with partial early clinical recovery. The
statistically significant differences in premorbid adjustment, early

illness features, and baseline clinical characteristics between the
groups are consistent with previously identified predictors of long-
term outcome [14, 29, 61] and, more specifically, longer-term CR
and TR [10, 14, 16, 18]. This supports the validity of the identified
outcome groups as early indicators of long-term outcomes [1, 2, 4,
62]. That a schizophrenia diagnosis per se did not have an indi-
vidual contribution in the regression model shows that the under-
lying differences are not secondary but integral to the diagnosis.

The predictors also correspond to those identified in a recent FEP
study of patients meeting the full TRRIP criteria [43]. In the current
study, meeting the full criteria depended, as hypothesized, on having

completed two adequate treatment trials before the 1-year follow-
up. The prevalence of TR as identified by the TRRIP criteria in the
early course of illness should thus be interpreted with some caution,
as a large proportion of patients with primary antipsychotic resist-
ance could remain unidentified. This could partly explain why
studies report an increase in TR later in the course of illness [2, 63].
Ongoing evaluation of treatment response and a change to
clozapine after two adequate but failed treatment trials is part of
most treatment guidelines [64, 65]. We thus expected that the
participants, although recruited from a naturalistic setting and
not a treatment trial, were treated according to the guidelines.

*Information about medication was compared across groups using chi-squared tests with Bonferroni corrections.

However, it appears as if more time was spent on trial and error
with different treatment strategies. This could be based on more
than just a lack of adherence to guidelines, as shared decision-
making is increasingly emphasized. Delays in the initiation of
treatment and change of medication could thus be based on the
need for psychoeducation and motivation. Previous studies point
to non-adherence or discontinuation of antipsychotic medication
as essential contributors to relapse and subsequent unfavorable
course of illness [66–68]. A slightly surprising finding was the
significant proportion of patients not using any antipsychotic
medication at 1-year follow-up across all outcome groups, includ-
ing those with early CR. The high number of unmedicated
patients across outcome groups indicates that the outcome dif-
ferences are not only due to differences in medication use or
treatment adherence.

That a high proportion of non-responding first-treatment
patients were using the same antipsychotic treatment for a year
despite a lack of sufficient response is problematic. It underlines
the need for a structured evaluation of treatment response in the
early phases to prevent non-responding patients from being
exposed to unwanted side effects in the context of little if any,
clinical benefit. The proportion using clozapine was also lower
than reported in previous studies [33, 69–71]. Fear of severe side
effects, clinicians’ unfamiliarity with procedures, and practical
inconveniences in addition to the early stage of the disorders are
possible reasons for the low number of clozapine trials [33]. How-
ever, the good effect of clozapine is illustrated by finding a
clozapine user in the ECR group, in line with studies underlining
the potential of clozapine use in the early stages of treatment [33,
34, 39].

Psychotic disorders start in young adulthood and many experi-
ence relapses and/or continuing symptoms. While the prevalence of
psychotic disorders is high, the incidence is however low. Most
psychiatrist thus have more experience treating multi-episode
patient groups with established partial or complete TR, and this
may lead to lower-than-necessary treatment expectations given the
potential of good outcomes in well-treated FEP groups. Using
predefined criteria for response and non-response adapted to the
stage of illness could here provide adequate benchmarks for treat-
ment success.

Strengths and Limitations

We report on a well-characterized sample of FEP participants in a
prospective naturalistic longitudinal design. The participants were
recruited without pre-selection from all treatment units in a large
catchment area and assessed by trained personnel.

The study protocol and data collection began before the current
consensus criteria were published. This could be seen as a limitation
because it affects the availability of measurements comprised by the
criteria. However, as we still can identify separate outcome groups
characterized by well-known predictors of outcome, our findings
can also be taken to support the robustness of the adapted criteria.
The retention rate for this study was low, which could affect both
statistical power and sample representativity. We found no signifi-
cant differences between completers and non-completers of the
1-year follow-up for demographics, premorbid adjustment, DUP,
and positive and negative symptoms at baseline. The reported
retention rate is however higher than in reports of low retention
rates in recent longitudinal studies involving patients with psych-
otic disorders [72]. The low retention rate could also be attributed
to the extensive research protocol for the larger translational project
that the longitudinal study also was a part of, where participants
were asked to join in comprehensive cognitive assessments and MR
protocols between the clinical assessments at baseline and 1-year
follow-up.

Conclusions

Using an adapted version of recent consensus criteria for outcome
after 1 year of treatment, we identified three outcome groups (no-
ECR 47%, ECR 30%, and P-ECR 23%) with statistically significant
differences in demographic, premorbid, and clinical characteristics
corresponding to predictors of long-term outcome. Using adapta-
tions of consensus criteria thus appears feasible and is reproducible
across studies. The resulting groups can be used to more rapidly
tailor treatments dependent on clinical status and to study the
mechanistic basis of different outcomes at an early stage.
