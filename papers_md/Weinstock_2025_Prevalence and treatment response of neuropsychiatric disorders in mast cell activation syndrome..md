Background: Neuropsychiatric disorders have been observed in mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS). MCAS is a 
common, yet rarely diagnosed, inflammatory, and immunologic disease characterized by mast cell dysregulation.
Methods: Questionnaires from 553 MCAS and 558 control subjects determined the prevalence and odds ratio of 
neurologic  disorders  (fatigue,  cognitive  dysfunction,  fainting/near  fainting,  migraine-like  headaches,  muscle 
pain/tenderness/weakness, pain/numbness/tingling in extremities, restless legs syndrome, seizure-like activity, 
insomnia,  sleep  attacks,  tinnitus,  acoustic  startle,  Tourette’s  syndrome,  resting  tremor,  and  light/sun/pain/ 
odors/scents/noise hypersensitivity) and psychiatric disorders (anxiety, agoraphobia, panic attacks, depression, 
bipolar depression, mania/hypomania, psychosis/schizophrenia, hallucinations, obsessive compulsive disorder, 
attention-deficit/hyperactivity  disorder,  anger  management  problems,  post-traumatic  stress  disorder,  suicidal 
thoughts, and eating disorders).
Results: Among 19 neurologic disorders, female MCAS patients reported higher rates in all but 1 disorder and 
male MCAS patients reported higher rates in all but 2 disorders. Among 14 psychiatric disorders, female MCAS 
patients reported higher rates in all and male MCAS patients reported higher rates in 8 disorders. Many of the 
disorders with increased prevalences were statistically greater compared to corresponding controls.
In self-reported ratings for effects on health status (0 = no benefit, 10 = maximum benefit), mean (SD) response 
was 6.3 (2.5) for antihistamines, 5.6 (3.2) for low-dose naltrexone, and 5.6 (3.1) for benzodiazepines.
Conclusion: MCAS subjects have significantly elevated odds ratios for many neuropsychiatric disorders and may 
see improvement of symptoms using MCAS-targeted therapies, suggesting that mast cell dysregulation affects the 
brain and peripheral nervous systems and contributes to neuropsychiatric symptoms. Certain mast cell media-
tors, specific genetic predisposition, and life experiences could determine which disorder is apt to develop or 
worsen.

1. Introduction

1.1. Overview of treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders

mast cell) which fairly reliably reveals the patients in whom MCAS is 
most  likely  underlying/unifying  diagnosis  accounting  for  the  largest 
extent of the problems and findings in the patient to date.

The clinical and societal impacts of neuropsychiatric (NP) disorders 
are  profound,  affecting  countless  individuals  and  families  (Hill  et  al., 
2021; Barr et al., 2022). Therefore, it is crucial to pursue treatments that 
specifically  target  the  underlying  pathophysiology.  The  impact  of  NP 
disorders is especially substantial for migraines, cognitive dysfunction, 
autism, restless legs syndrome (RLS), and depression (Burch et al., 2018; 
Hale et al., 2020; Theoharides et al., 2012a,b,c-a; Allen et al., 2005; Barr 
et  al.,  2022).  These  disorders  and  others  have  been  associated  with 
neuroimmune dysfunction and can be difficult to treat (Liberman et al., 
2018).

1.2. Multisystemic presentations of mast cell activation syndrome

Mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS) remains unrecognized as the 
primary cause for many complex patients with a multisystemic disorder 
(Afrin et al., 2016-a; Afrin et al., 2016-b; Afrin et al., 2020a,b). Symp-
toms of MCAS typically begin during childhood, sometimes in infancy 
(Afrin et al., 2020a,b). Patients may experience a variety of non-specific 
gastrointestinal and dermatologic symptoms, headaches, and frequent 
episodes of inflammation, which may be misinterpreted as infections. 
Other issues can include developmental anomalies, problems with the 
integrity  and  healing  of  connective  tissues,  and  atopic  disorders. 
MCAS-associated NP manifestations can be caused by dysfunction of the 
abnormal  MCs  in  the  central  and/or  peripheral  nervous  system  or 
indirectly by MC mediators in other tissues which lead to inflammatory 
and other effects in nervous systems (Afrin et al., 2015). For instance, 
cytokines  such  as  IL-12,  a  key  mediator  of  neuroinflammation,  may 
contribute  to  NP  symptoms  by  altering  neurotransmitter  systems  and 
activating  microglia  (Chauhan  et  al.,  2025).  While NP  manifestations 
have been reported in systemic mastocytosis (SM), a rare malignancy, 
MCAS itself has only recently gained attention, making it an underap-
preciated  and  often  treatable  differential  diagnosis  to  explain  a  wide 
range of NP disorders (Sagües-Ses´e et al., 2023; Afrin et al., 2015). Many 
NP disorders may stem from this more prevalent MC disease. Inflam-
matory disorders are often more prominent than allergic phenomena. 
Although allergic, dystrophic, and other phenomena are commonly seen 
in MCAS, chronic multisystem inflammation is the universal constant, or 
sine qua non, of MCAS (Afrin et al., 2016-a). Concordant with the MC’s 
evolutionarily defined role as the immune system’s front-line sentinel 
against insults to the body, a very wide range of stimuli for triggering 
MC  activation  has  been  identified,  including  a  vast  array  of  physical 
substances and forces (Weinstock et al., 2024). Mast cell activation and 
NP symptoms are known to be worsened by stress in humans and in lab 
animals (Theoharides, 2000; Sanacora et al., 2022). Thus, in MCAS there 
is  not  only  constitutive  chronic  aberrant  mediator  release  by  the 
dysfunctional  MCs  but  also  inappropriate  reactive  mediator  release 
upon exposure to various triggers.

The diagnosis of MCAS is often delayed for decades. Reasons for this 
include: 1) the relative absence of MCAS education in medical school 
and residency curricula, 2) the common misconception that an increased 
serum  tryptase  level  is  needed  to  establish  the  diagnosis,  and  3)  the 
marked  heterogeneity  of  the  disease’s  clinical  presentation  (conse-
quential to its marked heterogeneity at the genetic mutation level and 
the mediator expression level).

One  should  consider  a  differential  diagnosis  to  include  systemic 
mastocytosis and subclassifications, monoclonal MCAS, and secondary 
MCAS. As is the case with most challenges in differential diagnosis, it is 
the totality of the patient’s presentation (the symptoms and problems 
experienced throughout the patient’s life, and the full extent of findings 
on  comprehensive  physical  examination  and  thorough  laboratory 
testing  including  properly  technically  executed  testing  looking  for 
elevated levels in blood or urine of mediators relatively specific to the 

1.3. Etiology and prevalence of mast cell activation syndrome

Mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS) is characterized by unregu-
lated immune responses often linked to genetic mutations in mast cell 
(MC) regulatory genes (Molderings et al., 2007, Afrin et al., 2016a; Afrin 
et al., 2017; Afrin et al., 2020a,b). Epigenetic changes leading to somatic 
variants in MC regulatory genes are usually at the root of this lifelong 
illness (Molderings, 2007, 2022). Such variants and consequential MC 
dysfunction usually begin early in an MCAS patient’s life. As most MCAS 
patients progress through life, the acquisition of other variants (typically 
soon after major stressors) often leads the disease to escalate its baseline 
level of MC dysfunction, potentially affecting any or every system in the 
body (Afrin et al., 2020a,b).

MCAS  is  diagnosed  far  more  commonly  in  females  than  males 
(~4–5:1),  which  may  be  due  to  biological  determinants  (e.g.,  MC- 
surface  estrogen  receptors)  (Zierau  et  al.,  2012).  The  prevalence  of 
MCAS in the Northern Hemisphere is estimated at 4 %–17 % (Zaghmout 
et al., 2024; Molderings et al., 2013).

The biology and anatomical distribution of MCs in proximity to pe-
ripheral and central neurons may account for a wide range of extensive 
NP  symptoms  seen  in  these  patients  (Theoharides  et  al.,  2024).  Hun-
dreds of mediators and cell-surface receptors are known to be expressed 
by mast cells (MCs) (Molderings, Afrin, 2023). In the largest series of 
prospective  MCAS  patients  (N  = 413),  the  prevalence  of  various  NP 
disorders and symptoms included fatigue (83 %), fibromyalgia-type pain 
(75  %),  pre-syncope/syncope  (71  %),  headaches  (63  %),  cognitive 
dysfunction  (49  %),  insomnia  (35  %),  vision  abnormalities  (30  %), 
anxiety and/or panic attacks (16 %), depression (13 %) and involuntary 
movements (13 %) (Afrin et al., 2017). In 2010, an article listed head-
ache,  syncope,  and  psychiatric  conditions  that  were  associated  with 
mast cell activation (Akin et al., 2010).

1.4. The brain, mast cells, mediators, and inflammation

MCAS-associated NP manifestations can be caused by dysfunction of 
abnormal  MCs  in  the  central  and/or  peripheral  nervous  system  or 
indirectly by MC mediators in other tissues, leading to inflammatory and 
other  effects  in  the  peripheral  and  central  nervous  systems  (CNS) 
(Theoharides et al., 2012a,b,c-b; Theoharides et al., 2016, 2017, 2019, 
2024). Migraine is a common comorbidity noted in patients with MCAS 
(Blitshteyn, 2023). MCs are present in the meninges and are implicated 
in the pathophysiology of migraine via neuropeptide release, vasodila-
tion, plasma, and protein extravasation that can lead to MC degranula-
tion  (Hendriksen  et  al.,  2017).  Degranulation  of  meningeal  MCs  may 
sensitize trigeminal vascular afferent processing (Blitshteyn, 2023). This 
MC-mediated pathway is thought to be one of the mechanisms under-
lying migraine pain pathophysiology (Aich et al., 2015). Additionally, 
circulating autoantibodies could affect the brain and autonomic nervous 
system due to an MC-induced hyperpermeable blood-brain barrier (BBB) 
and/or  an  abnormal  functioning  blood-cerebrospinal  fluid  barrier 
(Shelestak et al., 2020; Gelb, 2018). The role of MC activation in a va-
riety of NP disorders has been studied in humans and in animal models 
(Theoharides et al., 2016; Moura et al., 2011; Georgin-Lavialle et al., 
2016; Kempuraj et al., 2017; Nicoloro-SantaBarbara et al., 2021; Nic-
oloro-SantaBarbara et al., 2022; Jendoubi et al., 2021; Bidri et al., 1999; 
Ikarashi,  Yuzurihara,  2002).  Magnetic  resonance  imaging  (MRI)  has 
demonstrated morphological and functional abnormalities in the brains 
of SM patients with NP complaints, (Boddaert et al., 2017). MCAS pa-
tients with NP complaints also have similar neuro-radiographic findings 
(abnormal punctuated white matter abnormalities) (Haenisch, Molder-
ings, 2018).

1.5. Inflammation, allergy, and psychiatric disorders

The field of immuno-psychiatry has been suggested as an agenda for 
clinicians to develop innovative research (Leboyer et al., 2016). Immune 
and/or inflammatory disorders have been suspected to play direct roles 
in  the  pathophysiology  of  the  following  disorders:  pediatric  autoim-
mune  neuropsychiatric  disorders  associated  with  depression,  strepto-
coccal  infection,  pediatric  acute-onset  neuropsychiatric  syndrome, 
bipolar  depression,  obsessive-compulsive  disorder  (OCD),  and  tic  dis-
orders (Leonard et al., 2001; Hamdani et al., 2012; Chang et al., 2015; 
Gerentes  et  al.,  2019;  Hsu  et  al.,  2021;  Marazziti  et  al.,  2023).  In  an 
exceptionally large pediatric study of tic disorders (N = 4508), ADHD 
(N = 83,569), and/or OCD (N = 1555), there was a higher prevalence of 
atopy in tic disorders (51.6 %), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder 
(ADHD) (50.7 %), and OCD (47.7 %) compared to 75,000 controls (38.6 
%)  (Hakimi  et  al.,  2022).  The  prevalence  of  allergic  conjunctivitis, 
allergic rhinitis, asthma, and atopic dermatitis was higher in children 
with tics, ADHD, or OCD as compared to controls.

1.6. Mast cell therapy and improvement in neuropsychiatric 
manifestations

in 

successful 

other  MC  medications  were 

There is emerging evidence that MC therapy may be effective for NP 
disorders in patients with MCAD. Antihistamines have been recognized 
to be helpful in some NP disorders, including migraine and neuropathic 
pain  (Worm  et  al.,  2019;  Khalilzadeh  et  al.,  2018).  Omalizumab  was 
partially  effective  for  several  NP  symptoms  in  SM  and  MCAS  (Lemal 
et al., 2019). In MCAS, NP symptoms improved in a patient with severe 
MCAS  and  postural  orthostatic  tachycardia  syndrome  (POTS)  using 
low-dose  naltrexone  (LDN),  intravenous  immune  globulin,  and  anti-
biotic  therapy  for  small  intestinal  bacterial  overgrowth  (Weinstock 
et  al.,  2018).  A  case  series  of  116  MCAS  patients  treated  with  LDN 
demonstrated improvement in a wide array of NP disorders (Weinstock, 
2020-a). In another case series, combinations of antihistamines, LDN, 
and 
treating 
standard-treatment  refractory  NP  manifestations  (Weinstock  et  al., 
2023). An animal study showed overall improvement in hippocampal 
neuroinflammation, apoptosis and synapse dysfunction using zileuton (a 
leukotriene synthesis inhibitor occasionally used in MCAD) (Liu et al., 
2020). Several patients who were first evaluated by the authors noted 
that  chronic  benzodiazepines  appear  to  have  had  been  prescribed  by 
other doctors for anxiety and insomnia. These two conditions were the 
most common NP disorders seen in MCAS patients (Afrin et al., 2017). In 
the  authors’  experience,  benzodiazepines, 
low, 
non-addicting doses and principally via their engagement with inhibi-
tory benzodiazepine binding targets known to be present in MCs, not 
uncommonly  help diverse MCAS symptoms  including a  variety of  NP 
and  systemic  symptoms,  not  only  when  taken  reactively  during  a 
trigger-induced symptomatic flaring of the disease but also when taken 
preventively at a low dose. An intravenous protocol that includes lor-
azepam  appeared  to  help  MCAS-induced  gastrointestinal  attacks 
(Weinstock et al., 2024). In vitro studies showed that benzodiazepines 
reduce MC activity (Birdri et al., 1999; Hoffmann et al., 2013; Yousefi 
et  al.,  2013;  Haenisch  et  al.,  2013).  Luteolin,  a  flavonoid  with 
anti-inflammatory efficacy, is used to treat MCAS as a MC stabilizer but 
has also been shown to improve autism spectrum disease, fatigue, and 
cognitive  dysfunction  (Theoharides  et  al.,  2012a,b,c-c;  Theoharides 
et al., 2012a,b,c; Tsilioni I, Theoharides, 2024; Gelabert-Rebato et al., 
2019). Vitamin D is another MC stabilizer and is also protective against 
NP disorders (Wassif et al., 2023). Certain probiotics and herbal medi-
cations can also suppress MC-induced inflammation (Dev et al., 2008; Li 
et al., 2019).

1.7. Purpose of this study

The  study  sought  to  determine  the  prevalence  of  a  variety  of  NP 

3 

manifestations  in  MCAS  patients  in  comparison  to  healthy  controls. 
Chronic  fatigue,  cognitive  dysfunction,  faint/near  faint,  migraine-like 
headaches,  muscle  pain/tenderness,  muscle  weakness  in  the  arms/ 
legs,  nerve  pain/numbness/tingling,  RLS,  seizure-like  activity, 
insomnia, sleep attacks, tinnitus, acoustic startle, Tourette’s syndrome, 
resting  tremors,  and  hypersensitivity  to  (a)  light/sun,  (b)  pain,  (c) 
odors/scents, or (d) noise were studied. Participants with MCAS were 
evaluated retrospectively for the historical efficacy and side effects of 
MC therapy by antihistamines, LDN, and benzodiazepines.

2. Methods

2.1. Study approval

The study was reviewed by the Sterling Investigational Review Board 
in Atlanta, Georgia. The board determined that the study (ID #12217, 
Protocol #12212) was exempt from full review pursuant to the terms of 
the U.S. Department of Health and Human Service’s Policy for Protec-
tion  of  Human  Research  Subjects  at  45  C.F.R.  §46.104(d).  The  board 
determined  that  the  exemption  Category  2  applied.  All  participants 
signed  an  electronic  informed  consent  form  that  allowed  anonymous 
collection and reporting of clinical data.

2.2. Inclusion and exclusion criteria

MCAS subjects were included if they were previously diagnosed with 
MCAS by one of the investigators using either the consensus-1 and/or 
consensus-2  proposals  for  diagnostic  criteria  for  MCAS  (Afrin  et  al., 
2020a). Consensus-1 and -2 criteria include 2 or more systems with MC 
symptoms,  although  anaphylaxis  is  usually  present  in  consensus-1. 
Laboratory support  for  a  diagnosis of  MCAS  per consensus-1  requires 
an  increase  of  tryptase  during  a  MC  attack,  whereas  any  increase  of 
tryptase  (not  attributable  to  hereditary  alpha-tryptasemia)  or  other 
mediators  relatively  specific  to  the  mast  cell  supports  a  diagnosis  of 
MCAS per consensus-2. The third criteria are similar in both consensus 
groups  (required  in  consensus-1,  though  optional  in  consensus-2  in 
recognition of the disease’s heterogeneity) – namely, that MC directed 
therapy improves the symptoms.

The study was a multicenter study with participants recruited from 
practices  based  in  Missouri,  New  York,  Washington,  and  Colorado. 
These clinicians had expertise in MCAS with specialties in gastroenter-
ology (LW), hematology/oncology (LA), neurology (SB, LK), and inter-
nal medicine with a focus on complex diseases (GE, JS, TD, DK).

Control  subjects  were  included  if  they  had  never  been  diagnosed 
with  MCAS.  Owing  to  the  high  prevalence  of  MCAS  in  the  general 
population and significant genetic predisposition, it is possible that some 
of the controls had undiagnosed MCAS. All participants were asked if 
there was a personal or family history of anaphylaxis, atopic disorders 
(“severe  allergic  symptoms  and/or  asthma  requiring  medicines  on  a 
weekly  basis  year-round”),  chronic  fatigue  syndrome  (CFS),  chronic 
pelvic  pain  syndromes  (CPPS  including  interstitial  cystitis,  chronic 
prostatitis, and vulvodynia), chronic vomiting syndrome (CVS), Ehlers- 
Danlos syndrome (EDS), fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS), irritable bowel 
syndrome  (IBS),  postural  orthostatic  tachycardia  syndrome  (POTS), 
RLS, or urticaria.

All participants had the same exclusion criteria: age less than 18 or 
greater than 85, and inability to read English at 8th grade level or above. 
Subjects  were  also  excluded  if  they  were  receiving  chemotherapy, 
currently  pregnant,  or  infected  with  mononucleosis  which  could  all 
cause MCAS symptoms. Vulnerable populations were excluded.

2.3. Study design and methods

Review  of  patient  records  to  confirm  the  diagnosis  of  MCAS  was 
performed by each investigator. These patients received invitations to 
join the study by each investigator. The invitation stated that patients 

L.B. Weinstock et al.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           

Brain, Behavior, & Immunity - Health 48 (2025) 101048 

were  being  recruited  to  compare  symptoms  and  conditions  of  MCAS 
versus a healthy population and that the survey was anonymous. The 
patients and investigators were asked to recruit their own healthy social 
network to the control group. The study design was observational and 
included retrospective and current data. To access the online question-
naire,  the  consent  form  was  reviewed  and  affirmed  before  survey 
questions  could  be  reviewed.  Survey  responses  from  subjects  who 
completed less than 85 % of the survey were excluded from analysis. 
When disorders were not well known by their common name such as 
depression or anxiety, a lay definition was provided. Neurologic exam-
ples include brain fog (disturbance of memory, word-finding difficulties, 
difficulties  in  concentrating),  acoustic  startle  (muscular  activity  in 
response to a sudden loud sound), restless legs syndrome (the compel-
ling urge to move one’s legs or arms while at rest, often associated with 
discomfort,  usually  at  night  and  at  rest,  temporarily  improves  with 
movement; it is not muscular cramps or caused by pain in the back), and 
tinnitus (ringing or other noises in the ear(s) are bothersome and not 
caused by loud noise injury and do not sound like pulsations). A psy-
chiatric  example  included  agoraphobia:  fear  and  avoiding  places  or 
situations that might cause panic and feelings of being trapped, helpless, 
or  embarrassed).  See  Appendix  1 for  other  questionnaire  details.  In 
contrast, a variety of medical terms are used in this text in response to 
the answers. For example, the question on the survey was “do you have 
pain, tingling, and/or numbness in the legs or arms,” while in this text 
we use the medical term neuropathy.

The  MC  mediator  release  syndrome  (MCMRS)  questionnaire  was 
used as a template for part of the health survey. The MCMRS score is a 
standardized validated checklist (Appendix 2) (Molderings et al., 2013). 
The  updated  MCMRS  includes  severity  scores  which  were  used  to 
calculate the cumulative severity score (Weinstock et al., 2020-b).

2.4. Analysis of study results

Data  included  subject  age,  gender,  ethnicity,  and  comparison  of 
personal and familial health  disorders. The primary  outcome was the 
prevalence of NP disorders in MCAS subjects compared to controls. The 
control  group  with  and  without  MCAS  risk  factors  were  compared 
separately to the MCAS group. 

To evaluate fatigue, subjects were asked to think back to the worst 
part of their lifetime regarding fatigue and/or weakness and use the 
following scales to rate the symptoms: 1) frequency: 0 = none of the 
time; 1 = a little of the time; 2 = about half of the time; 3 = most of 
the  time;  4  = all  of  the  time;  and  2)  severity:  0  = symptom  not 
present; 1 = mild; 2 = moderate; 3 = severe; 4 = very severe. The 
worst possible score is 8 points.

The  DePaul  Symptom  Questionnaire  was  used  to  assess  post- 
exertional malaise (Cotler et al., 2018) with 5 questions based on the 
presence  or  absence  of  five  symptoms:  1)  dead,  heavy  feeling  after 
starting to exercise?; 2) next day soreness or fatigue after non-strenuous, 
everyday  activities?;  3)  mentally  tired  after  the  slightest  effort?;  4) 
minimum  exercise  makes  you  physically  tired?;  and  5)  physically 
drained or sick after mild activity? The worst possible score is 5 points.
The prevalence of depression was determined by asking if there was 
a physician’s diagnosis and/or self-diagnosis of depression independent 
of  a  consequence  of  complications  of  COVID  Infection.  Subjects  were 
asked: 1) if they ever had a period of depressed mood lasting most of the 
day almost every day for a period of at least 2 weeks; 2) if they ever had a 
period of at least 2 weeks in which they were much less interested in the 
things they usually liked to do; 3) if they ever felt deeply sad for 2 or 
more weeks; and 4) if they ever felt suicidal. To look for confounding 
causes of depression or anxiety, subjects were asked if they ever expe-
rienced abuse, trauma, or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in their 
lifetime.

Participants with MCAS were asked to record the historical efficacy 
and  side  effects  of  MC  therapy  by  antihistamines,  LDN,  and 

benzodiazepines. Each medicine was evaluated by the percentage of the 
MCAS subjects who were using such medications presently or had used 
them in the past. Global health improvement using a Likert scale with 
mean (±SD) degree of improvement was based on a Likert scale of 0 (no 
improvement) to 10 (excellent improvement). Participants with MCAS 
also  marked  which  NP  symptoms  improved  to  any  degree,  if  any,  by 
each medication.

2.5. Statistical methods

Descriptive  statistics  included  measures  of  central  tendency  and 
variability  for  continuous  variables,  and  percentages  for  categorical 
variables. Welch’s t-tests and Chi-square tests were used to test signifi-
cant differences between patients and controls on continuous and cat-
egorical  variables,  respectively.  To  compare  the  prevalence  of  NP 
disorders between MCAS patients and the non-age-matched controls, we 
performed logistic regression analyses for each disorder, separately for 
males  and  females.  In  each  model,  the  presence  of  the  NP  condition 
(present vs. absent) was regressed on MCAS status (MCAS vs. control) 
while adjusting for age as a covariate. Odds ratios (OR) and 95 % con-
fidence  intervals  (CI)  were  then  computed  from  the  regression  co-
efficients  to  quantify  the  association  between  MCAS  and  each  NP 
condition. Statistical analyses were performed using R version 4.41 (R 
Core Team, 2024). Statistical significance was defined as p < .05.

3. Results

3.1. Clinical characteristics of subjects

553 MCAS patients and 558 controls completed the survey. Patients 
included 499 females  with mean  age ±SD 45.9 ± 14.3 and  54 males 
with mean age 46.6 ± 15.5. Controls included 416 females with mean 
age 51.8 ± 15.0 and 142 males with mean age 54.1 ± 16.1. Among both 
genders, patients were significantly younger than controls (females p <
.0001 and  males  p = .0036). Table 1 shows the  demographics of the 
participants which were similar. The MCAS patients’  mean time from 
diagnosis  of MCAS  to  the time  of the  survey  was  3.0  ± 2.5  years for 
females and 4.3 ± 2.6 years for males.

Despite their younger age, patients had accumulated all clinical risk 
factors  compared  to  controls,  as  shown  in  Table  2.  Patients  reported 
significantly higher rates of MCAS-related diagnoses and family history 
of the diagnoses. The most common physician-diagnosed comorbid di-
agnoses were POTS, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and urticaria. The

analysis of the control group with and without MCAS risk factors were 
compared separately to the  MCAS group and  there was no difference 
affecting the odds ratio. As shown in Table 3, patients had significantly 
higher  overall MCMRS scores, more symptoms (i.e., symptom count), 
more systems involved (i.e., system count), and higher symptom severity 
scores compared to their same-gender controls. Spider web plots rep-
resenting total MCMRS scores and system involvement in MCAS patients 
and control subjects are shown in Fig. 1.

3.2. Prevalence of neurologic disorders and symptoms

Female  patients  had  a  mean  ± SD  of  10.0  ± 4.0  self-reported 
neurologic  disorders  and  symptoms,  significantly  higher  than  female 
controls (mean 2.5 ± 3.3, p < .001). Male patients had a mean of 7.0 ±
4.2  self-reported  neurologic  disorders  and  symptoms,  significantly 
higher than male controls (mean 0.5 ± 2.5, p < .001). Tables 4a and 4b

and  gender.  The  most  prevalent  were  fatigue,  cognitive  dysfunction, 
neuropathy, and migraines, with female patients’ prevalence exceeding 
70 % and male patients trailing closely behind. To better characterize 
the major differences in prevalences between patients and controls, fe-
male and male MCAS patients’  OR for each disorder were calculated, 
controlling for age and gender. This allowed us to quantify how MCAS 
was associated with (often dramatically) increased odds of having each 
disorder relative to the baseline rates in our control group. Female pa-
tients’  OR were highest at 23.5 for cognitive dysfunction, 22.3 for fa-
tigue, and 15.3 for non-epileptic seizure activity. Male MCAS patients’ 
OR were highest at 28.0 for odor sensitivity, 23.4 for light sensitivity, 
and 18.6 for fatigue. In other words, MCAS patients were dramatically 
more  likely  to  report  many  neurologic  disorders,  suggesting  the 
observed  difference  between  patients  and  controls  was  not  due  to 
chance.

3.3. Prevalence of psychiatric disorders and symptoms

Tables 5a and 5b illustrate self-reported prevalence of each psychi-
atric disorder and symptom by group and gender. The most prevalent 
symptoms were anxiety disorder, depression, panic attacks, and PTSD 
where female patients’ prevalence neared (or exceeded) 50 % and male 
patients trailed but still showed high prevalence compared to controls. 
Female patients had a mean of 3.8 ± 2.6 self-reported psychiatric dis-
orders, significantly higher than female controls (mean 1.3 ± 1.8, p <
.001). Male patients had a mean of 2.9 ± 2.7 self-reported psychiatric 
disorders, significantly higher than male controls (mean 0.9 ± 1.7, p <
.001).

To better characterize the significant differences in prevalences be-
tween patients and controls, the OR was calculated for each symptom, 
separately  for  males  and  females,  and  controlled  for  age.  Female  pa-
tients’ OR were statistically significantly higher than female controls on 
13 of 14 disorders, and highest at OR 12.3 for hallucinations, 8.1 for 
bipolar depression, 7.4 for suicidal ideation, 6.6 for PTSD and 6.1 for 
OCD. Male patients’ OR were statistically significantly higher than male 
controls on 8 of 14 disorders, and highest at OR 8.3 for PTSD, 8.0 for 
OCD, 8.3, 7.9 for agoraphobia, and 7.0 for hallucinations.

3.4. Response to medical therapy for both neurologic and psychiatric 
disorders and symptoms

The number and percent of MCAS subjects who tried antihistamines 
was 498 (88.9 %), LDN was 347 (62.0 %), and benzodiazepines was 324 
(57. 9 %). In self-reported ratings for effects on health status (0 = no 
benefit,  10  = maximum  conceivable  benefit),  MCAS  patients  gave 
slightly, but significantly higher mean ratings (±SD) to antihistamines 
6.3 (±2.3) vs. LDN 5.6 (±3.2) and benzodiazepines 5.6 (±3.1) (p < .01).
In the subjects who experienced the following neurologic disorders 
and symptoms, antihistamines were rated effective by 25 % of the pa-
tients  who  used  antihistamines  for  cognitive  dysfunction,  23  %  for 
migraine, 22 % for fatigue, and 21 % for chronic severe insomnia. LDN

was  rated  to  be  effective  by  29  %  for  fatigue  and  myalgia,  28  %  for 
cognitive dysfunction, and 22 % for both neuropathy and RLS. Benzo-
diazepines helped 51 % of those with chronic severe insomnia, 34 % 
with tremors at rest, 29 % with RLS, 25 % with pain hypersensitivity, 
and 22 % with myalgia. Further details are shown in Table 6a.

In the subjects who experienced the following psychiatric disorders 
and symptoms, antihistamines were rated effective by 21 % for anxiety 
disorder, 14 % for anger management problems, 13 % for depression, 
and 12 % for panic disorder. LDN was rated effective by 16 % for anxiety 
disorder  and  depression,  14  %  for  bipolar  disorder,  12  %  for  agora-
phobia, and 10 % for ADHD. Benzodiazepines showed the highest effi-
cacy ratings for anxiety disorders (helping 70 %), panic disorder (52 %), 
agoraphobia (51 %), OCD (38 %), PTSD (33 %), and anger management 
(32 %). Among 324 patients who took benzodiazepines, 76 (23.4 %) had 
to increase dose to maintain the same effect. Further details are shown in 
Table 6b. Specific symptoms were summarized in supplemental files 1 to 
3.

3.5. Side effects of medical therapy for neuropsychiatric disorders

Side effects were reported by patients at a rate of 38.5 % for anti-
histamines,  33.7  %  for  LDN,  and  34.9  %  for  benzodiazepines,  with 
further details shown in Table 7. Among 324 patients who took benzo-
diazepines, 76 (23.4 %) had to increase the dose to maintain the same 
effect,  yet  specific  data  about  whether  this  drug  class  was  used  as 
monotherapy was not assessed in the questionnaire. Patients reported a 
wide  range  of  side  effects  to  these  medications,  though  it  is  unclear 
whether such issues were drug-driven reactivities or, as MCAS is known 
to drive, excipient-driven reactivities (Schofield, Afrin, 2019).

6 

Well-established  general  physiological  effects  (dryness  of  mucus 
membranes – 12 patients) and neurological and neuropsychiatric effects 
(fatigue – 9 patients) were common for those who tried type-1 antihis-
tamines. The use of sedating versus nonsedating antihistamines was not 
questioned in the survey (Appendix 1). LDN was associated with a large 
variety  of  side  effects  including  headaches,  insomnia,  and  abnormal 
dreams.  The  most  reported  side  effects  from  benzodiazepines  were 
drowsiness (22 patients), fatigue (19 patients), brain fog (18 patients), 
and other memory issues (15 patients). Increased anxiety in 10 patients 
and  worsening  depression  in  8  patients  was  also  reported.  Fourteen 
patients reported anaphylaxis and hives from benzodiazepines.

4. Discussion

4.1. Overview

The present study showed that MCAS patients have high rates of self- 
reported NP disorders and symptoms compared to healthy age-matched 
controls. For neurologic disorders, the prevalence in descending order 
from 75 % to 25 % included fatigue, cognitive dysfunction, migraine- 
like headaches, faint/near faint, insomnia, environmental sensitivities 
(odor,  light,  sound),  tinnitus,  muscle  tenderness,  neuropathy-like 
symptoms,  muscle  weakness,  RLS, pain  hypersensitivity, and  acoustic 
startle.  For  psychiatric  disorders,  the  highest  prevalences  observed  in 
descending order from 75 % to 25 % included anxiety, depression, panic 
disorder, PTSD, suicidal thoughts, and OCD.

We  theorize  that,  when  inappropriately  expressed,  MC  mediators 
which either cross the BBB into the CNS or which are expressed by MCs 
resident within the CNS can lead to or exacerbate various NP disorders.

Certain MC mediators, specific genetic predisposition, and life experi-
ences could determine which disorder is apt to develop or worsen. NP 
disorders could also be affected by genetically mutated MCs in the CNS 
and/or peripheral nervous system or by circulating MC mediators that 
may lead to CNS or peripheral nervous system neuroinflammation.

Although  histamine  itself  does  not  readily  cross  the  blood-brain 
barrier  (BBB)  (Partridge,  2005),  histamine  generated  by  any  cells 
within the CNS (including at least some neurons as well as MCs, mac-
rophages, and some glial cells) obviously has potential to engage with 
any cells within the CNS which express histamine receptors. Most of the 
histamine  receptors  (H1,  H2,  and  H4  (Haas  et  al.,  2008;  Szukiewicz, 
2024), found on most MCs are also found on most neurons (evidence is 
weaker regarding neuronal expression of H4 receptors (Schneider, Sei-
fert,  2016),  so  it  is  inescapable  that  aberrantly  excessive  histamine 
expression by the fundamentally dysfunctional MCs at the root of MCAS 
(and  regardless  of  whether  such  MCs  are  resident  within  the  CNS  or 
outside) has ample potential to drive a wide array of problems in both 
peripheral and central neurons both directly via binding with neuronal 
histamine  receptors  as  well  as  indirectly  by  binding  with  various  im-
mune and glial cells in the central nervous system. Depending on which 
mediators  are  (directly  and/or  indirectly)  impacting  which  neurons, 
such  effects  obviously  can  result  in  any  of  a  wide  array  of  central 
neuronal issues (Szukiewicz, 2024) regardless of whether any such issue 
is superficially categorized as a “neurologic” or “cognitive” or “psychi-
atric”  or  “dysautonomic”  issue.  A  similarly  wide  array  of  direct  and 

indirect effects upon neurons can be seen with many other potent in-
flammatory mediators, too, which are expressed by MCs (some of which, 
unlike histamine,  readily  cross the BBB (e.g.,  interleukin-6 (IL-6) and 
tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) (Banks, 1995). Though the BBB 
penetrability  of  another  potent  inflammatory  mediator  produced  by 
MCs  and  glial  cells,  IL-12  is  less  clear.  IL-12  is  clearly  involved  in 
pathogenesis and progression of a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders 
(Chauhan, 2025).

MCAS is often unrecognized and undiagnosed (Afrin et al., 2016-b). 
This multisystemic disease can account for the underlying pathophysi-
ology in certain idiopathic syndromes including POTS, FMS, CPPS, and 
IBS. These syndromes have been labeled as have underlying centralized 
hypersensitivity. Physicians  should consider trying  to diagnose MCAS 
and using MCAS therapies as part of the approach to the complex patient 
who might otherwise be dismissed as having a functional neurologic or 
somatoform disorder.

A high  burden of  NP  manifestations has  also been  documented  in 
POTS, hEDS, and fibromyalgia. In an online survey of 4835 individuals 
with POTS, 99 % reported dizziness or light-headedness, 94 % difficulty 
concentrating, 94 % headache, 87 % memory problems, 84 % myalgia, 
83 % muscle weakness, 78 % tremulousness, 76 % paresthesias in the 
hands  and  67  %  in  the  feet,  and  75  %  blurred  vision,  65  %  hand 
numbness, 58 % foot numbness (Shaw et al., 2019). After POTS diag-
nosis,  37  % reported  having  a  psychiatric  or  psychological diagnosis. 
Likewise, an online survey of 2596 people with fibromyalgia found that 
47 % reported recurrent headaches, 46 % tingling, 45 % balance prob-
lems,  44  %  numbness,  40  %  chronic  fatigue,  40  %  depression,  38  % 
anxiety  and  30  %  tinnitus  (Bennett  et  al.,  2007).  A  review  of

4.2. Comments on specific neurological disorders and symptoms

In  the  present  study,  fatigue  and  cognitive  dysfunction  had  the 
highest OR (20.5 and 20.1, respectively). LDN was rated helpful by 29 % 
for fatigue  and antihistamines were rated helpful in  22 % of  patients 
who took LDN. LDN helped 28 % with cognitive dysfunction and anti-
histamines helped 22 %. Based on limitations of the questionnaire, it is 
not  clear  whether  these  benefits  were  additive  using  multiple 
medications.

POTS can be a devastating multi-systemic illness and can have co-
morbid MCAS (Kohno et al., 2021). In a study of 69 POTS patients, 42 % 
(29/69)  initially diagnosed with  POTS showed  both additional  symp-
toms  and  at  least  one  elevated  biochemical  marker  suggesting  MCAS 
(Kohno  et  al.,  2021).  Another  study  of  the  parasympathetic  nervous 
system and MCs suggested that endogenous acetylcholine (receptors for 
which  are  expressed  by  MCs)  activates  meningeal  MCs  (Kilinc  et  al., 
2024).  Further  studies  are  needed  to  delineate  the  complex  interplay 
between MCs, the autonomic nervous system, connective tissues of the 
meninges, cerebral vasculature, and other structures important to the 
pathophysiology  of  the  triad  of  dysautonomia,  MCAS,  and  hypermo-
bility  spectrum  disorders  including  hypermobile  Ehlers-Danlos  syn-
drome (Wang et al., 2021).

In the present study, POTS occurred in 50.1 % of MCAS females vs. 
4.1 % of control females. Studies of comorbid POTS in MCAS patients are 
limited.  One  study  showed  the  prevalence  of  POTS  in  24.7  %  of  174 
MCAS patients (Weinstock et al., 2020b). Patients with both syndromes 
are  often  more  ill  than  patients  with  one  disorder  alone  (Weinstock 
et al., 2021a,b,c). Prevalence differences could also be explained if more

severely affected MCAS participants with co-morbid POTS were more 
inclined to take the questionnaire study. The other reason could be that 
the  present  study  was  a  multicenter  study  whereas  the  other  study 
recruited patients from refractory gastrointestinal patients.

FMS is a common idiopathic disorder marked by chronic widespread 
pain along with myalgia, muscle sensitivity, fatigue, and insomnia and is 
associated with migraines, atopic disorders, and depression (Fitzcharles 
et al., 2021; Tsiakir et al., 2017; Yepez et al., 2022). It is thought that 
FMS  is  primarily  caused  by  central  hypersensitivity  (Berwick  et  al., 
2022), yet inflammation with cytokines produced by MCs has also been 
discovered to play a role and cutaneous MC counts are increased in FMS 
(Parkitny, Younger, 2017; Enestrom et al., 1997). All signs and symp-
toms of FMS overlap symptoms of MCAS, and both can start at an early 
age (Afrin et al., 2015, 2017; Berwick et al., 2022; Coles et al., 2021).

RLS occurs in 7–10 % of the general population, increases morbidity 
and  mortality,  and  is  associated  with  immune,  inflammatory,  and  in-
fectious causes in 42 highly associated disorders with secondary RLS (Li 
et  al.,  2018;  Weinstock  et  al.,  2012).  In  the  present  study,  37.2  %  of 
females had RLS (OR 4.4) and 33.3 % of men had RLS (OR 3.0). In a prior 
study, 174 MCAS patients (146 female, 28 males, mean age 44.8 years) 
were compared to 85 spouse controls (12 females, 73 males, mean age 
50.9 years). Female MCAS patients had a higher prevalence of RLS (40.8 

%) than spouse controls (12.9 %) (p < .0001) (Weinstock et al., 2020-c). 
Endorphin deficiency in the brain appears to contribute to RLS and LDN 
could reverse this deficiency (Walters et al., 2024). In the present study, 
22 % of the MCAS patients with RLS had improvement with LDN.

Tinnitus causes a poor quality of life (Batts, Stankovic, 2024). In the 
present study, 59.1 % of female patients had tinnitus with an OR of 7.4. 
Men had similar prevalence and OR (47.1 % and 4.7, respectively). An 
earlier  study  of  tinnitus  showed  a  prevalence  of  61.4  %  of  114  pre-
dominately female MCAS patients (Weinstock et al., 2021a,b,c).

4.3. Specific comments about benzodiazepines

We have seen that benzodiazepines are sometimes being prescribed 
for anxiety and insomnia before the patients were diagnosed with MCAS. 
We have documented that anxiety and insomnia are common disorders 
in MCAS. Although benzodiazepines have been widely used in patients 
with these NP disorders, their chronic use may be associated with side 
effects, including sedation, abuse, dependence, and cognitive and mood 
alterations in a subset of patients. In our patient population with MCAS, 
we have found low dose, judicious use of benzodiazepines to be helpful 
both in the setting of chronic MC activation and/or as a treatment for an 
acute flare, with minimal side effects and minimal risk for development 
of  addiction/tolerance.  Some  patients  find  benzodiazepines  to  help 
abortively for flares, some find them helpful preventively using a low 
dose 1–3 times daily, and some find them helpful in both contexts.

4.4. Limitations of the study

This study has several limitations. 1) This was a volunteer study and 
thus participants have potential self-selection bias which could skew the 
data. The self-reported diagnoses, treatment and outcomes could not be 
confirmed and may have been influenced by recall bias. Confirmation of 
the  survey  responses  was  not  possible  in  this  computer-based  anony-
mous survey. 2) There was a high percentage of female MCAS subjects, 
although this is representative of MCAS patients in the literature (and 
thought  to  be  due  in  part  to  the  activating  effects  of  estrogen  when 
engaging with MC-surface estrogen receptors) (Molderings et al., 2013; 
Afrin et al., 2017). 3) COVID-19 infections may have affected results by 
exacerbating/flaring MCAS and sparking Long COVID Syndrome (Afrin, 
2020-b;  Weinstock,  2021-a).  We  addressed  this  concern  by  asking 
affected  participants  to  consider  their  responses  to  pre-COVID-19 
symptomology.  Health 
asymptomatic 
SARS-CoV-2  infections  could  not  be  determined.  4)  Assessment  of 
medication response may have been influenced by concomitant neuro-
logic and  MCAS medications.  MCAS patients usually are  treated with 
multiple medications and thus judging the efficacy of adding a new one 
can be difficult without double-blind prospective study or using mono-
therapy,  which  is  not  standard  of  care  in  clinical  practice.  5)  Our 
questionnaire did not address how many medicine classes were used and 
whether more than one type of antihistamine was used. A sizable per-
centage  of  MCAS  patients  had  tried  one  or  more  benzodiazepine. 
Benzodiazepine-responsive  disorders  are  common  in  MCAS,  and  ben-
zodiazepines reduce MC activity in laboratory studies.

5. Conclusions

Recognition that NP disorders are highly prevalent in patients with 
MCAS may lead to promising therapeutic treatment options for patients 
with MCAS and those with NP disorders who are refractory to standard 
NP  medications  and  whose  MCAS  diagnosis  may  have  been  missed. 
Treatment  directed  at  the  uncontrolled,  aberrant  MC  can  potentially 
improve  some  NP  disorders  and  symptoms.  These  observations  and 
hypotheses  will  need  evaluation  in  future  prospective,  randomized,
