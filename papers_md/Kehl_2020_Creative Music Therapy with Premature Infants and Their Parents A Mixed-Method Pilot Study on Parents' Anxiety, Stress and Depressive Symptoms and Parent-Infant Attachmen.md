Abstract: Premature birth is stressful for infants and parents and can adversely affect the parent–
infant dyad. This mixed-methods pilot study evaluates whether creative music therapy (CMT) can
alleviate anxiety, stress, and depressive symptoms in parents and support the bonding process with
their infant. Sixteen parent couples were included. Ten couples were randomly allocated to the
music therapy group (MTG) and six to the control group (CG). All couples completed psychological
questionnaires measuring anxiety and depressive symptoms as well as an implicit measure of parent–
infant attachment at two weeks postpartum (T1), at approximate neonatal intensive care unit (NICU)
hospitalization halftime (T2), and two weeks after the infant had been discharged (T3). At T1 and T2,
the parents additionally completed a questionnaire assessing the degree of stress they experienced at
the NICU. Qualitative data were collected through a semi-structured, problem-centered interview
with MTG parents at T3. The results of the quantitative analyses revealed reductions in anxiety levels
from T1 to T2 (p = 0.002) as well as decreases in depressive symptoms from T2 to T3 (p = 0.022). No
such changes were apparent in the CG. In fact, parental stress increased from T1 to T2 (p = 0.016).
Signiﬁcant increases in attachment across time were also observed within the MTG, but not in the
CG. The qualitative inquiry conﬁrmed that CMT can support the parent–infant relationship. Being
in musical interaction evoked feelings of joy and relaxation in the parents and encouraged them to
interact more profoundly with their infant. The results call for a more extensive powered follow-up
study to further investigate CMT’s potential for parental well-being and parent–infant bonding.

1. Introduction

Premature birth is a major challenge for both premature infants and their parents.
Due to the perinatal health care system’s improvement, many more premature infants
survive, but undesirable long-term effects of preterm birth range from deﬁcits in executive
functions to socio-emotional and behavioral problems [1,2].

Parents of premature infants bear the burden of this situation as well. In addition to the
shock of premature birth, they face numerous further challenges and difﬁculties: the early
separation from their child is traumatizing, and not being able to fully care for their infant
leads to a lack of autonomy as primary caregivers [3,4]. These two factors are experienced
as major stressful events by parents of premature infants [4]. Added to this, the neonatal
intensive care unit (NICU) remains a stressful environment where privacy and quiet are
rare. Instead, bright lights, beeping monitors and odors are predominant [5]. Moreover,
premature infants have to undergo various repeated and cumulative pain procedures [6].
Yet, the implementation of pain management strategies, which include pharmacological
(e.g., opioid administration) and nonpharmacological approaches (e.g., breastfeeding) is
currently viewed as inadequate and in need of optimization [7–9]. Consequently, and
understandably, parents of premature infants cared for in the NICU worry about their
infant’s suffering, and experience feelings of helplessness, guilt, and stress [5,10]. Other
emotional reactions of which parents of premature infants may suffer, due to the experience
of premature birth, include feelings of disappointment, fear, sadness, depression, anger,
grief, and loss of self-esteem [5,11].

Consequently, premature infants’ parents may show increased stress and anxiety
symptoms and a higher risk of depression than parents of term infants [12–14]. Symptoms
of traumatization can occur up to several weeks after hospitalization and, if unresolved,
may lead to posttraumatic stress disorder [3].

Besides, premature infants have difﬁculties communicating their internal states [15].
Due to their immaturity, their non-verbal expression is more complex to read than that of a
child born at term, making it more difﬁcult for the parents to understand and communicate
appropriately with their premature infant [16].

Taken together, these problems may impact upon the parent–infant bonding process.
Recent studies indicate that premature birth inﬂuences the dyadic quality of the mother–
infant interaction [16–18], and possibly affects later attachment behavior as well [19]. This at
a time when bonding is of considerable importance and especially vital for the development
of a child [2,16,20].

Therapeutic intervention programs play an important role in detecting and coun-
teracting possible stress symptoms in mothers of premature infants and supporting the
mother–infant relationship [3,21,22].

Creative music therapy (CMT) is an individualized and family-integrating music
therapy method [23–25]. Based on the concepts of Nordoff–Robbins’ creative music ther-
apy [26] and combined with principles of CMT used on comatose patients [27], it addresses
the needs and resources of premature infants and their parents in the NICU setting [25].

During CMT, the breathing pattern, gestures, and facial expressions of the premature
infant are perceived by the therapist and transformed into a musical response by humming
in a lullaby style [25,28]. The parents are individually involved in the therapeutic process,
e.g., by being supported to use their voice in an infant-directed and responsive way or by
performing CMT during kangaroo care [24].

A recent pilot randomized control trial (RCT) provided evidence for CMT’s beneﬁ-
cial effects on functional brain activity and brain connectivity in premature infants [29].
However, CMT not only ensures physical progress, stabilization and relaxation, it also
addresses and awakens the communicative abilities of premature infants, which has been
demonstrated in qualitative case studies [25,28].

Finally, CMT aims to address the parents’ needs and to promote the parent–infant
bonding process. By intuitively relating through music, parents are given the opportunity
to connect and care for their infant, and the infant’s needs for intimacy and closeness are
met [24].

A meta-analysis conducted by Bieleninik et al. [30] conﬁrmed various beneﬁcial
music therapy effects for premature infants and their parents. In particular, evidence was
found for the positive impact of music therapy on premature infants’ respiratory rate and
maternal anxiety.

Nevertheless, to date, only a few RCT studies have examined whether music ther-
apy may alleviate symptoms of anxiety, depression and stress in parents of premature
infants [31–33]. Moreover, no study so far has researched the effect of CMT on these
symptoms. The attachment between parents and their premature infant using a live mu-
sic therapy approach and its effect over a longer period of time has likewise been rarely
evaluated [31].

To address this gap, we aimed to determine how CMT affects symptoms of anxiety,
depression, stress, as well as parent–infant attachment of parents of premature infants
throughout the duration of their infant’s hospitalization.

Based on previous research ﬁndings in the ﬁeld of music therapy and parents of
premature infants [31], we hypothesize that parents of premature infants treated with CMT
experience less anxiety and depressive symptoms than parents without CMT (directional
hypothesis). We also tested the non-directional hypothesis that CMT would lead to a
difference in parents of premature infants compared to parents without CMT in terms of
stress experience and parent–infant attachment.

2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Overview

We chose a mixed-method approach for this study which is part of a larger pilot
RCT on the effects of creative music therapy (CMT) on brain function and brain structure
in premature infants [29,34]. This sub-study addresses the effect of CMT on parental
symptoms of anxiety, depression, stress as well as parent–infant attachment.

The larger study was designed as a prospective, single-center, between-subject random-
ized, clinical pilot trial in preparation for a full-scale trial and is registered at ClinicalTrials.
gov (Number: NCT02434224). Ethical approval was obtained from the Ethics Commit-
tee of the Canton of Zurich, Switzerland (KEK-ZH 2014-0655) and the Swiss Agency for
Therapeutic Products (Swissmedic), Audit No.: CTCQA14. All parents provided written
informed consent before study participation [29,34].

This sub-study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Canton of Zurich,
Switzerland, as an amendment to the broader study (BASEC-Nr. PB_2016-02589). Its
sample size is smaller as the sub-study started 26 months later than the main pilot RCT.

2.2. Participants

The participants were mothers and fathers of prematurely born infants recruited after

birth at the Department of Neonatology of the University Hospital Zurich, Switzerland.

Parents of clinically stable infants born before 32 weeks of gestation and at a chrono-
logical age of ≥7 days of life were eligible for study participation. Exclusion criteria
were parents of premature infants with a genetically deﬁned syndrome, severe congenital
malformation adversely affecting life expectancy and/or neurodevelopment, high-grade
intraventricular hemorrhage, and/or cystic white matter lesions. Parents of premature
infants admitted to palliative care were also excluded from the study. Lack of sufﬁcient
knowledge of the German language was a further deﬁned exclusion criterion.

Infants and parents were randomly allocated to either the music therapy group (MTG)
or the control group (CG). The randomization process was managed by the Clinical Trials
Center (CTC) of the University Hospital Zurich and its details have been described previ-
ously [29]. Preterm infants and their parents allocated to the CG received standard care
from the hospital team and skin-to-skin care with their parents. Preterm infants and their
parents allocated to the MTG additionally received CMT from one well-trained and highly
experienced music therapist (F.B.H.) for at least 8 sessions. As this study is a sub-study of
the main study, no sample size calculation was performed.

2.3. Intervention

CMT was offered 2–3 times per week in the morning after feeding time following the

clinical practice protocol of CMT [23] as well as the study protocol [34].

Each intervention lasted about 20 min and took place, whenever possible, in the pres-
ence of the parents (or one parent) who were in skin-to-skin contact with their premature
infant. If the parents could not be present (due to a conﬂicting schedule, such as attending
a meeting with the pediatricians and nurses or caring for a sibling at home), the therapeutic
session was conducted at the bedside with the premature infant alone, using initial and
therapeutic touch as well as the music therapist’s voice. After a period of observation, the
music therapist started to hum or sing according to the breathing rhythm, facial expression,
and gesture of the premature infant [25,28].

Whenever the parents could participate in the therapeutic sessions, a vibro-acoustic
monochord was used to accompany the singing. It was placed on one parent’s elbow so
that the vibrations could be felt. A monochord is a wooden, single-stringed instrument
manufactured for therapeutic purposes. When touched, its vibro-acoustic stimulation can
serve to relax or even stimulate [23].

During the sessions, the parents were involved in the therapy and decided each
time, whether they wanted to relax, to participate in singing or to just observe their
child’s reaction to the music. Before the therapy sequence started, the parents were asked
about their musical wishes, so their musical and cultural background became part of the
therapy and the sessions were shaped by the music therapist and the parents together.
As a previous study has shown, parents often started to use their own voice during the
therapeutic process, became more conﬁdent in this respect and aware how important their
singing, humming or even speaking is for their child [24].

After the session and when appropriate, the music therapist provided explanations
and feedback to the parents and shared her perceptions of the preterm infant’s reaction
to the music. This was done in order to support the parent–infant interaction and to
strengthen the parents in their parental role [23].

2.4. Data Acquisition

The sub-study was conducted from March 2017 to February 2018 with three assessment
time points. The ﬁrst assessment (T1) was scheduled for two weeks after birth, the second
(T2) at approximate halftime of the NICU hospitalization and the third (T3) for two weeks
after discharge from the NICU. At each time point (T1, T2, T3), mothers and fathers
responded individually and in writing to questions regarding their visits to their infants
at the NICU (hours spent at the NICU per day, frequency of kangaroo care, etc.) and
completed validated self-report questionnaires measuring parental symptoms of anxiety
and depression as well as an implicit measure of parent–infant attachment. Additionally,
at T1 and T2, the parents responded to a validated questionnaire on the stress experienced
on the NICU. Finally, a semi-structured, problem-centered interview was conducted at T3
with the parents of the MTG and was held separately with mothers and fathers. The design
of the study is presented in Figure 1.

One of the ﬁrst authors (S.M.K.) was responsible for the distribution of the question-
naires. She was blinded to which group the parents had been allocated to. Only shortly
before the time of the interviews, which took place at T3, was the ﬁrst author (S.M.K.)
informed which parents were assigned to the MTG.

2.5. Psychological Measures

Symptoms of Anxiety. Trait anxiety, which refers to a person’s general tendency to
experience worries, fears, and anxieties across various situations [35], was measured with
the validated German version of the trait subscale of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory
(STAI-t) [36]. Participants are asked to rate 20 items on a four-point Likert scale (1 = “almost
never”, 4 = “almost always”) regarding how they “generally feel” (e.g., “I feel pleasant”, “I feel
nervous and restless”). Higher values indicate higher trait anxiety. Cronbach’s alpha ranges
between 0.88 and 0.94 [36].

State anxiety, which refers to the degree of anxiety experienced in a current situation,
was measured with the validated German short form of the State-Anxiety Inventory (STAI-
SKD) [37]. This scale consists of ﬁve items. Participants are asked to rate how they feel
“right now”, “at this moment” (e.g., “I am tense”, “I feel nervous”) on a four-point Likert scale
ranging from 1 = “not at all” to 4 = “very much so”. Higher scores represent higher state
anxiety levels. Cronbach’s alpha for this scale ranges between 0.76 and 0.85 [37].

Symptoms of Depression. Depressive symptoms were measured with the well-validated
German version of the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) [38,39]. The EPDS
is a widely used screening tool for the detection of maternal perinatal depression [40]
and has been validated for the assessment of postpartum depressive symptoms in fathers
as well [41]. Participants are asked to respond to ten items on a four-point Likert Scale
(e.g., from 0 = “Yes, most of the time” to 3 = “No, never”) regarding how they felt in the past
seven days (e.g., “I have felt sad or miserable”, “I have been so unhappy that I have been crying”).
Cronbach’s alpha for this scale indicates good reliability with a value of 0.81 [39].

Symptoms of Stress. Symptoms of stress were measured with the German version of the
Parental Stressor Scale: Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (PSS:NICU), which assesses parents’
experience of various stressors caused by the physical and psychosocial environment in
the NICU [42–44]. Parents are asked to rate a list of 26 potential stressors on a ﬁve-point
Likert scale ranging from 1 = “not at all stressful” to 5 = “extremely stressful” based on the
degree of stress they were experiencing during the NICU hospitalization of their infant.
The PSS:NICU consists of the following three subscales “Sights and Sounds of the Unit”
(e.g., “the sudden noise of the monitor alarm”), “Infant Behaviour and Appearance” (e.g., “the
small size of my baby”), and “Parental Role Alteration” (e.g., “not being able to care for my
baby myself”). Cronbach’s alpha for the sub-scales ranges between 0.73 and 0.92 and for
the entire scale between 0.82 and 0.94, indicating good reliability [42–44]. The parents
responded to the PSS:NICU at T1 and T2, since at T3, the infant already was dismissed
from the NICU and at home.

Depressive symptoms were measured with the well-vali-dated German version of the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) [38,39]. The EPDS is a widely used screening tool for the detection of maternal perinatal depression [40] and has been validated for the assessment of postpartum depressive symptoms in fathers as well [41].

Cronbach’s alpha for the sub-scales ranges between 0.73 and 0.92 and for Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 265

Attachment. Feelings of attachment, bonding and connectedness were measured
implicitly and non-verbally (i.e., visually) with the Pictorial Representation of Attachment
Measure (PRAM) [45]. The mothers and fathers were shown an A4-size paper illustrating
a big circle of 18.6 cm diameter in the centre which represented their life. A smaller yellow
circle (5 cm diameter) was depicted within the centre of the larger circle and represented
the participant him- or her-self. Subsequently, the parents were given a green round sticker
(5 cm diameter) labelled “my baby” and were asked “where would you place the baby in your
life at the moment?”. For quantitative analysis, the distance between the centre of the yellow
and green sticker was measured (PRAM Self–Baby Distance). A shorter distance indicates
a greater feeling of attachment. As an addition to the original PRAM, the parents were
asked to place two further green stickers representing (a) the emotional and (b) the physical
closeness to their baby. The PRAM has proven to be a valid and easy-to-administer tool to
assess parental bonding processes both during the prenatal [45] as well as the postpartum
period [46].

2.6. Statistical Analysis

Statistical analyses were performed with SPSS (Chicago, IL, USA, version 24) for
Windows. During the course of the study, several infants were transferred to another
hospital which led to drop-outs in both study groups (cf. Sample Characteristics in the
Results) and thus, due to the small sample sizes of both study groups, non-parametric
methods were used to analyze the data. Differences between the two groups regarding the
psychological measures were explored using the Mann–Whitney test. Potential changes
across time (i.e., from T1 to T2 and from T2 to T3) were analyzed with the Wilcoxon signed-
rank test. The Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons was applied where necessary.
The level of signiﬁcance was set at p < 0.05 for all analyses (one-tailed for the directional
and two-tailed for the non-directional hypotheses).

2.7. Qualitative Analysis

The qualitative evaluation of the semi-structured, problem-centered parents’ interview
was conducted according to the thematic analysis by Braun and Clarke (2006) [47], which
“involves the searching across a data set—be that a number of interviews or focus groups, or a range
of texts—to ﬁnd repeated patterns of meaning” [47].

An inductive approach was chosen to identify themes within the data set. In the
ﬁrst step, one of the ﬁrst authors (S.M.K.) listened to the interviews several times and
handwritten notes were made of statements that seemed particularly interesting concerning
CMT. In a second step, the interviews were transcribed and by rereading it again, valuable
features were marked with color. This was followed by the division into codes, which in
turn were organized into sub-themes. The sub-themes were grouped and related to each
other until superior themes were found and a deﬁnitive presentation could be made. This
process resulted as a last step in a ﬁnal thematic map [47].

3. Results
3.1. Sample Characteristics

A total of 23 parent couples were asked to participate in this mixed-method study.
Due to the need to relocate to other hospitals, a ﬁnal sample of 16 parent couples with their
premature infants was included in this pilot study (N = a total of 32 mothers and fathers).
Of these 16 couples, ten had been allocated to the MTG (n = 20 mothers and fathers) for the
main study and six to the CG (n = 12 mothers and fathers; Figure S1). By T2, four more
infants were transferred to other hospitals leading to 12 parent couples remaining in the
pilot study. At this time point, there were eight parent couples (n = 16 mothers and fathers)
in the MTG and four in the CG (n = 8 mothers and fathers). At T3, two further infants were
transferred to another hospital. Thus, the study sample was comprised of 10 remaining
parent couples of which seven were in the MTG (n = 14 mothers and fathers) and three in
the CG (n = 6 mothers and fathers).

At T1, parents in the MTG visited their preterm infants at a median of 3.50 h per day
(range 1.50–6.00) and the parents in the CG at a median of 4.00 h per day (range 2.50–6.00).
This difference was not signiﬁcant (p > 0.05). In general, mothers stayed longer with their
infants (Mdn = 4.00 h) than fathers (Mdn = 2.50 h), U = 43.00, z = −2.91, p = 0.003, r = −0.53.
However, there were no signiﬁcant differences between the mothers in the MTG and the
mothers in the CG (p > 0.05). All parents (except for one missing value of a mother) had
already performed kangaroo care by T1.

At T1, all parents reported speaking very frequently to the infants. There were no
signiﬁcant differences between the two groups in this regard (p > 0.05) as well as no
signiﬁcant differences between mothers and fathers (p > 0.05). At T1, all parents reported

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 265

touching their infants very frequently and there were no signiﬁcant group (p > 0.05) or
gender differences (p > 0.05). The parents expressed the feeling that their infants frequently
gave resonance while they were visiting them. There were neither signiﬁcant group
(p > 0.05) nor gender differences (p > 0.05). Furthermore, the parents indicated that it was
very often difﬁcult for them to leave their infants at the NICU in the evenings; there were
neither signiﬁcant group (p > 0.05) nor gender differences (p > 0.05).

The parents were mostly present during the CMT sessions. A total of 148 (M = 13.167)
CMT sessions took place, including 48 (M = 4.364) individual therapies (i.e., sessions
without parents present) and 100 (M = 9.091) therapies during kangaroo care. Prior to T1,
parents received, on average, two CMT sessions together with their premature infant.

3.2. Results of the Quantitative Analyses
3.2.1. Symptoms of Anxiety

The two groups did not differ signiﬁcantly in trait anxiety levels (STAI-t) at T1, T2,
T3 (p > 0.05 for all time points). Concerning the course of trait anxiety across time, the
reduction from T2 (Mdn = 31.50) to T3 (Mdn = 29.00) failed to reach the conservative
signiﬁcance level in the MTG at a Bonferroni corrected p-value of 0.025 (z = −1.85, p = 0.034,
r = −0.349). In the CG, there were no signiﬁcant changes, neither from T1 to T2, nor from
T2 to T3.

The two groups did not differ signiﬁcantly in state anxiety levels (STAI-SKD) at T1,
T2, T3 (p > 0.05 for all time points). However, there was a signiﬁcant reduction in state
anxiety levels from T1 (Mdn = 11.00) to T2 (Mdn = 9.00), z = −2.71, p = 0.002, r = −0.451,
within the MTG, while in the CG, there were no signiﬁcant changes between T1 to T2 or
between T2 to T3 (p > 0.05; Figure 2).

3.2.2. Symptoms of Depression

At T1, the extent of depressive symptoms (EPDS) in the MTG (Mdn = 10.00) was not
signiﬁcantly different from to extent of depressive symptoms in the CG (Mdn = 12.50),
z = −1.44, p = 0.077, r = −0.255. There were no signiﬁcant differences between the two
groups at T2 and T3 either (p > 0.05 for all). However, within the MTG, there was a
signiﬁcant reduction in depressive symptoms from T2 (Mdn = 8.00) to T3 (Mdn = 4.00) at
a Bonferroni corrected p-value of 0.025 (z = −2.04, p = 0.022, r = −0.373). There were no

Symptoms of Depression At T1, the extent of depressive symptoms (EPDS) in the MTG (Mdn = 10.00) was not significantly different from to extent of depressive symptoms in the CG (Mdn = 12.50), z = −1.44, p = 0.077, r = −0.255. There were no significant differences between the two groups at T2 and T3 either (p > 0.05 for all). However, within the MTG, there was a significant reduction in depressive symptoms from T2 (Mdn = 8.00) to T3 (Mdn = 4.00) at a Bonferroni corrected p-value of 0.025 (z = −2.04, p = 0.022, r = −0.373). There were no significant changes across time in the CG (p > 0.06 at a Bonferroni corrected p-value of 0.025; Figure 3).  Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 265

3.2.3. Symptoms of Stress

There were no signiﬁcant differences between the two groups at T1 and T2 regarding
the Sights and Sounds subscale of the PSS:NICU (p > 0.05 for both). Within the MTG,
there were no signiﬁcant differences from T1 to T2. However, within the CG, parental
stress regarding the Sights and Sounds subscale increased from T1 (Mdn = 2.10) to T2
(Mdn = 2.30), z = −2.39, p = 0.016, r = −0.534 (Figure 4).

With regard to the Baby Looks and Behaves subscale, there were no significant dif-ferences between the two groups at T1 and T2 (p > 0.05 for both). There were no significant differences within the MTG and the CG between T1 and T2 (p > 0.05 for both). At T1, the difference between the CG (Mdn = 3.07) and MTG (Mdn = 2.64) on the Relationship and Parental Role subscale of the PSS:NICU was non-significant, U = 72.00, z = −1.87, p = 0.062, r = −0.331. This was similarly the case at T2 (p > 0.05). In relation to the course of parental stress regarding this subscale, no significant results emerged, neither in the MTG nor in the CG (p > 0.05 for both). Int. J. Environ. Res.

Attachment There was no significant difference between the two groups at T1 regarding the PRAM Self–Baby Distance. However, at T2, the MTG exhibited a significantly shorter dis-tance (Mdn = 2.80 cm) compared to the CG (Mdn = 3.70 cm), U = 28.00, z = −2.21, p = 0.026, r = −0.452. At T3, there were no significant group differences anymore (p > 0.05). Within the MTG, the PRAM Self–Baby Distance decreased significantly from T1 at a Bonferroni corrected p-value of 0.025 (Mdn = 2.90 cm) to T2 (Mdn = 2.80), z = −2.76, p = 0.004, r = −0.460 (Figure 5A). There were no differences in the PRAM Self–Baby Distance from T2 to T3 (p > 0.05). There were no significant differences within the CG across all time points (p > 0.05 for all time points). Concerning the PRAM Self–Baby Emotional Distance, again there were no significant differences between the two groups at T1 and T3 (p > 0.05). Similarly, at T2, the MTG did not exhibit a significantly shorter distance (Mdn = 3.10 cm) compared to the CG (Mdn = 3.50 cm), U = 35.00, z = −1.78, p = 0.077, r = −0.364. There were no significant differences from T1 to T2 and from T2 to T3 within both the MTG and the CG at a Bonferroni corrected p-value of 0.025. At T1, the MTG displayed a significantly shorter distance in the PRAM Self–Baby Physical Distance (Mdn = 4.20 cm) compared to the CG (Mdn = 6.95 cm), U = 39.50, z = −2.66, p = 0.006, r = −0.486. There were no significant group differences at T2 and T3 (p > 0.05). However, in the MTG, there was a significant decrease in distance from T1 (Mdn = 4.20 cm) to T2 (Mdn = 3.50 cm), z = −2.36, p = 0.016, r = −0.399, and again from T2 to T3 (Mdn = 2.80 cm), z = −2.34, p = 0.016, r = −0.435, at a Bonferroni corrected p-value of 0.025 (Figure 5B). No such changes across time were apparent in the CG. Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 265

With regard to the Baby Looks and Behaves subscale, there were no signiﬁcant differ-
ences between the two groups at T1 and T2 (p > 0.05 for both). There were no signiﬁcant
differences within the MTG and the CG between T1 and T2 (p > 0.05 for both).

At T1, the difference between the CG (Mdn = 3.07) and MTG (Mdn = 2.64) on the
Relationship and Parental Role subscale of the PSS:NICU was non-signiﬁcant, U = 72.00,
z = −1.87, p = 0.062, r = −0.331. This was similarly the case at T2 (p > 0.05). In relation to
the course of parental stress regarding this subscale, no signiﬁcant results emerged, neither
in the MTG nor in the CG (p > 0.05 for both).

3.2.4. Attachment

There was no signiﬁcant difference between the two groups at T1 regarding the PRAM
Self–Baby Distance. However, at T2, the MTG exhibited a signiﬁcantly shorter distance
(Mdn = 2.80 cm) compared to the CG (Mdn = 3.70 cm), U = 28.00, z = −2.21, p = 0.026,
r = −0.452. At T3, there were no signiﬁcant group differences anymore (p > 0.05). Within
the MTG, the PRAM Self–Baby Distance decreased signiﬁcantly from T1 at a Bonferroni

0.025 (Figure 5B). No such changes across time were apparent in the CG.

3.3. Results of the Qualitative Analysis

Three main themes emerged from the thematic analysis: Effects, Perspectives of
Mothers and Fathers, and Social Interaction. The three topics are interrelated and mutually
dependent, as can be seen in the graphic representation (Figure 6). For example, parents
and their infant could often develop more intimacy when their infant seemed relaxed,
or vice versa, because the parents were relaxed, they were much more receptive to their
infants’ reactions, so that they communicated and related more intensely with their infant.
In general, it was remarkable how all parents in the interviews were, without exception,
very quick to talk about CMT’s effects and this without having been asked directly about
it. As one of the three main themes, Effects are composed of six sub-themes: Relaxation
Baby, Relaxation Father/Mother, Well-being Baby, Music in Space, Fading out the Hospital
Situation and Music at Home.

The effect of Relaxation was a predominant topic in the interviews. Sometimes it
referred to the parents themselves, who described how they could relax due to CMT,
sometimes to the premature infant and its well-being or to the spatial environment, which
was inﬂuenced by the music and thus created a more peaceful atmosphere.

Figure 6. Graphic representation of the three main and six sub-themes that emerged from the thematic analysis.

“I have the feeling that he could let himself go. He was so relaxed on top of me and had a
satisﬁed expression to me [ . . . ].” (M49)

“He had quite a lot of [oxygen] decreases at the beginning and with the music, he really
never had any decreases when I was there. That was always reassuring for me, just that
it was good for him—I really have the feeling that it was good for him.” (M55)

Concerning the environmental inﬂuence, the parents mentioned that the music facili-
tated a protective and enveloping space for them and their infants and allowed them to
fade out the alarms’ beeping and the restless hospital atmosphere for a moment.

“That was the moment when you just could relax. I could never do that usually [ . . . ]
Just us—for me, it was really our moment.” (M72)

“You could relax; you also forgot that you are not alone here with S. [daughter] [ . . .
] You didn’t hear or see the monitors anymore, she [the music therapist] was always
watching.” (M72)

“At the IMC [Intermediate Care], you really noticed when music therapy took place.
Everyone was relaxed, all caregivers [ . . . ] It immediately became quiet on the unit. It
was radiant.” (M72)

Furthermore, most parents reported that music continued to accompany them in their
everyday life. Through the experience with CMT, they realized the effect of their vocal
attention on their premature infant and could relax in the face of their high demands
regarding singing.

“Now I sing with a feeling that it will surely do him good. I don’t know if I would have
perceived it that way before.” (M49)

“I take home with me that we increasingly sing and hum with him [ . . . ] and not that
you have to be a professional musician or a professional singer to sing something to him [
. . . ] he doesn’t care if you sing out of tune. The most important thing is music.” (M48)

Social Interaction as the second overarching theme consists of the following sub-
themes: Closeness and Intimacy, Reaction Baby, Feedback Music Therapist, Expansion
of Perception.

The parents reported that they experienced closeness and intimacy during CMT. The
music, humming and the monochord’s vibrations, which were passed on from the parents
to their premature infant, seemed to create a new way of connecting.

“Yes, you feel more as one, because of the monochord. I can feel the vibrations that go
through me to him and the humming in addition—I felt I was more united.” (M48)

Additionally, the support of and relationship to the music therapist enriched these
feelings. This circumstance was often mentioned in the parents’ interviews and appreciated.
The parents stated that the music therapist’s feedback facilitated a new and different view
of their child and helped them even to get to know him/her better.

“For me, it simply wasn’t so natural in our situation and I was then [during CMT]
allowed to simply observe L. [son]—and even a little—get to know him better and also
get to know him differently during this time of music therapy.” (M62)

Furthermore, the infant’s positive reactions during CMT revealed to the parents that
their child is capable of responding to the environment, and in many cases, this reaction
triggered a sequence of relationship replies, so that communication could develop. This
circumstance often calmed and relaxed the parents and gave them a feeling of security.

“That [CMT] was always a real highlight. Not only for L. [son]. The music therapist
said, he always reacted very well. She explained to me what she saw and then I could
observe it [ . . . ] It also always reassured me and it was good for me, very good.” (M62)

The third main theme Perspectives of Mothers and Fathers, arose from the motivation
to include fathers and their perspectives in the research topic in order to identify possible
differences in mothers’ and fathers’ perspectives, behaviors or coping strategies.

The interviews revealed small differences in the details of the description of CMT: if
fathers tended to be more objective in their choice of words, mothers described the effects
of CMT in more detail and with more adjectives and superlatives. Fathers also often talked
about the continuation of music in everyday life. The purchase and use of an instrument as
an additional way of making music at home was mostly mentioned by fathers and seemed
to have created much joy and interest.

“I enjoy it, also the instrument [bought an instrument for home use after the
experience with CMT]. It is a beautiful wooden instrument. I ﬁnd it a good thing.”
(V48)

Generally, through CMT, the fathers experienced that they have just as much vocabu-
lary as the mothers in the musical communication with their premature infant. This is all
the more important because they naturally often play a secondary role in this phase shortly
after birth. CMT encouraged them in terms of their importance as fathers. Later in every-
day life, they mentioned that music often became a ritual of father–child communication
and/or was used by them to soothe their child.

“Yes, we sing and hum a lot with her [daughter] [ . . . ] As soon as she is with her daddy
in the evening and he begins to hum, she is just quiet. She needs that, she is used to
it.”(M72)

None of the parents expressed any negative experience with the music therapy.

4. Discussion

Premature birth is a stressful life event for the infant and the parents [10–14], and both
are at risk of increased stress, which can affect the parent–infant dyad [16–19]. Hence, we
aimed to evaluate whether CMT can alleviate anxiety, stress and depressive symptoms in
the parents and support the bonding process between the parents and their infant.

Our ﬁrst hypothesis that parents of premature infants treated with CMT show less
anxiety and depressive symptoms than the CG parents can partially be conﬁrmed by the
present study. Our quantitative analysis showed no signiﬁcant overall difference in anxiety
and depressive symptoms between the MTG and the CG. However, a signiﬁcant reduction
in state anxiety levels from T1 to T2 was evident within the MTG, and there was also a
trend towards a signiﬁcant reduction in trait anxiety levels within the MTG from T2 to T3.
No such changes were apparent in the CG.

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 265

Interestingly, we could already show a signiﬁcant reduction in state anxiety levels
in the MTG from T1 to T2, after the parents had experienced, on average, six therapy
sequences. From this, it can be assumed that CMT could rapidly trigger a positive effect
on the parents. The trend towards a signiﬁcant reduction in trait anxiety within the MTG
from T2 to T3 suggests that CMT may have a lasting effect. Although the MTG and CG
converge on their anxiety level at T3, our results indicate that parents with CMT can be
supported during their hospital stay by more rapidly reducing their initial anxiety levels.
Concerning the STAI, previous studies have reported a signiﬁcant dampening effect
of live music therapy on maternal anxiety [31–33]. Considering the fact that all these
studies had a higher number of participants, our results need to be reviewed with a larger
sample size.

We also found that at T1, there was a trend towards signiﬁcantly lower depressive
symptoms (EPDS) in the MTG compared to the CG and there was a signiﬁcant reduction
in depressive symptoms within the MTG from T2 to T3. No such changes were apparent in
the CG.

Given the fact that depressive and anxiety symptoms tend to be related [48,49], a
persistent anxiety state could lead to depressive symptoms. The signiﬁcant reduction in
state anxiety levels from T1 to T2 within the MTG and the later trend towards a signiﬁcant
reduction in trait anxiety could be in relation to the just mentioned results regarding the
signiﬁcant reduction in depressive symptoms within the MTG between T2 and T3 and the
trend towards signiﬁcantly lower depressive symptoms in the MTG compared to the CG at
T1. CMT may offer a possibility to alleviate the parents’ fears of loss, failure and anxiety
early enough to reduce or prevent the development of depressive symptoms. Empowering
parents of premature infants through musical engagement, as reported in the qualitative
case study by Haslbeck [25], could play an important role concerning these outcomes. By
offering parents the opportunity to express themselves towards their premature infant
responsively and joyfully, and by supporting their autonomy by being creative in their
own language and cultural heritage, empowerment can emerge, and the passive emotions
of fear and anxiety can be transformed into more active and appealing feelings [25].

Therefore, CMT performed at the NICU with the parents and their premature infants
can also be seen as a coping strategy in the stress situation itself. This view refers to the
coping strategy “Applied Relaxation” by Lars Göran-Öst developed in the 1970s, which
was ﬁrst used in the treatment of phobias and panic attacks, later also in generalized
anxiety disorders, and is still considered as an effective form of therapy [50]. This technique
assumes the best possible effectiveness against anxiety and stress if anxiety signals are
recognized as early as possible and counteracted or even averted by applying the relaxation
techniques in the stress situation itself [50].

A study by Ionio et al. [13] found that both mother and father are at a greater risk of
developing higher levels of anxiety, depression, anger, and stress after experiencing the
premature birth of their child. Therefore, they call for family-centered interventions from
the ﬁrst moment onwards to support the parents and allow them to actively participate in
the development of their infant [13]. So does the study by Forcada-Guex et al. [17], which
demonstrated that premature birth affects mother–infant interactions and, in particular,
that high maternal posttraumatic stress symptoms were related to a “controlling” mother–
infant interaction pattern [17]. In their conclusion, they emphasize the need to identify
parents who have experienced a trauma related to a premature birth and underline the
importance of providing them the opportunity of joint observations and care for their
infant in order to promote parental feelings and competences [17].

The assumption that CMT can have a stress-relieving effect is consistent with the
results of our qualitative analyses, reﬂected by the sub-theme Relaxation Father/Mother,
Relaxation Baby. This topic is also mentioned in the studies by Ettenberger et al. [31] and

activity is crucial in helping parents to cope with the stress they experience in the NICU
and may contribute to creating a more optimal parent–infant relationship [31].

This leads us to our second hypothesis, that the MTG parents and the CG parents
differ in their stress and attachment levels towards their premature infant. If the course has
already been discussed concerning the stress symptoms of parents of premature infants,
the following applies to the course of the bonding behavior.

This hypothesis can partially be conﬁrmed. At T1, the MTG displayed a signiﬁcantly
shorter distance in the PRAM Self–Baby Physical Distance compared to the CG, and within
the MTG, there was a signiﬁcant decrease in the distance over time. No such changes
across time were apparent in the CG. Concerning the PRAM Self–Baby and the PRAM
Self–Baby Emotional Distance, trends toward signiﬁcant changes were observed between
T1 and T2, indicating closer distances for the MTG.

Regarding these results, we take Ettenberger et al.’s assumption [31] even further and
suggest that CMT, through relaxation, invites the parents in an easy manner to care for the
relationship with their premature infant so that dialog and closeness can take place more
often. This observation is reﬂected in one of the three main themes (Social Interaction) in
our qualitative analysis. The music, the humming, and possibly the monochord‘s vibration
during the therapy session which was passed on from the parents to their premature
infants, seemed to create an additional sense of closeness and intimacy, which subsequently
enabled a new way of meeting and being together [25].

The instrument monochord could play a valuable and promising role concerning
this result. It makes the music not only audible but also feelable for both the parents and
their premature infant. This may explain, among other things, the feeling of unity with
their infant described by many parents during the qualitative interviews, reﬂected within
the sub-theme Closeness and Intimacy. However, further research on this assumption is
necessary and would certainly be interesting.

In their review on the impact of suboptimal bonding caused by prematurity, Kommers
et al. [15] conclude that negative effects could be reversed by bonding interventions and
that NICUs should focus more on this aspect [15]. From their research on maternal post-
partum behavior and its implication for the mother–infant and father–infant relationship,
Feldman and Eidelman [16] conclude that following premature birth, mothers of premature
infants were less capable of coordinating their social behavior with the few moments of
alertness of the infant [16]. Therefore, they advocate supporting techniques for parents of
premature infants and propose methods linked to mother–infant touch and contact as well
as psychosocial interventions.

We are convinced that CMT can be an appropriate therapy approach in this ﬁeld, as
it combines corporeality and unconscious parts of therapy with a psychosocial direction.
CMT may support premature infants in developing their communicative abilities and may
empower the parents by allowing them to experience inter-subjectivity with their infant
through music [25]. Therefore, we call CMT not a parental education method, but rather a
therapeutic method to use with the parents and to elicit their endogenous parental abilities.
Often, not many words are needed, as music with its resonance does its job entirely, by
opening up a space where parents and infants get into the same pulsation and experience
intimate and intersubjective moments [25]. This is reﬂected in our qualitative results
through the sub-theme Expansion of Perception and is closely related to the sub-theme
Feedback Music Therapist, since the music therapist’s sensitive behavior and musical
response to the needs of the parents and their infants contribute substantially to the
possibilities of interactions.

At this point, we refer to Benzies et al. [22], who, in their paper examining key
components of early intervention programs for preterm infants and their parents, report
that studies with positive outcomes for the parents were often associated with improved
outcomes for the premature infants. However, they underline that parental education alone
does not reduce stress. Apparently, it requires more than education [22].

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 265

Nevertheless, it is not yet clear, which factors play an inﬂuential role in this form of
therapy, and more work is needed to deﬁne them better. Additionally, whether the positive
results concerning the MTG are due to the music itself, the parents’ participation and
empowerment, or related to the fact that the parents received more support and attention
in the MTG, should be investigated in future studies. Presumably, all factors together may
contribute to the beneﬁcial outcomes of CMT.

Due to the small sample size, it is not easy to draw clear conclusions. This is of course
the main limiting factor of the present study. Besides, a larger sample size would have
enabled us to address further important research questions concerning music therapy on
the NICU, such as the inﬂuence of the number of therapy sessions on parental well-being
and attachment. Moreover, we would have been able to evaluate the data of the mothers
and fathers separately in the quantitative analyses and thus, gain a better understanding
of the respective needs of mothers and fathers. A third limiting factor concerns the fact
that CMT sessions had already begun prior to the T1 questionnaire assessment. Thus, true
baseline data regarding parental symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress as well as the
parent–infant attachment is lacking.

One strength of this study is its mixed-method design, since it provides a more in-
depth understanding of the parents’ psychological processes and their point of view. A
further strength concerns the inclusion of both mothers and fathers as well the use of an
implicit measure of parent–infant attachment (i.e., the PRAM) combined with the explicit
stress questionnaires. The use of these various methods should be expanded in future
studies on the effect of CMT for parents in the NICU.

5. Conclusions

Overall, this study’s results support the assumption that CMT may have the potential
to alleviate symptoms of anxiety, depression and stress in premature infants’ parents during
their hospitalization and may thereby support the parent–infant bonding process right
from the very beginning. The results call for a more extensive powered follow-up study to
further investigate the potential of CMT on parental well-being and parent–infant bonding.
