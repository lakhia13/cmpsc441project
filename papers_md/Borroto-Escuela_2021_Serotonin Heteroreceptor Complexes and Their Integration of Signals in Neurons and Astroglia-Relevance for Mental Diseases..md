Abstract: The heteroreceptor complexes present a novel biological principle for signal integration.
These complexes and their allosteric receptor–receptor interactions are bidirectional and novel targets
for treatment of CNS diseases including mental diseases. The existence of D2R-5-HT2AR hetero-
complexes can help explain the anti-schizophrenic effects of atypical antipsychotic drugs not only
based on blockade of 5-HT2AR and of D2R in higher doses but also based on blocking the allosteric
enhancement of D2R protomer signaling by 5-HT2AR protomer activation. This research opens a
new understanding of the integration of DA and 5-HT signals released from DA and 5-HT nerve
terminal networks. The biological principle of forming 5-HT and other heteroreceptor complexes
in the brain also help understand the mechanism of action for especially the 5-HT hallucinogens,
including putative positive effects of e.g., psilocybin and the indicated prosocial and anti-stress
actions of MDMA (ecstasy). The GalR1-GalR2 heterodimer and the putative GalR1-GalR2-5-HT1 het-
eroreceptor complexes are targets for Galanin N-terminal fragment Gal (1–15), a major modulator of
emotional networks in models of mental disease. GPCR-receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) heterorecep-
tor complexes can operate through transactivation of FGFR1 via allosteric mechanisms and indirect
interactions over GPCR intracellular pathways involving protein kinase Src which produces tyrosine
phosphorylation of the RTK. The exciting discovery was made that several antidepressant drugs
such as TCAs and SSRIs as well as the fast-acting antidepressant drug ketamine can directly bind to
the TrkB receptor and provide a novel mechanism for their antidepressant actions. Understanding
the role of astrocytes and their allosteric receptor–receptor interactions in modulating forebrain
glutamate synapses with impact on dorsal raphe-forebrain serotonin neurons is also of high relevance
for research on major depressive disorder.

1. Introduction

The concept of allosteric receptor–receptor interactions in which G protein-coupled
receptor (GPCR) homo-and heteroreceptor complexes, physically interact with each other
and adaptor proteins, provides a new dimension to molecular integration in the central
nervous system (CNS). Interactions through allosteric mechanisms dynamically alter recog-
nition, pharmacology, signaling, and trafﬁcking of the receptor protomers that include e.g.,
also ionotropic receptors and receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). Allosteric mechanisms come
together with phosphorylation and dephosphorylation mechanisms to optimize the molec-
ular integration of dynamic receptor complexes located in the synaptic and extra-synaptic
membranes and necessary for CNS function. The heteroreceptor complexes present a novel
biological principle for signal integration. Their allosteric receptor–receptor interactions are
bidirectional and the complexes represent novel targets for treatment of CNS diseases [1].
The serotonin (5-HT) heteroreceptor complexes appear to have a signiﬁcant role in major
depression [2,3].

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRIs) antidepressants have had only moderate
success with only one-third of the patients responding well to the treatment [4,5]. It may
be related to the problem that increases in extracellular serotonin levels induced by SSRIs,
activates not only 5-HTR subtypes that reduce depression (such as postsynaptic 5-HT1AR
and 5-HT4R) but also others that enhance depression (such as 5-HT1A auto-receptors and
5HT2A/C receptors) [3,5,6]. However, there exist new opportunities to enhance the actions
of SSRIs based on the existence of serotonin heteroreceptor complexes in which different
subtypes of 5-HT receptors, dopamine (DA) receptors, RTKs, and neuropeptide receptors
such as galanin receptor 1 and galanin receptor 2 (GalR1-GalR2) can participate [2,6–10].
In this article we, in part, focus on the role of the 5-HT2A-D2R [11,12] and putative
GalR1-GalR2-5-HT1AR heterocomplexes in mental disease, with a particular focus on major
depression [9]. The impact of GPCR-RTK heterocomplexes will also be covered. Based on
the signiﬁcant work on astrocytic control of limbic glutamatergic activity [13] having effects
on serotoninergic dorsal raphe function, the role of astrocytes and their heteroreceptor
complexes [14,15] is discussed in relation to depression and other mental diseases. Finally,
in view of the negative effects of stress on depression development [16] the possible link of
stress to effects on 5-HTR heterocomplexes, especially to 5-HT1A auto-receptor complexes
in dorsal raphe serotonin neurons, is also brieﬂy discussed.

2. D2R-5-HT2AR and D2R-5-HT1AR Heterocomplexes and Mental Disease
2.1. D2R-5-HT2AR Heterocomplex

In 2010 two groups [11,12], by means of FRET and BRET methods, respectively,
provided the ﬁrst evidence for the existence of the DA D2R-5-HT2AR heteromer in cel-
lular models. Electrostatic interactions between the third intracellular loop of the D2R
protomer and the C-tail of the 5-HT2AR protomer [12] as observed in A2AR-D2R hetero-
complexes [17] and triplet amino acid homologies in transmembrane regions [11], appeared
to be involved in forming the receptor interface. They also assembled into functionally
interacting heteromers. Their existence in the brain was proposed based inter alia on their
colocalization in the medial prefrontal cortex [12].

It is of interest that hallucinogenic drugs, such as d-Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD)
and those of the indole-alkyl-amine type such as psilocybin, proposed to act as postsy-
naptic 5-HTR agonists [18,19] turned out to be 5-HTR agonists that mainly target the
5-HT2AR subtype [20]. The effects of the standard 5-HT2AR agonist TCB2 were therefore
compared with those of the hallucinogenic 5-HT2AR agonists LSD and 2,5-dimethoxy-4-
iodoamphetamine (DOI) on the biochemical binding and signaling of the D2R protomer in
the D2R-5-HT2A heteroreceptor complexes. Only the hallucinogenic 5-HT2AR agonists
were able to increase the Bmax values of the D2R antagonist binding sites and to increase
the afﬁnity of the high-afﬁnity D2R protomer agonist binding sites in the ventral and
dorsal striatum and HEK293 cells [21]. The actions of LSD and DOI on D2R afﬁnity and
density were blocked by the 5-HT2AR antagonist ketanserin. In the cellular model using a

Cells 2021, 10, 1902

3 of 23

forskolin-induced CRE-luciferase reporter gene assay the hallucinogenic 5-HT2AR agonists
signiﬁcantly enhanced the D2R agonist-induced inhibition of CRE-luciferase activity which
likely reﬂects enhanced inhibitory Gi/o-mediated signaling of the D2R protomer. These
enhancing effects by the hallucinogenic drugs were counteracted by ketanserin.

Based on these ﬁndings the hypothesis was introduced that hallucinogenic 5-HT2AR
agonists at least in part induce their psychotic-like actions by being biased 5-HT2AR
agonists at the orthosteric binding site of the 5-HT2AR protomer of the D2R-5-HT2AR
heterocomplex, especially located in the ventral striatum. This biased property of the
hallucinogenic 5-HT2AR agonists leads to the activation of a facilitatory allosteric mech-
anism that increases the density and the afﬁnity of the high-afﬁnity component of the
D2R protomer, associated with an enhancement of D2R protomer signaling mediated via
Gi/o [21,22].

These observations also give a new understanding of the molecular mechanism for
the ability of atypical antipsychotic drugs with high afﬁnity for the 5-HT2AR to exert
therapeutic effects in psychosis and schizophrenia [23,24]. Most of them are antagonists
that have a higher afﬁnity for the 5-HT2AR than for the D2R. Under the assumption
that in schizophrenia a pathological enhancement of the facilitatory allosteric receptor–
receptor interactions develops in the D2R-5-HT2AR heterocomplexes involving nucleus
accumbens [25], these receptor complexes become of high interest as targets in the treatment
of schizophrenia. The existence of D2R-5-HT2AR heterocomplexes can help explain the
anti-schizophrenic effects of atypical antipsychotic drugs not only based on blockade of
5-HT2AR and D2R in higher doses but also based on blocking the allosteric enhancement of
D2R protomer signaling by 5-HT2AR protomer activation. Brain-penetrant hetero-bivalent
drugs with 5-HT2AR and D2R antagonist pharmacophores can be therefore of substantial
interest by selectively targeting the D2R-5-HT2AR heterocomplexes that can be located in
relevant brain circuits such as the ventral striatal-pallidal GABA antireward neurons [26].
It should be considered, however, that each of the classical hallucinogens targeting
mainly the 5-HT2AR, such as d-LSD and psilocybin [27] have its own panorama of actions
in its modulation of the 5-HT2AR and other types of serotonin heteroreceptor complexes
which will have consequences for their mood-modulating effects. It will be an interesting
area for the future.

Furthermore, MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine,“ecstasy”) can exert
actions at several subtypes of 5-HT receptors [28], which belongs to the compounds called
entactogens. It possesses prosocial effects in animals and may have positive effects in post-
traumatic stress disorder [29]. However, DA-serotonin interactions involving increased
release of 5-HT and DA are also involved in the actions of MDMA [28]. These early
ﬁndings support the possibility that one target for the actions of MDMA can be the D2R-5-
HT2AR heteroreceptor complex. Thus, D2R-5-HT2AR complexes can represent a center for
integration also for the actions of MDMA.

Another feature of interest is that the 5-HT2AR also forms a heteroreceptor complex
with oxytocin receptors (OXTR) [30]. The negative effects of 5-HT2AR on depression can in-
volve allosteric antagonistic receptor–receptor interactions in OXTR-5-HT2A heteroreceptor
complexes in emotional networks [3]. The inhibition of OXTR protomer signaling by 5-
HT2AR can contribute to inhibitory effects on e.g., reward and motivation and disturbances
in social behavior [31].

2.2. D2R-5-HT1AR Heterocomplex

In 2016 the formation of constitutive D2R-5-HT1AR complexes was demonstrated
in cotransfected HEK cells [32]. The method was based on the FRET principle using
homogenous time-resolved FRET (HTRF) and ﬂuorescence lifetime imaging microscopy
(FLIM). It is of interest that colocalization of the 5-HT1AR and D2R was observed to a high
degree in the medial prefrontal cortex (mouse) but to a much lower degree in the striatum
and hippocampus based on double immunoﬂuorescence.

Cells 2021, 10, 1902

Atypical antipsychotic drugs, especially clozapine, increased the heteromerization
of these two receptors in the HEK 293 cell line. Combined treatment with clozapine and
the 5-HTR agonist 8-OH-DPAT led to the most marked reduction of cAMP levels that was
proposed to involve a 5-HTR agonist-induced allosteric inhibition of the signaling of the
D2R [32]. These results again underline the impact D2R-5-HTR heteromerization for the
integration of DA and 5-HT signals in the DA and 5-HT nerve terminal networks of the
brain, which can be of relevance for understanding schizophrenia and depression and the
development of novel treatments.

This work was continued in 2018 [33] with the demonstration of D2R-5-HT1AR
heterocomplexes in the prefrontal cortex of the mouse using the in situ proximity ligation
assay (in situ PLA). Chronic treatment with the SSRI paroxetine or a low dose of risperidone,
an atypical antipsychotic drug with ability to block both 5-HT2AR and D2R, was found to
increase D2R-5-HT1AR heteromerization in the prefrontal cortex. This action was found
not to be related to an increased expression of these two receptors due to lack of changes in
the mRNA levels using in situ hybridization and failure of changes in the density of the
D2R and 5-HT1AR using quantitative receptor autoradiography [33]. Thus, the increased
D2R-5-HT1AR heteromerization found is independent of changes in expression and may
reﬂect an increased afﬁnity of the two receptors for each other involving recruitment of the
D2R and/or 5-HT1AR from monomers, homomers, and other types of D2R and 5-HT1AR
heteroreceptor complexes.

It is of substantial interest the demonstration of PLA positive D2R-5-HT1AR heterore-
ceptor complexes both in the pyramidal glutamate nerve cells and in the GABA neurons,
and also in the astroglia, underlining the view that this integrative mechanism is also
present in this glial cells [14,15]. It will be of substantial interest to study if these heterore-
ceptor complexes of high relevance for integration of DA and 5-HT signals are also present
in signiﬁcant densities in other brain regions.

In view of the existence of 5-HT1AR-5-HT2AR heteroreceptor complexes in the hip-
pocampus and anterior cingulate cortex [34] it should be considered that also D2R-5-
HT1AR-5-HT2AR heterocomplexes can exist in several regions of the brain in a dynamic
balance with D2R-5-HT2AR and D2R-5-HT1AR heteroreceptor complexes and the corre-
sponding homomers and monomers. This research opens a new understanding of the
integration of DA and 5-HT signals released from DA and 5-HT nerve terminal networks
operating mainly via volume transmission to reach heteroreceptor complexes located in
extrasynaptic and synaptic regions of neuronal cells and in astroglia.

3. The GalR1-GalR2 Heterodimer and the Putative GalR1-GalR2-5-HT1A
Heteroreceptor Complexes. Targets for Galanin N-terminal Fragment Gal (1–15), a
Modulator of Emotional Networks in Models of Mental Disease

Gal (1–15) has a high afﬁnity for and preferentially activates the GalR1-GalR2 het-
erodimer located especially in the raphe-limbic-cortical systems and has a signiﬁcant role
in producing anxiety and depression-related behaviors [35,36]. GalR1activation produces
depressive actions while GalR2 stimulation induces antidepressant effects [9]. The reason
for the stronger depressive effects of the Gal (1–15) fragment compared with parent galanin
peptide [9] may be its ability to preferentially activate with higher afﬁnity and efﬁcacy of
the GalR1 protomer vs. the GalR2 protomer of the GalR1-GalR2 complex [37] (Figure 1).
This should also lead to increased allosteric inhibition of the GalR2 protomer signaling
with its antidepressant activity.

Figure 1. To the left it is shown the location of GalR1 homodimer and the GalR2 homodimer. They are located in the
plasma membrane with high afﬁnity mainly for galanin 1–29 (blue circles). GalR1 signals via inhibition of adenylyl cyclase
(AC) mediated through Gi/o while GalR2 mainly signals via phospholipase C (PLC) activation mediated through Gq/11.
The GalR1-GalR2 heterodimer has instead a high afﬁnity for galanin fragment 1–15 (yellow circles) (to the right). This
heterodimer is in equilibrium with the 5-HT1AR-GalR1-GalR2 in the plasma membrane. In this heterotrimeric complex the
Gal 1–15 fragment enhances through allosteric mechanisms the 5-HT1AR signaling mainly through activation of GalR2. As
a result, antidepressant-like effects were observed upon cotreatment with 5-HT1AR agonist and the galanin fragment given
i.c.v. Moreover, an increased expression of the 5-HT1AR protomer was observed.

It should be noted that high-afﬁnity galanin fragment-binding sites were observed also
in brain regions with few galanin high-afﬁnity binding sites such as dorsal hippocampus,
striatum, and cerebral cortex [36]. In regions with both galanin fragment and galanin-
binding sites, the galanin fragment was more potent than galanin in reducing the afﬁnity
of the high-afﬁnity 5-HT1AR agonist binding sites [38,39]. In line with these results, only
the galanin fragment but not galanin was able to reduce the high-afﬁnity 5-HT1AR agonist
binding sites in the hippocampus [40].

In 2016 Millon et al. [8] discovered that Gal (1–15) could enhance the antidepressant-
like actions of a 5-HT1AR agonist in the forced swimming test. Furthermore, Flores-Burgess
et al. [41] discovered that this Gal fragment improved the antidepressant-like effects of
the SSRI ﬂuoxetine in the same test. To explain this switch in the action of Gal (1–15)
from causing depression and anxiety to enhancing the antidepressant effects of a 5-HT1AR
agonist and the SSRI ﬂuoxetine, the existence of GalR1-GalR2-5-HT1AR complexes was
proposed. In this putative complex novel allosteric receptor–receptor interactions can
develop. Furthermore both GalR1-5HT1A and GalR2-5-HT1A heteroreceptor complexes
exist inter alia in the hippocampus, as demonstrated by in situ PLA analysis [8]. These
results are compatible with the formation of GalR1-GalR2-5-HT1AR heterocomplexes in
balance with the GalR1-5-HT1AR and GalR2-5-HT1AR heteromers in the hippocampus.

The mechanism for the ability of the Gal (1–15) fragment to enhance the antidepressant
effects of the 5-HT1AR agonist [8] is unknown but it may be that the combined treatment
enhances GalR2 signaling via an allosteric mechanism in the putative GalR1-GalR2-5-HT1AR
complex. The 5-HT1AR agonist may preferentially enhance the GalR2 protomer signaling
which in turn can allosterically inhibit the GalR1 protomer signaling coupled to Gi/o, causing
inhibition of the cAMP-PKA signaling pathway and leading to depressive effects. Of high rel-
evance is the coupling of GalR2 to Gq/11 which, upon activation, can increase phospholipase
C signaling leading to activation of the calcium signaling pathway. It involves the activation
of Erk1/2, p50/p65 and calmodulin which alters gene expression and can cause increases

They are located in the plasma membrane with high affinity mainly for galanin 1–29 (blue circles). GalR1 signals via inhibition of adenylyl cyclase (AC) mediated through Gi/o while GalR2 mainly signals via phospholipase C (PLC) activation mediated through Gq/11. The GalR1-GalR2 heterodimer has instead a high affinity for galanin fragment 1–15 (yellow circles) (to the right). This heterodimer is in equilibrium with the 5-HT1AR-GalR1-GalR2 in the plasma membrane. In this heterotrimeric complex the Gal 1–15 fragment enhances through allosteric mechanisms the 5-HT1AR signaling mainly through activation of GalR2. As a result, antidepressant-like effects were observed upon cotreatment with 5-HT1AR agonist and the galanin fragment given i.c.v. Moreover, an increased expression of the 5-HT1AR protomer was observed. It should be noted that high-affinity galanin fragment-binding sites were observed also in brain regions with few galanin high-affinity binding sites such as dorsal hippo-campus, striatum, and cerebral cortex [36]. In regions with both galanin fragment and galanin-binding sites, the galanin fragment was more potent than galanin in reducing the affinity of the high-affinity 5-HT1AR agonist binding sites [38,39]. In line with these re-sults, only the galanin fragment but not galanin was able to reduce the high-affinity 5-HT1AR agonist binding sites in the hippocampus [40]. In 2016 Millon et al. [8] discovered that Gal (1–15) could enhance the antidepressant-like actions of a 5-HT1AR agonist in the forced swimming test. Furthermore, Flores-Bur-gess et al. [41] discovered that this Gal fragment improved the antidepressant-like effects of the SSRI fluoxetine in the same test. To explain this switch in the action of Gal (1–15) from causing depression and anxiety to enhancing the antidepressant effects of a 5-HT1AR agonist and the SSRI fluoxetine, the existence of GalR1-GalR2-5-HT1AR com-plexes was proposed. In this putative complex novel allosteric receptor–receptor interac-tions can develop. Furthermore both GalR1-5HT1A and GalR2-5-HT1A heteroreceptor complexes exist inter alia in the hippocampus, as demonstrated by in situ PLA analysis [8]. These results are compatible with the formation of GalR1-GalR2-5-HT1AR heterocom-plexes in balance with the GalR1-5-HT1AR and GalR2-5-HT1AR heteromers in the hippo-campus.  The mechanism for the ability of the Gal (1–15) fragment to enhance the antidepres-sant effects of the 5-HT1AR agonist [8] is unknown but it may be that the combined treat-ment enhances GalR2 signaling via an allosteric mechanism in the putative GalR1-GalR2-5-HT1AR complex. The 5-HT1AR agonist may preferentially enhance the GalR2 protomer signaling which in turn can allosterically inhibit the GalR1 protomer signaling coupled to Gi/o, causing inhibition of the cAMP-PKA signaling pathway and leading to depressive effects. Of high relevance is the coupling of GalR2 to Gq/11 which, upon activation, can increase phospholipase C signaling leading to activation of the calcium signaling path-way. It involves the activation of Erk1/2, p50/p65 and calmodulin which alters gene ex-pression and can cause increases in 5-HT1AR mRNA levels observed as well as the Cells 2021, 10, 1902

in 5-HT1AR mRNA levels observed as well as the increase of Bmax values of the 5-HT1AR
high-affinity agonist binding sites [8]. Such an increase of expression of 5-HT1AR can be
a major mechanism involved in the Gal (1–15) induced enhancement of the antidepressant
effects of the 5-HT1AR agonist including the raphe-hippocampal 5-HT neurons.

Similar results were also obtained with i.c.v Gal (1–15) in combination with ﬂuoxetine
treatment in terms of enhancement of the antidepressant effects of the SSRI using the
forced swim test [41]. It is of substantial interest that both, siRNAGalR1 or siRNAGalR2
knockdown in vivo, counteracted the enhancement of these antidepressant-like effects
induced by Gal (1–15) in ﬂuoxetine treated rats [41,42]. The involvement of the 5-HT1AR
in these events was demonstrated by the blockade of these behavioral effects by a speciﬁc
5-HT1AR antagonist (WAY 1000635). These results were compatible with the existence
of a GalR1-GalR2-5-HT1AR complex. In line with these results increases in the 5-HT1AR
mRNA levels in the dorsal hippocampus, but not in the dorsal raphe, were also observed
by the combined treatment.

Another interesting paper was published by Flores-Burgess et al. [43] studying the
Gal (1–15)-ﬂuoxetine interactions in the novel object recognition test with participation
of 5-HT1AR in the medial prefrontal cortex. This part of the cerebral cortex is a region
where emotional processing and cognitive events become integrated and there exist sig-
niﬁcant densities of GalR1, GalR2, and 5-HT1AR. It is of substantial interest that the
ﬂuoxetine-produced memory impairment in the novel object recognition test was reversed
by Gal (1–15). The neurochemical mechanism involves the GalR2 subtype, since it was
the GalR2 antagonist (M871) which blocked the reversal of ﬂuoxetine effects induced by
Gal (1–15) [43]. Other neurochemical ﬁndings were that the galanin fragment reduced the
afﬁnity and increased the density of the 5-HT1AR agonist binding sites and increased the
mRNA levels of the 5-HT1AR 24 h after the treatment.

In order to interpret this ﬂuoxetine-induced memory impairment and its reversal by
Gal (1–15), we should consider that there is a balance between the various heteroreceptor
complexes in each neuron [2]. In the medial prefrontal cortical neurons, we should consider
especially the balance between GalR1-GalR, GalR1-GalR2-5-HT1AR, and 5-HT1AR-5-
HT2AR [44] heteroreceptor complexes.

Furthermore, the heteroreceptor complexes are highly dynamic and it has been pro-
posed that they play a major role in learning and memory [44,45]. In the postsynaptic
membranes they can form short-term memories that can be transformed into long-term
memories (molecular engram). This can involve a major role for novel adapter proteins
formed through the binding of receptor fragments set free from the intracellular part of the
receptor protomer to bind and modulate transcription factors. This can allow the expres-
sion of novel adapter proteins that can reorganize transient heteroreceptor complex into a
long-term memory. Thus, to understand the results obtained by Flores-Burgess et al. [43]
we should consider the existence of the GalR1-GalR2-5-HT1AR heterocomplex and its bal-
ance with the 5-HT1AR-5-HT2AR heterocomplex in the medial prefrontal cortex. It seems
possible that the SSRI ﬂuoxetine increases the extracellular serotonin levels which should
activate both 5-HT1AR and 5-HT2AR, with a consequent 5-HT2AR protomer-induced al-
losteric inhibition of the 5-HT1AR protomer in the 5-HT1AR-5-HT2AR heterocomplex [34].
It should also be considered that the 5-HT2AR monomer and homomer can bind to the
5-HT1AR protomer of the GalR1-GalR2-5-HT1AR heterocomplex and inhibit the signaling
also of this 5-HT1AR protomer. Such an inhibition of these two 5-HT1ARs in two different
heteroreceptor complexes can help explain the ﬂuoxetine-induced memory impairment
in the novel object recognition test in the prefrontal cortex. With the 5-HT1AR signaling
inhibited in these two receptor heterocomplexes that can be part of the memory formed
together with other high order homo-and heteroreceptor complexes, this memory can no
longer function, and novel object recognition memory is lost.

However, the memory could be restored by giving Gal (1–15) together with ﬂuoxetine.
The mechanism can involve restoration of 5-HT1AR signaling in the GalR1-GalR2-5-HT1AR
heterocomplex. This may be possible because in this heteroreceptor complex Gal (1–15)

Cells 2021, 10, 1902

the allosteric receptor–receptor interactions are different from those in the GalR1-GalR2
complex. Thus, Gal (1–15) may now preferentially activate the GalR2 protomer which via
the Gq/11 coupling can activate the signaling of the 5-HT1AR signaling. In addition, the
activation of the Gq/11 signaling which increases gene expression can also explain the
observed increase in the mRNA levels of the 5-HT1AR. This action will also contribute to
increased 5-HT1AR activity [43].

It is of interest that Gal (1–15) did not reverse the actions of ﬂuoxetine on the Object
Location Memory task [43]. This task likely mainly takes place in the hippocampus and
was also impaired by ﬂuoxetine. Thus, it seems as if in this case the GalR1-GalR2-5-HT1AR
heterocomplex does not participate in this memory process. Instead, it may involve another
5-HT heteroreceptor complex in which the 5-HTR protomer may need to be reactivated
after its down regulation by SSRI ﬂuoxetine activated 5-HTR subtypes potentially with
depressive actions.

Gal (1–15) and Its Modulation of the Meso-Limbic DA Reward Neurons Causes Anhedonia

It is of high interest that Millon et al. [46] found that Gal (1–15) fragment given i.c.v.
can cause anhedonia based especially on studies on saccharin self-administration and
sucrose preference tests. The neurochemical analysis was focused on the ventral tegmental
area, rich in DA cell bodies projecting into the ventral striatum and the cerebral cortex,
especially the frontal and limbic cortex, and the nucleus accumbens rich in DA nerve
terminals. However, also a substantial number of GABA nerve cells exist in the ventral
tegmental area [47].

As previously mentioned, the major target for Gal (1–15) is the GalR1-GalR2 hete-
rocomplex [35,37]. It is therefore of signiﬁcant interest that the GalR1 and GalR2 were
colocalized among the DA and GABA nerve cell bodies of the ventral tegmental area where
they form GalR1-GalR2 heterocomplexes. The dominant action of Gal (1–15) at this hetero-
complex is usually an activation of the GalR1 protomer with a Gi/o mediated inhibitory
signaling and with the ability to allosterically inhibit the GalR2 signaling mediated via
Gq/11 which enhances the signaling in the cells.

However, it is important to notice that anhedonia-like behavior, demonstrated e.g., in
saccharin self-administration and sucrose preference test after i.c.v. injection of Gal (1–15),
was counteracted by the GalR2 antagonist M871 [46]. These results can best be interpreted
by assuming that the GalR1-GalR2 heterocomplexes are mainly located on the GABA VTA
interneurons innervating the VTA DA neurons. Activation of the GABA interneurons by
GalR2 can then lead to inhibition of the VTA DA neurons contributing to anhedonia-like
behavior. The blockade of the GalR2 by the antagonist can then cause a return of the activity
in the VTA-limbic-cortical DA neurons which counteracts the anhedonia-like behavior [46].
As to a leading role of GalR2 vs. the GalR1 protomer in this regulation of the VTA DA
neurons, it was found that Gal (1–15) reduced the mRNA expression of the DA transporter
and vesicular monoamine transporter 2 that also reﬂect an increased GABA inhibition of
the VTA DA neurons. Instead, there was a signiﬁcant increase in the mRNA expression of
D3R in the VTA by Gal (1–15) which can be explained by the fact that the D3R can operate
mainly as an auto-receptor in VTA [46]. The results are compatible with the view that the
VTA GalR2 protomer upon activation by Gal (1–15) induced an activation of the GABA
interneurons causing inhibition of the VTA DA neurons leading to anhedonia-like behavior
and a neurochemical down regulation of the meso-limbic DA reward neurons [46]. These
results are supported by the observations of a reduction of the mRNA levels of DAT and
vesicular monoamine transporter 2 after Gal (1–15) treatment. This should lead to increased
activation of the D2 and D3 auto-receptors producing a reduced neuronal activity in the
VTA-Limbic-Cortical DA neurons [46].

Cells 2021, 10, 1902

In line with these results, reduced tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity was found
in the nucleus accumbens as well as reduced mRNA levels of C-Fos [46]. Thus, signs of
a down-regulation of the VTA-Limbic-Cortical DA system also appeared to develop in
the nucleus accumbens after treatment with Gal (1–15). As a compensatory upregulation,
signiﬁcant increases of the mRNA levels of DA D1R, D2R, and D3R were observed in the
nucleus accumbens in response to the reduced activity induced in these DA neurons by
Gal (1–15) [46].

This work by Millon et al. [46] indicates that GalR1-GalR2 heterocomplex activated by
Gal (1–15) may directly activate the GABA interneurons in the VTA leading to inhibition of
the VTA-Limbic-Cortical DA pathway which produces anhedonia-like behavior, a major
sign of depression. It seems possible that the previous work reporting strong depression,
based on testing in the forced swim test, and anxiety with i.c.v. Gal (1–15) [35] also
can involve at least in part activation of GABA interneurons also in regions such as the
hippocampus and dorsal raphe. This will be an important continuation of the work on
understanding the mechanism of action of Gal (1–15) besides the participation of the
GalR1-GalR2 heteromer in higher order heteroreceptor complexes with the 5-HT1AR and
enhancing its signaling [2,10,36].

The remarkable down-regulation of the activity of VTA-Limbic-Cortical DA reward
neurons observed with Gal (1–15) with a postulated dominance of GalR2 activation give
thoughts to the idea that GABA interneurons in the VTA upon activation has a major role
in putting a brake on the VTA-limbic-Cortical DA pathway to reduce reward and introduce
anhedonia. It should be considered that this regulation should have an impact not only
in major depression but also for the negative symptoms of schizophrenia. It will also be
of high interest to study if Gal (1–15) via its GalR1-GalR2 heteromer has a similar role in
regulating the GABA interneurons which innervate the nigro-striatal DA neurons.

4. Serotonin 5-HT1AR-Receptor Tyrosine Kinase (RTK) Heteroreceptor Complexes

In 2007, it was proposed that direct GPCR-RTK interactions through the formation
of GPCR-RTK heteroreceptor complexes can lead to transactivation of the RTK protomer
independent of metalloprotease activation to transform a pro-ligand into a RTK ligand
to elicit RTK signaling [48,49]. Inspired by the signiﬁcant work of Kitayama et al. [50] we
proposed that certain postjunctional 5-HT1R subtypes may activate the ﬁbroblast growth
factor receptor FGFR2-FGFR1 system by forming a heteroreceptor complex leading to
development of allosteric receptor–receptor interactions (Figure 2). In this way it seemed
possible that SSRI, such as ﬂuoxetine, may improve also neural trophic activity and coun-
teract depression-induced atrophy of the serotonin raphe-limbic neuron systems through
transactivation of FGFR1 via allosteric mechanisms and indirect interactions over intra-
cellular pathways. It was also proposed that transactivation of RTK may also develop
via activation of the intracellular pathways of GPCRs involving increases of intracellular
calcium ions, protein kinase Src, and messengers such as reactive oxygen species which
cause tyrosine phosphorylation of the RTK [49].

Figure 2. GPCR-RTK heteroreceptor complexes exempliﬁed by the A2A-TrkB heteroreceptor complex [51]. To the left
the TrkB homodimer is found in the plasma membrane signaling via growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (GRB2),
proto-oncogene tyrosine protein kinase (src) and PLC beta. At the center, in the plasma membrane, it is shown the A2AR
homodimer which is found interacting with an adapter protein (e.g., RAMP) and its link to the Gs alpha, leading to the
enhancement of cAMP levels via activation of the AC. At the center, it is also shown the A2A-TrkB heteroreceptor complex
and their allosteric receptor–receptor interactions (A) which take place between the A2AR protomer and TrkB receptor
protomer enhancing the TrkB receptor signaling. The TrkB receptor signaling can also be enhanced through phosphorylation
(B) involving transactivation via e.g., activation of src. A number of signaling proteins are indicated in cytoplasm below
the heteroreceptor complex, leading via various Ras proteins to activation of MEK1/2 and ERK1/2. To the far right, the
co-activation of the two receptor protomer in the heteroreceptor complex leads through recruitment of beta-arrestin to
co-internalization, reducing the signaling of the heteroreceptor complex (C).

The ﬁrst evidence for this view was obtained by Flajolet et al. [52], who demonstrated
that FGF can act as a co-transmitter through adenosine A2AR to regulate synaptic plasticity.
Using the yeast two hybrid analysis physical interactions were demonstrated through the
formation of A2AR-FGFR heteroreceptor complexes. Coactivation of these two receptor
protomers caused in PC12 cells neurite extension and MAPK-ERK activation and induction
of cortical-striatal plasticity, opening up new possibilities for drug development [52].

In 2012, evidence was obtained for the existence of FGFR1-5-HT1AR heteroreceptor
complexes in the raphe-hippocampal 5-HT system [3,7,53]. These heteroreceptor com-
plexes were discovered in hippocampal cultures and in the dorsal hippocampus using
co-immunoprecipitation and in situ PLA [15,53]. A neuronal location was observed and
upon coactivation of the two receptor protomers, synergistic increases in extracellular
signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 were found. The highest density of FGFR1-5-HT1AR
heterocomplexes were present in the pyramidal cell layer of the CA1 to CA4 areas mainly
modulating their glutamate projections and their plasticity. The enhancement of hip-
pocampal plasticity also involved synergistic increases in PC12 cell neurite densities and
extensions as well as protrusions in hippocampal cultures. These plasticity changes were
blocked by interference with the receptor interface of the heteromer. It was of high interest
that the acute and combined treatment with FGF-2 and 5-HT1AR agonist produced marked
antidepressant-like effects as demonstrated by using the forced swim test.

In 2015 evidence was obtained also for the existence of FGFR1-5-HT1AR autoreceptor
complexes in the dorsal and median raphe of the midbrain projecting inter alia into
the hippocampus [54]. Enhancement of the FGFR1 protomer signaling was observed
with improved trophic effects also in the FGFR1-5-HT1A autoreceptor complexes upon
combined agonist treatment [55]. The neurophysiological work of Ambrogini et al. (2021)
led to the remarkable demonstration that agonist activation of the FGFR1 protomer led to a

reduced, improving neuronal activity in the ascending 5-HT neuron systems leading to
antidepressant activity.

5. Other Types of GPCR-RTK Heterocomplexes and Treatment of Depression
5.1. GPCR-TrkB Heterocomplexes

This year the exciting discovery was made that a number of antidepressant drugs such
as tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and SSRIs, as well as the fast-acting antidepressant drug
ketamine, can bind to the TrkB receptor [56]. The binding site for ﬂuoxetine was shown to
be in the transmembrane domain of the TrkB heterodimer. The binding of the antidepres-
sants to this site enhanced the behavioral actions of BDNF including their positive effects
on neuronal plasticity. Another highlight was that mutation of the transmembrane domain
counteracted the behavioral actions of the antidepressant drugs. The link to the effects of
the antidepressant drugs to enhanced neuronal plasticity was suggested to explain the slow
development of the antidepressant-like effects of antidepressant drugs. Previous work
strongly indicated that the signaling of BDNF was essential for the effects of almost all
antidepressant drugs [57,58]. However, the study of Casarotto et al. [56] now demonstrated
that antidepressant drugs can directly bind to the TrkB homo-dimer in the transmembrane
domain with an afﬁnity that is relevant for obtaining therapeutic effects. The analysis
involved atomistic molecular dynamics simulations. It was also found that the transmem-
brane domain of the TrkB heterodimer can sense alternations in the levels of cholesterol in
the plasma membrane, which can be of relevance for its ability to mediate plasticity [56].
Cholesterol is derived from astroglia and modulates BDNF signaling and BDNF enhances
neuronal synthesis of cholesterol [59].

The above results from Casarotto et al. [56] are of high interest and demonstrate that
antidepressant drugs through targeting a novel binding site in the transmembrane part
of the TrkB homodimer can allosterically promote the signaling of BDNF over the TrkB
receptor. This integrative process can be further developed through the existence of GPCR-
TrkB heteroreceptor complexes in diverse brain regions as discussed above. The GPCRs can
then, especially upon agonist activation allosterically modulate the BDNF-TrkB signaling
in the GPCR-TrkB heteroreceptor complex. So far, only the A2AR-TrkB heterocomplex
in the striatum has been demonstrated [51]. It will be of high interest to test if a discrete
number of 5-HTR subtypes can form heteroreceptor complexes with the TrkB receptor.
Upon activation of the 5-HT receptor protomer the allosteric receptor–receptor interactions
may then enhance the signaling of the TrkB receptor homodimer and promote neuronal
plasticity and antidepressant-like behavioral activity in animal models of depression.

It is of high interest that very recently Madhusmita et al. [60] published a paper on
the effects of depletion of TrkB receptors located in adult 5-HT neurons. They found
clear-cut modulations of the neurochemistry and function of the 5-HT neurons. They found
marked increases in the brain 5-HT levels and likely in 5-HTsynthesis and release and
deﬁciency in learning and memory together with improved energy metabolism. These
results open the possibility that the TrkB homodimer receptor can form a heteroreceptor
complex with the 5-HT1A autoreceptor in the 5-HT neurons, in which the TrkB protomer
can enhance the 5-HT1A protomer afﬁnity for 5-HT and 5-HT1A autoreceptor signaling
based on facilitatory allosteric receptor–receptor interactions. As a result of enhanced
inhibitory 5-HT1A autoreceptor activity, the ﬁring rate of the 5-HT neurons will decline
through the enhanced opening of the GIRK channels increasing hyperpolarization.

Based on the loss of activation of the 5-HT1A autoreceptor by the TrkB receptor in
this heteroreceptor complex, it seems possible to understand the reason for the putative
overactivation of 5-HT synthesis and release upon deletion of TrkB receptors in the adult
5-HT neurons. It should also be noticed that 5-HT1A autoreceptor-FGFR1 heterocomplexes
exist in the 5-HT neurons [6,54]. It will be of high interest to evaluate if these heterocom-

Cells 2021, 10, 1902

11 of 23

plexes have a differential role in modulating the activity and plasticity of the dorsal raphe
5-HT neurons via their 5-HT1A autoreceptors and to understand their balance in the adult
5-HT neurons.

It is of substantial interest that Di Palma et al. [51] demonstrated the A2AR-TrkB
heteroreceptor complexes in the dorsal hippocampus also have their highest density in the
pyramidal cell layer including the CA1 to CA3 regions and the polymorphic layer of the
dentate gyrus. Thus, different types of GPCR-RTK hetero complexes appear to exist to a
high degree in the pyramidal cell layer of the hippocampus giving it substantial neuronal
plasticity necessary for the learning and memory activities ongoing in the glutamate
pyramidal neurons of these regions. This high plasticity likely becomes impaired as aging
develops leading to cognitive disturbances [51]. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)
is the ligand for the TrkB receptor and deﬁcits in its production may be one factor to be
considered when discussing the malfunction of learning and memory in aging and overall
errors in the allosteric receptor–receptor interactions in the GPCR-RTK heterocomplexes
are likely to play a major role.

Angiotensin receptor type 2 can form heteroreceptor complexes with TrkB receptors
in the medial prefrontal cortex leading to transactivation of TrkB. Moreover, an antagonist
of the angiotensin receptor produces antidepressant effects [49]. These results open the
possibility that this heterocomplex can be a novel target for antidepressants [61]. It should
also be noticed that activation of 5-HT7 receptor promotes TrkB receptor expression and
phosphorylation in primary cultures from the cerebral cortex [62]. However, these effects
may not be linked to antidepressant actions since this 5-HT receptor subtype possesses
depressive activity. However, this may not be true when existing in a complex with TrkB.
It is of substantial interest that Rantamaki et al. [63] found that antidepressant drugs such
as imipramine can transactivate the TrkB receptor in the rodent brain independently of
BDNF and blockade of monoamine transporters. The mechanism remains to be determined
but it may potentially involve the possible existence of certain monoamine receptor-TrkB
heteroreceptor complexes. In this case, the extracellular monoamines can induce confor-
mational changes in monoamine receptor protomers that via allosteric receptor–receptor
interactions can contribute to the transactivation of the TrkB protomer. As a result, increases
in neuronal survival and plasticity may develop.

5.2. Muscarinic Acetylcholine Receptor (mAChR)-FGFR1 Hetero Complexes

Muscarine M3R-FGFR1 heterocomplexes were found in the hippocampus using in situ
PLA [64]. Subsequently the existence of M1R-FGFR1 heterocomplexes was explored in the
dorsal hippocampus [65]. M1R-FGFR1 heterocomplexes were found with receptor–receptor
interactions leading to a rapid transactivation of the FGFR involving allosteric modulation.
The transactivation was connected to neuronal plasticity since neurite outgrowth was
counteracted by the pFGFR inhibitor and the Src inhibitor. With PLA the hetero receptor
complexes were observed inter alia in the pyramidal cell layer of the hippocampus. The
M1R protomer can therefore take part in the FGFR transactivation. The allosteric receptor–
receptor interactions in these complexes demand the phosphorylation of the FGFR by
receptor and nonreceptor tyrosine kinases to improve FGFR signaling [65]. It should also
be considered that nuclear FGFR1 may operate as a general transcriptional regulator [66].
Treatments involving pFGFR inhibitor SU5402 or Src inhibitor PP1 on FGFR transac-
tivation induced by a mAChR agonist indicated a mechanism in which potential allosteric
receptor–receptor interactions between FGFR1 and mAChR depends on the Src protein linked
to these heteroreceptor complexes. It suggested that the allosteric mechanisms in the het-
eroreceptor complexes demand a correct recruitment and activation of the Src tyrosine kinase
protein for the AChR agonist to produce the transactivation of the hippocampal FGFR1.
Thus, a tyrosine kinase of the Src protein family is crucial for the operation of the allosteric
receptor–receptor interaction [65]. It enables the muscarinic receptor activation of the trophic
FGFR1 system with modulation of differentiation, growth, and protection of neurons.

Cells 2021, 10, 1902

12 of 23

It should also be considered that the mAChR subtypes in the hippocampus are located
in a pre and post-synaptic position and can participate in higher order heteroreceptor
complexes, also containing FGFR1 protomers and ionotropic receptors. Through their
modulation the mAChR1,3 subtypes can have a signiﬁcant role in learning and mem-
ory [44,65]. The mAChR1,3-FGFR1 heterocomplex may also be a new target for treatment
of Alzheimer’s disease by reducing neurodegeneration upon its activation, including the
malfunction of the synaptic heteroreceptor complexes.

Moving into mental disease, it was found by Veena et al. [67] that the mAChR agonist ox-
otremorine could improve depression-like behavior in chronically stressed rats. Furthermore,
it seems more than possible that depression-induced atrophy in hippocampal neurons can be
improved by treatment with muscarinic agonists, especially in combination with brain pene-
trant FGFR subtype specific agonists [28,65]. Based on the work of Borroto-Escuela et al. [53,68]
(see above) a combined treatment with 5-HT1AR agonists and muscarinic1,3 receptor agonists
would be of high interest in view of the existence of both 5-HT1AR-FGFR1 and mAChR1,3-
FGFR1 heterocomplexes in the hippocampal neurons, especially of the pyramidal cell layer.
These heteroreceptor complexes may be in balance with 5-HT1AR-FGFR1-mAChR1,3 hetero
complexes, should they be expressed in the same neurons.

5.3. GPCR-Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) Heterocomplexes

EGFR belongs to the ErbB family of tyrosine kinase receptors and become functional
through homodimerization and heterodimerization in a ligand-dependent way [69]. It
possesses neuromodulation and neurotrophic activities [49]. It is of substantial interest
that adenosine A1 receptors can produce transactivation of the EGFR leading to neuropro-
tective actions in cortical neurons [70]. These two receptors are co-located in the plasma
membrane of nerve cells supporting the view that A1R-EGFR heterocomplexes may be
formed. However, they remain to be demonstrated.

Another GPCR,

the D2R can upon its activation increase the degree of
co-immunoprecipitation supporting the view that D2R activation can increase the for-
mation of this putative heteroreceptor complex in striatal neurons [71]. The D2R protomer
appears capable of producing a transactivation of EGFR protomer through stimulation of a
non-receptor tyrosine kinase (Src) leading to the activation of extracellular signal-regulated
kinase (ERK) signaling. The D2R can have a relevant role in neuroprotective effects and in
the development of the DA neuron systems.

It should also be noticed that GPCR-EGFR complexes may also be formed in as-
troglia but this remains to be demonstrated. Upon activation of 5-HT2BR in astroglia via
ﬂuoxetine-induced increases in extracellular levels of 5-HT, transactivation of the EGFR
can develop followed by ERK phosphorylation and EGF shedding [72]. Via volume trans-
mission neuronal EGFR can also become activated by EGF and may also contribute to
the antidepressant effects of ﬂuoxetine. It is also of substantial interest that activation of
the 5-HT2 receptor causes Src-dependent FGFR2 transactivation followed by ERK and
CREB phosphorylation and expression of GDNF mRNA in glial cells [73]. It should be
considered that multiple mechanisms can be involved in the GPCR transactivation of
EGFR-like tyrosine phosphorylation and allosteric receptor–receptor interactions.

5.4. Do GPCR-Platelet-Derived Growth Factor Receptor (PDGFR) Heteroreceptor Complexes Exist?

PDGFs and their ligands have a major role in the development of the nervous system
and its maintenance [74]. So far, no GPCR-PDGFR heteroreceptor complexes have been
reported. Of special interest is the demonstration that 5-HT and 5-HT1AR agonists can
increase the phosphorylation of the PDGF beta in cortical neurons and neuroblastoma cells.
This transactivation turned out to be Src and PLC dependent [75,76]. Furthermore, the
SSRI ﬂuoxetine could transactivate the PDGFR beta via activation of 5-HT2B receptors
which blocked the 5-HT-induced transactivation likely through desensitization [77]. Both
D2R and D4R were capable of transactivating PDGFR beta via tyrosine phosphorylation.
Furthermore, it is also of signiﬁcant interest that the D2R and D4R-induced transactivation

Cells 2021, 10, 1902

13 of 23

of PDGFR beta can lead to inhibition of NMDAR signaling in the pyramidal cell layer in
the hippocampus and in the prefrontal cortex involving a calcium ion and calmodulin-
dependent NMDAR inactivation [78]. In 2006 it was demonstrated that the D2R can inhibit
NMDAR signaling via formation of a D2R-NMDAR complex [79]. Thus, the regulation by
D2R of NMDAR may involve in certain brain regions higher-order heteroreceptor com-
plexes in which D2R-PDGFR beta-NMDAR can participate. Such heteroreceptor complexes
may indicate that not only GPCRs but also RTKs can modulate synaptic transmission and
thus have an impact on learning and memory through modulation of the composition of
the homo-and heteroreceptor complexes, their allosteric receptor–receptor interactions,
and their phosphorylation and dephosphorylation via striatal-enriched protein tyrosine
phosphatase (STEP). In this way short-term memories and long-term memories and thus
molecular engrams can be formed in the postsynaptic membrane of synapses [44,45].

6. Can the Biological Principle of Forming Heteroreceptor Complexes in the Brain
Help Understand the Mechanism of Action of Hallucinogens?
6.1. MDMA (3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine)

MDMA belongs to the family of entactogens and is known for its prosocial actions and
was shown to be able to improve the symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder [28,80–82].
MDMA was found to produce multiple neurochemical effects such as inhibitory actions
on the DA, noradrenaline (NA) and 5-HT transporters and increases the blood levels of
oxytocin, cortisol, and vasopressin. It can directly bind to certain 5-HT receptor subtypes,
mainly to 5-HT1AR and 5-HT2B-C receptors. These receptors, such as the vasopressin 1A
receptor activated by oxytocin, may be involved in the prosocial effects of MDMA [81].
The real targets that induce the prosocial effects of MDMA and its therapeutic effects in
post-traumatic stress disorder is unknown. In view of the existence of e.g., 5-HT1AR-
5-HT2AR, 5-HT2AR-OXTR, and 5-HT2CR-OXTR heteroreceptor complexes [2,31,83], it
seems possible that such and other 5-HT heteroreceptor complexes can be high-afﬁnity
targets for MDMA actions. These heteroreceptor complexes can also become modulated
by activated glucocorticoid receptors in stress, known to be enriched in the monoamine
neurons [84].

6.2. Psilocybin

This psychoactive alkaloid belongs to the classic 5-HT hallucinogens [84] also called
psychedelic compounds [85]. Its major target appears to be the 5-HT1A, 5-HT2A, and
5-HT2C receptors [85]. There exist promising indications that psilocybin can produce
therapeutic effects in depression [86]. It is proposed that the major target of psilocybin
can be certain 5-HTR heterocomplexes in which due to conformational changes certain
5-HTR heterocomplexes have developed a high afﬁnity for psilocybin as well as a high
efﬁcacy leading to enhanced signaling of this 5-HTR subtype. Such an effect can also be
region selective due to the differences in their composition. There is the possibility that
such heteroreceptor complexes can mediate fast antidepressant effects, but there is no
support for this possibility. Such events may also develop with the 5-HT hallucinogen
dimethyltryptamine, which can activate several subtypes of 5-HT receptor besides the
5-HT2AR, known to play a major role in mediating the hallucinogenic actions [82].

6.3. Ketamine

Ketamine is a rapidly acting antidepressant drug used in treatment of resistant depres-
sion. It is hallucinogenic but belongs to the dissociative anesthetics [82]. Its mechanism
of action has not been fully clariﬁed but it has been suggested that the antidepressant
actions of ketamine may involve a noncompetitive antagonist action at certain NMDARs
and activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin 1 (mTORC1) pathway [87]. However,
the early work of Saarelainen et al. [88] should be also noted. They demonstrated that the
positive effects of antidepressant drugs such as ketamine were counteracted by blocking

Cells 2021, 10, 1902

14 of 23

TrkB signaling. Castren and Antila [58] therefore proposed that the antidepressant effects
were produced by TrkB-induced increases in neuronal plasticity.

The recent work of Casarotto et al. [56] is highly interesting since they found that not
only classical antidepressant drugs such as ﬂuoxetine but also ketamine and its metabolite
can bind to the TrkB receptors in concentrations that do not block the NMDA receptor.
These exciting results suggest that both TCA and SSRI antidepressant drugs as well as the
rapidly acting antidepressant drug ketamine can produce signiﬁcant therapeutic effects
through binding and acting at partially overlapping sites in the transmembrane domain
of the TrkB receptor in critical neuronal networks [56]. They also proposed that the more
rapid antidepressant actions of ketamine can be explained by its more rapid penetration
into the brain reaching more quickly the concentration needed for the activation of TrkB.

7. Understanding the Role of Astrocytes in Modulating Forebrain Glutamate Synapses
with Impact on Dorsal Raphe-Forebrain Serotonin Neurons Playing a Key Role in
Major Depressive Disorder
7.1. Key Features of Astrocytes

It is today well-known that the astrocytes possess a large number of receptors,
especially those belonging to the GPCR family [89]. As examples can be mentioned
monoamine [90], adenosine, and mGluR5 receptors among the GPCRs. Astrocytes can
release transmitters especially glutamate, D-serine being a co-agonist at the NMDA recep-
tor and ATP which is hydrolyzed to adenosine in the extracellular space [91]. Via short
distance volume transmission [92,93] the astroglial transmitters such as glutamate released
by astroglial Ca2+ signals can directly reach the neuronal glutamate receptors leading to
increases in neuronal Ca2+ signals as well [94–96].

It is true that the astrocytes are not electrically excitable but are excitable in terms
of Ca2+ oscillations found through the use of confocal and 2-photon microscopy as well
as ﬂuorescent indicators of Ca2+ (see [97]). These Ca2+ oscillations can be propagated as
calcium waves in astrocytes through astrocytic release of ATP [98]. Thus, astrocytes can
encode information using Ca2+ signaling.

It appears clear that astrocytic mGluR5 can play a signiﬁcant role in increasing the
degree of astrocytic Ca2+ signaling. This glutamate receptor is Gq coupled which activates
phospholipase C leading to increased formation of diacylglycerol and inositol triphosphate
(IP3), which can release Ca2+ from its stores in the astrocytes and increase the Ca2+ levels in
the cytoplasm. It should also be considered that astroglia via release not only of glutamate
but also of D-serine, can regulate neuronal NMDA receptors since D-serine acts as a co-
agonist at the glycine binding site of the NMDA receptor. Thus, it is clear that astrocytes in
this way can modulate synaptic glutamate plasticity [99].

When discussing the role of astrocytes, it should be noted that an important source
of glutamate originates from the astrocytic glutamate-glutamine cycle (see [100]). It in-
volves the uptake of glutamate into astrocytes via their astroglial transporters followed
by its binding to an astrocytic enzyme, glutamine synthetase leading to the formation of
glutamine. Upon release of glutamine from the astrocytes it is taken up into neurons by
transporters. Here glutaminase converts glutamine into glutamate. In the GABA neurons
glutamate then becomes decarboxylated into GABA and stored in vesicles. It documents
the major role of astrocytes in synaptic GABA transmission.

Finally, when discussing the function of the astrocytes the marked impact of inter-
actions between astrocytes and neurons on brain energy metabolism should be remem-
bered [101]. There is a need not only for neurovascular coupling but also for neurometabolic
coupling involving demands of cooperation between activated astrocytes and neurons to
meet high energy demands to develop appropriate neuronal excitability and function. Of
special interest is lactate in the brain that is to a substantial degree formed and released
from astrocytes. Lactate reaches neurons via volume transmission and acts not only by
providing energy but also by providing signals to the neurons [102]. Magistretti and
Allaman [102] regard lactate as a modulator of neuronal function to improve excitability

Cells 2021, 10, 1902

and plasticity to allow the development of “an optimal homeostatic tone.” It represents an
exciting achievement.

7.2. Astroglial Heteroreceptor Complexes

In 2017 the ﬁrst indications were obtained that allosteric receptor–receptor interac-
tions can exist in astrocytes [14]. Thus, A2AR-D2R interactions were shown to modulate
gliotransmitter release from striatal astrocytes. The confocal analysis in isolated striatal
astrocytes demonstrated their co-location. Furthermore, the activation of D2R inhibited the
4-aminopyridine (blocker of potassium channels that delays repolarization) induced release
of glutamate from the astrocytes and this action was blocked by A2AR activation [14]. The
A2AR agonist alone lacked effects on the astroglial glutamate release. These results were
compatible with the existence of antagonistic allosteric A2AR-D2R interactions also in
astroglial A2AR-D2R hetero complexes. This view was strongly supported by the demon-
stration that the synthetic D2R peptide VLRRRRKRN present in the intracellular loop 3,
which is part of the electrostatic interface with the C- tail of the A2AR, can effectively block
the inhibitory action of the A2AR agonist on D2R-induced inhibition of astroglial glutamate
release by 4-aminopyridine [14]. In a subsequent paper biochemical and biophysical evi-
dence was obtained for the existence of A2AR-D2R hetero complexes on striatal astrocytes
based on the use of coimmunoprecipitation and proximity ligation assay [103] (Figure 3).
Thus, this important integrative mechanism present in heteroreceptor complexes exist also
in astroglia as beautifully demonstrated in these two publications.

Figure 3. In the nucleus accumbens shell A2AR-D2R heteroreceptor complexes were demonstrated
both in astrocytes and in nerve cells. The astrocytes were visualized in green color with GFAP
antibodies (glial ﬁbrillary acidic protein immunoreactivity). The nerve cells were not visualized. PLA
positive A2AR-D2R hetero complexes were found as clusters in high densities. White arrows point
to the red PLA clusters in green labeled astroglia. Most of the red clusters are not associated with
the astroglia (yellow arrows) and are most likely present in the accumbal neurons rich in GalR1 and
GalR2 and 5-HT1ARimunoreactivities.

The astrocytes were visualized in green color with GFAP anti-bodies (glial fibrillary acidic protein immunoreactivity). The nerve cells were not visualized. PLA positive A2AR-D2R hetero complexes were found as clusters in high densities. White arrows point to the red PLA clusters in green labeled astroglia. Most of the red clusters are not associated with the astroglia (yellow arrows) and are most likely present in the accumbal neurons rich in GalR1 and GalR2 and 5-HT1ARimunoreactivities. It should also be underlined that FGFR1-5-HT1AR heteroreceptor complexes exist in hippocampal astrocytes which may have a role in the 5-HT and FGF2 modulation of hip-pocampal gamma oscillations [15]. The pharmacological analysis indicated the existence of antagonistic allosteric receptor–receptor interactions in the astroglial FGFR1-5-HT1AR heterocomplexes that can contribute to diminishing the 5-HT1AR-induced reduction of gamma oscillations [15]. These results further underline the role of heteroreceptor com-plexes as a significant integrative mechanism also in astrocytes. 7.3. On the Role of Astrocytes in the Control of Glutamatergic Activity in the Infralimbic Cortex Modulating the Activity of the Ascending Raphe-Limbic-Cortical Systems Gasull-Camos et al. [104] made the exciting discovery that the blockade of the as-troglial transporter GLT-1 in the infralimbic cortex of rats can produce rapid antidepres-sant-like actions. Previous work had indicated that ketamine can elicit fast antidepressant actions via AMPA receptor (AMPAR) activation in the medial prefrontal cortex [105]. A similar AMPAR activation in the infralimbic cortex likely takes place also after the block-ade of GLT-1 through microinfusion of the GLT-1 inhibitor dihydrokainic acid leading to enhanced astroglial glutamate release and activation of AMPAR. Thus, the effects were mimicked by an AMPA receptor agonist s-AMPA and blocked by an AMPAR antagonist. This group also emphasized the infralimbic cortex connections to the midbrain raphe serotonin neurons projecting into the forebrain and having a highly significant role in ma-jor depressive disorder [5,106]. It is of high interest that microinfusion of veraridine, a depolarizing compound, into the infralimbic cortex produced rapid antidepressant ac-tions. The mechanism likely involved the activation of the serotonin raphe-cortical neu-rons, via the descending glutamate pathways from the infralimbic cortex, supported by the demonstration that the antidepressant-like effects produced by the astroglial trans-porter were no longer induced, following serotonin synthesis inhibition. Instead, the SSRI Cells 2021, 10, 1902

It should also be underlined that FGFR1-5-HT1AR heteroreceptor complexes exist in
hippocampal astrocytes which may have a role in the 5-HT and FGF2 modulation of hip-
pocampal gamma oscillations [15]. The pharmacological analysis indicated the existence of
antagonistic allosteric receptor–receptor interactions in the astroglial FGFR1-5-HT1AR hete-
rocomplexes that can contribute to diminishing the 5-HT1AR-induced reduction of gamma
oscillations [15]. These results further underline the role of heteroreceptor complexes as a
signiﬁcant integrative mechanism also in astrocytes.

7.3. On the Role of Astrocytes in the Control of Glutamatergic Activity in the Infralimbic Cortex
Modulating the Activity of the Ascending Raphe-Limbic-Cortical Systems

Gasull-Camos et al. [104] made the exciting discovery that the blockade of the astroglial
transporter GLT-1 in the infralimbic cortex of rats can produce rapid antidepressant-like
actions. Previous work had indicated that ketamine can elicit fast antidepressant actions
via AMPA receptor (AMPAR) activation in the medial prefrontal cortex [105]. A similar
AMPAR activation in the infralimbic cortex likely takes place also after the blockade of
GLT-1 through microinfusion of the GLT-1 inhibitor dihydrokainic acid leading to enhanced
astroglial glutamate release and activation of AMPAR. Thus, the effects were mimicked by
an AMPA receptor agonist s-AMPA and blocked by an AMPAR antagonist.

This group also emphasized the infralimbic cortex connections to the midbrain raphe
serotonin neurons projecting into the forebrain and having a highly signiﬁcant role in
major depressive disorder [5,106]. It is of high interest that microinfusion of veraridine, a
depolarizing compound, into the infralimbic cortex produced rapid antidepressant actions.
The mechanism likely involved the activation of the serotonin raphe-cortical neurons, via
the descending glutamate pathways from the infralimbic cortex, supported by the demon-
stration that the antidepressant-like effects produced by the astroglial transporter were
no longer induced, following serotonin synthesis inhibition. Instead, the SSRI citalopram
given into the infralimbic cortex had antidepressant effects similar to those of the astroglial
transport blocker [104].

The serotonin mechanisms involved in the antidepressant-like effects of astrocytic
transporter blockade with dihydrokainic acid in the infralimbic cortex, were further studied
in 2018 [107]. It is of substantial interest that local 5-HT1ARs mediated the antidepressant
effects of dihydrokainic acid and citalopram in the infralimbic cortex since they were
blocked by the microinjection of the 5-HT1ARs antagonist WAY100635 in this region.
Nevertheless, it was found that the astroglial transporter inhibition in the infralimbic cortex
increased serotonin and glutamate release in the dorsal raphe of the midbrain. In support,
increased expression of c-Fos was demonstrated in the serotonin nerve cells of the dorsal
raphe but not in its GABA interneurons [107] and increased serotonin release was also
found in the ventral hippocampus.

It should be noted that inhibition of the astrocytic transporter in the infralimbic cortex
versus the AMPAR agonist action gives a more prolonged duration of the antidepressant
effects. It may be related to a longer duration and enhanced intensity of the glutamate drive
from the pyramidal neurons of the infralimbic cortex after astrocytic transporter inhibition.
It can be due to a prolonged release of glutamate from the astrocytes enhancing the activa-
tion of multiple extrasynaptic and synaptic glutamate receptors on the infralimbic cortical
glutamate neurons to the dorsal raphe. The increased 5-HT release induced in the dorsal
raphe by the glutamate drive can also activate the 5-HT1A autoreceptor and contribute to
its down regulation in the serotonin neurons of the dorsal raphe increasing the duration
and enhancement of activity in the midbrain-limbic-cortical serotonin pathway [107].

These studies especially underline the impact of direct glutamate connections activat-
ing the dorsal raphe serotonin neuron from the infralimbic cortex to produce antidepressant-
like effects involving projections of the dorsal raphe neurons also into the ventral hippocam-
pus showing increased serotonin release. However, also locally activated postjunctional
5-HT1ARs in the infralimbic cortex play a role in mediating antidepressant actions of
locally given SSRI and inhibitors of astrocytic glutamate transport.

7.4. Selective Knockdown of Astrocytic Glutamate Transporters in the Infralimbic Cortex.
Depressive-Like Phenotypes in Mice

In contrast to the acute pharmacological blockade of astroglial glutamate transporters
above in the infralimbic cortex, a selective knockdown of these transporters in the same region
led to a depressive phenotype in mice [108]. These experiments, leading to a stronger activa-
tion of the descending glutamate pathway to the dorsal raphe and with a longer duration were
performed, since it was proposed that disturbances in the astrocytes of the ventral anterior
cingulate cortex (infralimbic cortex in rodents) together with increased energy metabolism
participate in producing major depressive disorder (MDD). Knockdown was produced by
microinjecting small interfering RNA, targeting the GLT-1 or BLAST astrocytic glutamate
transporters, into the infralimbic cortex [108]. Reductions in the number of glutamine syn-
thase and GFAP positive astrocytes were observed linked to the development of a depressive
phenotype. This state could be reversed by ketamine and SSRI.

The substantially increased glutamate drive to the dorsal raphe from the infralimbic
cortical region after knockdown of the astroglia glutamate transporters was demonstrated
in neurophysiological experiments on pyramidal neurons in layer V [109]. An increased
ﬁring rate of action potentials was observed together with membrane potentials that were
more depolarized. Spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents with elevated amplitude
and frequency were also found. However, this highly enhanced glutamate drive to the
dorsal raphe region led to a marked reduction of serotonin release in the dorsal raphe
that likely led to a strong inhibition of the activity in the meso-limbic-cortical serotonin
pathways globally innervating these regions [110]. The deﬁcit in serotonin transmission can
help explain the reductions of the BDNF that can explain the reduced structural and func-
tional plasticity found in MDD [108]. Of interest is also their observations of an increased
formation of early growth response protein 1 (Egr-1) in the activated infralimbic cortical
glutamate neurons to the dorsal raphe after the knockdown of the astroglial glutamate
transporter. This may directly improve GABAA receptor expression, composition, and
maintenance [111] in the dorsal raphe serotonin projection neurons upon Egr-1 release
from the activated infralimbic cortical glutamate neurons onto these serotonin neurons and
cause their enhanced inhibition. It can be a way to keep the balance of glutamate excitation
and GABA inhibition to reach a proper synaptic strength. However, in the current case a
pathological inhibition of the dorsal raphe serotonin neurons was obtained.

In addition, highly signiﬁcant studies [14,109,110] clearly indicates that the degree of
glutamate drive activation to the dorsal raphe induced by astrocyte glutamate transporter
inhibition or knockdown have a major impact on whether the dorsal raphe serotonin
neurons become activated or inhibited. In their exciting work they have pointed out
that an important factor is also whether the activated glutamate projection neurons from
the infralimbic cortex mainly target the local GABA neurons inhibiting the dorsal raphe
serotonin neurons causing a depressive phenotype or mainly directly activate the dorsal
raphe serotonin neurons with their rapid activation producing fast antidepressant actions.
This work has put the astrocytes and their interactions with serotonin neurons into a top
position in the ﬁeld of depression and its treatment together with serotonin and other types
of heteroreceptor complexes.

8. Conclusions and Future Work

The formation of heteroreceptor complexes in the brain appears to represent a funda-
mental integrative mechanism in the brain that can be disturbed in mental disease leading
to pathological disturbances in neuronal-astrocyte networks especially in the limbic system
and its connections with the lower brain stem. The focus of this review was on the 5-HT
heteroreceptor complexes and their role in major depression. There exist many types of
5-HT heteroreceptor complexes in the limbic system and highly relevant 5-HT1A autore-
ceptor complexes exist in the dorsal raphe neurons sending their axons into the forebrain
and diencephalon. It is concluded that 5-HT receptor subtypes physically interact not only
with other GPCRs such as DA receptor subtypes and Gal R subtypes but also with several

Cells 2021, 10, 1902

types of RTKs such as TrkB and FGFR1, allowing direct integrative interactions also in the
modulation of plasticity and neuroprotection that can involve also the astroglia. It is also
of high interest that Casarotto et al. [56] have demonstrated that antidepressant drugs can
directly bind to the TrkB receptors. Therefore, for the future it will be of interest to ﬁnd
out if the TrkB heteroreceptor complexes can be of special interest for understanding major
depression development involving the integration of 5-HTR and TrkB receptor signaling
through allosteric and phosphorylation/di-phosphorylation processes. In the future work
it will also be of high interest to further develop the work of Gasull-Camos et al. [104] on the
role of astrocytes in the control of glutamate activity in the infralimbic cortex modulating
the activity of the raphe-forebrain 5-HT neurons. This is also true for the work of Fullana
et al. [108] showing depression-like phenotype in mice after a selective knockdown of the
astrocytic glutamate transporter in the infralimbic cortex.
