Abstract: Because of the nature of their work, physical and occupational therapists are at high
risk of burnout, which is associated with decreased job satisfaction, medical errors, and mental
wellbeing in healthcare professionals. To well manage and minimize potential impact of burnout,
risk factors should be determined. This study examined burnout and job stress in physical and
occupational therapists in various Korean hospital settings. Physical and occupational therapists
from several rehabilitation facilities in South Korea completed a survey between March–May 2019.
A set of questionnaires, including the Maslach Burnout Inventory and Job Content Questionnaire,
were distributed to all participants. In total, 325 professionals (131 men and 194 women) were
recruited. Burnout and work-related stress diﬀered signiﬁcantly according to several factors. Hospital
size, gender, and age were the main contributory factors aﬀecting at least two dimensions of the
questionnaires. The more vulnerable group consisted of female therapists in their 20s at small- or
medium-sized hospitals with low scores for quality of life. High levels of job stress and burnout
were observed in female therapists in their 20s at small- or medium-sized hospitals. Hospitals
and society should create suitable environments and understand the nature of therapists’ work to
improve healthcare.

1. Introduction

Burnout is a state of physical and emotional exhaustion involving the development of both a
negative self-concept and a negative attitude toward one’s job. This concept was ﬁrst described in 1975
by Herbert Freudenberger, an American psychologist, who deﬁned it as follows: “Burnout” is “to fail,
wear out, or become exhausted by making excessive demands on energy, strength, or resources” [1].
Maslach and Jackson later described burnout syndrome in three major dimensions: emotional
exhaustion (EE), depersonalization (DP), and lower perception of personal achievement (PA) [2].

Emotional exhaustion refers to feelings of emotional overextension and being drained by others.
Depersonalization refers to a callous response towards the people receiving the service. Reduced
personal accomplishment refers to a decline in one’s feelings of competence and a reduction in
successful achievement in one’s work with people. Recently, job burnout is commonly referred to as a
negative psychological reaction caused by an increase in chronic work-related stress [3]. In general,
many factors may signiﬁcantly contribute to burnout, including reward, community, fairness, values,
and job–person incongruity [2,4].

Healthcare professionals have been described as particularly vulnerable to burnout [1,5]. Physical
and occupational therapists, among other healthcare personnel, are at high risk of burnout syndrome
because of the nature of their work. Therapists are in daily contact with the physical and psychological
pain of clients as they face various states of disability. This naturally triggers emotional responses
and may lead therapists to defend themselves by distancing themselves from relationships with their
patients [6]. As they spend the majority of the workday deeply involved with their patients, the therapy
they provide is emotionally, physically, and intellectually challenging [1,6–10].

In healthcare professionals, burnout has been associated with a lack of concentration [11], drug and
alcohol abuse, increased depression, and suicide [12], leading to poor quality of life [13]. In addition,
burnout can lead to high turnover resulting from decreased job satisfaction, which burdens other
team members [14–17]. Moreover, medical errors increase with burnout, which hinders the quality
of medical treatment [17,18]. Further, the loss of medical personnel due to burnout can lead to poor
medical quality and socioeconomic loss [19–21].

Various studies have been conducted to examine burnout syndrome in physical and occupational
therapists [18,22–24]. A study conducted by Corrado and colleagues conﬁrmed that physical therapists
are at a high risk of developing burnout syndrome. However, the total number of subjects was 118,
and the sample size was relatively small [23]. An article by Deckard and colleagues examined role
stress on physical therapists but also had ﬂaws in sampling size [18]. And a few existing studies have
explored burnout according to hospital characteristics. The working environment is expected to exert
a signiﬁcant eﬀect on the frequency and degree of burnout [25], and a multicenter study that can
conﬁrm the results according to the diﬀerence in hospital character is essential. In addition, because
of the recent social demand for rehabilitation, a growing number of hospitals employ both physical
and occupational therapists. However, previous studies included either physical or occupational
therapists [8–11,18,23].

To well manage and minimize the potential impact of burnout, it is important to understand
which groups are particularly vulnerable to burnout. And it is essential to investigate the risk factors
in ﬁnding vulnerable groups. Therefore, the current study aims to investigate the level of burnout and
job stress among physical and occupational therapists in Korea and identify which type of people are
vulnerable to burnout. To ﬁnd vulnerable groups, analysis of factors, such as hospital and personal
characteristics, has been conducted.

The following research questions were posed:

(a) What is the level of burnout and job stress among physical and occupational therapists?
(b) Which groups are particularly vulnerable to burnout?
(c) Which demographic or hospital characteristics are related to burnout?

By identifying the vulnerable groups, it could help to manage the group well with caution,
solve working environmental problems, and ultimately improve the overall quality of healthcare
provision in South Korea.

2. Materials and Methods

2.1. Sample

Subjects were recruited from 4 hospitals with over 100 beds and 5 hospitals with under 100 beds
in the Republic of Korea between March–May of 2019. The following inclusion criteria were adopted:

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2020, 17, 5001

3 of 16

therapists with a bachelor’s degree in physiotherapy or occupational therapy, and those in direct
contact with patients being under professional activity.

After visiting the rehabilitation unit of each hospital, the therapist who met the inclusion criteria
were asked for written consent to participate in the study, and a set of questionnaires was distributed.
Participants were asked to complete a brief, anonymous questionnaire, which was followed by
assessment. It contained items pertaining to general demographic characteristics, such as gender, age,
annual income, and job group. In addition, it included items regarding job characteristics, such as
hospital size, and personal health behaviors, such as smoking, drinking, exercise, and leisure time.

The job group was divided into two types: physical therapist and occupational therapist.
The physical therapists perform therapeutic exercises, such as lower extremity strengthening, range of
motion (ROM) exercise, gait training, trunk balance training, and manual therapy for musculoskeletal
injury. Occupational therapists conduct treatment programs to perform activities of daily living (ADL)
and perform upper extremity strength training, ROM exercise, dysphagia therapy, ADL training,
and cognitive rehabilitation.

Regarding hospital size, hospitals with more than 100 beds are classiﬁed as ‘general hospitals’
under the Korean medial law, many medical departments are often gathered, and various employee
welfare, including industrial accident insurance, is well guaranteed. On the other hand, in hospitals
with less than 100 beds, which are classiﬁed as ‘hospitals’, the number of departments is usually 1 or 2,
and employee welfare is often not as well guaranteed as that of large hospitals. Therefore, hospitals
were classiﬁed as large if they had ≥100 beds and as small- or medium-sized if they had <100 beds.
The duties of therapist were the same regardless of the size of the hospital.

Three hundred sixty-seven professionals who met the inclusion criteria were prepared, and 325
(131 men and 194 women) were analyzed, with the exception of 42 who refused to respond or the data
were unable to be analyzed due to poor responses.

2.2. Maslach Burnout Inventory

The Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) designed by Maslach and Jackson was used to measure
burnout [2,26] and consists of 22 items. Cronbach’s α was 0.76 when the questionnaire was designed
and 0.87 in the current study. The scale has three subscales, each of which measures a dimension of
burnout syndrome: Emotional Exhaustion (EE), Depersonalization (DP), and Personal Achievement
(PA). EE measures emotional exhaustion experienced at work (9 items); DP measures the presence
of negative attitudes and feelings toward the recipients of services (5 items), and PA measures the
presence of feelings of low accomplishment and professional failure (8 items). Cronbach’s α for each
subscale of EE, DP, and PA were 0.863, 0.688, and 0.811, respectively. All responses were provided
using a Likert scale ranging from 1 (totally disagree)–5 (totally agree). The scores for each subscale
were summed and divided by the number of items to obtain a mean score. Higher EE and DP scores
indicate high levels of burnout, while higher PA scores reﬂect low levels of burnout.

2.3. Job Content Questionnaire

The Job Content Questionnaire (JCQ) [27,28], which contains 22 items based on the job strain
model, was used to evaluate the risk of developing work-related stress.
It includes dimensions
regarding quantitative (1) psychological job demands (5 items); (2) decision latitude, including skill
discretion (6 items) and decision authority (3 items); and (3) social support including coworker (4 items)
and supervisor (4 items) support. Responses were provided using a 4-point Likert scale, ranging from 1
(strongly disagree)–4 (strongly agree). The item scores were summed and divided by the total number
of items to obtain a mean score. Higher scores indicate lower levels of job stress. In the current study,
Cronbach’s α for the scale was 0.79.

2.4. Short Form 36

The Short Form 36 (SF-36) was used to evaluate health-related quality of life (QOL) [29].
This scale has been shown to be a credible and reasonable instrument for measuring QOL [30].
Existing studies dealing with QOL in health care personnel used SF-36 [13,31,32], and it is considered
valid, reliable, comprehensive, brief, and potentially useful for individual patient applications [33].
Therefore, SF-36 was also used in this study. The questionnaire contains 8 itemized categories and
36 questions. The 8 categories are as follows: (1) physical functioning (e.g., walking or lifting), (2) role
function-physical (e.g., limitations in the ability to perform usual activities), (3) body pain (e.g., level of
body pain or discomfort), (4) general health perceptions (e.g., global evaluation of health), (5) vitality
(e.g., energy level or fatigue), (6) social functioning (e.g., impact of health or emotional problems on
social activities), (7) role function-emotional (e.g., impact of emotional problems on work or daily
activities), and (8) mental health (e.g., anxiety, depression, and a sense of psychological wellbeing).
The raw data from the 8 categories were converted into scores, categorically combined, and converted
to a scale ranging from 0–100 using the Rasch measurement model. Higher combined scores represent
better QOL. The ﬁrst 4 categories were grouped as the physical component summary, and the ﬁnal
4 categories were grouped as the mental component summary.

2.5. Data Analysis

Data were analyzed using open-source software R version 3.6.1 (R Foundation, Vienna, Austria).
To demonstrate distribution, frequency analysis was used for general and job characteristics.
And independent t-tests and ANOVA were used to compare job stress and burnout according
to various variables. After identifying vulnerable subgroups with severe burnout and high job stress
(in the previous analysis), SF-36 score was compared between the vulnerable group and the entire
sample through independent t-test.

2.6. Ethical Considerations

The protocol used in the study was approved by the institutional review board at the hospital
(IRB No. 2019-03-006-004). Participation was voluntary, and written consent was obtained from all
participants. All information was considered conﬁdential.

3. Results

3.1. Demographic Characteristics

Of the 325 participants, 194 (59.7%) were women, 178 (54.8%) were aged 20–29 years, 232 (71.4%)
were single, and 227 (69.8%) worked at small hospitals. Regarding job type, 216 (66.5%) and 109 (33.5%)
were physical and occupational therapists, respectively.

3.2. Burnout and Job Stress by Hospital Size

Participants’ burnout and job stress diﬀered signiﬁcantly according to hospital size (Table 1).
The mean JCQ score was 1.88 ± 0.27 for therapists working at hospitals with ≥100 beds and 1.80 ± 0.26 for
therapists working at hospitals <100 beds, indicating that therapists working at small- or medium-sized
hospitals showed higher levels of job stress relative to those working in large hospitals.

The mean EE score was 1.74 ± 0.67 at large hospitals and 2.07 ± 0.65 at small- or medium-sized
hospitals. DP scores in small- or medium-sized hospitals (1.38 ± 0.59) were higher relative to those in
large hospitals (0.98 ± 0.58). PA scores in small- or medium-sized hospitals (3.08 ± 0.06) were lower
relative to those in large hospitals (3.47 ± 0.51). In other words, therapists in small- or medium-sized
hospitals showed higher burnout levels relative to those of therapists in large hospitals for all three
MBI dimensions.

3.3. Groups Vulnerable to Burnout and Job Stress

To identify those vulnerable to burnout and job stress, changes in job stress according to various
variables besides hospital size were examined, as shown in Table 2. In hospitals with ≥100 beds,
job stress did not diﬀer signiﬁcantly according to these factors. However, in hospitals with <100 beds,
job stress levels diﬀered according to gender, annual salary, and religion, and stress levels were higher
in women, those with lower annual income, and those without religion.

The MBI subscale data for various variables are shown in Tables 3 and 4. In large hospitals,
PA scores in women were higher relative to those in men. With respect to age, participants in their
20s showed higher EE, DP, and PA scores relative to those of participants aged >30 years. Regarding
annual income, lower income was associated with higher EE and PA scores. Married therapists showed
lower DP and PA scores relative to those of single therapists. In addition, temporary employees
showed higher DP scores relative to regular workers, and those with no experience of leaving a job
showed higher EE and PA scores relative to those with this experience. PA scores diﬀered signiﬁcantly
according to educational level and religion. Therapists with <3 years of work experience showed the
highest PA scores.

At hospitals with <100 beds, gender, age, salary, educational level, marital status, job type, type of
employment, and years of experience aﬀected burnout levels (Table 4). Women showed higher EE
and DP scores relative to men. Regarding age, the EE score was higher, and PA score was lower in
participants in their 20s relative to those participants aged ≥30 years, indicating severe burnout. Lower
incomes were associated with higher EE, DP, and PA scores. Highly educated people tended to show
higher PA scores relative to those with lower educational levels, and single people showed higher EE
scores relative to married people. Physical therapists showed lower PA scores relative to occupational
therapists, and temporary workers showed higher DP scores relative to regular workers. EE scores
were highest in those with 3–6 years of work experience.

In summary, therapists in small- or medium-sized hospitals tended to show higher job stress and
burnout levels relative to those in large hospitals. In addition, women in their 20s were shown to
be particularly vulnerable to job stress and burnout. Hospital size, gender, and age exerted eﬀects
on more than one domain and were representative to some extent, although many other factors also
aﬀect burnout.

It is obvious that the vulnerable group has more job stress and burnout, but to quantitatively
compare the speciﬁc degree, their scores were compared to those of the overall sample (Figure 1).
Burnout for all three dimensions (EE, DP, and PA) and job stress was more severe in the vulnerable
group relative to the overall sample.

It is clear that the vulnerable group also have lower QOL, but to determine the speciﬁc extent, SF-36
was compared to those of the overall sample. As shown in Figure 2, scores for the four SF-36 domains,
physical functioning, general health perceptions, vitality, and mental health, were signiﬁcantly lower in
the vulnerable group relative to the overall sample. Physical component summary scores did not diﬀer
signiﬁcantly between the vulnerable group and the overall sample, while mental component summary
scores in the vulnerable group were lower relative to those in the overall sample. This result indicates
that the vulnerable group experienced not only high job stress and burnout levels but also poor QOL.

4. Discussion

This study revealed that female therapists in their 20s working at small- or medium-sized hospitals
are vulnerable to burnout and identiﬁed individual and work environment-related factors. The study

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2020, 17, x; doi:  www.mdpi.com/journal/ijerph At hospitals with <100 beds, gender, age, salary, educational level, marital status, job type, type of employment, and years of experience affected burnout levels (Table 4). Women showed higher EE and DP scores relative to men. Regarding age, the EE score was higher, and PA score was lower in participants in their 20s relative to those participants aged ≥30 years, indicating severe burnout. Lower incomes were associated with higher EE, DP, and PA scores. Highly educated people tended to show higher PA scores relative to those with lower educational levels, and single people showed higher EE scores relative to married people. Physical therapists showed lower PA scores relative to occupational therapists, and temporary workers showed higher DP scores relative to regular workers. EE scores were highest in those with 3–6 years of work experience.  In summary, therapists in small- or medium-sized hospitals tended to show higher job stress and burnout levels relative to those in large hospitals. In addition, women in their 20s were shown to be particularly vulnerable to job stress and burnout. Hospital size, gender, and age exerted effects on more than one domain and were representative to some extent, although many other factors also affect burnout. It is obvious that the vulnerable group has more job stress and burnout, but to quantitatively compare the specific degree, their scores were compared to those of the overall sample (Figure 1). Burnout for all three dimensions (EE, DP, and PA) and job stress was more severe in the vulnerable group relative to the overall sample.  Figure 1. Comparison of Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) and Job Content Questionnaire (JCQ) scores between vulnerable group and overall participants. *—p < 0.05. It is clear that the vulnerable group also have lower QOL, but to determine the specific extent, SF-36 was compared to those of the overall sample. As shown in Figure 2, scores for the four SF-36 domains, physical functioning, general health perceptions, vitality, and mental health, were significantly lower in the vulnerable group relative to the overall sample. Physical component summary scores did not differ significantly between the vulnerable group and the overall sample, while mental component summary scores in the vulnerable group were lower relative to those in the overall sample. This result indicates that the vulnerable group experienced not only high job stress and burnout levels but also poor QOL. Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2020, 17, x  2 of 18   Figure 2.

Discussion This study revealed that female therapists in their 20s working at small- or medium-sized hospitals are vulnerable to burnout and identified individual and work environment-related factors. The study by Lindqvist and colleagues (2015) reported that working in a large hospital induced greater stress [25], but the current study showed opposing results. The differences in job stress and burnout according to hospital size could have occurred because of differences in the hospitals’ working environments including the welfare system and patient groups encountered during work. Organizational factors also play a crucial role in the health professional’s burnout [34], and the difference in organizational culture according to the size of the hospital would also have an effect on the level of burnout. In addition, personal characteristics, such as pride at being part of a larger hospital, could have exerted effects. In this study, because each hospital had different characteristics (e.g., the proportions of men and women and ages of staff members), a multiple regression analysis was performed to calibrate the variables. Significant differences in job stress and DP and PA scores were observed, indicating that hospital size exerted independent effects on job stress and burnout. Differences in job stress and burnout according to gender in large hospitals were not as prominent as those reported in previous studies [35–37], and women’s PA scores were higher relative to those in men. In contrast, in small- or medium-sized hospitals, women’s job stress levels and EE and DP scores were higher relative to those of men. This finding could have occurred because issues, such as gender discrimination, in the work environment varied according to hospital size. Reflecting the current social trend, discrimination between men and women in terms of salary and promotion opportunities has declined in large, but not in small- or medium-sized hospitals [38,39]. As for the age classification, because of Korea’s short history of physical/occupational therapy, many therapists are young. There were 178 therapists in their 20s, 121 in their 30s, 26 in their 40s, and 26 in their 40s or 50s. Statistical limitations have arisen in classifying people in their 40s and 50s as independent groups, so this study divided them into two groups: 178 people under 30 years old, and 147 people over 30 years old. Regarding age, participants in their 20s showed higher EE scores relative to older participants, regardless of hospital size. On the other hand, in small- or medium sized hospitals, PA scores observed in therapists in their 20s were lower, relative to those of older participants, and the opposite was observed in large hospitals. The result for the small- or medium-sized hospitals is consistent with the findings of a study conducted by Coward, in which older age Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2020, 17, 5001

by Lindqvist and colleagues (2015) reported that working in a large hospital induced greater stress [25],
but the current study showed opposing results. The diﬀerences in job stress and burnout according
to hospital size could have occurred because of diﬀerences in the hospitals’ working environments
including the welfare system and patient groups encountered during work. Organizational factors also
play a crucial role in the health professional’s burnout [34], and the diﬀerence in organizational culture
according to the size of the hospital would also have an eﬀect on the level of burnout. In addition,
personal characteristics, such as pride at being part of a larger hospital, could have exerted eﬀects.
In this study, because each hospital had diﬀerent characteristics (e.g., the proportions of men and
women and ages of staﬀ members), a multiple regression analysis was performed to calibrate the
variables. Signiﬁcant diﬀerences in job stress and DP and PA scores were observed, indicating that
hospital size exerted independent eﬀects on job stress and burnout.

Diﬀerences in job stress and burnout according to gender in large hospitals were not as prominent
as those reported in previous studies [35–37], and women’s PA scores were higher relative to those in
men. In contrast, in small- or medium-sized hospitals, women’s job stress levels and EE and DP scores
were higher relative to those of men. This ﬁnding could have occurred because issues, such as gender
discrimination, in the work environment varied according to hospital size. Reﬂecting the current social
trend, discrimination between men and women in terms of salary and promotion opportunities has
declined in large, but not in small- or medium-sized hospitals [38,39].

As for the age classiﬁcation, because of Korea’s short history of physical/occupational therapy,
many therapists are young. There were 178 therapists in their 20s, 121 in their 30s, 26 in their 40s,
and 26 in their 40s or 50s. Statistical limitations have arisen in classifying people in their 40s and 50s
as independent groups, so this study divided them into two groups: 178 people under 30 years old,
and 147 people over 30 years old. Regarding age, participants in their 20s showed higher EE scores
relative to older participants, regardless of hospital size. On the other hand, in small- or medium sized
hospitals, PA scores observed in therapists in their 20s were lower, relative to those of older participants,
and the opposite was observed in large hospitals. The result for the small- or medium-sized hospitals
is consistent with the ﬁndings of a study conducted by Coward, in which older age was associated
with higher levels of job satisfaction [40]. This could be related to the skills required in the work.

Concerning diﬀerences in job stress and burnout according to salary at large hospitals, the annual
salary was investigated in Korean money, “won”, and 1 million won is currently worth between
800–900 US dollars. EE scores were highest in the group with an annual salary of <20 million won,
but this ﬁnding was limited statistically because this group included only four participants. In the
small- or medium-sized hospitals, EE and DP scores in the group with annual salaries of 20–30 million
won were the highest, and PA scores in the group with incomes of >50 million won were the lowest.
In general, lower pay was associated with greater risk of burnout. This ﬁnding is similar to those
reported in a study conducted by Lee [41], in which higher salaries were associated with higher
job satisfaction.

Temporary workers were found to have higher DP scores relative to regular workers, regardless of
hospital size. This ﬁnding could have occurred because of stable working patterns. According to
Seo [42], the fact that regular employees receive higher salaries relative to temporary workers, could also
have led to this result.

Comparing the vulnerable group and the overall sample revealed signiﬁcant diﬀerences not only
in job stress and burnout but also in QOL, which corresponded to the results of a previous study on
burnout and QOL [13].

This study found that female therapists in their twenties working in hospitals with less than 100 beds
are most vulnerable to burnout. In this regard, further evaluation at small- or medium-sized hospitals
is needed to ascertain whether members of the vulnerable group were being sexually discriminated
against, had welfare problems, or had excessive workload. In particular, it is necessary to check
whether discrimination in salary or promotion is present according to gender. By preventing gender
discrimination, or supplementing insuﬃcient welfare policies to vulnerable group, job satisfaction will

Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2020, 17, 5001

14 of 16

be enhanced and further quality of medical care can be improved. In addition, the government should
also provide ﬁnancial/institutional support to help small- and medium-sized hospitals manage the
burnout of therapists.

The current study was subject to a few limitations. First, although the measurement tools used in
the study were standardized, data were collected according to the self-reporting method. Therefore,
the risk of responder bias cannot be ruled out. Further, the study was cross-sectional and measured
factors related to job stress and burnout simultaneously. Several factors were found to be relevant,
but no causal relationships could be inferred. Further prospective research is required to identify
the causal relationships between these factors and job stress, burnout, and QOL. Diﬀerences in the
work environment, which is based on 100 beds, are caused by the Korean medical law, and since
the standards vary by country, there is a limit to the same application in other countries. However,
apart from the speciﬁc number of 100 beds, it would be more practical to think of it as a standard
for large hospitals, or small and medium hospitals that ﬁt each country’s situation. Lastly, in some
analyses, the sampling size was too small, which was statistically limited. For example, in hospitals
with more than 100 beds, the number of sample was too small when divided by salary, work type,
or assigned patient type. Further large-scale studies are needed in the future.

Recently, with growing number of elderly patients, more physical and occupational therapists
are working together in hospitals. And increasing burnout syndrome with the number of therapists
is emerging as a social problem. In this situation, the signiﬁcance of this study lies in the fact that
it examined job stress and burnout in both physical and occupational therapists at several hospitals
simultaneously and identiﬁed a vulnerable group of participants notwithstanding the above limitations.

5. Conclusions

Examination of the factors that inﬂuence job stress and burnout revealed that female therapists
in their 20s working at small- or medium-sized hospitals were at high risk of job stress and burnout.
To reduce this risk in vulnerable groups, it is necessary to understand the nature of the therapist’s
work, which inevitably increases the risk of job stress and burnout; reduce workloads; improve work
eﬃciency, and create suitable work environments. Moreover, the hospital and society should ensure
on-going support of emotional health and job satisfaction for health professionals. These eﬀorts could
help to reduce the risk to vulnerable therapists and improve healthcare provision.
