Mental illness and legal discrimination

Why do so many countries have a mental health act? 

What  is  it  about  mental  disorders  which  warrants 
that  people  who  suffer  from  them  be  subject  to  differ-
ent  laws  from  the  rest  of  society?  The  issues  of  stigma 
and discrimination against people with a mental disorder 
have moved up the agenda in many parts of the world. So 
why persist with a legal framework for the non-consensual 
medical treatment of those who are mentally ill which is 
different from that for those who are physically ill? 

In  2002,  in  a  court  judgement,  Dame  Elizabeth  Butler-

Sloss, one of the most senior judges in England, said: 

A  competent  patient  has  an  absolute  right  to  refuse  to 
consent  to  medical  treatment  for  any  reason,  rational  or 
irrational,  or  for  no  reason  at  all,  even  when  that  decision 
may lead to his or her death. (Re B (adult: refusal of medical 
treatment), 2002) 

But  she  was  wrong.  A  competent  adult,  in  England  and 
Wales, may be detained in hospital and forcibly treated, for a 
mental illness, against the patient’s capacitous wishes. 

The  law  in  England  and  Wales,  in  relation  to  an  adult 
with a physical illness, is set out in the Mental Capacity Act 
2005:
m  The  doctor,  or  other  health  professional,  must  gain  the 
consent of an adult patient, if that person retains decision-
making  capacity,  before  examining  or  carrying  out  any 
procedure  on  that  patient.  If  the  doctor  performs  a 
medical  procedure  without  the  patient’s  consent,  it  is  a 
criminal  assault  and  a  civil  trespass  (the  doctor  can  be 
charged with an offence by the police and sued for com-
pensation by the patient).

m  The  doctor  must  start  by  presuming  the  patient  has 

capacity, unless there is evidence to the contrary.

m  If  the  patient  lacks  capacity,  then  the  doctor  has  to  act 
in  the  patient’s  ‘best  interest’.  Lack  of  capacity  means 
the  patient  has  an  impairment  of,  or  a  disturbance  in 
the  functioning  of,  the  mind  or  brain  and  is  unable  to 
understand  the  information  relevant  to  the  decision,  to 
retain  that  information,  to  use  or  weigh  that  informa-
tion  as  part  of  the  process  of  making  the  decision,  or  is 
unable to communicate the decision, or fails to make the 
decision.

m  The lack of capacity is both time and decision specific.
m  In  determining  what  is  in  the  patient’s  ‘best  interest’, 
account must be taken of any previous wishes the patient 
has expressed, if known.

m  An  advance  decision  to  refuse  treatment,  made  by  the 
patient  when  capacitous,  must  be  honoured  (because  a 
capacitous  person’s  refusal  to  accept  treatment  must  be 
honoured).  Advance  requests  for  treatment  should  be 
given  due  consideration  but  are  not  binding  (because  a 
capacitous  person’s  request  for  treatment  does  not  place 
an obligation on the doctor).

m  Adults may, if they wish, give another adult the authority 
to consent to, or decline, future medical treatment should 
the patient lose the capacity to make the decision.

m  No matter what risks people may present to themselves or 
others,  they  cannot  normally  be  deprived  of  their  liberty 
unless  they  have  been  charged  with,  or  convicted  of,  a 
crime.  They  can  only  be  restrained  for  brief  periods  to 
prevent  imminent  serious  danger.  The  degree  of  any  re-
straint must be proportionate to the risks.
These  rules  exist  because  of  the  importance  attached  to 

the autonomy of the individual.

What are the equivalent provisions if the patient is given a 
diagnosis which sits in the ‘mental and behavioural disorders’ 
chapters  of  the  International  Classification  of  Diseases?  That 
is,  what  are  the  rules  for  the  non-consensual  detention  and 
treatment of a person with a mental illness? For England and 
Wales,  the  Mental  Health  Act  1983  says  that  a  person  may 
be detained if he or she: 

is suffering from mental disorder of a nature or degree which 
warrants the detention of the patient in a hospital for assess-
ment (or for assessment followed by medical treatment) for 
at least a limited period; and he ought to be so detained in 
the interests of his own health or safety or with a view to the 
protection of other persons.

There  is  no  suggestion  that  patients  should  be  unable  to 
make  the  decision  for  themselves.  It  is  solely  based  on  risk. 
In  relation  to  treatment  for  a  mental  disorder,  patients  can 
be forced to have treatment they do not want, because the 
doctors  think  it  is  in  their  best  interest,  even  when  patients 
say it is not and retain the capacity to make that decision and 
the only risk is to their own health. Advance refusals of treat-
ment are not honoured.

This,  as  explained  above,  is  not  permitted  in  relation  to 
treatment for physical illness. Oddly, it is the disorder that is 
to  be  treated  which  determines  whether  or  not  the  capaci-
tous adult retains autonomy, not the person’s mental state.

Imagine  two  people,  one  with  schizophrenia  and  one 
with  cancer.  In  both  cases  it  is  clear  that  they  are  able  to 
make  rational  judgements  about  their  treatment.  They  both 
recog nise that they are ill and that their illness can be treated 
and that there are consequences to not receiving treatment. 
In  the  case  of  the  former,  the  fact  that  he  has  capacity  has 
no  relevance  and  even  if  fully  capable  his  unwillingness  to 
consent  can  be  overridden.  In  the  case  of  the  latter,  it  is 
central, and for treatment to proceed without the consent of 
this person with capacity would be an assault. If the patient 
with  schizophrenia  also  has  cancer,  and  retains  decision-
making  capacity,  he  is  entitled  to  refuse  treatment  for  the 
cancer – but not for the schizophrenia.

The  Mental  Health  Act  for  England  and  Wales  is  perhaps 
unusual  in  taking  no  account  of  patients’  ability  to  make 
decisions  for  themselves.  The  equivalent  Scottish  act,  the

Mental  Health  (Care  and  Treatment)  (Scotland)  Act  2003, 
does require some impairment of decision making – ‘because 
of the mental disorder, the patient’s ability to make decisions 
about  the  provision  of  medical  treatment  is  significantly 
impaired’  –  but  does  not  require  that  the  person  lacks  the 
capacity  to  make  the  relevant  decision  in  the  way  that  is 
required for adults suffering from physical illnesses.

For  patients  in  both  jurisdictions,  total  control  of  the 
patient,  including  deprivation  of  liberty,  is  authorised  if  the 
criteria for detention are met. The authority is not limited to 
providing care and treatment solely in relation to the specific 
decision about which the patient is incapacitous.

The  Irish  Mental  Health  Act  2001  includes  a  similar  re-

quirement:

because of the severity of the illness, disability or dementia, 
the  judgment  of  the  person  concerned  is  so  impaired  that 
failure to admit the person to an approved centre would be 
likely to lead to a serious deterioration in his or her condition 
or  would  prevent  the  administration  of  appropriate  treat-
ment that could be given only by such admission. 

The Irish act also makes reference to ‘best interests’ but it is 
qualified: 

In  making  a  decision  under  this  Act  concerning  the  care 
or  treatment  of  a  person  (including  a  decision  to  make  an 
admission  order  in  relation  to  a  person),  the  best  interests 
of  the  person  shall  be  the  principal  consideration  with  due 
regard being given to the interests of other persons who may 
be at risk of serious harm if the decision is not made.

In  New  Zealand,  the  Mental  Health  (Compulsory  Assess-
ment  and  Treatment)  Act  1992  requires  that  the  disorder 
either causes a ‘serious danger to the health or safety of that 
person  or  of  others’  or  ‘seriously  diminishes  the  capacity  of 
that person to take care of himself or herself’. This is similar 
to  the  law  in  Queensland,  Australia  (Mental  Health  Act 
2000),  which  states  that  the  person  must  either  ‘lack  the 
capacity to consent to be treated for the illness’ or ‘has un-
reasonably refused proposed treatment for the illness’.

The  mental  health  acts  that  make  provision  for  compul-
sory treatment in the community tend to have a similar lack 
of  regard  for  patient  autonomy.  A  rare  exception  is  from 
Canada, where the criteria for a community treatment order  

set  out  in  Saskatchewan’s  Mental  Health  Services  Act  2006 
include the following:

The person is unable to understand and to make an informed 
decision  regarding  his  or  her  need  for  treatment,  care  or 
super vision as a result of the mental disorder. 

Ontario  has  a  similar  criterion:  the  person  ‘has  shown  or  is 
showing a lack of competence to care for himself or herself’ 
while living in the community,

It  is  not  only  nationally  that  the  legal  framework  for  the 
non-consensual  care  and  treatment  of  people  with  a  mental 
illness  differs  from  the  framework  that  applies  to  people 
who  are  physically  ill.  Article  5  of  the  European  Convention 
on  Human  Rights  (1950)  is  highly  discriminatory.  It  groups 
together  those  of  unsound  mind,  drug  addicts,  alcoholics 
and  vagrants,  as  people  who  may  legitimately  be  locked 
up,  without  any  requirement  that  they  have  committed  an 
offence or are incapable of making decisions for themselves, 
or even that they will personally benefit from the intervention.
The United Nations (UN) starts better with its Declaration 

of Human Rights (1948): 

Recognition  of  the  inherent  dignity  and  of  the  equal  and 
inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the 
foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world.

Unfortunately,  while  it  does  better  than  most,  it  fails  to 
maintain  this  high  ideal.  The  UN  Principles  for  the  Protec-
tion  of  Persons  with  Mental  Illness  and  the  Improvement 
of  Mental  Health  Care  (UN  General  Assembly  Resolution 
46/119  of  17  December  1991)  set  out  the  grounds  for 
compulsion: 
m  that, because of the mental illness, there is a serious likeli-
hood of immediate or imminent harm to that person or to 
other persons; or

m  that, in the case of a person whose mental illness is severe 
and  whose  judgement  is  impaired,  failure  to  admit  or 
retain that person is likely to lead to a serious deterioration 
in his or her condition or will prevent the giving of appro-
priate treatment that can be given only by admission to a 
mental  health  facility  in  accordance  with  the  principle  of 
the least restrictive alternative.
I return to where I started. Why? Why do people who are 
mentally  ill  need  a  different  legal  framework  for  their  non-
consensual care and treatment?

Reproductive risk to maternal mental health: 
international perspectives

Despite  the  emphasis  placed,  in  international  com-

parisons  of  obstetric  management,  on  the  perinatal 
mortality rate as a measure of excellence of care (or other-
wise),  there  has  been  relatively  little  discussion  of  the 
impact of birth on maternal mental health. When thinking 

about this issue, we need to consider both the mental state 
of the mother during the antenatal period as well as the 
subsequent  impact  of  the  birth  on  her  mood  and  risk  of 
major mental illness. According to the authors con tribut-
ing to the theme discussed here, that risk is much higher
