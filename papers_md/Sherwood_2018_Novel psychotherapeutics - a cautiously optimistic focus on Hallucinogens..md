1.  A Renewed Interest in Hallucinogens

Disrupted mental health affects up to 1 in 3 individuals globally and is an unmet medical 
challenge contributing to individual suffering as well as significant societal and economic 
burden.[1] In response to the stalled development of new drugs and a greater than ever need 
for novel therapies to treat psychiatric illness, the last two decades have seen renewed 
scientific and medical receptiveness to the idea of treating several mental disorders with 
drugs commonly known as hallucinogens.

“Hallucinogens,” in a general sense, define a vast and diverse set of molecules that elicit 
significant alteration in human consciousness by acting on targets in the central nervous 
system, temporarily rerouting synaptic transmission in the brain. Commonly accepted 
classes of hallucinogens include psychedelics, entactogens, dissociatives, and atypical 
hallucinogens that include deliriants, cannabinoids and kappa opioids. Each class possesses 
its own unique attributes and subclasses as well as some degree of overlap with regard to 
perceived effects, pharmacology and/or potential therapeutic utility.[2]

The therapeutic use of hallucinogens represents a potentially new paradigm in the way 
medicine understands and treats psychiatric illnesses. While the pharmacological diversity 
of hallucinogens is vast, a fascinating common phenomenon has been observed in their 
therapeutic utility: a single acute exposure to the hallucinogenic agent can elicit an 
immediate and lasting improvement in symptoms for the patient, an effect that persists long 
after the drug is metabolized and gone from the body.[3] This is in contrast to current 
pharmacotherapies used to treat mental disorders, such as SSRIs, which are based on a

therapeutic model that attempts to alleviate symptoms by re-equilibrating the steady-state 
levels of serotonin in the brain using a chronic dosing regimen of the drug.

The evolution of novel therapies to treat psychiatric conditions is inevitable as new tools and 
technologies contribute to our understanding of the intricate mechanics of the brain.[4] 
Unquestionably, the hallucinogen’s unique ability to perturb consciousness provides a 
compelling tool to help understand the connectivity of the brain in relation to the genesis of 
self-awareness and introspection. While the molecular pharmacology of most hallucinogens 
has been established, the complementary biological mechanisms responsible for their 
observed effects on the psyche are only beginning to be understood.[5] As more rigorous 
scientific data emerges from clinical research, combined with the availability of modern 
brain-imaging techniques, we are provided with newly generated insight into the mind.[6] 
This insight will provide a foundation and rationale for the way that we understand the brain, 
ultimately leading to the development of novel approaches to treating mental illness.

2.  Public Perception and Regulatory Troubles

A contemporaneous paradigm shift occurring alongside the renewed scientific and medical 
interest in hallucinogens is a change in perception by the public and by regulatory agencies. 
These changes include the approval of several Phase 3 clinical trials by the Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA), a variety of recent positive reports in mainstream news outlets, and 
the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA)’s willingness to work with researchers and 
clinicians to grant the appropriate legal authorizations to handle otherwise illegal 
compounds. All are examples of perceptions shifting away from the fears originally brought 
about by the association of hallucinogens with the complex cultural changes that occurred in 
the 1960’s and 70’s.

The cooperation of the law-enforcing entities such as the DEA is especially critical. Most of 
the hallucinogens being tested in the current FDA-approved clinical trials fall into the 
DEA’s Schedule I classification, which attempts to label drugs with high potential for abuse 
and having no medicinal value. Therein lies a significant challenge. How does a researcher 
study the medical utility of a drug that has been labeled medically useless and illegal? Once 
a compound has been declared Schedule I, it becomes increasingly onerous to obtain and 
handle legally, and researchers are often either unwilling or afraid to take the necessary steps 
to achieve access.

The scheduling rationale behind hallucinogens is especially challenging to comprehend in 
light of the less-restrictive classification of many other psychoactive drugs with medical 
utility and high abuse potential such as amphetamine. Given the emerging data 
demonstrating the medical safety and efficacy of several hallucinogens (outlined below), the 
support of federal regulatory and funding agencies will be imperative in increasing research 
into these potentially valuable medicines.

3.  Psilocybin, LSD, and Terminal Illness Diagnosis Distress

Psychedelics represent one of the more studied classes of hallucinogens in terms of 
pharmacology and potential clinical utility.[7] The effects produced by psychedelic drugs are

principally mediated through the serotonergic 5-HT1A/2A receptors, which are found widely 
in the central and peripheral nervous system, including the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, 
amygdala and raphe nucleus, and have been shown to modulate attention, working memory, 
and cognition/perception. The common effects reported by users of psychedelics include 
alterations of sensory perception, ego loss, and increased awareness of the present leading to 
sometimes-profound personal insight and even mystical experiences.[8] The individual’s 
state of mind and the set and the setting of the experience have been hypothesized to largely 
influence the magnitude of each aspect of the psychedelic drug’s effects, and guides with 
specialized training are typically present to facilitate the experience in a clinical setting.

Upon its serendipitous discovery in 1943 by the Swiss chemist Albert Hoffman, LSD 
became the prototypical psychedelic compound for clinical study in the 1950’s until the 
Controlled Substances Act brought a halt to research in 1970. Though the majority of 
contemporary psychedelic studies have avoided LSD due to its controversial reputation and 
relatively long duration of action, several recent small clinical studies have been conducted 
in Switzerland and the UK.[9] In particular, one double-blinded placebo-controlled pilot 
study aimed to understand the safety and efficacy of LSD for treating the anxiety associated 
with terminal illness diagnosis; the observed trends were promising and support further 
study in larger trials.[10]

With relatively similar effects to LSD and a shorter duration of action, the natural product 
psilocybin, a fungal tryptamine and also first characterized by Hoffman has recently been 
the focus of two expanded clinical trials aimed at addressing depression and anxiety in 
terminally ill cancer patients. The trials were designed around a coupled experience with the 
drug and psychiatric guidance. Phase 2 trials at Johns Hopkins University and New York 
University have been conducted under rigorous double-blinded placebo controlled 
conditions.[8, 11] In both studies, a majority of patients demonstrated both immediate 
improvements in self-reported measures of anxiety and depression and 60 – 80 % of patients 
exhibited clinically significant sustained decreases in depression and anxiety at 6-month 
follow-up visits. The outcomes have been described as “unprecedented” in psychiatry.[12] 
Follow-up multi-site Phase 3 clinical trials are currently being planned by the non-profit 
Heffter and Usona Research Institutes.

4.  MDMA and Severe Post-traumatic Stress Disorder

In the mid-1970’s, the experimental psychopharmacologist Alexander Shulgin first 
suggested the therapeutic potential of the prototypical entactogen, 3,4-
methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA).[13] Entactogens are characterized by their 
ability to induce openness and connection with others, and MDMA saw early esoteric 
clinical use as a tool in couples therapy. However, the increasing casual abuse of MDMA 
overshadowed its therapeutic potential in the eyes of lawmakers and by the late 1980’s 
MDMA was illegal in most countries. Despite its recreational reputation and some concerns 
about safety, mounting data has supported the clinical use of MDMA again, specifically as a 
psychotherapeutic tool for patients with severe post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD); in a 
single therapeutic session, it has been shown that MDMA can grant patients the ability to 
access and confront difficult traumatic memories, which has been hypothesized as a factor

contributing to the success of the trials.[14] In response to the positive outcomes in Phase 2 
clinical trials with MDMA for severe post-traumatic stress, the FDA has subsequently 
granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation to the non-profit Multidisciplinary Association 
for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS] to advance further studies. Preparation for Phase 3 trials is 
currently underway; these landmark trials represent, for first time, hallucinogen-assisted 
psychotherapy being evaluated for possible prescription use.

5.  Ketamine’s Unique Antidepressant Effect

Dissociatives are generally characterized by their ability to distort the user’s perception of 
sight and sound and to elicit illusions of detachment from the environment or one’s self. 
Ketamine is a dissociative anesthetic that was first synthesized in 1962 while in search of an 
anesthetic alternative to phencyclidine (PCP) that was devoid of PCP’s tendency to cause 
hallucinations and occasionally violent behavior. Ketamine likely achieves a dissociative 
effect by antagonizing the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor in addition to 
polypharmacology at other receptors in the CNS. Ketamine has been of particular interest in 
light of numerous controlled studies describing the compound’s rapid and relatively 
sustained (4–10 day) antidepressant effect.[15] While the aforementioned hallucinogens tend 
to involve an element of guidance, introspection and self-discovery associated with their 
positive clinical outcomes, ketamine may work through a less subjective, more 
biochemically driven “reset” type of mechanism.[16] Nevertheless, ketamine’s precise short-
term and long-term neurobiological effects are still not well understood and a possible 
pharmacological convergence with the therapeutic effects of psychedelics cannot be ruled 
out. Insight into ketamine’s mode of action will likely provide models by which to develop 
new antidepressants.[17] Once again, however, ketamine’s use as an antidepressant has been 
controversial, as it is also a Schedule III controlled substance due to its occasional 
recreational use.

6.  Concluding Remarks

The clinical and scientific consensus towards hallucinogens as novel psychotherapeutic 
agents has been generally optimistic; however, caution and due diligence must be observed 
if continued research is to occur. As the pendulum again swings in favor of studying and 
utilizing hallucinogens with the ultimate goal of benefiting society, a challenge to consider 
will be ensuring the absence of scientific and interpretive bias, especially given the 
recreational appeal of many of these substances. We must also be careful towards zealously 
viewing powerful psychoactive drugs as “silver bullets.” The future success of hallucinogen-
based therapies will depend first on the application of ethically sound and rigorous scientific 
methods towards the continued demonstration of significant clinical outcomes combined 
with rethinking how we perceive and regulate these compounds. While potential for the 
misuse of hallucinogens cannot be discounted, we must ultimately ask ourselves: could their 
medical benefit potentially outweigh the harm in facilitating the availability of these 
compounds to clinicians and researchers? If armed with irrefutable evidence of efficacy and 
safety, it will be up to motivated scientists and medical professionals to become politically 
vocal in seeking the necessary changes.
