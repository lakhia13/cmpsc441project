Abstract

Objective:  The capacity for understanding mental states (Reflective-Functioning; RF) is 
considered essential for self-growth, social learning and emotion regulation. Impaired RF is 
thought to play a central role in borderline personality disorder (BPD). We examined whether 
asking patients to consider mental states in-session has a down-regulatory effect on emotional 
arousal in treatments for BPD.

Method:  Early, middle and late phase videotaped sessions from a randomized-controlled trial of 
Transference-Focused Psychotherapy (TFP; n = 30), Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT; n = 29) 
and Supportive Psychodynamic Therapy (SPT; n = 29) were segmented to therapist and patient 
talk-turns. Therapist talk-turns were rated as asking patients to consider mental state (bids for RF) 
or not. Patient talk-turns were rated for RF and acoustically encoded for arousal.

Results:  Bids were twice as common in TFP compared to DBT and SPT. Across treatments, 
therapist bids for RF predicted better RF, which, in turn, predicted lower emotional arousal.

Conclusions:  Asking patients to consider mental states has a down-regulatory effect on patients’ 
arousal in psychotherapies for BPD.

Therapy; Supportive Psychodynamic Therapy; Reflective functioning

Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a severe and prevalent disorder characterized by 
instability in identity, emotion and interpersonal relationships (Skodol et al., 2002). Several 
specialized treatments are efficacious in reducing symptoms of BPD, but treatment effects 
tend to be moderate to small (Cristea et al., 2017). In addition, specialized treatments for 
BPD do not differ in their efficacy in reducing symptoms (e.g., Cristea et al., 2017) despite 
the different theorized mechanisms of action underlying these treatments (Clarkin & Levy, 
2006). Studying the unique and common processes of change in treatments of BPD may 
help shed light on the actual mechanisms underlying these treatments and may ultimately 
help improve their outcome.

The Role of Reflective Functioning in Treatments of BPD

Reflective functioning (RF) is an empirical operationalization of the concept of mentalizing 
– the ability to consider self- and other’s mental states. RF is one potential mechanism 
of change in treatments for BPD. The capacity for RF is postulated to be a fundamental 
and crucial human function. Inferring intentions through RF is hypothesized to be essential 
for social learning and self-organization and is assumed to be achieved through processing 
of interpersonal and emotional experiences (Fonagy, 2001). Understanding mental states 
makes the world and relationships with others more predictable and meaningful (Fonagy, 
Target, Steele, & Steele, 1998). It allows one to distinguish between appearance and reality, 
safely explore one’s environment, maintain close relationships, benefit from the social 
world, appropriately trust (or distrust) others, and effectively tolerate and manage distressing 
mental states and emotions (Fonagy, 2001). In support of the notion of RF as a fundamental 
human function, a recent comprehensive meta-analysis found that better capacity for RF 
predicts positive outcomes in a host of life domains (Kivity, Levy, Rosenstein, Johnson, & 
LeBreton, 2021).

Importantly, numerous studies suggest that the capacity for RF is impaired in individuals 
with BPD (see Fonagy & Luyten, 2009 for a review). These findings, along with theoretical 
considerations, led some authors to propose that change in RF is a presumed mechanism 
of change that is specific to psychodynamic therapies (Fonagy & Bateman, 2006; Levy 
et al., 2006a) while other authors propose that it is shared across various treatments for 
BPD (Bateman, Campbell, Luyten, & Fonagy, 2018). To our knowledge, the existing 
evidence suggest that Transference-Focused Psychotherapy (TFP; Yeomans, Clarkin, & 
Kernberg, 2015), a psychodynamic treatment for BPD, appears to be uniquely associated 
with increases in RF (Fischer-Kern et al., 2015; Levy et al., 2006b; Levy, Diamond, Clarkin, 
& Kernberg, in press) while other approaches do not show such increases (e.g., Möller, 
Karlgren, Sandell, Falkenström, & Philips, 2017).

These findings raise important questions regarding the active ingredients (i.e., therapist 
interventions) that underlie this specific increase in RF in TFP and the way this increase

unfolds over time. One recent study found that general conformity to principles of TFP 
(and not other principles) predicted increased RF in TFP but not in other treatments 
(Kivity et al., 2019). This finding suggests that some aspects of TFP indeed play a role 
in promoting increased RF. In light of these findings, an examination of specific ingredients 
of TFP has the potential to provide insights about the way these changes are brought about. 
Specifically, Levy et al. (2006a) proposed that one such mechanism is that TFP therapists 
tend to utilize interventions that ask patients to consider mental states (“bids” or appeals 
for RF), for example, by asking patients what they think went in other people’s mind 
when they interacted with them. These bids are hypothesized to increase the likelihood of 
patients engaging in RF and lead to increased capacity for RF. The increased RF is then 
hypothesized to promote increased psychological integration, leading to adaptive emotional 
processing, and ultimately lead to a reduction in BPD symptoms (Levy et al., 2006a). 
Such dynamic exchanges between therapist and patient unfold moment-by-moment within 
sessions. Therefore, microanalytic designs that tap into moment-by-moment processes of 
change are essential for capturing these dynamics.

In a recent study, Möller et al. (2017) utilized such a microanalytic design to examine 
in-session RF during mentalization-based treatment (MBT) for patients with BPD and 
comorbid substance abuse disorder (n = 5). Individual therapist and patient talk-turns were 
coded for use of bids and for RF, respectively. The findings showed that therapist use of bids 
predicted better RF in the talk-turn that followed the bid. This important finding provides 
preliminary support to the notion that therapist bids for RF may explain increases in RF in 
treatments for BPD. However, the lack of a control group and the small sample size in the 
study limit the generalizability of the finding.

Another gap in the empirical literature on RF in psychotherapy is related to the emotion-
regulatory role of RF. Many of the positive benefits associated with RF are assumed to be 
mediated by its role in processing emotional experiences and in tolerating and managing 
distressing emotions (Fonagy, 2001; Fonagy et al., 1998). However, to our knowledge, 
the emotion-regulatory role of RF in psychotherapy has yet to be examined. Such a role 
seems highly relevant to BPD, which is often characterized with high levels of negative 
emotions and with impairments in emotion regulation (Dixon-Gordon, Peters, Fertuck, 
& Yen, 2016). One way to operationalize this emotion regulatory role is to examine if 
higher quality RF predicts lower emotional arousal. A process in which a therapist bid 
predicts better patient RF which, in turn, predicts lower patient emotional arousal would 
suggest that stimulating in-session RF might play a role in in-session emotional processing. 
Vocally-encoded arousal is one promising measure of emotional arousal that may be well 
suited for this purpose. Vocal pitch as measured by fundamental frequency (f0) may serve 
as a proxy for emotional arousal because higher vocal pitch is correlated with higher 
self-reported and psychophysiological arousal (e.g., Baucom et al, 2012). f0 is an especially 
promising measure because it is simple to apply, unobtrusive, objective (i.e., does not 
involve subjective self- or observer-ratings) and is clinically relevant (clinicians are often 
attuned to fluctuations in vocal pitch and intonations). Indeed, f0 has been successfully 
applied to psychotherapy sessions in previous studies showing meaningful associations 
with indices of emotional processing (Diamond, Rochman, & Amir, 2010; Imel et al., 
2014). Thus, utilizing intensive measurements of therapist bid and patient RF quality in

conjunction with vocally encoded arousal may provide a cutting-edge examination of the 
emotion-regulatory role of RF in psychotherapies for BPD.

The Current Study

The current study is an investigation of the role of in-session RF in a previously completed 
randomized controlled trial (RCT) of TFP, Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT; Linehan, 
1993) and Supportive Psychodynamic Therapy (SPT; Appelbaum, 2007) for BPD. RCTs 
provide an excellent opportunity for research on unique and common processes because the 
random assignment of patients to treatment conditions reduces possible confounds related to 
differences in sample characteristics. Of note, TFP and DBT are two empirically supported 
(American Psychological Association Division 12, n.d.) and among the most utilized 
treatment models of BPD (Sansone, Kay, & Anderson, 2013). TFP is a psychodynamic 
treatment for BPD that focuses on the patient’s disparate representations of themselves and 
others as they are expressed in the here and now in the relationship with the therapist 
(Yeomans et al., 2015). In TFP, BPD is conceptualized as a result of unintegrated and 
undifferentiated self/other representations (i.e., undifferentiated negative representations 
that are split off from positive ones). Accordingly, the integration of these split off 
representations is a presumed principal change mechanism in TFP and it is achieved through 
increased reflection regarding the disparate aspects of the patient’s experience of self and 
other (Levy et al., 2006a; Yeomans et al., 2015).

DBT is a cognitive-behavioral approach that draws from Buddhist and Dialectical 
philosophies (Linehan, 1993). It includes four modes of treatment: individual treatment, 
skills training group, phone coaching for patients, and a consultation team for therapists. 
DBT balances cognitive and behavioral change strategies with acceptance- and validation-
based strategies with the goal of building a life worth living (Linehan, 1993). BPD is 
conceptualized as a result of biological tendencies toward impulsivity and high emotional 
sensitivity that are amplified by an invalidating family environment. These risk factors, 
and the negative consequences associated with them, are presumed to lead to core emotion 
dysregulation and impairments in behavioral control (Lynch, Chapman, Rosenthal, Kuo 
& Linehan, 2006). DBT promotes emotion regulation by reducing maladaptive action 
tendencies that are associated with intense emotions and by learning how to effectively 
manage interpersonal conflicts. This, in turn, is achieved through several skills that patients 
acquire through four skills-training modules (mindfulness, distress tolerance, interpersonal 
effectiveness, and emotion regulation).

SPT is another approach to the treatment of BPD that has shown preliminary efficacy 
(Clarkin, Levy, Lenzenweger, & Kernberg, 2007; reviewed below). It focuses on replacing 
self-destructive behaviors with verbal expression of conflicts through a healthy collaborative 
relationship with a therapist, whose reflective capacities serve as a model for the patient. 
Supportive techniques are utilized to promote identity consolidation, and to increase the 
patient’s sense of agency and mastery of impulses and emotions. These techniques may 
include describing significant aspects of the patient’s self, providing emotional support, 
reassurance, advice, and direct environmental intervention alongside alliance fostering and 
enhancement of reflective abilities and identification of defensive processes.

The increased RF is presumed to play a central role in the process of change in the TFP 
model (Levy et al., 2006a) and, to a lesser extent, in the SPT model as well. In contrast, 
RF is not assumed to play a major role in the DBT model (Lynch et al, 2006). Indeed, a 
previous study of data drawn from this RCT, showed that RF, as measured during attachment 
interviews at pre- and post-treatment, increased only during TFP but not during DBT or SPT 
(Levy et al., 2006b).

Thus, the current study builds on these findings to examine in-session RF and its emotion-
regulatory role. Up to three videotaped sessions per patient, representing early, middle and 
late phases of treatments, were segmented to talk turns. Then, talk turns were coded for 
therapist use of bids, patient RF quality, and patient vocally encoded arousal in order to 
examine the following hypotheses.

Group differences and changes in study variables during treatment (Hypothesis 1).

Hypothesis 1a: Given the role bids for reflection play in TFP, we hypothesized that use 
of bids will be higher in TFP compared to DBT and SPT, especially in the middle phase 
which represents the working phase of treatment. Hypothesis 1b: similarly and consistent 
with previous findings (Fischer-Kern et al., 2015; Levy et al., 2006b; Levy et al., in press), 
we hypothesized that RF quality will increase during TFP but not during DBT and SPT. 
Research Question 1c: changes in vocally encoded arousal were examined without a specific 
a-priori hypothesis1.

Within session-analyses: the emotion regulatory role of RF (Hypothesis 2).

Hypothesis 2a: across treatments, therapist bids will predict better patient RF immediately 
following the bid, which, in turn, will predict lower arousal. Hypothesis 2b: the emotion 
regulatory effect of RF would increase during treatment, and especially during TFP.

Method

Participants

We report how we determined our sample size, all data exclusions (if any), all 
manipulations, and all measures in the study. The current study was not preregistered.

Data were drawn from a previously completed RCT of three treatments for BPD. For a fuller 
description of the trial, see Clarkin et al. (2007) and Levy et al. (2006b). Participants from 
the New York City Metropolitan area were referred mostly by mental health professionals. 
Participants were 90 patients who met DSM-IV (American Psychiatric Association, 1994) 
criteria for primary BPD. Patients with comorbid schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, 
bipolar I disorder, delusional disorder, and/or delirium, dementia, and amnesia and other 
cognitive disorders were excluded because of the influence of brain pathology and thought 
disorder on the ability to provide meaningful self-report data and complicated response 
to treatment. Written informed consent was obtained after all study procedures had 

1Although we did not have an a-priori directional hypothesis regarding change in vocally encoded arousal, we later became aware 
of studies showing a decrease in arousal during psychotherapy (e.g., Baucom et al., 2015). In light of these studies, a directional 
hypothesis might have been more appropriate. We thank an anonymous reviewer for pointing out this literature.

been explained, including agreement to have all assessments and psychotherapy sessions 
videotaped. The study was approved by the human participant institutional review board. 
Of the 90 patients, 88 patients had at least one videotaped individual session available for 
inclusion in the current study. Participants were randomized to one of the three treatment 
conditions for a no cost 1-year outpatient treatment. The final sample consisted of 30 TFP, 
29 DBT, and 29 SPT patients. The mean age was 31 (Range: 19–52, SD = 7.9) and the 
sample was predominantly women (93%), Caucasian (68%), unmarried (91%) and educated 
(58% completed college). The three groups did not differ on any of the demographic 
variables (ps > .05).

Treatments and Therapists

Transference-Focused Psychotherapy (TFP; Yeomans et al., 2015).—A modified 
manualized psychodynamic treatment for BPD. Its primary goal is to reduce symptoms and 
self-destructive behavior through the modification of representations of self and others as 
they manifest in the treatment. The primary focus is on the predominant affectively-charged 
themes that emerge in the relationship between patients and therapists in sessions.

Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT; Linehan, 1993).—DBT is a manualized 
cognitive-behavioral treatment with four modes of treatment: (a) individual therapy, (b) 
group skills training, (c) phone coaching for patients, and (d) consultation teams for 
therapists. The primary technique in the individual treatment mode is maintaining a balance 
of validation and change strategies with the goal of creating a life worth living. The 
individual treatment focuses on a hierarchy of target behaviors, which the patient tracks 
daily, often with the use of diary cards. Behavioral analyses of the pattern and chain of 
thoughts, emotions, and events resulting in suicidal and self-mutilating acts take place 
routinely to help the patient identify triggers and alternative strategies for coping. In 
addition, in the group skills training, patients acquire coping skills for reducing maladaptive 
action tendencies through four modules (mindfulness, distress tolerance, interpersonal 
effectiveness, and emotion regulation). In the individual treatment, therapist and patient 
address obstacles in implementing these skills.

Supportive Psychodynamic Therapy (SPT; Appelbaum, 2007).—SPT is a 
psychodynamically-oriented treatment for BPD with the primary goal of supporting the 
patient’s adaptive functioning, that is, to bring about changes by developing a healthy 
collaborative relationship with the therapist and replacing self-destructive enactments with 
verbal expression of conflicts. Change is assumed to occur by the patient using the 
therapist’s capacity for reflection as a model, as opposed to TFP in which interpretation 
is used to achieve these goals. SPT utilizes supportive techniques, such as describing 
significant aspects of the patient’s self in order to encourage greater integration of identity, 
promoting the patient’s sense of agency and self-regulation, and encouraging socially 
acceptable ways of expressing impulses (such as exercise or creative expression). Emotional 
support, reassurance, advice, and direct environmental intervention are provided alongside 
alliance fostering and enhancement of reflection and identification of defensive processes.

Procedure

Measures

Therapists in each of the three treatment conditions were selected based on prior 
demonstration of competence in their respective treatment and after being judged by cell 
leaders to be adherent to and competent in their respective manual. All TFP, DBT, and 
SPT therapists were experienced with patients with BPD and in their respective modality. 
All treatments were supervised weekly by experts to ensure adherence and competence. 
Throughout the study, all therapists regularly videotaped their sessions and were supervised 
in a group on a weekly basis. In the subset of 88 patients in the current study, TFP was 
delivered by 8 therapists that treated an average of 3.75 patients (SD = 2.25, range: 1 – 7), 
DBT was delivered by 4 therapists that treated an average of 7.25 patients (SD = 2.99, range: 
3 – 10), and SPT was delivered by 7 therapists that treated an average of 4.14 patients (SD = 
0.69, range: 3 – 5).

For in-session process coding, three sessions were identified for each patient, representing 
three phases of treatment: early (four months into treatment), middle (eight months) and 
late (twelve months). These specific timepoints were selected for several reasons. First, we 
wanted to obtain data that would be most representative of the entire course of treatment. 
Four months were chosen as the earliest session because they were enough time into the 
treatment for the sessions to be representative of the working phase of the treatments, and 
at the same time not too late for disentangling process from outcome (i.e., process of late 
sessions may be a reflection of how successful the outcome of the treatment is). Finally, 
for future process-outcome analyses, we selected timepoints that corresponded with the 
four-, eight- and twelve-months outcome assessments. Overall, 205 recordings of individual 
therapy (DBT group skills training sessions were not coded) were available for coding: 
eighty-eight from the early phase, 63 from the middle phase, and 54 from the late phase of 
treatment. Missing sessions were either due to drop out or sessions not being recorded.

Prior to coding, sessions were segmented into therapist and patient talk-turns. Talk-turns 
included all the utterances a speaker made from a beginning of the talk-turn to the transition 
of the turn to the other speaker. Segmentation was done by research assistants using 
oTranscribe software (https://otranscribe.com/) by inserting time stamps at the beginning 
of each talk-turn and noting whether the speaker was the therapist or the patient. These time 
stamps were used to make sure that each of the process measures are applied to the exact 
same talk-turns.

Therapist Bids for Reflection (Möller et al., 2017).—Each therapist talk-turn was 
classified as either asking the patient to consider mental states directly or indirectly (“bid 
for reflection”) or not (“non-bid”). As Möller et al. (2017) mention, an example of a bid 
would be “why do you think your boyfriend said that?” whereas an example of a non-bid 
would be “tell me more about what you did around that time”. Coding was done by four 
undergraduate research assistants that were trained to reliability by the first author on a 
separate sample of patients with BPD (Clarkin et al., 2001). Coders met weekly with the first 
author to discuss ratings in order to maintain reliability and avoid rater drift. Coders were 
blind to study hypotheses, the treatment approach and timing of the session. A subset of

20 sessions were coded by two coders for inter-rater reliability calculations. At the session 
level, inter-rater reliability of the percent of bids at each session was calculated using a 
generalizability coefficient for designs in which raters and ratees are neither fully crossed 
nor nested (Putka, Le, McCloy, & Diaz, 2008). The Intra-Class Correlation (ICC)-like 
coefficient was .84. At the statement (within-session) level, absolute agreement was 86% on 
average with an average Kappa of .55 across sessions. The lower reliability at the within- 
compared to the between-session level could be due to a restricted range of scores at 
the within-session level, which has an attenuating effect on inter-rater reliability estimates 
(LeBreton, Burgess, Kaiser, Atchley, & James, 2003; J. LeBreton, personal communication, 
March 12, 2021).

Reflective-Functioning Scale (Fonagy et al., 1998).—An 11-point scale that 
evaluates the quality of RF. The scale has been mostly applied to the Adult Attachment 
Interview (AAI; George, Kaplan, & Main, 1985). We applied the scale to individual 
patient talk-turns following previous studies (e.g., Möller et al., 2017). The scale ranges 
from –1 (negative reflective-functioning, overly concrete, totally barren of reflection, or 
grossly distorting of the mental states of others) to 9 (exceptional reflective-functioning, 
unusually complex, elaborate, or original reasoning about mental states). In addition to 
coding individual talk-turns, coders also assigned a global score for each session using 
similar guidelines that are detailed in the manual. Coders were four graduate students (i.e., 
not the same coders that coded bids for RF) and the first author that were trained by the 
second author and have passed a reliability test by the Anna Freud Center. Every effort 
was made to keep coders blind to the treatment approach and timing of the session. The 
graduate student coders, who performed most of the coding (86%) were also blind to study 
hypotheses. Coders met weekly with the first author to discuss ratings in order to maintain 
reliability and avoid rater drift. A subset of 20 sessions were coded by two coders for 
inter-rater reliability calculations. At the session level, the ICC-like coefficient (Putka et al., 
2008) for global RF scores was .81. In addition, the global scores of the 4-month session 
correlated positively (r = .34, p = .008, n = 60) with reflective-functioning scores that were 
coded from AAI interviews at pre-treatment (Levy et al., 2006b). At the statement level, 
the average ICC across sessions was .62. Similar to the measurement of bids, the lower 
reliability at the within- compared to the between-session level could be due to a restricted 
range of scores at the within-session level (LeBreton et al., 2003; J. LeBreton, personal 
communication, March 12, 2021).

Vocally Encoded Arousal.—Vocal pitch as measured by fundamental frequency (f0) 
served as a measure of emotional arousal. Higher levels of f0 are indicative of higher 
pitch and therefore, higher psychophysiological arousal. f0 has been successfully applied to 
psychotherapy sessions in previous studies showing meaningful correlations with indices of 
emotional processing (Diamond, Rochman, & Amir, 2010; Imel et al., 2014). First, research 
assistants cleaned each recording by silencing background noises and overlapping speech. 
For each patient talk-turn, f0 was extracted every 0.25 s using Praat speech signal processing 
software, with a band-pass filter of 75 to 350 Hz (typical values for human speech; Boersma 
& Weenink, 2019). The talk-turn f0 was calculated as the median of all measurements in the 
talk-turn.

Data Analytic Approach

Page 9

Session level Analyses: Changes in study variables during treatment 
(Hypothesis 1).—Data were analyzed using linear multi-level models implemented in 
R version 3.4.3, package ‘nlme’ (Pinheiro, Bates, DebRoy, & Sarkar, 2016). These models 
account for the multilevel structure of the data (talk-turns repeated within sessions, repeated 
within patients) while using all available observations, thus providing full intent-to-treat 
estimates. Analyses that included therapists as an additional level, showed that the therapist 
effect on RF was negligible and non-significant (ICC = .00). Therapist effects on bids 
(ICC = .44) and arousal (ICC = .14) were not negligible but the inclusion of the therapist 
level did not change the results of these models. Because of that, and because three- and 
four-level models are difficult to interpret, we only report models that did not include the 
therapist level. Analyses were adjusted for repeated measures with restricted maximum 
likelihood estimation method and random intercepts and slopes at the patient level. Diagonal 
covariance structure was modeled at the patient level and the covariance structure at the 
session and talk-turn levels (first-order autoregressive, diagonal, or identity) was determined 
using model fit and deviance tests.

To examine changes in bids for RF, we used the proportion of bids out of the total number 
of talk-turns in each session as a dependent variable in a two-level model (sessions repeated 
within patients). Timepoint (early, middle and late phases of treatment) was included as a 
level 1 predictor, treatment group (TFP, DBT, or SPT) was included as a level 2 predictor, 
and group × timepoint as a cross-level interaction term. Timepoint was centered around the 
early phase session so intercepts represent estimated proportion of bids at that session, while 
slopes represent estimated change in proportion of bids between timepoints.

To examine changes in RF and arousal, we fitted three-level models (talk-turns repeated 
within sessions repeated within patients). Timepoint (early, middle and late phases of 
treatment) was included as a level 2 predictor, treatment arm (Group: TFP, DBT, or SPT) 
was included as a level 3 predictor, and group × timepoint as a cross-level interaction term. 
Timepoint was centered around the early phase session so intercepts represent estimated 
RF/arousal at that session, while slopes represent estimated change in RF/arousal between 
timepoints.

Within-session analyses: The emotion regulatory role of RF (Hypothesis 2).
—The proposed within-session model was fitted using the dynamic structural equation 
modeling (DSEM) module in Mplus, version 8.1 (Hamaker, Asparouhov, Brose, Schmiedek, 
& Muthén, 2018; Muthén & Muthén, 2017). Full description of these analyses is included 
in supplemental material, section 2. The dataset was structured such that each talk-turn 
consisted of a therapist intervention (classified as either a bid or a non-bid) and the patient 
response that immediately followed the therapist intervention and was coded for RF and 
arousal (see Figure 1, top panel, for an illustration). Thus, by design, within each talk-turn, 
therapist interventions preceded patient responses. Then, a model was fitted that examined 
all possible associations between the three in-session process variables (therapist bids, 
patient RF, patient arousal), both concurrently (within a talk-turn) and in a cross-lagged 
manner. Given the structure of the data, we were mainly interested in the associations within

talk-turns. However, modeling the cross-lagged associations allows to take into account the 
state of affairs in the previous talk-turn in a dynamic manner.

To test the hypothesis that bids will be associated with better RF which, in turn, will be 
associated with lower arousal we examined a mediation model (Figure 1, bottom panel). 
We estimated the path from bids to RF immediately following the bid (called the a path in 
the mediation literature) and the path from RF to arousal at the same talk-turn (called the b 
path). The a×b term was then estimated as a measure of the indirect effect. Our hypotheses 
was that better RF should have a down-regulatory effect on arousal as it occurs in the 
moment. We therefore focused on the path from RF to arousal at the same talk turn and not 
in a lag. In addition, by design, RF at a given talk-turn and arousal at the subsequent talk-
turn are separated by a therapist bid and therefore, examining the cross-lagged association 
in the mediation model would not allow to disentangle the effect of previous RF and the 
therapist bid on arousal.

The model was first examined on all three sessions combined. To examine changes over 
time in the indirect path, we analyzed person-specific estimates of the indirect path using 
multilevel modeling using the approach that was taken to examine changes in study level 
variables.

Finally, to strengthen the validity of our hypothesized model, we also tested a competing 
model. We examined whether lower arousal predicts better RF rather than the other way 
around (e.g., whether being less emotionally aroused allows patients to better utilize RF). To 
examine this, we tested the indirect effect of bids on better RF through lower arousal.

The data and study materials are not available as they include personally identifiable 
information. The data analysis code is available upon request from the first author.

Results

Descriptive Statistics

The final dataset in the current study included 88 patients and 205 sessions (59 sessions 
were not available for coding due to patient dropout or missing recordings). In total, those 
sessions included 17,973 therapist-patient talk-turns (each consisting of a therapist statement 
and a subsequent patient statement), and 2,232,333 observations of vocal data (that were 
aggregate using the median of each statement). TFP had less talk-turns per session (M = 
65.84, SD = 32.40) compared to DBT (M = 102.21, SD = 39.22; t108 = 5.67, p < .001) and 
SPT (M = 98.31, SD = 32.95; t146 = 6.05, p < .001), which did not differ from one another 
(t109 = 0.60, p = .55).

Session Level Analyses: Changes in Study Variables during Treatment

Session-level means, and standard deviations for therapist bids (ratio of bids out of all talk 
turns in the session), patient RF following a bid, patient RF following a non-bid, and patient 
vocally encoded arousal (f0) are reported in Table 1, separately for group and timepoint.

Change in therapist bids for RF.—A multilevel model examined the effect of time 
(early, mid- and late- therapy) and treatment group on the ratio of therapist bids for RF per 
session. The results showed a significant main effect of group (F(2, 85) = 37.16, p < .001) 
such that TFP therapists had a higher ratio of bids (M = .35, SD = .15) than DBT therapists 
(M = .17, SD = .07; F(1, 109) = 52.16, p < .001) and SPT therapists (M = .17, SD = .08; 
F(1, 109) = 56.32, p < .001). DBT and SPT therapists did not differ from one another (F(1, 109) 
= 0.10, p = .76). Thus, TFP therapists made bids for RF in 35% of their interventions while 
DBT and SPT therapists showed half the ratio of bids (17%) compared to TFP. In addition, 
no significant effects emerged for time (F(2, 111) = 2.04, p = .13) and time × group (F(2, 111) 
= 0.63, p = .64) which means that the ratio of bids did not change during treatment in any of 
the groups.

Change in patient in-session RF.—As Table 1 shows, on average, patient RF tended to 
be rather low in all treatments and timepoints (average scores were around 2 while scores 
of 3 are considered questionable or low RF according to the RF scale). A multilevel model 
examined the effect of time and treatment group on RF. No significant effects emerged for 
group (F(2, 85) = 1.27, p = .29), time (F(2, 111) = 1.30, p = .28) and time × group (F(2, 111) = 
0.42, p = .79). Thus, no changes in RF were observed during any of the treatments.

Change in patient vocally encoded arousal.—A multilevel model examined the 
effect of time and treatment group on patient arousal. The results showed a significant main 
effect of group (F(2, 85) = 3.66, p = .03) such that patients in TFP had lower arousal (M = 
165.77, SD = 22.67) compared to patients in SPT (M = 183.32, SD = 25.10; F(1, 109) = 7.10, 
p = .009). Patients in DBT (M = 177.20, SD = 32.17) did not differ from patients in TFP 
(F(1, 109) = 2.84, p = .09) or from patients in SPT (F(1, 109) = 0.81, p = .37). No significant 
effects emerged for time (F(2, 111) = 2.20, p = .12) and time × group (F(2, 111) = 1.89, p = .12) 
which means that arousal did not change during treatment in any of the groups.

Within-Session Analyses: The Emotion Regulatory Role of RF

Figure 1 shows the structure of the within-session data (top panel) and the hypothesized 
mediation model (bottom panel). The SEM fitted to test the study hypotheses across all 
three sessions is displayed in Figure 2. It is important to note that the model was fitted 
and applies to all available talk-turns in each session, but only two adjacent talk-turns are 
presented for ease of interpretation. All model paths express the effect of that path while 
taking into account all other paths in the model. Unstandardized estimates (denoted b) 
represent the expected change in the outcome variable that is associated with a one-point 
increase in the predictor. Standardized estimates (denoted β) represent the expected change 
in standard deviations in the outcome variable that is associated with an increase of one 
standard deviation in the predictor.

The emotion regulatory role of RF.—Consistent with our hypotheses, across sessions, 
we found that bids predicted better RF immediately following the bid (b = 0.17 [0.12, 0.22], 
p < .001, β = .15 [.12, .17]). This means that patient RF tended to be 0.17 points higher on 
talk-turns that were preceded by a therapist bid than on talk-turns that were preceded by a 
non-bid. In addition, better RF predicted lower vocally encoded arousal at the same talk turn

(b = −0.94 [−1.29, −0.59], p < .001, β = −.05 [−.07, −.04]). Importantly, the indirect effect of 
therapist bids on patient vocally encoded arousal through better patient RF was significant (b 
= −0.15 [−0.24, −0.08], p < .001). Therefore, an emotion regulatory effect RF was observed 
such that use of bids predicted better patient RF which, in turn, predicted lower emotional 
arousal.

Additional paths in the model.—In addition to findings above, additional paths 
emerged as significant in the model. All autoregressive paths in the model were significant 
suggesting that a moderate degree of stability was observed in the likelihood of the 
occurrence of bids (b = 0.30 [0.24, 0.35], p < .001, β = .29 [.26, .33]), in patient RF (b 
= 0.23 [0.19, 0.27], p < .001, β = .23 [.21, .24]) and in patient vocally encoded arousal (b 
= 0.24 [0.19, 0.28], p < .001, β = .24 [.22, .26]). In addition, better RF predicted greater 
likelihood of subsequent bids (b = 0.10 [0.06, 14], p < .001, β = .11 [.08, .13]) and higher 
subsequent arousal (b = 0.46 [0.12, 0.80], p = .01, β = .02 [.01, .04]). Bids did not directly 
predict lower arousal immediately following the bid (after taking into account the indirect 
effect through better RF; b = 0.39 [−0.20, 1.04], p = .19, β = .02 [−.01, .05]). Furthermore, 
bids did not predict arousal (b = −0.44 [−1.04, 0.13], p = .13, β = −.02 [−.05, .01]) and RF 
(b = 0.04 [−0.01, 0.08], p = .16, β = .03 [.00, .05]) in the talk turn that followed the next bid 
(e.g., two bids apart). Finally, lower arousal did not predict greater likelihood of subsequent 
bids (b = 0.00 [−0.02, 0.02], p = .88, β = −.03 [−.05, .00]) or better subsequent RF (b = 0.00 
[−0.02, 0.02], p = .97, β = .00 [−.02, .02]).

In sum, bids predicted lower arousal through better RF. In addition, RF predicted a greater 
likelihood of additional bids in the subsequent talk turn and also higher arousal. The 
increased subsequent RF, in turn, predicted lower subsequent arousal. Bids, RF, and arousal 
showed a moderate degree of stability between talk turns.

Group differences and changes during treatment in the emotion regulatory 
role of RF.—To examine changes during treatment, a multilevel model was fitted to 
session-level estimates of the indirect effect of bids on arousal through RF (i.e., an estimate 
of the indirect path was saved separately for each patient and each session from the SEM). 
We found that the indirect effect at the 4-month session was significant (b = −0.14, t114 = 
−13.88, p < .001) and it became stronger over time (b = −0.05, t114 = −4.46, p < .001). The 
effects of group (F(2, 85) = 0.07, p = .93) and time × group (F(2, 114) = 0.47, p = .63) were not 
significant.

To better understand this finding, we examined changes during treatment in each of the paths 
that constitute the indirect effect, namely, the effect of bids on RF immediately following 
the bid and the effect of RF on arousal. In a model examining the effect of bids on RF 
immediately following the bid none of the effects were significant (time: F(2, 114) = 0.01, p 
= .93; group: F(2, 85) = 0.02, p = .98; time × group: F(2, 114) = 0.38, p = .68). However, the 
effect of RF on decreasing arousal became stronger over time (b = −0.26, t114 = −14.00, p 
< .001) while the group (F(2, 85) = 1.40, p = .25) and time × group (F(2, 114) = 1.71, p = 
.19) effects were not significant. Thus, these findings suggest that the regulatory effect of 
RF on arousal became stronger during treatment and that this increase could be attributed

to an increase during treatment in the effect of RF on decreased arousal. In addition, the 
regulatory effect did not differ by group.

Testing a competing model: lower arousal as a facilitator of better RF.—Given 
the naturalistic nature of the within-session model, it was important to test a competing 
model to the hypothesized model. Therefore, we tested a model with an indirect effect of 
bids on better RF through lower arousal. The model examined the alternative explanation 
that lower arousal predicts better RF and not the other way around. This might be the case 
if being less emotionally aroused allows patients to better utilize RF. We found that bids did 
not predict lower subsequent arousal (b = 0.23 [−0.32, 0.81], p = .37, β = .07 [−.05, .23]) 
and arousal did not predict better RF (b = 0.00 [−0.03, 0.02], p = .82, β = .00 [−.01, .01]). 
Similarly, the indirect effect of bids on RF through arousal was not significant (b = 0.00 
[−0.02, 0.01], p = .86). These findings provide further support to the proposed model by 
ruling out the possibility that lower arousal contributes to better RF and not vice versa.

Accounting for therapist vocally-encoded arousal.—A possible alternative 
explanation for the indirect effect of bids on arousal through RF is that therapist arousal 
serves as a third variable that is correlated with increased likelihood of bids and also 
predicts lower subsequent patient arousal. For example, making a bid might reduce the 
therapist’s arousal. In turn, therapist arousal may predict lower patient arousal, for example, 
by interpersonal regulation/dampening (Imel et al., 2014). To rule out this explanation, we 
tested a model that included therapist arousal. We examined whether bids predicted therapist 
arousal in the same talk turn and whether patient arousal was predicted from therapist 
arousal. The results showed that bids indeed predicted lower therapist arousal in the same 
talk turn (b = −0.93 [−1.47, −.37], p < .001) and that therapist arousal predicted lower 
patient arousal (b = 0.11 [0.07, 0.16], p < .001). However, the indirect effect of bids on 
patient arousal through RF remained significant (b = −0.15 [−0.24, −0.08], p < .001). Thus, 
although an indirect path between bids and patient arousal through therapist arousal may 
exist, it seems that the emotion regulatory effect of bids through RF is independent of that 
path.

Discussion

Impairments in RF, the capacity to consider mental states, are considered central in the 
psychopathology of BPD, and their reduction is hypothesized to play a role in treatment 
of BPD, and especially in psychodynamic psychotherapies (Levy et al., 2006a). The 
current study examined the emotion regulatory role of in-session RF in psychotherapies 
for BPD. Findings from this intensive, micro-analytic research design showed that therapist 
interventions that ask participants to consider mental state are associated with better 
subsequent patient RF which, in turn, predicts reduced emotional arousal. Below we discuss 
these findings in detail.

The Emotion Regulatory Role of In-Session RF

Consistent with our hypothesis and with a previous study that utilized a similar design 
(Möller et al., 2017), we found that bids predicted better RF in the talk-turn immediately

following the bid. This finding suggests that asking patients to consider mental states 
results in a better quality of RF. Furthermore, our findings showed that better RF predicted 
lower vocally encoded arousal – suggesting that RF may play a role in down regulating 
emotional arousal in session. Although the effect size tended to be small, this finding is 
consistent with the notion of RF as enabling meaning making that promotes processing 
of interpersonal and emotional experiences thereby increasing tolerance and regulation of 
distressing mental states (Fonagy, 2001). To our knowledge, this is the first study to show 
that RF as measured by an observer predicts a psychophysiological measure of arousal in the 
context of psychotherapy.

It is noteworthy that our findings held even after examining (and ruling out) alternative 
explanations such as patient arousal predicting RF and not the other way around or the 
possibility that therapist arousal, and not RF, predicts lower patient arousal. That said, 
another possible alternative explanation for our findings is that patients experience bids as 
“demands” for RF, and having complied with the therapists’ demands, patients feel a relief 
which is expressed in lower arousal.

It is important to note that the direct effect of bids on arousal (that is, not including the 
indirect effect through better RF) was not significant. This finding may suggest that bids for 
RF do not have a universal down-regulatory effect on arousal. Rather, bids are associated 
with decreased arousal only to the degree that they are also associated with increased RF. It 
remains for future studies to try to identify what makes for a successful bid. For example, 
optimal bids might be those that require a moderate level of incremental reflection from the 
patient while trivial or overly demanding bids might not be successful in promoting better 
RF and lower arousal.

Taken together, we see the indirect effect of bids on arousal through RF as capturing the 
degree to which patients can take in what the therapist is saying and use it to reflect on 
their experience in order to down regulate their distressing emotions. Such a process plays 
a central role in many psychodynamic therapies and is an important part of the TFP model 
(Levy et al., 2006a). These findings demonstrate the contribution of micro-analytic designs 
coupled with appropriate novel data analytic approaches to understanding the moment-by-
moment unfolding of in-session processes. Future studies could further examine the causal 
effect of bids on RF and arousal in more controlled settings by utilizing experimental 
designs such as lab experiments and micro-interventions. Future studies could also examine 
a more nuanced classification of bids as well as take into account the competence in 
which the bid is delivered. For example, from a TFP perspective, studies could examine 
differences between interventions such as clarifications, confrontations and interpretations in 
their effects on subsequent RF.

Group Differences and Changes over Time

Consistent with hypotheses and with the TFP model, bids were twice as common in TFP 
compared to DBT and SPT. Use of bids did not increase during treatment in TFP, in contrast 
to hypotheses, which means that bids were common even early in treatment, at least during 
the active phase of it (i.e., after goal- and frame setting).

Interestingly, the emotion regulatory effect of bids was similar regardless of treatment 
despite the fact that RF and bids for RF are not an integral part of the DBT model (Lynch 
et al., 2006) and play a lesser role in the SPT model compared to TFP (Appelbaum, 2007). 
Thus, bids were more likely to occur in TFP, but when they occurred, they had a similar 
effect on RF and arousal regardless of treatment.

In contrast to hypotheses, in-session RF rated on therapy discourse did not increase during 
treatment, including in TFP. This finding is inconsistent with a previous study of the same 
dataset that showed increases in RF during TFP only, from pre- to post-treatment, as 
measured by an attachment interview (the AAI). There are several possible explanations for 
this discrepancy in findings. TFP patients may have improved in their capacity to reflect 
on their past experiences and/or with regards to their parents (aspects that are captured 
by the AAI) whereas the capacity to reflect in the moment and/or with regards to the 
therapist/significant others during psychotherapy sessions is slower to develop. Related to 
that, current upsetting experiences that are discussed in session may be more emotionally 
evoking, and therefore harder to reflect on, compared to talking about past experiences. 
Examining RF at follow up periods after treatment as well as using methods for assessing 
RF in daily life between sessions (e.g., ecological momentary assessments) could help 
clarify the pathways for improvements in RF during TFP.

Study Limitations and Future Research

Psychotherapy, by definition, occurs at an interpersonal context. Therefore, the findings 
in the current study should be interpreted as reflecting dyadic processes, rather than pure 
patient-related processes. For example, it is impossible to determine if RF, as coded in the 
study, solely reflects the patient’s capacity for reflection rather than interaction between the 
patient’s capacity to reflect and the therapist’s capacity to facilitate reflection (mediated by 
the therapist’s own RF capacity). As mentioned above, coding the skill in which bids were 
delivered, as well as therapists’ capacity to reflect on their patients’ experiences may help 
disentangle these contributions (Diamond, Stovall-McClough, Clarkin, & Levy, 2003).

In the current study, we focused on emotional arousal, broadly defined, regardless of the 
content and valence of the emotion. Although it is reasonable to assume that on most talk 
turns emotional arousal was related to unpleasant emotions, we cannot rule out that some 
talk turns included emotional arousal related to pleasant emotions. The process described 
in the study may be different for pleasant emotions and therefore future studies could 
complement our findings by classifying talk turns based on their affective content.

Related to that, it important to note that we do not assume that decreasing arousal is a 
uniform goal in psychotherapy that applies in all situations. Indeed, some studies show that 
a moderate level of arousal tends to predict the best outcomes (Carryer & Greenberg, 2010). 
Instead, our goal was to examine RF-related reductions in arousal that may be a proxy for 
emotional processing. Given that individuals with BPD are more likely to be dysregulated, 
rather than constricted, in their emotional experience (Dixon-Gordon et al., 2016), a 
decrease, rather than an increase in arousal seemed to be more relevant. Nevertheless, future 
studies could try to identify for which patients a reduction in arousal is more likely to be 
conducive to emotional processing and which patients need to experience their emotions

more fully in order process them. Attachment styles, and their related emotion regulation 
patterns, may be one factor distinguishing between these two groups of patients (Shaver & 
Mikulincer, 2007).

The large number of observations per patient (80 talk turns per session on average and up 
to three sessions per patient) made our analyses well powered for detecting within-patient 
processes. However, with a total of 88 patients in three treatments, the study may not 
have been adequately powered to detect group differences. Therefore, non-significant group 
differences in the current study should be interpreted with caution and replicated in larger 
samples.

Finally, the current study focused exclusively on in-session processes. As a next step, it 
would be important to examine how in-session RF and its emotion-regulatory effect are 
related to treatment outcome. Psychotherapy outcome is most often conceived as occurring 
in longer time intervals than in-session processes, typically at the between-session level 
(i.e., session by session changes in symptoms). Thus, bridging between these micro- 
(within-session processes) and meso-phenomena (between-session outcome) is an important 
challenge to address in cutting edge process-outcome research (Elliott, 2010; Penix, Swift, 
& Trusty, 2020).

Implications and Concluding Comments

Psychotherapy is a dynamic process that unfolds moment-by-moment. The current 
study demonstrates the utility of intensive measurements and of microanalytic research 
designs in capturing these dynamic processes. The findings of the study highlight the 
importance of therapists’ focus on increasing patient RF, which, in turn, predicts lower 
emotional arousal. These findings represent a step towards elucidating unique and common 
mechanisms of change in psychotherapies for BPD, a severe disorder which is of major 
public health concern. Such findings, coupled with future studies focusing on in-session 
processes-outcome relations, have the potential of informing the practice and delivery of 
psychotherapies for BPD in order to maximize the emotion-regulatory role of RF.

Public Health Significance Statement

In psychotherapies for borderline personality disorder (BPD), therapist interventions 
that ask patients to consider mental states are associated with increased capacity 
for understanding mental states which, in turn, is associated with reduced emotional 
arousal. Thus, understanding mental states might have an emotion regulatory role in 
psychotherapies for BPD.
