Background  and  Hypothesis:    People  with  first-episode 
psychosis (FEP) in low- and lower-middle-income countries 
(LMIC) experience delays in receiving treatment, resulting 
in  poorer  outcomes  and  higher  mortality.  There  is  robust 
evidence for effective and cost-effective early intervention 
in  psychosis  (EIP)  services  for  FEP,  but  the  evidence  for 
EIP  in  LMIC  has  not  been  reviewed.  We  aim  to  review 
the evidence on early intervention for the management of 
FEP in LMIC.  Study Design:  We searched 4 electronic 
databases  (Medline,  Embase,  PsycINFO,  and  CINAHL) 
to  identify  studies  describing  EIP  services  and  interven-
tions to treat FEP in LMIC published from 1980 onward. 
The  bibliography  of  relevant  articles  was  hand-searched. 
Preferred  Reporting  Items  for  Systematic  Reviews  and 
Meta-Analyses  (PRISMA)  guidelines  were  followed.  
Study Results:  The search strategy produced 5074 records; 
we included 18 studies with 2294 participants from 6 LMIC 
countries.  Thirteen  studies  (1553  participants)  described 
different approaches for EIP. Pharmacological intervention 
studies (n = 4; 433 participants) found a high prevalence of 
metabolic  syndrome  among  FEP  receiving  antipsychotics 
(P ≤ .005). One study found a better quality of life in pa-
tients  using  injectables  compared  to  oral  antipsychotics 
(P = .023). Among the non-pharmacological interventions 
(n = 3; 308 participants), SMS reminders improved treat-
ment engagement (OR = 1.80, CI = 1.02–3.19). The meth-
odological  quality  of  studies  evidence  was  relatively  low.  
Conclusions:    The  limited  evidence  showed  that  EIP  can 
be provided in LMIC with adaptations for cultural factors 
and limited resources. Adaptations included collaboration 
with traditional healers, involving nonspecialist healthcare 
professionals,  using  mobile  technology,  considering  the 

optimum use of long-acting antipsychotics, and monitoring 
antipsychotic side effects.

Introduction

The  initial  1–3-year  period  after  the  onset  of  psychosis 
is  considered  as  the  critical  period  in  the  outcome  of 
first-episode  psychosis  (FEP).1  The  lack  of  treatment 
during this period sets in motion the neuropathological 
and neurochemical processes which result in poorer out-
comes. Individuals experiencing FEP often have a decline 
in their social functioning alongside negative symptoms 
like  a  lack  of  motivation  and  reduced  ability  to  experi-
ence  pleasure.  Social  functioning  tends  to  diminish  as 
individuals face challenges in maintaining relationships, 
engaging in daily activities, and fulfilling societal roles.

The  duration  of  untreated  psychosis  (DUP)  refers 
to  the  period  between  the  onset  of  the  initial  psychotic 
symptom  and  the  commencement  of  appropriate  treat-
ment  with  antipsychotic  medication.  The  long  DUP 
before  appropriate  treatment  is  associated  with  worse 
outcomes in overall functioning, symptom severity, and 
quality of life, as well as lower levels of recovery from the 
first psychotic episode.2,3

The  robust  evidence  for  the  deleterious  effect  of  un-
treated or poorly treated FEP during the initial years of 
FEP led to the development of early intervention in psy-
chosis (EIP) services in many countries. EIP services aim

to detect and manage psychotic symptoms and associated 
psychological  and  behavioral  effects  of  FEP  during  the 
critical  first  3  years  after  the  onset  of  psychosis.4  These 
services  vary  between  countries  but  often  share  similar 
components  such  as  explicit  admission  criteria,  small 
patient-to-staff ratios, and evidence-based pharmacolog-
ical and psychosocial treatments.

EIP  services  are  now  a  widespread  therapeutic  ap-
proach  across  Europe,  United  States,  and  Australasia. 
Recent  systematic  reviews  and  meta-analyses  show 
that  EIP services are both effective and cost-effective.5–8 
However, almost all evidence in these systematic reviews 
comes from high-income countries (HIC).

According  to  the  United  Nations  Population  Fund, 
90%  of  young  people  across  the  world  live  in  LMIC.9 
Those young people experiencing FEP within LMIC ex-
perience a prolonged DUP of approximately 125 weeks 
compared  to  62.5  weeks  in  HIC.10  Such  a  long  period 
of untreated psychosis is associated with poor response 
to  treatment,  greater  disability,  and  probably  increased 
mortality.11  Therefore,  understanding  the  status  and  ef-
fectiveness of EIP services in LMIC is crucial to inform 
the development of treatment pathways for FEP and im-
prove clinical outcomes in young people with FEP.

There  is  a  paucity  of  literature  on  the  effectiveness 
of  pharmacological  and  psychosocial  interventions  for 
treating FEP that can be used in EIP services in LMIC. 
Resource constraints and important cultural differences 
mean that commonly used interventions such as cognitive 
behavioral therapy (CBT), which are readily available in 
EIP  services  in  HIC,  cannot  be  used  in  LMIC.12  There 
are also important differences in access to pharmacolog-
ical  treatments,  the  pharmacokinetics  of  antipsychotic 
treatments, and the greater propensity for metabolic side 
effects of commonly used antipsychotics for large popu-
lations in many LMIC.13

Many  patients  with  FEP  in  LMIC  present  to  tradi-
tional and spiritual healers (TSH) as their first care pro-
viders,14 and this must be considered in care pathways for 
providing EIP services in LMIC. Therefore, a “one-size-
fits-all” approach for EIP cannot be utilized and it is im-
portant to examine the provision of EIP services and the 
interventions to treat FEP in LMIC.

To the best of our knowledge, there is currently no sys-
tematic review that examines the evidence on the config-
uration of EIP services or their effectiveness in treating 
FEP in LMIC. We aim to systematically review the liter-
ature on the components and configuration of EIP serv-
ices in LMIC and the interventions that can be used in 
these services to treat FEP in LMIC settings. Specifically, 
this study will address the following questions:

1.  What is the existing situation of EIP services in LMIC, 
including  care  pathways  for  assessment  and  manage-
ment of FEP, the characteristics of EIS, and the con-
figuration of services?

522

2.  Is EIP effective or cost-effective in improving the out-

comes for people with early psychosis in LMIC?

3.  What is the evidence for the effectiveness of pharma-
cological and non-pharmacological interventions that 
have  been  studied  in  the  context  of  LMIC,  and  can 
they be used in EIP services in these countries?

Methods

We  followed  the  PRISMA  guidelines15  (supplementary 
appendix 1) for evidence synthesis and the protocol was 
registered prior to starting the study (PROSPERO 2022 
CRD42022338379).

Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria

We  included  the  studies  reporting  the  effectiveness  of 
pharmacological  or  psychosocial  intervention  among 
people  with  FEP,  and  studies  describing  the  EIP  serv-
ices in any setting from LMIC (supplimemtary appedix 
2).  We  limited  the  search  to  1980  onwards  as  the  early 
intervention  services  and  interventions  for  treating  and 
evaluating  focused  specifically  on  FEP  only  started  in 
1990 onwards. As some interventions used in FEP might 
have commenced before 1990, the search criteria were set 
to cover studies from 1980 onwards.

EIP is mostly limited to the 15–35 age group in HIC.16 
In view of the sparse literature, we decided to include EIP 
for FEP regardless of age in LMIC.

Definitions of Key Concepts

FEP.  The  clinical  definition  for  FEP  described  by  the 
NICE  guidelines  is  the  first  time  a  person  experiences 
a  combination  of  symptoms  known  as  psychosis.16  The 
definitions  of  “first  episode  psychosis”  in  the  literature 
vary. FEP is usually defined as psychosis (meeting ICD 
or  DSM  criteria  for  the  psychotic  disorder)  in  people 
who  have  not  received  regular  antipsychotic  treatment 
for  more  than  6  weeks  prior  to  contact  with  the  index 
service.17  We  included  studies  irrespective  of  the  defini-
tion  used  and  we  provide  the  definition  of  FEP  as  em-
ployed by different studies (supplementary appendix 3). 
We  also  included  studies  describing  the  at-risk  mental 
state as these states commonly precede FEP.16

EIP Services.  EIP services are defined in terms of pro-
viding a set of services for people with FEP during the 
first  2–5  years  after  contact  with  services.  We  included 
the studies describing EIP in any form or scope. Studies 
describing the early identification of people at high risk 
were also included.

Pharmacological  and  Non-pharmacological  Interventions.  
Any drug treatment used for treating FEP was considered a 

pharmacological intervention. The non-pharmacological 
interventions included psychosocial interventions such as 
CBT,  relaxation  exercises,  occupational  therapy,  family 
psychoeducation, and individual psychoeducation.

Search Strategy

Four  databases  were  electronically  searched:  CINAHL, 
EMBASE,  MEDLINE,  and  PsycINFO.  The  prelimi-
nary  search  was  carried  out  to  refine  the  search  terms. 
The  search  strategy  was  developed  in  consultation  with 
the  systematic  review  team  that  included  psychiatrists 
with  extensive  experience  in  EIP,  psychologists,  and  an 
information specialist. The search strategy was developed 
with  a  focus  on  the  review  questions,  types  of  studies, 
databases, Mesh terms, variations of search terms using 
parentheses and Boolean operators, and insights gained 
from previous similar literature searches. Each low- and 
middle-income country was searched separately.

The  detailed  search  strategy  and  search  terms  used 
are given in supplementary appendix 4 and the following 
terms  were  included  in  the  search  strategy:  “psychosis,” 
“psychotic,”  “early  intervention,”  “FEP  (first  episode 
intervention),”  Schizophrenia,  schizophrenia  spectrum 
and  other  psychotic  disorders,  early  intervention  schiz-
ophrenia “PLE (psychosis-like illness),” “ultra high-risk 
mental state,” “early medical intervention,” “health plan 
implementation,”  “at-risk  mental  state,”  “prodrome,” 
“early intervention psychosis services,” “care,” and “care 
pathways.” The search strategy was last updated in June 
2023.  The  citations  and  bibliographies  of  the  full-text 
articles  retrieved  from  the  search  were  hand-searched 
to avoid duplication and missing important key articles. 
Also,  a  secondary  hand  search  of  references  was  car-
ried out to identify any additional articles relevant to the 
review.

Study Selection Process

The titles and abstracts of the articles were independently 
screened  by  2  reviewers  (S.S.  and  M.W.).  Any  disagree-
ment about an article at this stage was discussed with a 
third reviewer (S.F.) to reach a consensus. The full texts 
of the included studies that met the inclusion criteria were 
assessed independently by 2 reviewers (N.F. and A.M.), 
and  any  differences  were  subsequently  discussed  with  a 
third reviewer (S.F.).

Data Extraction

The data were extracted independently from each of the 
eligible articles by 2 reviewers (A.M. and S.H.) using an 
Excel  form  created  especially  for  this  review.  In  addi-
tion  to  the  study  characteristics,  the  data  was  extracted 
on  the  following  key  variables:  (a)  intervention  studies: 
drug  therapy,  type  of  non-pharmacological  interven-
tion  (psychological,  family  education),  setting,  control 

Early Intervention in Psychosis and Management of FEP in LMIC

group, components, followed-up period, outcome of ef-
fectiveness (symptoms, functioning or other parameters). 
(b)  EIP  services  studies:  location,  components,  service 
providers/facilitators,  effectiveness  as  a  primary  out-
come,  and  implementation  strategies,  etc.,  as  secondary 
outcomes.

Data Synthesis

We  planned  to  do  a  meta-analysis  of  included  studies 
for  key  outcomes.  However,  on  examining  the  included 
studies,  it  was  observed  that  the  studies  varied  in  terms 
of the type of interventions/services, methods used, and 
outcomes considered. Therefore, it was not appropriate to 
do  a  meta-analysis,  and  synthesis  without  meta-analysis 
was performed following the guidelines.18 These guidelines 
outline 9 essential categories of information that must be 
provided in the instance that a quantitative synthesis is not 
feasible (supplementary appendix 5). This synthesis incor-
porated the country in which the research was carried out, 
details  of  interventions  and  key  findings,  characteristics 
of EIP services in LMIC, and proposed outcomes.

Risk of Bias Assessment

The quality of the studies was assessed independently by 
2 reviewers (N.F. and G.A.) using checklists for different 
study designs. Cochrane collaboration tool19 was used for 
randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and Risk of Bias in 
Non-Randomized Studies of Interventions20 was used for 
quasi-experimental studies. STrengthening the Reporting 
of  OBservational  studies  in  Epidemiology  (STROBE) 
was  used  for  observational  studies  (supplementary 
 appendix  6).21  The  qualitative  study  was  screened  as  a 
part of the overall literature results using Joanna Briggs 
Institute critical appraisal checklist criteria (supplemen-
tary appendix 6).

Patient and Public Involvement

Patient and public involvement and engagement (PPIE) 
for  this  review  is  part  of  the  THEHOPE  study,  as  de-
scribed in the study’s protocol.22 THEHOPE is a research 
program  that  aims  to  develop  a  collaborative  approach 
with  TSH  for  the  early  detection  and  management  of 
FEP  in  Pakistan.  PPIE  has  been  crucial  at  every  stage 
of  THEHOPE,  including  the  design  and  conduct  of 
this systematic review. The members of patients and the 
public who formed the PPIE group in Pakistan identified 
the need for developing evidence-based guidance for the 
management of FEP in Pakistan, which led to the choice 
of outcome measures and search strategy for this review. 
At each stage, PPIE and community service user groups 
from  the  University  of  Keele  and  Peshawar,  Pakistan 
have  provided  key  suggestions  for  the  study.  The  prior-
ities, experiences, and preferences of these groups will in-
form the dissemination of findings from this review.

Results

The search strategy produced 5074 records, of which 18 
studies met the inclusion criteria. The PRISMA flow dia-
gram (figure 1) illustrates the searches, screenings, and se-
lection outcomes. The studies included articles describing 
EIP  services  in  LMIC  (n = 6,  33.3%),  pharmacological 
interventional  (n = 3,  16.7%),  non-pharmacological  in-
terventional  (n = 4,  22.2%),  and  both  pharmacological 
and non-pharmacological (n = 5, 27.8%) for FEP.

Study Characteristics

The characteristics of the studies are listed in table 1. The 
included studies were conducted in hospital settings be-
tween 2008 and 2023 in the following 6 countries (figure 
2):  India  (n = 10),  Iran  (n = 3),  Nigeria  (n = 2),  Nepal 
(n = 1), Tunisia (n = 1), and Uganda (n = 1).

The  16  quantitative  studies  included  the  following: 
RCT  (n = 4),  quasi-experimental  (n = 1),  and  observa-
tional studies (n = 11). The total number of participants 
in all included studies was 2294 and the mean sample size 
was 127.4. The mean age of the study sample was 29.05 
(95% CI: 24.06–33.5).

Studies on Pharmacological and Non-pharmacological 
Interventions in FEP

The brief descriptions of interventions and key findings 
are  summarized  in  table  2  (supplementary  appendix 
7),  with  detailed  outcome  measures  used  in  these 
studies  given  in  table  3  (supplementary  appendix  8). 
Pharmacological studies included 3 RCT and 1 longitu-
dinal  observational  study.  Saddichha  et  al.13  evaluated 
the  effects  of  olanzapine  (n = 35),  risperidone  (n = 33), 
and  haloperidol  (n = 31)  on  the  development  of  met-
abolic  syndrome  (MetS)  in  an  RCT  and  found  that 
olanzapine  was  associated  with  the  highest  prevalence 
rates  (20%–25%)  of  MetS  compared  to  risperidone 
(9%–24%)  and  haloperidol  (0%–3%).  The  overall  prev-
alence was 5 times greater than the prevalence observed 
(P = .005  and  P  ≤  .001)  in  the  control  group  (n = 51). 
In  a  randomized,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled 
study, Modabbernia et al.27 examined the short-term ef-
fect  of  melatonin  in  the  prevention  of  drug-induced 
(olanzapine)  MetS.  By  the  eighth  week  of  the  trial, 
individuals  who  were  administered  melatonin  (n = 24) 
demonstrated  a  significantly  lower  increase  in  weight 
(P = .023),  body  mass  index  (P = .024),  and  waist

circumference  (P = .041),  as  compared  to  the  placebo 
group  (n = 24).  Furthermore,  the  patients  in  the  mel-
atonin  group  showed  a  significant  reduction  in  the 
PANSS total score (P = .014).
Kaur  et  al.28  compared 

the  effectiveness  of 
long-acting  injectable  (LAI)  antipsychotics  vs  oral  an-
tipsychotic  drugs.  Patients  (n = 72)  with  FEP  (DSM-5) 
were  randomly  assigned  to  receive  either  oral  haloper-
idol  (n = 34)  or  LAI  haloperidol  (n = 38)  for  a  dura-
tion  of  12  weeks.  Both  groups  showed  a  significant 
decrease in PANSS scores, while those on the LAI hal-
operidol  demonstrated  a  significantly  higher  quality 
of  life  (P = .023).  Tabatabaee  et  al.26  assessed  the  pre-
dictors  of  acute  treatment  response  to  antipsychotics 
in  FEP  patients  (n = 163)  in  an  inpatient  unit  in  Iran. 
At  the  end  of  5–7  weeks  of  follow-up,  it  was  observed 
that  the  higher  premorbid,  lower  baseline  functioning, 
and  acute  onset  were  found  to  be  the  predictors  of 
functional  response  (x2  =  30.093;  df = 3;  P  ≤  .001; 
Nagelkerke  R2 = 0.379).

Amongst  non-pharmacological  studies,  Thomas  et 
al.25 examined the effectiveness of short message service 
(SMS)  reminders  on  clinical  appointments  in  an  RCT 
and  found  that  receiving  SMS  helped  to  improve  clinic 
attendance (OR = 1.80, 95% CI = 1.02–3.19). In a quasi-
experimental  study,  Sadath  et  al.23  evaluated  the  effec-
tiveness  of  group  intervention  (n = 37)  vs  treatment  as 
usual  (TAU)  (n = 34)  on  expressed  emotions  (EE)  and 
social  support  for  carers  of  persons  with  FEP.  Group 
intervention  reduced  EE  significantly  (P < .007)  at  the 
one-month follow-up, but the observation was not signif-
icant at the third month. The effectiveness of electrocon-
vulsive therapy (ECT) in patients with FEP was assessed 
using a naturalistic study methodology and those who re-
ceived ECT (n = 12) showed significant improvement in 
psychopathology  (P = .001)  and  day-to-day  functioning 
(P = .003) when compared to the group that did not re-
ceive ECT (n = 33) at 1-year post-ECT (Adhikari24).

EIP Services in LMIC

Detailed findings from these studies are given in table 2 
(supplementary  appendix  7)  and  the  brief  findings  are 
described  here.  Four  studies  used  pre-  and  post-design. 
Three studies examined the effectiveness of EIP by com-
paring  services  in  Canada  and  India.29,32,34  Both  sites 
adopted  similar  protocols  for  the  treatment  of  FEP, 
case  management,  individual  and  family  intervention, 
psychoeducation, and CBT using key outcomes such as 
positive  and  negative  symptoms,  family  function,  and 
medication  adherence.  These  studies  conducted  a  com-
parative  analysis  of  the  FEP  program  in  Canada  and 
India. Significant improvement in positive (P ≤ .001) and 
negative symptoms (P ≤ .03) over the 24 months was ob-
served in both the sites, Chennai (n = 168) and Montreal 
(n = 165).  Family  support  was  higher  in  Chennai  (µ  = 

Early Intervention in Psychosis and Management of FEP in LMIC

10.3 SD = 3.41) than in Montreal (µ = 8.79 SD = 3.46).29 
The predictors of service disengagement were examined.34 
Improved  communication  between  the  families  and  the 
treating  teams  (HR = 0.84,  95%  CI  0.78–0.92),  age  at 
entry  (HR = 0.89,  95%  CI  0.80–0.98),  and  medication 
adherence  (HR = 0.28,  95%  CI  0.12–0.68)  were  found 
to  be  independently  associated  with  reduced  likelihood 
of  service  disengagement.  Rangaswamy  et  al.33  assessed 
DUP  and  its  impact  on  outcomes  in  patients  (n = 47) 
with FEP and found that at the end of 2 years, the group 
that  experienced  remission  (n = 28)  had  a  substantially 
lower  DUP  compared  to  the  group  that  remained  con-
sistently  unwell  (n = 10)  (t = 4.048,  sig = 0.002).  The 
mean  DUP  for  the  remitted  group  was  11.40  months, 
whereas  the  mean  DUP  for  the  continuously  ill  group 
was 56.50 months. Authors commented that EIP is fea-
sible even in environments that mostly deal with chronic, 
and untreated, psychotic patients.

Chiliza et al.31 examined the feasibility and effectiveness 
of a depot antipsychotic combined with an assertive moni-
toring program (AMP) using exploratory noncomparative 
study methodology. Participants (n = 207) were assessed, 
from the baseline up to 1 year. There was a significant im-
provement in positive and negative symptom scores (P ≤ 
.001), as well as quality of life (P ≤ .001) and authors con-
cluded that in environments with limited resources, com-
bining a depot antipsychotic with assertive monitoring is 
feasible and may be an effective treatment for first-episode 
schizophrenia.  Ventura  et  al.30  demonstrated  the  feasi-
bility of developing a clinical high-risk program (CHiRP) 
to  identify  youth  at  clinical  high  risk  (CHR).  Patients 
(n = 10)  exhibiting  possible  signs  of  CHR  were  assessed 
by the CHiRP assessment team and provided with psycho-
social  and  pharmacological  management.  Follow-up  as-
sessments were done at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months. 
The findings indicated the feasibility of implementing the 
methods  established  in  HIC  within  LMIC  settings.  The 
study  was  carried  out  in  Tunisia  and  recognized  by  the 
Early  Intervention  in  Mental  Health  Association  as  the 
first CHR program in Africa.

The Adaptation of EIP in LMIC

A  detailed  description  of  the  characteristics  of  the  EIP 
services  is  given  in  table  4  (supplementary  appendix  9). 
We mapped the components of EIP as described in the 
included  studies  against  the  7  standards  provided  by 
NICE guidelines16 for assessing the adaptation of EIP in 
LMIC settings.

1.  Referral  and  Assessment:  Referrals  to  EIP  services 
were  done  by  the  hospitals,  general  practitioners, 
families  or  caregivers,  and  young  people  them-
selves.34  The  assessment  was  carried  out  by  psychi-
atrists34,35,38 using DSM-IV34,38 and ICD-10 criteria.35 
Assessments  included  the  Positive  and  Negative 

527

S. Farooq et al

Syndrome  Scale  and  Social  and  Occupational 
Functioning  Assessment  Scale.34  Singh  et  al.  found 
that  faith  healing  was  the  predominant  kind  of 
health-seeking  behavior  in  North  India,  and  it  was 
strongly  correlated  with  the  prolonged  duration  of 
FEP in South India. It was observed that the treat-
ment gap could be bridged by a collaborative model 
between the faith healers and the current healthcare 
system, creating a referral pathway.35

2.  Care Coordinator: Case managers play a crucial role 
in facilitating the coordination of healthcare services 
for  individual  patients,  while  also  providing  non-
pharmacological interventions.38

3.  Pharmacotherapy:  The  feasibility  of  protocol-based 
management of FEP in the selection of antipsychotic 
medication, mode of administration, and monitoring 
of side effects has been demonstrated.34–36 The protocol-
based management was delivered by a multidisciplinary 
team  consisting  of  psychiatrists  and  case  managers 
working in the Specialist FEP. A significant propor-
tion of individuals used first-generation antipsychotics 
(n = 129,  81.13%)  in  contrast  to   second-generation 
antipsychotics (SGAs) (n = 3, 1.89%).36

4.  Psychoeducation and Support for Carers and Families: 
Individual36  and  family34–36  psychoeducation  was  de-
livered by a clinical psychologist. It was reported that 
the involvement of family members in treatment is a 
strong predictor of service engagement as the dropout 
rate  observed  at  the  Indian  site  (5.4%)  was  consid-
erably  lower  than  at  the  Canadian  site  (18.95%).34 
Mottaghipour  et  al.37  examined  the  effectiveness 
of  training  health  professionals  to  conduct  family 
psychoeducation.  The  sessions  were  recorded  and 
analyzed with scoring based on the manual’s content. 
Multiple family group education sessions in a hospital 

setting had a higher rate (79%) compared to the single-
family home-based psychoeducation sessions (69%).
5.  Supported  Employment  Programs  and  Vocational 
Rehabilitation:  Using  a  retrospective  chart  review, 
Mwesiga  et  al.36  evaluated  the  quality  of  the  indi-
vidual  and  group-level  interventions  provided  to 
FEP patients in Uganda. They reported limited pro-
vision of assistance to patients in terms of employ-
ment  and  vocational  plans  (n = 4,  2.5%)  that  were 
offered  to  only  1  and  4  patients,  respectively,  in  a 
sample of 156 patients.

6.  Physical  Health  Interventions  and  Monitoring:  In 
their study, Mwesiga et al.36 assessed the monitoring 
of  medication  side  effects  and  metabolic  changes 
such  as  Body  Mass  Index  (BMI),  cholesterol, 
Random Blood Sugar (RBS), and weight gain, and 
reported that a significant proportion of participants 
exhibited poor monitoring of antipsychotic medica-
tion side effects (n = 39, 25%) and metabolic changes 
(n = 4, 2.5%).

7.  Evaluation  and  Quality  Improvement:  Mwesiga  et 
al.36  used  the  FEP  Services  Fidelity  Scale  to  assess 
the quality of the services provided for each compo-
nent of the specialized service. Iyer et al.39 developed 
“show  me  you  care”:  a  new  measure  to  explicitly 
evaluate the conduct and treatment approach of the 
treating  team.  Singh  et  al.  found  that  faith  healing 
was  the  predominant  kind  of  health-seeking  be-
havior in North India, and it was strongly correlated 
with the prolonged duration of FEP in South India.

Quality Assessment

The  quality  criteria  of  the  included  study  were  as-
sessed using the appropriate checklist for different study 

Fig. 2.  Different LMIC of included studies.

528

designs.19 The details of the quality assessment are pro-
vided in supplementary appendix 6. Out of the 4 RCTs, 
1 had a low risk of bias, 2 had a high risk of bias, and 1 
trial was classified as having some concerns. The quasi-
experimental study was categorized as having a high risk 
of  bias.  Seven  prospective  studies  were  assessed  using 
the STROBE checklist for cohort studies.20 Three studies 
failed  to  include  key  elements  of  study  design.  Only  2 
studies  mentioned  how  the  sample  size  was  arrived  at. 
Five observational cross-sectional studies were included 
in the assessment. Four studies failed to mention proper 
sample size calculation and it was unclear whether study 
participants  were  sampled  appropriately.  Overall  ap-
praisal of the qualitative study was to be included in the 
review.

Discussion

We used a comprehensive search strategy to map all ev-
idence  and  found  18  studies  from  6  out  of  82  LMIC, 
highlighting  the  paucity  of  evidence.  Around  90%  of 
children  and  adolescents  worldwide  live  in  an  LMIC, 
where  they  form  half  of  the  population.40  Considering 
that the peak onset of FEP is between 13 and 24 years,41 
almost  90%  of  future  FEP  incidence  would  lie  in  these 
countries.42  Lack  of  effective  interventions  during  the 
critical initial period of 2–5 years after the onset of psy-
chosis would potentially condemn a substantial propor-
tion  of  these  young  persons  with  disabling  and  often 
life-threatening  chronic  psychosis  over  the  long-term 
follow-up.11,12

Despite  the  limited  evidence  in  a  few  countries,  we 
found that (a) The essential components of EIP can be 
adapted  and  provided  in  resource-poor  settings  and  it 
may be feasible to establish these services in LMIC. (b) 
The adaptations will need to consider the high consulta-
tion  rates  with  traditional  healers,  involving  family  and 
modifications  in  the  role  of  different  team  members  in 
EIP.  (c)  The  effectiveness  and  metabolic  side  effects  of 
SGAs are probably similar in the FEP population in these 
countries, and interventions to counteract the metabolic 
side  effects  are  nonexistent  or  limited.  (d)  Mobile  tech-
nology interventions such as SMS reminders can improve 
treatment engagement in this population. (e) The group 
interventions can help to reduce EE among the carers of 
FEP. We also aimed to examine the cost-effectiveness of 
EIS in LMIC but none of the included studies provided a 
cost-effective evaluation.

One  previous  systematic  review43  examined  the  care 
pathways for psychosis in LMIC and highlighted the role 
of  traditional  healers  in  the  care  pathways.  Despite  the 
evidence  that  TSHs  play  a  crucial  role  in  treating  FEP 
in  LMIC,  long  periods  of  treatment  by  these  healers 
significantly  contribute  to  the  exceptionally  long  DUP 
The role of TSH in schizophrenia care in LMIC is well 
known14,22  but  the  literature  on  how  traditional  healers 

Early Intervention in Psychosis and Management of FEP in LMIC

can  be  involved  in  the  early  identification  and  manage-
ment  of  FEP  is  sparse.  A  model  of  EIP  in  LMIC  will 
need training and involvement of TSH in the early detec-
tion and management of FEP. A recent study22 has pro-
posed a model for involving TSH in the early detection 
and  management  of  FEP  and  evaluating  its  feasibility 
but this has not been evaluated fully.

Our review showed that the 7 key components of EIP 
services  identified  in  NICE16  recommendations  could 
be  adapted  for  use  in  LMIC.  The  major  modifications 
for  implementing  EIP  include  the  following:  (a)  A  col-
laborative  care  pathway  between  the  faith  healers  and 
the  healthcare  professionals35  and  referrals  from  a  wide 
range of care providers ranging from general hospitals to 
young  people  themselves.34  (b)  The  adaptation  of  phar-
macological  management  in  view  of  limited  availability 
of SGAs and use of long-acting depot antipsychotic.28,36 
(c)  Greater  role  of  the  family  in  care  provision  and  in 
maintaining treatment engagement.34,37 (d) Case manager 
role adopted by a clinician in view of a limited number 
of trained professionals. It was clear that standalone EIP 
teams are not feasible in LMIC, and the service will be 
provided by existing mental health teams.

There are certain elements of EIS that can be adapted 
relatively  easily  in  LMIC.  This  would  include,  eg,  pro-
viding  evidence-based  pharmacological  treatment  for 
managing FEP, as almost all SGAs are available in these 
countries.  Other  interventions  such  as  providing  cogni-
tive therapy will need cultural adaptation and using inno-
vative approaches to deliver therapy in view of very low 
number  of  CBT  therapists  available  in  these  countries. 
The organization of services will also be different, as EIS 
in these countries can be stand-alone services as in HIC. 
Finally,  EIS  services  in  LMIC  will  have  certain  unique 
features that do not fit well within the 7 key elements of 
good EIS as described in NICE guidance. This includes 
cultural  and  religious  aspects  of  care  such  as  including 
TSH in the care pathways for EIS, These aspects of ad-
aptation of EIS in LMIC need to be identified and evalu-
ated in future research studies.

The  studies  involving  the  use  of  antipsychotics  high-
lighted the increased rates of metabolic side effects in the 
young FEP population.44 Patients with schizophrenia die 
about  10  years  earlier  than  the  general  population  due 
to cardiovascular disease.44 The mortality and morbidity 
may be even greater in South Asian populations who are 
at higher risk of developing cardiovascular disease with 
poorer  outcomes45  and  limited  health  facilities.  This  re-
quires careful adaptation of current guidelines for LMIC 
in selecting and monitoring the use of SGAs.

Our literature review identified a few important gaps in 
providing EIP for LMIC. There was little evidence of the 
involvement of primary care in EIP, reflecting the lack of 
involvement of general practice in the care of psychosis 
in  LMIC.  Similarly,  task-sharing  and  task-shifting  ap-
proaches46 which have been widely used for the scale-up 

529

S. Farooq et al

and increasing the accessibility of mental health services 
in  LMIC  were  rarely  employed  in  adapting  the  EIP  in 
the included studies. We also identified limited provision 
of educational and vocational support. Only 1 study re-
ported assistance to patients in terms of employment and 
vocational plans and found only a few patients receiving 
this in a cohort of FEP patients. Adequate employment 
and  educational  support  for  young  people  with  FEP  is 
crucial in developing, recovering, and maintaining their 
occupational skills.

Reducing the unacceptably long DUP in LMIC must 
be a key target of EIP services and hence there is a need 
for  studies  to  detect  and  manage  young  persons  during 
the  prodrome.  Interventions  for  the  long  DUP  require 
phase-specific  medical  and  psychological  treatments  in 
EIS and reducing delays in treatment following the onset 
of  psychosis  through  early  recognition.47  However,  we 
could  find  only  1  study  that  described  the  potential  de-
velopment  of  a  CHiRP  intended  to  identify  young  in-
dividuals  at  CHR.  This  represents  an  important  gap  in 
evidence and clinical practice and needs to be addressed 
in future research.

Limitations of this study include a high risk of bias in 
most of the included studies. Key concepts such as FEP 
were not clearly defined in several studies and there was 
no  controlled  evaluation  of  EIP.  It  is  difficult  to  gener-
alize  the  findings  as  the  studies  were  published  by  only 
6  LMIC  and  were  almost  entirely  done  in  specialized 
settings. The LMIC are not a homogenous group, these 
countries  have  diverse  populations,  cultures,  and  socio-
economic  conditions  and  hence  the  findings  cannot  be 
generalized  across  all  LMIC.  We  did  include  gray  liter-
ature in the search strategy and it is possible that studies 
describing  health  services  or  programs  may  have  been 
missed.  The  cost-effectiveness  of  EIP  interventions  or 
services has not been studied in LMIC settings. However, 
evidence from HIC suggests that EIP can have an incre-
mental cost-effectiveness ratio of approximately $51 600 
per Quality Adjusted Life Year.

From a societal perspective, this translates into much 
fewer  hospitalizations  and  more  years  of  employment 
throughout the remaining life expectancy of young FEP 
patients.48 In LMIC, the impacts would be much greater 
given the existing huge treatment gaps. It is therefore cru-
cial to develop and evaluate EIP services in LMIC. This 
review  provides  a  framework  for  the  development  of  a 
service model for EIP in resource-poor settings and inter-
ventions that can be used to treat people with FEP. While 
specialist EIP services will not be feasible in these coun-
tries,  it  is  possible  to  provide  these  services  based  on  a 
public health approach.12

Future  research  needs  to  focus  on  controlled  evalua-
tion of EIP, implement and evaluate the evidence-based 
guidelines for managing the FEP in LMIC settings, and 
agree on quality standards that can be used for monitoring 
the quality of services. Future research needs to consider 

530

implementation  frameworks  such  as  RE-AIM  (Reach, 
Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance) 
that  help  to  evaluate  the  implementation  as  well  as  the 
outcome  of  the  service.  The  studies  included  in  this  re-
view  paid  little  attention  to  the  patient  and  public  in-
volvement and it will be important to include the service 
users in all stages of research in this area.

Conclusion

The  available  evidence  suggests  that  EIP  can  be  de-
livered  in  LMIC  by  adapting  cultural  factors  and  con-
sidering  resource  constraints.  These  adaptations  might 
include  partnering  with  traditional  healers,  engaging 
nonspecialist  healthcare  personnel,  leveraging  mobile 
technology, optimizing the utilization of long-acting an-
tipsychotic medications, and closely monitoring the po-
tential side effects of antipsychotics. Further research is 
needed using the implementation research methodologies 
to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of EIP 
in LMIC.
