Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and alcohol use disorder (AUD) are often comorbid. Few treatments exist to reduce comorbid
PTSD/AUD. Elucidating the mechanisms underlying their comorbidity could reveal new avenues for therapy. Here, we employed a
model of comorbid PTSD/AUD, in which rats were subjected to a stressful shock in a familiar context followed by alcohol drinking.
We then examined fear overgeneralization and irritability in these rats. Familiar context stress elevated drinking, increased fear
overgeneralization, increased alcohol-related aggressive signs, and elevated peripheral stress hormones. We then examined
transcripts of stress- and fear-relevant genes in the central amygdala (CeA), a locus that regulates stress-mediated alcohol drinking.
Compared with unstressed rats, stressed rats exhibited increases in CeA transcripts for Crh and Fkbp5 and decreases in transcripts
for Bdnf and Il18. Levels of Nr3c1 mRNA, which encodes the glucocorticoid receptor, increased in stressed males but decreased in
stressed females. Transcripts of Il18 binding protein (Il18bp), Glp-1r, and genes associated with calcitonin gene-related peptide
signaling (Calca, Ramp1, Crlr-1, and Iapp) were unaltered. Crh, but not Crhr1, mRNA was increased by stress; thus, we tested whether
inhibiting CeA neurons that express corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) suppress PTSD/AUD-like behaviors. We used Crh-Cre rats
that had received a Cre-dependent vector encoding hM4D(Gi), an inhibitory Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer
Drugs. Chemogenetic inhibition of CeA CRF neurons reduced alcohol intake but not fear overgeneralization or irritability-like
behaviors. Our ﬁndings suggest that CeA CRF modulates PTSD/AUD comorbidity, and inhibiting CRF neural activity is primarily
associated with reducing alcohol drinking but not trauma-related behaviors that are associated with PTSD/AUD.

INTRODUCTION
Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) commonly is comorbid with
substance use disorders,
including alcohol use disorder (AUD)
[1–3]. Symptoms of comorbid PTSD/AUD include excessive
generalized fear and anxiety, drinking-related aggression, and
alcohol drinking to cope with emotional dysregulation (i.e.,
negative reinforcement) [4–7]. Individuals with PTSD also develop
AUD more rapidly than non-PTSD individuals, with heightened
negative affective phenotypes, such as suicidal ideation and social
isolation [6, 8, 9]. Pharmacotherapies to treat both PTSD/AUD
remain limited. Thus,
identifying shared neural mechanisms of
PTSD/AUD may reveal new therapeutic avenues to treat these
comorbid disorders.

Stress-mediated alcohol drinking is inﬂuenced by neuroendo-
crine stress responses via the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal
(HPA) axis [10–12]. Stress canonically activates the HPA axis via

the release of corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF)
into portal
blood, and it also orchestrates an array of additional behavioral
and physiological responses to stress and alcohol [13] via the
into non-
paracrine/autocrine release of diverse peptides
neuroendocrine circuits. One such region, the central amygdala
(CeA), contains extrahypothalamic CRF neurons that release CRF
locally within and outside the CeA, and this CeA CRF system can
modulate stress and alcohol drinking in rodents [13, 14]. In animal
models, CRF is released in the CeA during alcohol withdrawal [15],
and CRF1 receptor blockade decreases escalated drinking [16–18]
and negative affective behaviors that are associated with alcohol
withdrawal
the inhibition of CeA CRF-
expressing neurons reduces escalated alcohol drinking and
physical signs of alcohol withdrawal in rats [20].

Importantly,

[15, 19].

Much literature has broadened our understanding of

the
involvement of CeA CRF in stress and alcohol drinking. Newly

emerging studies have provided new insights
into other
neuropeptides and proteins in the CeA that are also regulated
by stress and alcohol. Recent work demonstrated that stress and
alcohol drinking inﬂuence glucocorticoid receptor (GR) signaling,
increasing the abundance of FK-binding protein 51 (FKBP5), a co-
chaperone that is key for GR transcriptional activity [21–25].
Another neuropeptide that is inﬂuenced by stress and alcohol is
calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP). CGRP immunoﬂuores-
cence increases in cortical and limbic brain regions following
alcohol exposure and withdrawal, and CGRP+ neurons from the
parabrachial nucleus synapse onto CeA neurons [26, 27]. Further-
more, the role of neuroinﬂammatory signaling has also gained
interest in stress-mediated alcohol drinking. Alcohol intoxication
increases interleukin-18 (IL-18). Recent work from our group found
that IL-18 signaling in the CeA is impaired after traumatic stress
and alcohol drinking [28–30]. Thus, it is important to understand
whether these molecular systems play a role in PTSD/AUD.

We recently developed a comorbid model of PTSD/AUD-like
behavior [31]. This is an avoidance-based model of traumatic
stress that combines re-experiencing footshock in a familiar
context with alcohol drinking. This procedure results in fear
overgeneralization and irritability-like behaviors post-alcohol
abstinence and greater alcohol drinking and anxiety-like behavior
that resemble symptoms of comorbid PTSD/AUD [31, 32]. The
present study employed this model to compare effects of familiar
“2-hit” stress vs. no stress in male and female rats. We then
assessed CeA expression of stress-related genes,
including CRF
(Crh), CRF1 receptor (Crhr1), Fkbp5, brain-derived neurotrophic
factor (Bdnf), and nuclear receptor subfamily 3 group C member 1
(Nr3c1; which encodes the GR), which are known to modulate
anxiety and alcohol drinking [23, 33]. We also evaluated transcripts
for CGRP system-related gene targets, such as calcitonin-related
polypeptide α (Calca), receptor activity modify protein 1 (Ramp1),
calcitonin receptor-like receptor 1 (Crlr-1), glucagon-like peptide 1
(Glp-1r), and islet amyloid polypeptide (Iapp), and neuroinﬂamma-
including Il18 and Il18 binding protein (Il18bp)
tory targets,
[30, 34–37]. Among the transcript changes, we observed a
signiﬁcant increase in Crh, but not Crhr1, mRNA induced by stress,
thus, we tested whether chemogenetic inhibition of CeA CRF-
expressing neurons modulates phenotypes of comorbid PTSD/
AUD in Crh-Cre male and female rats and examined sex
differences. The overall aim of targeting CRF is to provide deeper
insight into CeA CRF pro-stress role in modulating PTSD associated
alcohol drinking.

METHODS AND MATERIALS
Animals
A total of n = 71 wildtype Wistar and n = 50 heterozygous Crh-Cre (Wistar
background) male and female rats were used in this study [38]. All rats
were pair-housed, separated by a perforated clear Plexiglas divider, and
had access to food and water ad libitum before the experiments began. All
experimental procedures were approved by The Scripps Research Institute
(TSRI) Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (protocol no. 09-0006).
All procedures followed the National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care
and Use of Laboratory Animals (8th edition).

Overall approach
This report consisted of three studies that were conducted in separate
cohorts of rats. Study 1 (n = 35 rats) examined effects of stress and alcohol
in an established paradigm of comorbid PTSD/AUD [31, 32]. This study
utilized familiar inhibitory avoidance shock stress procedures, followed by
alcohol drinking,
fear overgeneralization, bottle bush irritability, and
assessments of peripheral stress hormones (corticosterone [CORT] and
adrenocorticotropic hormone [ACTH]). Unstressed controls underwent
similar procedures, except they did not receive footshocks. To understand
the role of other stress-related peptide genes, Study 2 (n = 36 rats)
examined transcript levels for Crh, Crhr1, Fkbp5, Bdnf, Nr3c1, Calca, Il18,
Iapp (which encodes pro-amylin), and Glp-1r in a
Il18bp, Ramp1, Crlr-1,

separate cohort of rats that underwent a similar comorbid PTSD/AUD 2-hit
model procedure. A separate cohort of rats (n = 25) was tested for changes
in these genes under shock stress but non-drinking conditions. In Study 3
(n = 50), CeA CRF-expressing neurons in Crh-Cre rats were transduced for
Cre-dependent Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer
Drugs (DREADDs) or control vector (Cre-dependent) to selectively inhibit
these CRF neurons. Surgeries occurred after footshock stress. The rats were
allowed to recover from surgery and then received access to alcohol
drinking, followed by testing for fear overgeneralization and irritability-like
behavior. The administration of clozapine-N-oxide (CNO; 2 mg/kg, i.p.) or
vehicle (5% dimethylsulfoxide [DMSO] with 0.9% saline) was given on the
last day of drinking and on each behavioral test day.

Familiar footshock stress
The “2-hit” footshock stress procedures were conducted using a familiar
context in an inhibitory avoidance procedure as previously reported
[31, 32, 39]. Footshock stress (3.0 mA for 2 s) was administered on two
single shock instances after crossing from a lit compartment to a dark
compartment in the same contextual environment (familiar), separated by
48 h. The latency to cross (in seconds) into the dark compartment was
measured. Unstressed controls underwent similar procedures without the
presence of footshock.

Voluntary alcohol regimen
Two weeks after the initial shock, all rats received an initial 48 h acclimation
to the alcohol (20% v/v) bottle in addition to the water bottle, followed by
intermittent (Monday, Wednesday, Friday), two-bottle choice (2BC) limited
access (2 h) for 4 weeks in their home cage as previously described
[31, 32, 39]. Blood alcohol levels (BALs) were measured in the middle of week
4 (Day 11 of 2BC), 30 min into their 2 h session before rats began their
abstinence period. To validate BALs,
intake and preference in rats that
showed detectable levels within the 30 min were compared to rats that
displayed non-detectable levels (see Fig. S1a, b) as previously reported [39].

Fear overgeneralization
All rats were tested in a fear overgeneralization paradigm that consisted of
a modiﬁed inhibitory avoidance box and were given a maximum of 10 min
to enter the dark compartment as previously described [31, 32, 39]. The
latency to cross (in seconds) into the dark compartment was recorded, and
animals that never crossed were recorded as having a latency of 600 s
(10 min).

Bottle-brush irritability
Bottle-brush irritability was assessed by scoring aggressive-like behaviors
(biting, boxing, following, and mounting), defensive behaviors (startling,
freezing, climbing cage walls, vocalizing, and attempting to
digging,
escape), and general explorative behaviors (grooming,
rearing, and
exploring) as previously described [31, 39].

Stress hormone analysis
Plasma samples were analyzed using commercially available MilliPlex kits
(Millipore Sigma) that are speciﬁc for CORT, ACTH, and melatonin as
previously reported [39]. Trunk blood was collected in Study 1 in
ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) tubes (BD Vacutainer K2 EDTA)
then placed on ice 1 week after the last behavioral test during the rats’
active phase 2 h into their dark cycle (between 10 AM and 2 PM). The
centrifuged plasma samples were analyzed on a MAGPIX system using
xPONENT software. The intra-assay coefﬁcients of variation were < 10%.

Quantitative polymerase chain reaction
Rats were anesthetized with isoﬂurane and rapidly decapitated. Brains
were harvested, ﬂash frozen in dry ice-cooled isopentane, and stored at
−80 °C until analysis. The CeA was dissected from coronal cryostat sections
(400 μm) using a stainless-steel punch. mRNA was isolated from the CeA
using Trizol (Invitrogen; catalog no. 15596026) and RNA extraction kits
(Zymo Research; catalog no. NC9972645). cDNA synthesis was conducted
using SuperScript IV exDNAse kits (Invitrogen; catalog no. 11766050). cDNA
was ampliﬁed using SYBR green PowerTrack master mix (Applied
Biosystems; catalog no. A46109) and quantiﬁed by quantitative polymer-
ase chain reaction (qPCR) on the QuantStudio 5 system. Crh, Crhr1, Fkbp5,
Bdnf, Nr3c1, Calca, Il18, Il18bp, Ramp1, Crlr-1, Iapp, and Glp-1r mRNA fold
changes are expressed relative to unstressed controls and were normalized

Stereotaxic surgery
For the chemogenetic study, rats were anesthetized with an isoﬂurane/
oxygen mixture (1–3%) and placed on a stereotaxic apparatus. Cre-
dependent viral vectors that contained the inhibitory DREADD (AAV8-
hSyn-DIO-hM4D[Gi]-mCherry;
reporter control
(AAV8-hSyn-DIO-mCherry; titer: ≥1 × 10¹³ vg/ml) were purchased from
Addgene (catalog no. 4462 and 50459). Viral vectors were injected
bilaterally in the CeA (anterior/posterior: −2.16 mm; medial/lateral: ±
4.3 mm; dorsal/ventral: −8.5 mm from ﬂat skull). The infusion rate was
150 nl/min for 5 min. After the infusion, the injectors remained in place for
10 min before removal. Rats recovered in their home cage for 5-7 days
until the initial 48 h acclimation period to alcohol.

titer: 1 × 10¹³ vg/ml) or

Validation
For the site injection and expression validation of viral vectors, rats were
anesthetized with isoﬂurane and transcardially perfused with ice-cold
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), followed by Z-ﬁx zinc formalin ﬁxative
(Fisher Scientiﬁc, Waltham, MA, USA). Brains were dissected, immersion
ﬁxed in Z-ﬁx at 4 °C for 24 h, cryoprotected in 30% sucrose in PBS at 4 °C for
24–48 h, ﬂash frozen in isopentane, and stored at −80 °C. Brains were then
sliced on a cryostat into 20 μm thick sections, mounted on SuperFrost Plus
slides (Fisher Scientiﬁc, Waltham, MA, USA), and stored at −80 °C until use.
The CeA was imaged using a Vectra Polaris Imaging system (CLS143455).
For the functional validation of viral vectors, rats were exposed to brief
anesthesia (3–5% isoﬂurane), after which brains were rapidly extracted,
placed in ice-cold sucrose solution that contained 206.0 mM sucrose,
2.5 mM KCl, 0.5 mM CaCl2, 7.0 mM MgCl2, 1.2 mM NaH2PO4, 26 mM
NaHCO3, 5.0 mM glucose, and HEPES 5 mM, and coronally sectioned

(300 μm) on a Leica VT1000S (Leica Microsystems). After sectioning, slices
were incubated in an oxygenated (95% O2/5% CO2) artiﬁcial cerebrospinal
ﬂuid (aCSF) solution that contained 130 mM NaCl, 3.5 mM KCl, 1.25 mM
NaH2PO4, 1.5 mM MgSO4, 2 mM CaCl2, 24 mM NaHCO3, and 10 mM glucose
for 30 min at 37 °C, followed by 30 min equilibration at room temperature
(21-22 °C) as described previously [41, 42]. Electrophysiological recordings
were obtained using a Multiclamp 700B ampliﬁer, Digidata 1440 A digitizer,
and pClamp 10 software (all from Molecular Devices) at a sampling rate of
20 kHz and low-pass ﬁltered at 10 kHz. CeA neurons that contained
mCherry were identiﬁed and differentiated from unlabeled neurons using
ﬂuorescent optics and brief (<2 s) episcopic illumination. To compare
effects of hM4D(Gi) and control virus on spontaneous action potential
ﬁring,
loose cell-attached recordings were obtained in voltage-clamp
mode, and CNO (1 μM) was bath applied for 8-12 min. Four rats were
excluded from this analysis because cell-attached recording was
unattainable.

Drugs
Ethyl alcohol (200 proof; 20%) was purchased from Pharmco (Brookﬁeld,
CT, USA). CNO was purchased from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI, USA),
dissolved in 5% DMSO and diluted with 0.9% sterile saline as described
previously [43, 44], and administered 1 h before testing. The dose was
2 mg/kg (1 mg/mL, i.p.) based on prior work that showed a reduction of
fear conditioning, anxiety-like behavior, and CeA speciﬁcity in the same
Crh-Cre rat line [43, 44].

Statistical analysis
Behavioral and gene expression data in Study 1 and Study 2 were
analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA), with Stress (unstress vs.
stress) and Sex (male vs. female) as between-subjects factors. Inhibitory
footshock stress data were analyzed using repeated-measures ANOVA,
with Shock Day (hit 1 vs. hit 2) as the within-subjects factor and Stress as
the between-subjects factor. Drinking data in Study 1 were analyzed using
repeated-measures ANOVA, with Drinking across weeks (weeks 1-4) as
the within-subjects factor and Stress and Sex as between-subjects
factors. Behavioral data in Study 3 were analyzed using ANOVA, with

Virus (AAV8-hSyn-DIO-mCherry vs. AAV8-hSyn-DIO-hM4D[Gi]-mCherry),
Drug (vehicle vs. CNO), and Sex as between-subjects factors. In cases of
signiﬁcant interactions, post hoc analyses were conducted using Bonferroni
correction adjusted for multiple comparisons. Pearson’s correlation was
used to examine relationships between total mean alcohol
intake and
aggressive and defensive signs as well as peripheral stress hormones.
Validation was analyzed using a one sample t-test for within-cell percent
baseline changes. For all experiments, sample size was pre-determined
based on prior work effect sizes using a similar model [31, 39]. Simple
randomization for treatment conditions occurred prior to the start of the
experiments. Rats were arbitrarily assigned via a numbering system to
different treatment groups. All experimenters were blind to the subjects’
treatment condition during testing and sample preparations. All data were
analyzed using SPSS 29 software. All graphs were generated using
GraphPad Prism 8 software.

RESULTS
Study 1 employed an established model of familiar context stress
and alcohol drinking that exhibits symptomology of comorbid
PTSD/AUD. All shocked rats exhibited familiar context avoidance
on the second day of shock vs. unstressed rats, reﬂected by a
longer latency to cross into the dark side of the familiar shock
apparatus (Fig. 1b: Stress: F1,33 = 18.36, p < 0.01, Shock Day ×
Stress: F1,33 = 19.36, p < 0.001). Stressed rats speciﬁcally developed
avoidance-like behavior for the shocked paired side on Day 2 vs.
Day 1 of shock (p < 0.001). This effect was not observed in
unstressed rats (p = 0.998). Beginning 2 weeks after the shock
stress procedures, we measured 4 weeks of 2BC intermittent
alcohol drinking. These data are expressed as average weekly
intake (weeks 1-4) during 2BC alcohol sessions. Familiar shock

increased both alcohol

One week after the end of the 2BC drinking procedures, we
tested unstressed and stressed rats for fear overgeneralization and
irritability-like behavior. Familiar shock stress increased the latency
to cross (in seconds) and number of fecal boli (secondary fear
response index) vs. unstressed control rats in the unfamiliar
avoidance apparatus (Fig. 1e: Stress: F1,31 = 14.85, p < 0.01; Sex:
F1,31 = 0.34, p = 0.563; Stress × Sex: F1,31 = 0.33, p = 0.569; Fig. 1f:
Stress: F1,31 = 27.31, p < 0.001; Sex: F1,31 = 1.04, p = 0.315; Stress ×
Sex: F1,31 = 0.17, p = 0.677). No signiﬁcant differences were
observed in aggressive or defensive signs (Fig. 1g: Stress:
F1,31 = 2.08, p = 0.159; Sex: F1,31 = 0.84, p = 0.365; Stress × Sex:
F1,31 = 0.006, p = 0.939; Fig. 1h: Stress: F1,31 = 2.35, p = 0.135; Sex:
F1,31 = 0.01, p = 0.906; Stress × Sex: F1,31 = 0.04, p = 0.842).
However, the amount of total alcohol intake across the 4 weeks
positively correlated with the expression of aggressive signs but
not defensive signs (Fig. 1i: r = 0.42, 95% conﬁdence interval [CI] =
0.11-0.67, p = 0.010; Fig. S2:
r = −0.19, 95% CI = −0.50-0.15,
p = 0.255).

We measured enduring changes in peripheral stress hormones
in a subset of unstressed vs. stressed rats 9 weeks after the initial
familiar shock exposure. Familiar shock stress increased plasma
CORT and ACTH vs. unstressed control
rats (Fig. 1j: Stress:
F1,26 = 5.88, p = 0.023; Sex: F1,26 = 0.49, p = 0.487; Stress × Sex:
F1,26 = 7.90, p = 0.842; Fig. 1k: Stress: F1,29 = 5.59, p = 0.025; Sex:
F1,29 = 8.78, p = 0.006; Stress × Sex: F1,29 = 0.98, p = 0.329). No
changes were observed in plasma melatonin levels across stress
groups (Fig. S3: Stress: F1,25 = 0.12, p = 0.731; Sex: F1,25 = 10.71,
p = 0.003; Stress × Sex: F1,25 = 1.19, p = 0.286). Pearson r correla-
tion was also performed for plasma CORT and ACTH on total
alcohol intake. Plasma CORT or ACTH did not correlate with the

levels of total alcohol intake across groups (Fig. S4a: r = 0.29, 95%
CI = −0.07–0.60, p = 0.109; Fig. S4b:
r = −0.12, 95% CI =
−0.45–0.23, p = 0.501).

In Study 2, CeA gene expression was analyzed for several
stress- and fear-relevant peptides in a separate cohort of rats that
were subjected to familiar shock stress and alcohol drinking
11-weeks after their initial shock exposure. Familiar shock stress
increased mRNA levels of Crh (Fig. 2b: Stress: F1,24 = 4.46,
p = 0.048; Sex: F1,24 = 1.07, p = 0.310; Stress × Sex: F1,24 = 0.24,
p = 0.623) and Fkbp5 (Fig. 2d: Stress: F1,26 = 8.53, p = 0.007; Sex:
F1,26 = 0.004, p = 0.948; Stress × Sex: F1,26 = 0.004, p = 0.947) and
decreased mRNA levels of Bdnf
(Fig. 2e: Stress: F1,28 = 6.18,
p = 0.019; Sex: F1,28 = 0.53, p = 0.472; Stress × Sex: F1,28 = 0.28,
p = 0.598) and Il18 (Fig. 2l: Stress: F1,25 = 8.58, p = 0.007; Sex:
F1,25 = 2.16, p = 0.154; Stress × Sex: F1,25 = 1.66, p = 0.209) vs.
unstressed rats. Furthermore, we observed a signiﬁcant difference
in mRNA levels of Nr3c1 across males and females (Fig. 2f: Stress:
F1,25 = 8.60, p = 0.007; Sex: F1,25 = 61.59, p < 0.001; Stress × Sex:
F1,25 = 52.56, p < 0.001). Speciﬁcally, familiar shock stress increased
Nr3c1 mRNA levels in males vs. their unstressed controls (Fig. 2f;
p = 0.005), whereas it decreased Nr3c1 mRNA levels in females vs.
respective unstressed controls (Fig. 2f; p < 0.001). We
their
observed no signiﬁcant differences in Crhr1 or Calca gene
expression across familiar shock stressed groups (Fig. 2c: Stress:
F1,27 = 0.53, p = 0.469; Sex: F1,27 = 0.45, p = 0.507; Stress × Sex:
F1,27 = 0.49, p = 0.490; Fig. 2g: Stress: F1,24 = 3.37, p = 0.078; Sex:
F1,24 = 0.02, p = 0.871; Stress × Sex: F1,24 = 0.04, p = 0.836).

We also measured the expression of genes that have been more
recently associated with fear that might be linked to PTSD/AUD.
Familiar shock stress did not signiﬁcantly alter CeA mRNA levels of
Ramp1 (Fig. 2h: Stress: F1,28 = 0.02, p = 0.869; Sex: F1,28 = 1.25,
p = 0.272; Stress × Sex: F1,28 = 1.50, p = 0.230), Crlr-1 (Fig. 2i: Stress:

F1,28 = 2.75, p = 0.108), Glp-1r (Fig. 2j: Stress: F1,27 = 1.64, p = 0.214;
Sex: F1,27 = 0.02, p = 0.886; Stress × Sex: F1,27 = 0.45, p = 0.505),
Iapp (Fig. 2k: Stress: F1,26 = 1.10, p = 0.303; Sex: F1,26 = 0.21,
p = 0.644; Stress × Sex: F1,26 = 0.20, p = 0.654), or Il18bp (Fig. 2m:

Sex: F1,25 = 0.002, p = 0.965).

To examine whether changes in gene expression were altered
by stress only (without subsequent alcohol access), we measured a
subset of genes in a separate cohort of rats that were only
subjected to familiar context stress 48 h after the last shock day.
There were no signiﬁcant differences in CeA mRNA levels of Crh
(Fig. S5a: Stress: F1,24 = 0.10, p = 0.748; Sex: F1,24 = 0.02, p = 0.872;
Stress × Sex: F1,24 = 0.62, p = 0.437), Crhr1 (Fig. S5b: Stress:
F1,25 = 2.82, p = 0.105; Sex: F1,25 = 1.49, p = 0.233; Stress × Sex:
F1, 25 = 1.36, p = 0.253), Fkbp5 (Fig. S5c: Stress: F1,24 = 2.27,
p = 0.112; Sex: F1,24 = 1.04, p = 0.317; Stress × Sex: F1,24 = 0.48,
p = 0.493), or Bdnf (Fig. S5d: Stress: F1,25 = 0.55, p = 0.465; Sex:
F1,25 = 0.07, p = 0.793; Stress × Sex: F1,24 = 0.21, p = 0.649) across
groups.

In Study 3, we used a chemogenetic approach to test whether
selectively inactivating CRF-expressing neurons
in the CeA
reduces comorbid phenotypes of PTSD and alcohol drinking. All
Crh-Cre rats were stressed and exhibited inhibitory avoidance-like
behavior on the second day of shock vs. day one (Fig. 3b: Shock
Day: F1,48 = 31.43, p < 0.001; Shock Day × Sex: F1,48 = 4.079,
p = 0.049; post hoc: p < 0.001). Furthermore, our analysis revealed
a signiﬁcant difference in alcohol
intake across Virus and CNO
administration (Fig. 3c: Virus: F1,42 = 16.14, p < 0.001; Drug:
F1,42 = 0.11, p = 0.736; Sex: F1,42 = 10.14, p = 0.003; Virus × Drug:
F1,42 = 6.59, p = 0.014; Virus × Drug × Sex: F1,42 = 2.32, p = 0.135).
Speciﬁcally, CNO administration (2 mg/kg) in stressed hDM4(Gi)-
expressing rats decreased 2 h alcohol intake vs. their respective
vehicle-treated controls (p = 0.044) and viral vector controls
(p < 0.001). We observed no signiﬁcant differences in alcohol

changes in the ﬁring rate of either mCherry- (t = 1.98, p = 0.145)
or mCherry+ (t = 0.66, p = 0.575) cells (Fig. 4c).

DISCUSSION
The present study examined potential CeA gene targets and
functional circuit mechanisms that may be involved in comorbid
PTSD/AUD in rats. We found similar increases in alcohol drinking,
fear overgeneralization, peripheral stress hormone levels, and
drinking-related irritability-like behavior after familiar shock stress
as previously described [31, 32, 39]. Familiar shock stress and alcohol
drinking disrupted the expression of several stress- and fear-relevant
genes (including Crh) in CeA tissue. Using a chemogenetic approach,
the selective inhibition of CRF CeA neurons
we found that
signiﬁcantly decreased alcohol
intake but not trauma-associated
avoidance- or aggressive-like behaviors. Overall, our ﬁndings
support a role for CeA CRF systems in post-traumatic drinking and
add further evidence that other stress targets, including CeA Fkbp5,
Bdnf, and Nr3c1, are involved in comorbid PTSD/AUD.

Our ﬁndings revealed signiﬁcant increases in Crh and Fkbp5,
decreases in Bdnf, but no change in Crhr1 gene expression in the
CeA that were produced by our comorbid stress and drinking
model. We recognize the historical evidence of Crh upregulation in
the CeA following chronic alcohol withdrawal and stress exposure
[45–50]. Our changes in gene expression in the CeA appeared to

be driven by the combination of familiar shock stress and alcohol
because a subset of stress-only rats, measured 48 h after stress
exposure, did not exhibit changes in these genes (see Supple-
mentary Results). However, we note that the lack of changes after
48 h may be attributable to differences in the timing of tissue
collection (i.e., 48 h vs. 11 weeks) after the initial shock stress

expression were also observed in stressed rats. This ﬁnding is
consistent with several studies that reported that alcohol with-
drawal severity positively correlates with Fkbp5 levels, PTSD
increases DNA methylation for Fkbp5, and alcohol administration
increases Fkbp5 mRNA in rats [21–23, 51, 52]. Importantly, recent
work from our group showed that inhibiting FKBP5 via broad-
acting and selective FKBP5 inhibitors has efﬁcacy in decreasing
comorbid PTSD/AUD-like behaviors in rats [39, 53].

CeA Nr3c1 displayed distinct

transcript expression that
increased in stressed males and decreased in stressed females
vs. controls. This ﬁnding suggests possible sex differences in the
regulation of GR signaling in stressed and alcohol-exposed rats. A
recent study from our group found that naive female rats
exhibited higher CeA Nr3c1 gene expression than males, and
stress exposure or alcohol may differentially change Nr3c1 gene
transcript levels after a history of stress and alcohol exposure [54].
Parameters in the latter study used in situ hybridization methods,
which can account for cell type-selective changes that are not
controlled in bulk qPCR gene expression methods. A report that
found similar
used a high drinking strain of mice (HDID-1)
decreases in striatal Nr3c1 [23]. Alcohol withdrawal also decreases
GR mRNA levels in multiple stress- and reward-associated regions
[23, 24, 55]. These studies suggest that stress combined with
alcohol drinking history may differentially recruit GR systems

between males and females. Future studies are needed to assess
the sensitivity of GR-targeting compounds and sex differences for
the treatment of comorbid PTSD/AUD [30, 39, 54].

We found no signiﬁcant changes in CeA gene transcript levels
for Ramp1, Crlr-1, Iapp, Glp-1r, or Il18bp. However, transcript levels
for Calca showed the largest mean-fold change of all studied
targets (Fig. 2, summary; p = 0.07). This lack of changes does not
support their known role for encoding molecules in stress, fear,
and drinking behavior [37, 56–58]. Additionally, Glp-1r and Iapp
were shown to play important roles in alcohol drinking and
dependence using other rodent models and in other brain areas
[36, 59, 60]. Given the trend for altered Calca mRNA expression, we
cannot exclude changes in CeA expression of this calcitonin-
in our comorbid PTSD/AUD model. Future
system precursor
studies will examine expression of splice-processed transcripts
that encode calcitonin or CGRP, given that these systems are
linked to threat perception, aversive memories, and alcohol intake.
[26, 61]. To our knowledge, these genes have not been explored in
the CeA in comorbid PTSD/AUD-like rodent models.

Prior work showed that predator odor stress and chronic
alcohol exposure increased CRF expression in the CeA in rodents
[14, 48, 50]. We found that Crh mRNA was elevated in the CeA in
stressed rats. Thus, we examined whether
inhibiting CRF-
expressing neurons in the CeA reduces behavioral phenotypes
of comorbid PTSD/AUD in Crh-Cre rats [20, 38]. We found that the
chemogenetic inhibition of CRF CeA neurons decreased alcohol
intake but not fear overgeneralization or irritability-like behavior.
Our results for alcohol consumption are similar to results from a
prior study with this same transgenic line, showing that the
optogenetic inhibition of CRF CeA neurons decreased the
escalation of alcohol intake and somatic signs of withdrawal in
rats [20]. A surprising ﬁnding was that
alcohol-dependent
chemogenetic inhibition did not reduce fear overgeneralization

or
irritability because prior work found that chemogenetic
inhibition or caspase3 genetic ablation decreased anxiety-like
behavior following immobilization stress in Crh-Cre rats [43, 44].
We also acknowledge prior work that showed that the chemo-
genetic stimulation or inhibition of CeA CRF-expressing neurons
did not affect alcohol drinking or negative affective behavior in
dependent Crh-IRES-Cre mice [48]. We suggest
that species
differences (Crh-Cre rats vs. Crh-IRES-Cre mice) can yield non-
parallel results, particularly for alcohol drinking or differences in
the engagement of stress systems (e.g., by shock stress) before
alcohol drinking. The lack of changes in trauma-related behaviors
might also be mediated by CRF projections outside the CeA, such
that the inhibition of CeA CRF neurons alone is insufﬁcient to
impact these behaviors.

The neurobiological mechanisms in this report require further
assessments. We speculate that
comorbid PTSD/AUD are
mediated by CeA γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic signaling
because prior work identiﬁed an increase in CeA GABAergic
signaling in stressed rats, possibly through CRF, FKBP5 (GR co-
chaperone), and Nr3c1 (which encodes the GR) [31, 39, 62–64].
Indeed, the chemogenetic or optogenetic stimulation of CeA CRF
increased GABA transmission (via an increase in
neurons
spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic current
in a
subset of CeA neurons in Crh-Cre rats and Crh-IRES-Cre mice,
mimicking the increases in GABAergic transmission following
familiar stress and alcohol drinking [38, 65]. Another possibility is
that familiar shock stress and alcohol drinking may synergistically
affect CeA GABAergic transmission, possibly through FKBP5/GR
mechanisms, by facilitating the ligand activation of GR and its
subsequent translocation into the nucleus [66]. This possibility is
supported by work that showed that a GR antagonist decreased
CeA GABAergic signaling in alcohol-dependent rats, as well as
Fkbp5 gene expression [63, 67].
Importantly, GR antagonists

prevent and reverse the increase in alcohol self-administration
that is associated with alcohol dependence and in genetically
selected, alcohol-preferring rodent models [24, 25, 55, 68–70].
Future studies are needed to disentangle the mechanisms in
stress-mediated alcohol drinking and trauma-induced anxiety.

We note that systemic administration of CNO in DREADD-
infused animals can inhibit both local CRF and CRF outside the
CeA inﬂuencing our behavioral results. Optogenetic inhibition of
local CeA CRF neurons prevents escalation of alcohol drinking in
Crh-Cre rats [20]. Downstream neuronal

projections to the bed nucleus stria terminalis (BNST) decreases
alcohol intake [20]. This inhibition of CRF CeA-BNST pathway is
dependent upon the CRF-CRF receptor 1 system with R121919
(CRF1 receptor antagonist) blocking the optogenetic inhibition of
CRF CeA input neurons [20]. The putative role of CRF outside the
extended amygdala structures has also been explored. Excitation
of CRF CeA to locus coeruleus (LC) pathway increases anxiety-like
behavior, an effect blocked by the administration of antalarmin
(CRF1 receptor antagonist) [71]. Hypothalamic CRF deﬁciency in
KO mice and inhibition of CRF1 in rats decreases anxiety-like
behaviors versus controls [72].

In conclusion, we found that familiar shock stress increased
phenotypes of comorbid PTSD/AUD, including increases in alcohol
drinking, fear overgeneralization, peripheral stress hormone levels,
and alcohol-associated irritability-like behavior, recapitulating our
prior work and the work of others [31, 32, 39, 73, 74]. Familiar
stress and alcohol drinking dysregulate stress and fear-based gene
expression in the CeA, providing a region of interest to study the
underlying deﬁcits of PTSD/AUD. The selective inhibition of CeA
CRF neurons reduced alcohol intake but not fear overgeneraliza-
tion or irritability-like behavior, suggesting that the modulation of
trauma-related behavior may include circuits outside the CeA or
other molecular targets. It is essential to examine the expression
proﬁles of other targets such as Fkbp5 (encodes for GR co-
chaperone) or Nr3c1 (encodes for GR)
in the CeA upon CRF
inhibition that may provide insight into CRF-related mechanisms.
Collectively, these data provide insight into the contribution of
CeA CRF and related molecular mechanisms on susceptibility to
PTSD/AUD.
