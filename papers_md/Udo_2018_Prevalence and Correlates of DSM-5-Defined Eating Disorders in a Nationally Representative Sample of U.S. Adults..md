Abstract

Background—There exist few population-based data on the prevalence of eating disorders 
(EDs) and this is especially needed because of changes to diagnoses in the DSM-5. This study 
aimed to provide lifetime and 12-month prevalence estimates of DSM-5 anorexia nervosa (AN), 
bulimia nervosa (BN), and binge-eating disorder (BED) from the 2012–2013 National 
Epidemiologic Survey Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC-III).

Methods—A national sample of 36,306 U.S. adults completed structured diagnostic interviews 
(AUDADIS-5).

Results—Prevalence (standard error) estimates of lifetime AN, BN, and BED were 0.80% 
(0.07%), 0.28% (0.03%), and 0.85% (0.05%). 12-month estimates for AN, BN, and BED were 
0.05% (0.02%), 0.14% (0.02%), and 0.44% (0.04%). Adjusting for age, race/ethnicity, education, 
and income, odds of lifetime and 12-month diagnoses of all three EDs were significantly greater 
for women than men. Adjusted odds ratios (AORs) of lifetime AN were significantly lower for 
non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic than for White respondents. AORs of lifetime and 12-month BN 
did not differ significantly by race/ethnicity. AOR of lifetime BED, but not 12-month, was 
significantly lower for non-Hispanic Black relative to non-Hispanic White respondents; AORs of 
BED for Hispanic and non-Hispanic White respondents did not differ significantly. AN, BN, and 
BED were characterized by significant differences in ages of onset, persistence and duration of 
episodes, and rates of current obesity and psychosocial impairment.

Conclusions—These findings for DSM-5-defined EDs, based on the largest national sample of 
U.S. adults studied to date, indicate some important similarities and differences to earlier smaller 
nationally representative studies.

There exist few nationally representative population-based data on the prevalence of eating 
disorders (EDs) (1). In the United States, the National Institutes of Mental Health 
Collaborative Psychiatric Epidemiological Studies (CPES; 2) comprised three nationally 
representative samples of adults assessed with diagnostic interviews: National Comorbidity 
Survey-Replication (NCS-R; 3), National Survey American Life (NSAL; 4), and National 
Latino and Asian American Study (NLAAS; 5). NCS-R used structured lay-administered 
diagnostic interviews (Composite International Diagnostic Interview; CIDI) to generate 
DSM-IV-based psychiatric diagnoses, including anorexia nervosa (AN), bulimia nervosa 
(BN), and binge-eating disorder (BED; which was not a “formal” diagnosis but included as a 
provisional diagnosis category and criteria set). Hudson and colleagues (6) analyzed data 
from a subset of N=2980 respondents (randomly selected from larger NCS-R pool of 
N=5692), and reported lifetime prevalence estimates for AN, BN, and BED as 0.6%, 1.0%, 
and 2.8% (0.9%, 1.5%, and 3.5% among women, and 0.3%, 0.5%, and 2.0% among men). 
Marques and colleagues (7) compared ED prevalence rates across ethnic/racial groups by 
pooling CPES data, including NCS-R (6) aggregated with N=3750 African-American from 
NSAL and N=2554 Latinos and N=2095 Asian-Americans from NLAAS. Similar 
prevalence estimates for AN and BED across ethnic/racial groups but higher estimates for 
BN among Latino and African-American than White respondents were reported (7).

Data from large-scale nationally-representative samples assessed with diagnostic interviews 
is required to update prevalence estimates of EDs in the U.S. Expert reviews of worldwide 
ED epidemiology have emphasized the need for larger rigorous studies to produce a better 
understanding of prevalence and distribution of EDs (1). This is especially needed because 
of recent changes in diagnoses and criteria of EDs in DSM-5 (8), which could impact 
prevalence estimates. In DSM-5, AN diagnosis no longer requires amenorrhea and now 
defines low-weight as less than minimally normal/expected. The BN diagnosis now has a 
frequency requirement of once-weekly for binge-eating and weight-compensatory behaviors, 
a lower frequency than twice-weekly in the DSM-IV. BED, now a “formal” diagnosis, is 
also defined with a lower frequency requirement of once-weekly binge-eating for 3-months 
to parallel the BN diagnosis.

Research on the impact of changes between DSM-IV and DSM-5 on prevalence of EDs has 
been limited. One study from Switzerland, which used diagnostic interviews to assess a 
nationally representative sample of 10,038 residents, examined differences between DSM-
IV and DSM-5 for AN (9). A Swedish Twin Study re-analyzed data from diagnostic 
interviews with 13,295 female twins to estimate impact of reduced frequency/duration 
criteria for binge-eating on estimates for BN and BED (10). One U.S.-based internet survey 
study of 22,397 respondents used self-reports to estimate prevalence of BED based on DSM-
IV and DSM-5 (11). These studies suggested DSM-5-based criteria yielded higher estimates 
for AN (9), BN (10), and BED (11). To date, however, no study has estimated the DSM-5-

defined prevalence of EDs using diagnostic interviews with a large-scale nationally 
representative U.S. sample.

This study aimed to provide lifetime and 12-month prevalence estimates of DSM-5 AN, BN, 
and BED in a nationally-representative sample of U.S. adults using data from 2012–2013 
National Epidemiologic Survey Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC-III). NESARC-
III, which included 36,309 respondents assessed with lay-administered diagnostic 
interviews, is by far the largest nationally-representative sample of U.S. adults to allow for 
estimating prevalence of AN, BN, and BED following the DSM-5 (8).

Methods and Materials

Sample

NESARC-III included 36,309 non-institutionalized U.S. civilians 18 years and older (12, 
13). Respondents completed computer-assisted face-to-face personal interviews between 
April 2012 and June 2013. NESARC employed multi-stage probabilistic sampling with 
counties or groups of contiguous counties as primary sampling units, groups of Census-
defined blocks as secondary sampling units, and households within secondary sampling 
units as tertiary sampling units. Within each household, eligible adults were randomly 
selected but with Hispanic, Black, and Asian household members oversampled (i.e., two 
respondents from households with more than four eligible minority members) relative to 
White household members. Household response rate was 72% and person-level response 
rate was 84%, yielding an overall response rate of 60.1% (13). Data were adjusted for non-
response and weighted to represent the U.S. population based on Bureau of the Census 2012 
American Community Survey. NESARC-III was approved by the NIH IRB and respondents 
provided oral informed-consent which was electronically recorded (13). The authors 
obtained IRB exempt approval from SUNY-Albany to perform analyses.

Measurement

Sociodemographic Characteristics—Respondents provided sociodemographic 
information including age, sex, ethnicity/race (non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic Black, 
Hispanic, non-Hispanic Asian/Pacific Islander, and non-Hispanic American-Indian/Alaska 
Native, and Hispanic [any race]), education (categorized as less than H.S., H.S./GED, at 
least some college), and income (categorized as <$25,000, $25,000–39,999, $40,000–
69,999, ≤$70,000).

Body mass index (BMI)—Self-reported height and weight were used to calculate BMI.

Diagnostic Assessment—NESARC-III used the NIAAA Alcohol Use Disorder and 
Associated Disabilities Interview Schedule-5 (AUDADIS-5; 14) to assess DSM-5-defined 
psychiatric disorders and their criteria, including AN, BN, and BED. The AUDADIS-5 
assessed age at onset and age for most recent episode in order to calculate 12-month and 
lifetime prevalence estimates and assessed for impairment in social function due to EDs, 
including: (1) interference with normal daily activities, (2) serious problems getting along 
with others, and (3) serious problems fulfilling responsibilities.

AUDADIS-5 was administered by 970 trained lay assessors who had an average of five 
years of experience with health-related surveys (13). Good test-retest reliability and fair-to-
moderate concordance levels for the AUDADIS-5 with a semi-structured diagnostic 
interview administered by independent/blinded research-clinicians have been reported for 
substance use and psychiatric disorders (15, 16). Reliability for NESARC-III ED diagnoses 
has not been reported.

Creation of Eating Disorder Diagnoses1

We created specific ED diagnostic groups (AN, BN, BED) based on DSM-5 criteria using 
NESARC-III respondents’ responses to relevant AUDADIS-5 items2. We did not utilize 
NESARC-III-generated ED diagnosis variables because inspection of the dataset revealed 
various errors3. Thus, it seemed clearly indicated to re-score NESARC-III variable data to 
create DSM-5-based ED categories for our analysis4, 5.

For AN, respondents were required to meet the following: (1) Self-reported lowest BMI less 
than 18.5; (2) Tried not to gain weight or restrict food intake despite low weight; (3) Afraid 
of gaining weight or “getting fat” despite low weight; and (4) Reported at least one of the 
following while their BMI was lowest: (a) thought they “looked fat”; (b) thought their 
weight or shape was one of the most important things about them; (c) did not think they 
might have been unhealthy; (d) did not believe others who thought their weight was 
unhealthy; or (e) constantly weighing themselves or measuring body parts.

For BN and BED, respondents were required to report recurrent binge-eating, determined 
based on three questions: (1) Ever eaten an unusually large amount of food within 2-hour 
period, not including the holidays; (2) Ever eating unusually large amounts of food on 
average at least once weekly for at least 3 months; and (3) While eating an unusually large 
amount of food, felt unable to stop eating or control how much/what eating.

For BN, in addition to meeting criteria for recurrent binge-eating, respondents were required 
to report that during any of those times that they were binge-eating they: (1) Tried to keep 
from gaining weight by vomiting, using enemas, laxatives, diuretics/other medicines, 
fasting, or exercising excessively; (2) Engaged in the weight-compensatory behaviors at 

1The NESARC III was the first wave of this nationally-representative survey study that included eating disorders (EDs). To our 
knowledge, reliability and validity of the AUDADIS-5 for specific EDs have not been reported.
2Supplemental Table S1 lists DSM-5 criteria for AN, BN, and BED, alongside the exact AUDADIS-5 items in the NESARC-III 
dataset used to create each specific ED criterion including how each item was scored. The Supplemental Table 1 footnotes describe the 
clinical/empirical rationale for scoring decisions.
3During our preliminary analyses, we found errors in how the NESARC-III co shows every “marked distress” regarding binge-eating, 
which is required for the BED diagnosis, and categorized many respondents with 12-month AN despite having current BMIs in the 
obese range, among other errors. Thus, for this study, we re-created lifetime and 12-month diagnosis variables for AN, BN, and BED 
based on the criteria described in the method section (and elaborated further in Supplemental Table S1).
4Supplemental Table S2 shows every coding discrepancy between the ED diagnosis variables in our study and the NESARC-III data 
set.
5It is possible that the 12-month persistence finding could be influenced by age of onset. For example, for two individuals with the 
same length (or total years) of an ED episode, one individual having an earlier onset of that ED would have different persistence 
relative to a second individual having a later onset. Thus, it might be possible for increased “persistence” to reflect not only the ED 
persisting longer but also partly confounded by later onset. Thus, we performed multiple logistic regression analyses to compare the 
risk for reporting 12-months diagnosis among those with lifetime diagnosis by age of onset, with current age, sex, education, race, and 
income as covariates. For AN, due to the small number of positive cases, the model was not valid. For both BN and BED, however, 
later age of onset was associated with significantly greater likelihoods of meeting 12-month diagnosis (for BN: AOR = 1.12, 95% CI = 
1.03–1.21, p < .05; for BED: AOR = 1.03, 95% CI = 1.01–1.06, p < .05).

least once weekly for at least 3 months; and (3) Thought their weight/shape was one of the 
most important things about them.

For BED, in addition to meeting criteria for recurrent binge-eating, respondents were 
required to report: (1) Eating an unusually large amount of food made them very upset, and 
(2) At least three of the following five features during the times they ate unusually large 
amounts of food: (a) Eating much more quickly than usual; (b) Eating until uncomfortably 
full; (c) Eating despite not being hungry; (d) Eating alone because embarrassed by how 
much they were eating; and (e) Felt disgusted, depressed, or very guilty about the 
overeating.

Statistical Analysis

Analyses were performed using Statistical Analysis System (SAS) (release 9.4, 2002–2012) 
and accounted for NESARC-III survey design by using Proc Survey procedures with Taylor 
series-variance-estimation method. Weighted means, frequencies, and cross-tabulations were 
computed for 12-month and lifetime DSM-5-based diagnosis for the three specific EDs 
overall (total sample) and separately for specific sociodemographic groups (sex, ethnicity/
race, age, education, income).

For each ED, weighted means, medians, and frequencies were computed for age, BMI, age 
of onset, years with episode, persistence of ED, and ED-related impairment; Analysis of 
covariance (ANCOVA) was used to examine whether current age, current BMI, age of onset, 
and years with episode differed between AN, BN, and BED, adjusting for sociodemographic 
variables. Rao-Scott Chi-Square test was used to compare the proportion reporting 
persistence of ED and ED-related impairment across ED groups. Significant omnibus chi-
square tests were probed by comparing cells to identify significant differences between ED 
groups (17, 18). For these inferential statistics comparing lifetime ED groups, we followed 
well-established diagnostic “hierarchy” of AN>BN>BED (i.e., lifetime BN excluded those 
with lifetime AN, lifetime BED excluded those with lifetime AN/BN). Multiple logistic 
regression was used to calculate adjusted odds ratios (AORs) comparing risk of lifetime and 
12-month diagnoses of EDs by sociodemographic variables, adjusting for the other 
sociodemographic variables not being tested. Cox proportional hazardous models were used 
to test for differences in age-cohort effects on ED, adjusting for sociodemographic variables. 
Multiple logistic regression was used to examine whether the likelihoods of having 
BMI<18.5 (underweight), 18.5≤BMI< 25 (normal weight), 25≤BMI< 30 (overweight), 
30≤BMI< 40 (obese), and 40≤ BMI (extremely obese) differed significantly between EDs 
(12-month and lifetime), relative to respondents without lifetime history of any ED; these 
analyses adjusted for a sociodemographic variables (except for 12-month AN diagnosis 
which required BMI<18.5).

Prevalence Estimates of Eating Disorders: Lifetime and 12-month Rates: Overall and by 
Sociodemographic Characteristics

Prevalence (standard error [SE]) estimates of lifetime AN, BN, and BED were 0.80% 
(0.07%), 0.28% (0.03%), and 0.85% (0.05%), respectively (Table 1). Prevalence (SE) 
estimates of 12-month AN, BN, and BED were 0.05% (0.02%), 0.14% (0.02%), and 0.44% 
(0.04%), respectively (Table 2). Supplemental Table S3 summarizes sensitivity analyses 
showing the impact of discrepancies between our coding with that of the NESARC-III 
(listed in Supplemental Table S2) as well as to exploring the impacts of “broadening” 
various specific criteria on the prevalence estimates for EDs.

Lifetime prevalence estimate for “comorbid” EDs (i.e., having lifetime diagnoses of two or 
more specific EDs) was 0.22% (0.03%). Of those, 0.01% (0.01%) reported lifetime 
“comorbidity” between AN and BN, 0.02% (0.01%) between AN and BED, 0.13% (0.02%) 
between BN and BED, and 0.05% (0.02%) amongst all three EDs. Tables 1 and 2 also show 
(unadjusted) prevalence estimates of lifetime and 12-month diagnoses, respectively, of AN, 
BN, and BED by sex, ethnicity/race, age, education, and income categories.

Adjusted Prevalence Estimate of Eating Disorders by Sex, Race/Ethnicity, Education, and 
Income

Table 3 shows AORs and 95% CIs by sex, ethnicity/race (non-Hispanic White, non-Hispanic 
Black, and Hispanic respondents), education, and income groups. AORs of lifetime and 12-
month diagnoses of all three EDs were significantly greater for women than men (Tables 1 
and 2 show unadjusted estimates). AORs of lifetime AN were significantly lower for non-
Hispanic Black and Hispanic than non-Hispanic White respondents. AORs of 12-month AN 
were significantly lower for Hispanic than non-Hispanic White respondents. There were no 
cases of 12-month AN in non-Hispanic Black respondents; thus, it was not possible to 
generate valid estimates of AORs for non-Hispanic Black vs. non-Hispanic White groups. 
AORs of lifetime and 12-month BN did not differ significantly by race/ethnicity. AOR of 
lifetime BED was significantly lower for non-Hispanic Black than non-Hispanic White; 
AORs of BED for Hispanic and non-Hispanic White did not differ significantly. There were 
no racial differences in AORs of 12-month BED. Education level was not significantly 
associated with any ED prevalence. Higher income categories were associated with 
significantly increased odds of lifetime AN.

Age of Onset, Duration, and Persistence of Eating Disorders—Table 4 
summarizes mean and median age of onset across the EDs (current age at interview is shown 
to provide context). Compared with lifetime AN or BN, those with lifetime BED had later 
age of onset of ED and longer duration of ED episodes. 12-month persistence, defined as the 
proportion of those with 12-month diagnosis among those with the lifetime diagnosis, was 
63.5% for BED and 54.7% for BN which were significantly higher than for AN (9.4 %)5.

Cohort Effects

Page 7

Cox proportional hazard models revealed an inverse association between age cohort (age at 
interview) and lifetime risk for EDs (Table 5). Adjusting for age, sex, ethnicity/race, and 
educational level, hazard ratios (HR) of AN and BED in younger age groups (ages 18–29, 
30–44, 45–59) were significantly higher relative to older group (ages 60+); AHRs increased 
as age decreased. AHRs of BN were significantly higher in ages 18–20 and 30–44, relative 
to 60+, but not in ages 45–59.

Impairment in Psychosocial Functioning Associated with Disordered Eating

Table 6 summarizes rates of impairment in psychosocial functioning in three domains and 
overall (“any”) associated with disordered eating reported by respondents categorized with 
the EDs shown separately for lifetime and 12-month diagnoses. For lifetime diagnoses, rates 
of any impairment in social function were significantly greater for BN (61.4%) and BED 
(53.7%) than AN (30.7%). Rates of reporting interference with normal daily activities was 
significantly greater for BED (52.5%) and BN (49.5%) than AN (23.5%). For 12-month 
diagnoses, the three EDs differed little; only significant difference observed was BN 
reporting greater rate of difficulties setting along with others than BED.

Associations with Current BMI

Table 7 shows current mean (SE) and median (IQR) BMI and current BMI categories 
(prevalence rates and AORs with 95% CIs) across the ED groups for both lifetime and 12-
month diagnoses. For both lifetime and 12-month diagnoses, AN had significantly lower 
current BMI than BN and BED (for 12-month diagnosis this was as expected given the 
required criterion of BMI less than 18.5 for AN). For both lifetime and 12-month diagnoses, 
BN had significantly lower current BMI than BED.

Relative to no history of ED, lifetime AN had significantly greater odds of being categorized 
currently with underweight and normal weight, and significantly reduced odds of currently 
having overweight, obesity, and extreme obesity; AORs reduced as BMI increased. Relative 
to no history of ED, lifetime BED was associated with significantly reduced odds of being 
categorized as currently having normal weight and overweight, but significantly increased 
odds of currently having obesity and extreme obesity. Similarly, 12-month BED was 
associated with significantly reduced odds of being categorized as currently having normal 
weight and overweight, but significantly increased odds of currently having obesity and 
extreme obesity. For both lifetime and 12-month BED, AORs increased as BMI increased. 
Relative to no lifetime history of ED, BN (lifetime and 12-month diagnoses) did not differ 
significantly in odds of any weight/obesity categories

Discussion

This study, with a nationally-representative sample of U.S. 36,309 adults assessed with lay-
administered diagnostic interviews, provides new prevalence estimates of EDs based on 
DSM-5. Prevalence estimates of lifetime AN, BN, and BED were 0.80%, 0.28%, and 0.85%, 
respectively, and 12-month estimates were 0.05%, 0.14%, and 0.44%. These prevalence 
estimates are based on our re-coding of NESARC-III ED data because inspection of the

original NESARC-III data revealed errors; Supplemental Tables summarize coding 
discrepancies and sensitivity analyses exploring impacts of discrepancies on prevalence 
estimates. Findings for DSM-5-defined EDs, which included several changes from the 
DSM-IV, are based on the largest national sample of U.S. adults studied to date, and suggest 
some important similarities and differences to earlier smaller nationally-representative 
studies.

Our prevalence estimates of DSM-5-defined BN and BED are lower than reported by 
Hudson and colleagues (6) from the NCS-R based on a subset of N=2,980 respondents for 
DSM-IV-defined BN and BED (1.0% and 2.8%, for lifetime and 0.3% and 1.2%, for 12-
month). Our lifetime prevalence estimate of DSM-5-defined AN (0.8%) is slightly higher 
than that of DSM-IV-defined AN in the NCS-R (0.6%; 6); for 12-month AN, we observed 
0.05% whereas NCS-R (6) found no cases. Our lower prevalence estimates for BN and BED 
relative to NCS-R (6) estimates are surprising given the changes in criteria from DSM-IV to 
DSM-5 which would be expected to yield higher rates, as found in a population-based Swiss 
sample of 10,028 adults (9). Lifetime prevalence was higher for AN than BN while the 
pattern was opposite for 12-month.

Both the current and NCS-R studies used lay-administered structured interviews, albeit 
different ones, and used rigorous sampling methods; thus, exact reasons for the varied 
findings are uncertain. Much larger sampling in our study, roughly 12 times more 
respondents than the NCS-R, may allow for more stable estimation. Kessler and colleagues 
(19), in comparing differences across DSM-IV-based studies, addressed important 
methodological considerations such as how even different versions of the same interview can 
yield differences. Moreover, different structured interviews for psychiatric disorders vary in 
how diagnostic criteria are asked, strictness of wording, the survey administration order 
(e.g., NCS-R assesses EDs mid-way whereas NESARC-III assesses EDs at the end, which 
conceivably lead to lower responding because of fatigue), and in how diagnostic hierarchies 
are applied. We explored impacts of “broadening” several specific criteria (i.e., “marked 
distress” about binge-eating for BED and overvaluation of shape/weight for BN) because of 
differences in the structured interviews in NCS-R and NESARC-III. Our sensitivity analyses 
(detailed in Supplemental Tables) revealed slight increases in lifetime estimates for BED, 
but not BN; however, even with broadened definitions, our prevalence estimates remained 
lower than the NCS-R (6). Sensitivity analyses performed for NCS-R (6) testing stricter 
definitions of overvaluation revealed little effect on reducing BN prevalence estimates. Thus, 
neither our present analyses nor the NCS-R (6) suggested much impact based on either 
overly broad/stringent measures of overvaluation on BN prevalence estimates. Our 
prevalence estimates are at odds with critics’ views of the DSM-5 who used BED as an 
illustration of over-pathologizing. Discrepancies in prevalence estimates underscore the need 
of more population-based studies with large samples using diagnostic interviews.

Our findings extend knowledge regarding the distribution and sociodemographic correlates 
of EDs. Adjusting for age, ethnicity/race, education, and income categories, odds of lifetime 
and 12-month diagnoses of all three EDs were significantly greater for women than men, 
particularly for AN and BN. We also found that risk of: (1) lifetime AN was significantly 
lower for Hispanic and non-Hispanic Black than for non-Hispanic White respondents; (2)

lifetime and 12-month BN did not differ significantly by ethnicity/race; (3) lifetime BED, 
but not 12-month BED, was significantly lower for non-Hispanic Black than non-Hispanic 
White respondents; (4) lifetime and 12-month BED for Hispanic and non-Hispanic White 
respondents did not differ significantly; and (5) lifetime AN was associated with higher 
income. Overall, it is important to recognize that EDs occur across all ethnic/racial groups 
and that the rates for some diagnoses (e.g., BN and BED to a lesser extent) are comparable 
across groups. However, 12-month AN was most prevalent among non-Hispanic White, 
women, and 18–29 years old. The findings are broadly consistent with previous DSM-IV-
defined EDs (6, 7). Kessler and colleagues (19) - in their analysis of 24,124 adult 
respondents from the WHO World Mental Health Survey – reported roughly comparable 
prevalence estimates for BN and BED across 14 countries. Collectively, such findings 
highlight the importance of actively considering all forms of diversity across prevention and 
intervention clinical/research work, which to date, appears to be at odds with our findings 
(e.g., 20).

Findings regarding the mean ages of onset for AN, BN, and BED were nearly identical to 
the NCR-S (6): ages 19.3, 20.0, and 24.5, respectively versus 18.9, 19.7, and 25.4. The 
chronic nature of EDs was suggested by long illness durations and rates of 12-month 
persistence, which highlight the importance of early recognition and intervention. 
Percentage of 12-month persistence in AN was significantly lower than BN or BED, which 
is at odds with NCR-S (6) findings and reports on the course of AN (21). We found some 
support for the view that EDs might be increasing in incidence. We observed an inverse 
association between age cohort (age at interview) and lifetime risk particularly for BN and 
BED, echoing earlier findings for BN (1, 6, 22) and BED (6). Odds of AN showed slight 
increase with cohort, adding to the mixed literature, primarily case register data. As noted by 
Hudson and colleagues (6), cohort effects overlaps with age effects, and thus prospective 
studies should investigate whether incidence of EDs is on increasing trend.

Impairment in psychosocial functioning associated with disordered eating was common. The 
majority of lifetime BN (61.4%) and BED (53.7%) groups reported “any” impairment; these 
rates were significantly higher than reported by lifetime AN (30.7%). However, the rates of 
reporting “any” impairment were not significantly different for 12-month diagnoses 
(AN=47.1%, BN=64.6%, and BED=54.7%). Comparison with the NCS-R (6) is difficult due 
to different measurement of impairment and because their smaller study precluded analysis 
of AN. Nonetheless, these two studies converge in suggesting that roughly half of persons 
with BN and BED suffer from impaired functioning associated with their disordered eating. 
Our findings for AN, might seem surprising given the established seriousness and even life-
threatening nature of this disorder. Alternatively, it is possible that the findings for AN 
reflect, in part, under-reporting associated with the well-known minimization of severity and 
ego-syntonic nature of the underweight state in persons with AN.

We observed significant but varied associations between EDs and obesity. Lifetime AN had 
significantly lower current BMI than lifetime BN and BED and lifetime BN had 
significantly lower BMI than lifetime BED. Consistent with the NCS-R (6) and clinical 
studies (19, 21), we found lifetime AN had significantly greater odds of currently having 
underweight/normal weight and lower odds of having overweight/obesity/extreme-obesity,

with AORs increasing with increasing BMI. Conversely, lifetime and 12-month BED was 
associated with significantly reduced odds of currently being categorized as normal weight/
overweight, but increased odds of being currently categorized with obesity/extreme obesity. 
Substantially elevated odds of having current extreme obesity in those with lifetime BED 
(AOR=4.67) and 12-month BED (AOR=5.42) echo previous NCS-R (6) and WHO (19) 
findings and clinical reports regarding steep weight-gains among persons with BED prior to 
seeking treatment (23). Finally, in contrast to significant, albeit opposite, associations with 
weight for AN versus BED, BN (lifetime and 12-month) did not differ significantly in 
associations with different weight/obesity categories.

We note strengths and limitations as context for our findings. A major strength is the large 
epidemiological data-set with a representative sample of U.S. adults assessed with trained 
interviewers using structured interviews. A relative weakness is the use of lay interviewers, 
rather than clinicians; standardized training and structured assessments may offset this 
limitation to some extent. The AUDADIS-5 has not been evaluated for reliability/validity for 
ED diagnoses, although it has been validated for other psychiatric conditions. We note that 
even different diagnostic interviews or even versions of the same interview can produce 
different diagnostic estimates (24). EDs are thought to be associated with shame and secrecy, 
and some specific types such as AN are ego-syntonic and these factors might result in under-
reporting and lower estimates. Different reference time points used to define lowest BMI 
across studies may also result in different prevalence estimates of AN. The use of telephone 
interviews might have offset this to some degree by allowing for greater honesty when 
reporting sensitive or embarrassing issues. The AUDADIS-5 does not assess EDs using the 
exact wording of the DSM-5; as we detailed in the methods, we re-scored specific 
AUDADIS-5 items to map very closely to criteria and performed sensitivity analyses which 
revealed relatively limited impacts of loosening criteria on prevalence estimates. BMI was 
calculated based on self-reported height and weight, which may be biased (25)6.

Conclusions

Our findings for DSM-5-defined EDs, based on the largest national sample of U.S. adults 
studied to date, indicate these are prevalent disorders distributed across age groups, both 
men and women, and across different ethnic/racial groups. Although substantial differences 
between EDs exist, overall, they appear to be persistent and associated with substantial rates 
of impairment in psychosocial functioning. EDs show differential associations with obesity 
and our findings highlight substantial associations between BED and extreme obesity. Thus, 
our findings indicate that DSM-5 EDs represent an important public health problem.

6When errors in self-report of weight/height occur, they tend to be in the direction of under-reporting weight and over-reporting height 
(25); in community-based studies, for example, this can produce on average a BMI estimate of 1.3 units lower than based on measured 
values (26). Nonetheless, large-scale studies generally report high correlations between self-reported and measured height and weight 
(28) and studies with patients with EDs have found that errors in self-reported height and weight tend to be very slight (27, 29) and the 
discrepancies between self-report and measured values are not associated with eating-disorder psychopathology or psychological 
features (29).
