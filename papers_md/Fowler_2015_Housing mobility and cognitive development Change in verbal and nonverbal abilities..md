Abstract

This study investigates the influence of housing instability on verbal and nonverbal cognitive 
development among at-risk children and adolescents involved in the child welfare system. 
Frequent residential changes threaten child mental health, especially among low-income families. 
Little is known regarding disruptions to cognitive growth, specifically the impact on verbal and 
nonverbal abilities. The study tests whether developmental timing of housing mobility affects 
cognitive development beyond individual and family risks. A nationally representative study of 
families (n = 2,442) susceptible to housing and family instability tracked children and adolescents 
aged four to 14 years (M = 8.95 years) over 36 months following investigation by the child 
welfare system. Youth completed standardized cognitive assessments while caregivers reported on 
behavior problems and family risk at three time points. Latent growth models examined change in 
cognitive abilities over time. Housing mobility in the 12 months prior to baseline predicts lower 
verbal cognitive abilities that improve marginally. Similar effects emerge for all age groups; 
however, frequent moves in infancy diminish the influence of subsequent housing mobility on 
verbal tasks. Housing instability threatened cognitive development beyond child maltreatment, 
family changes, poverty, and other risks. Findings inform emerging research on environmental

Systematic assessment of family housing problems, including through the child welfare system, 
provides opportunities for coordinated responses to prevent instability and cognitive threats.

Keywords

Inadequate housing represents a significant barrier to healthy child development for many 
at-risk families in the United States (Adam, 2004; Leventhal & Newman, 2010). Low-
income families struggle to secure safe and stable housing in tight affordable housing 
markets that remain difficult to navigate after a slow recovery from economic recession 
(Joint Center for Housing Studies of Harvard University, 2012; Institute for Children, 
Poverty, and Homelessness, 2013). A growing body of evidence demonstrates associations 
between housing problems and poorer child mental health and school outcomes (Adam, 
2004; Jelleyman & Spencer, 2008; Leventhal & Newman, 2010). However, less research 
examines the effects of housing mobility on cognitive development, especially in the context 
of other family and economic stressors. The present study proposes and tests a 
developmentally informed model of housing instability and child development. Using data 
from a nationally representative sample of at-risk families, the study hypothesizes that 
timing and chronicity of moves influence growth of verbal and nonverbal abilities beyond 
co-occurring family instability.

Housing and Child Development

Safe and stable homes facilitate healthy families and child development (Leventhal & 
Newman, 2010); however, a substantial portion of children experience precarious housing 
situations marked by unsustainable accommodations and frequent moves. The Current 
Population Survey estimates 10 million children aged 1 to 19 years (12.8%) moved at least 
once in a 12-month period in 2013 and 2014, while female-headed and low-income 
households move at more than two times that rate (United States Census Bureau, 2015). 
Although moves reflect voluntary and involuntary decisions, frequent mobility indicates 
economic strains that range from seeking affordability to chronic housing changes 
characteristic of homeless families (Buckner, 2008).

A growing body of evidence links housing mobility with poor behavioral adjustment and 
worse school outcomes among children and adolescents. Youth exposed to multiple 
residential moves exhibit greater emotional, behavioral, and social maladjustment both 
immediately following housing transitions, and over time (Adam, 2004; Jelleyman & 
Spencer, 2008). Moves also relate with poorer educational attainment and greater likelihood 
of dropout (Cutuli et al., 2013; Metzger, Fowler, Anderson, & Lindsay, in press; Voight, 
Shinn, & Nation, 2012). Maladaptation seems especially pervasive for at-risk youth (Coley, 
Leventhal, Lynch, & Kull, 2013; Fowler et al., 2014; Hagan, Macmillan, Wheaton, 1996). A 
recent study of children born to single mothers in 20 United States cities suggests excessive 
mobility in the first five years of life relates to elevated externalizing problems, particularly 
among youth in lower income families (Ziol-Guest & McKenna, 2014). This evidence

points to specific conditions (i.e., low income) and time periods (i.e., early childhood) in 
which housing mobility disrupts behavioral adjustment among children.

Less is known about the role of housing instability on cognitive development – a 
fundamental domain of child development with life course implications (Heckman, 2006). 
Cognitive abilities broadly refer to the effective application of novel solutions to ambiguous 
tasks and situations (Sternberg, 1985). Contrary to previous conceptualizations of 
intelligence as a static individual characteristic, recent evidence shows malleability of 
cognitive functioning associated with environmental adversities across childhood and into 
young adulthood (Beckett, Castle, Rutter, & Sonuga-Barke, 2010; Jaffee, 2007). Only one 
study explicitly examines developmental delays associated with housing mobility among 
low-income children across the United States (Coley, Doyle, & Kull, 2015); the authors did 
not find significant relationships between timing of moves among low-income infants and 
toddlers and delays in cognitive domains measured a year later. However, the short follow-
up period and focus on younger children limits the implications of the study for theory. 
Although a larger body of research demonstrates inverse relations between housing 
instability and academic achievement (Coley et al., 2013; Cutuli et al., 2013; Voight, Shinn, 
& Nation, 2012), underlying developmental processes remain understudied.

Ecobiodevelopmental Model of Housing Stability

An ecobiodevelopmental model of housing illustrated in Figure 1 emphasizes the multilevel 
and dynamic nature of family instability (Coley, Lynch, & Kull, 2015; Shonkoff & Garner, 
2012). Based on the ecological systems theory (Bronfenbrenner, 1979; Bronfenbrenner & 
Evans, 2000), this model proposes child development occurs within concentric zones of 
influence that interact over time. Housing stability represents an exosystem process that 
facilitates relationships within and between environmental contexts. Safe and stable 
accommodations support positive microsystem connections between parents and children, 
including establishment of consistency and routines that facilitate active learning and 
behavioral adaptation (Mayberry, Shinn, Benton, & Wise, 2014). Housing also nurtures 
important links with peer networks, teachers, and neighbors in the community who 
contribute to and invest in healthy child development (Coleman, 1988). Macrosystem 
processes contribute to housing stability through employment opportunities, quality 
affordable housing, and policies that support integrated communities (Sampson, 2012). 
Consistency in relations with family and community readies children for developmental 
challenges such as the transition into school, formation of peer networks, and onset of 
puberty. The accumulation of strong social ties facilitated by stable housing promotes 
protective factors that support healthy child development.

Housing instability and exposure to environmental adversities

Housing mobility disrupts protective relationships and increases risk for exposure to adverse 
environments. Relocation to more affordable accommodations often requires moving away 
from extended family, peers, teachers, and neighbors. Frequent moves limit families’ 
abilities to accumulate and use age-appropriate enrichment materials (e.g., books, games, 
and computers), and impoverished housing conditions limit dedicated space for parents to 
engage children in learning (Leventhal & Newman, 2010). Moreover, communities

accessible to low-income families often host fewer educational and enrichment 
opportunities; children attend more impoverished and less desirable schools, and a lack of 
safe spaces in the community limits opportunities for children to play and families to 
connect with neighbors. To avoid more precarious situations and homelessness, caregivers 
double-up with relatives and friends in temporary accommodations, such as staying on 
couches (Buckner, 2008). Overcrowded and impermanent conditions strain connections with 
social supports, and families often cycle in and out of places to stay, including homeless 
shelters. Dynamics across multilevel environments perpetuate frequent mobility among 
vulnerable families that further threatens child development.

An ecobiodevelopmental model of housing emphasizes risks in the family microsystem. 
Families preoccupied by navigating tight affordable housing markets with limited emotional 
and instrumental supports experience greater distress that disrupts positive parenting (Kull & 
Coley, 2014; Samuels, Fowler, Ault, Tang, & Marcal, in press). Precarious housing that 
results from and exacerbates parental mental health problems interferes with the ability to 
provide emotional support for children. The strain increases the probability of emotional and 
physical abuse, while caregivers may also neglect basic child needs (food and clothing); 
inadequately housed families are disproportionately in contact with the child welfare system 
(Fowler, Taylor, & Rufa, 2011; Park, Metraux, Brodbar, & Culhane, 2004).

Poverty research alludes to specific neurodevelopmental deficits associated with housing 
instability and environmental chaos (Blair, Raver, Granger, Mills-Koonce, & Hibel, 2011; 
Evans & Kim, 2012). Compared to higher-income households, children in low-income 
families demonstrate greater lags in language development, while deficits are less 
pronounced in spatial processing and nonverbal skills (Farah et al., 2008; Noble, Farah, & 
McCandliss 2006; Noble, Norman, & Farah, 2005). Theory attributes the pattern of delays to 
impoverished communication between low-income parents and children; financial and 
emotional stress makes caregivers less available to talk and engage in reciprocal interactions 
necessary for development of language brain circuitry (Shonkoff & Garner, 2012). In 
contrast, nonverbal tasks develop more consistently because low-income children continue 
to engage spatially despite environmental chaos. Verbal deficits accumulate over time and 
help explain subsequent socioeconomic educational gaps that endure into adulthood 
(Duncan, Yeung, Brooks-Gunn, & Smith, 1998). Poverty might be expected to explain 
academic deficits and behavior problems associated with housing mobility; however, 
research consistently shows effects of mobility beyond other risks, including socioeconomic 
status (Hagan et al., 1996; Metzger et al., in press; Ziol-Guest & McKenna, 2014).

Housing instability in context of child development

Developmental timing of housing instability provides a further probe of the 
ecobiodevelopmental model on cognitive development. The framework emphasizes child 
age at exposure as well as the chronicity of environmental adversities as timing processes, 
meaning that children are more vulnerable to environmental threats during developmental 
transitions or in sensitive periods for acquisition of competencies (Bronfenbrenner, 1979; 
Cicchetti & Lynch, 1995; Huston & Bentley, 2010). Poverty research indicates earlier and 
more persistent exposure to impoverished conditions delay cognitive development (Blair et

al., 2011; Duncan, et al., 1998; Evans & Kim, 2012). Theory suggests adversities disrupt 
neural circuitry, especially in the development of early language abilities, and deficits 
accumulate with time spent in poverty (Farah et al., 2008; Noble et al., 2006; Noble et al., 
2005). However, research on childhood exposure to chronic child maltreatment and 
deprivation in orphanages suggests initial cognitive delays rebound in later childhood after 
children receive more stable and enriched environments (Beckett et al., 2010; Jaffee, 2007; 
Straus & Paschall, 2009). Despite these bodies of work, there is very little information on 
the effects of housing stabilization across cognitive processes as well as at different ages.

Very little research has examined differences between verbal and nonverbal cognitive 
processes associated with housing mobility. Studies of homeless children have provided 
limited evidence of developmental timing differences that vary by outcome. A prospective 
study matched children entering New York City homeless shelters with a random sample of 
youth whose families received public assistance (Shinn et al., 2008). Five years later, 
homelessness related to lower verbal scores among preschoolers aged 4 to 6 years at 
baseline, while no differences emerged among children aged seven to 17 at shelter entry. 
Homeless and housed children performed similarly on nonverbal abilities. Another study 
comparing children in homeless shelters to matched low-income children found differences 
in verbal but not nonverbal tasks among school-aged children; however, children aged 3 to 5 
years in shelters performed more poorly on both verbal and nonverbal tasks (Rescorla, 
Parker, & Stolley, 1991). A similar pattern was found in a comparison of homeless children 
with youth from the same neighborhoods (Yu et al., 2008). Although not explicitly tested, 
the pattern of effects across child ages suggests potential timing influences for particular 
cognitive domains.

The limited evidence suggests early childhood represents a particularly vulnerable window - 
especially for verbal development, and potential exists for a rebound effect of cognitive 
processes following housing stabilization. Nevertheless, these hypotheses are derived 
primarily from studies of poverty and extreme housing instability, so further investigation of 
the impact of housing mobility remains needed.

Present Study

The present study leverages longitudinal data from a nationally representative sample of at-
risk families to examine individual variation in cognitive abilities over time associated with 
mobility. Repeated assessments of children and adolescents (n = 2,442) examine within- and 
between-individual change in verbal and nonverbal cognitive processes over a three-year 
follow-up. To test an ecobiodevelopmental framework, analyses account for risks on 
cognitive development at multiple levels and over time. Models emphasize family 
microsystem processes as potential alternative explanations for housing effects, especially in 
the high-risk population; type and frequency of child maltreatment, as well as caregiver 
mental health, are explicitly modeled. Response from the child welfare system represents an 
exosystem factor that might promote child development; socioeconomic characteristics such 
as caregiver highest educational achievement and household income address macrosystem 
influences. Importantly, models also account for individual development of co-occurring 
behavioral regulation shown to be related with housing instability (Fowler et al., 2014).

Analyses investigate specific hypotheses regarding whether a) increased residential moves 
relate to hampered growth of cognitive abilities beyond the effects of other socioeconomic 
and family risks; b) deficits associated with housing mobility emerge for both verbal and 
nonverbal processes; c) preschoolers experience the greatest impact of housing mobility on 
cognitive development compared to school-aged children and adolescents; and d) early and 
repeated exposure to mobility relates to suppressed cognitive development.

Method

Participants

Data were drawn from the first cohort of the National Survey of Child and Adolescent Well-
Being (NSCAW), a nationally representative sample of families under investigation for 
child abuse and neglect from October, 1999 to December, 2000. Face-to-face interviews 
with caregivers, children, and child welfare caseworkers occurred within six months of child 
protective services investigation; follow-up occurred 12, 18, 36, and 59 to 97 months after 
baseline assessment. With 5,501 total families investigated, the current study included those 
with children aged 4 to 16 years who remained together after CPS investigation (n = 2,442). 
Families placed out of home (n = 1,467) did not provide information on housing mobility, 
while children aged zero to three (n = 1,592) were not administered cognitive assessments. 
This study included caregiver and child reports at baseline, 18-, and 36-month follow-ups.

Child mean age was 8.95 years (SD = 3.26 years) at baseline. Caregivers, aged 34.47 years 
on average (SD = 8.32), were predominantly female (89%) and unmarried (66%). The 
majority of families were ethnic minorities, including 27% African Americans, 18% 
Hispanics, and 8% other ethnicities; the remainder (47%) were white. Over half of families 
(56%) earned below $20,000 per year, and one-third of households reported incomes below 
the federal poverty level. More than half of families (57%) received in-home child welfare 
services to support family functioning after maltreatment investigation.

Measures

Mobility—Three measures of housing instability were employed in this study:

1. Housing mobility. Housing mobility was assessed at the baseline interview through 
caregiver-reported number of moves with children in the last 12 months. As in 
other studies of family housing and homelessness, total number of moves was used 
and has demonstrated adequate validity in capturing risk associated with instability 
above and beyond other indicators of family disruption (Coleman, 1988; Cutuli et 
al., 2013; Wood et al., 1993). A similar distribution of recent moves was found in 
this sample as in prior research; most families reported no moves (70%), 20% 
reported one move, while 10% reported two or more moves within 12 months. 
Caregiver-reported number of moves was not collected at follow-up waves.

2. Address changes. To assess housing mobility after baseline, dichotomous variables 
indicated whether parent interviews occurred at the same physical address as the 
prior interview. Address locations were tracked in an electronic database as part of 
study protocol. A fuzzy matching algorithm identified matches, accounting for

minor spelling and data entry errors. Many families changed addresses between 
baseline and the 18-month follow-up (49.1%), as well as between 18- and 36-
months (42.4%).

3. Early mobility. Caregivers were asked at baseline to report the number of moves 
made with children in the first 12 months of the child’s life. This item served as a 
proxy of exposure to early mobility (Osborne & McLanahan, 2007). The count 
variable was dichotomized such that zero represented none or one move (83%) 
within the child’s first 12 months, while one represented two or more moves (17%). 
This bifurcation was based on the variable distribution, which showed a binary 
pattern with very few families (4%) reported moving three or more times.

Cognitive development—The vocabulary and matrices subscales of the Kaufman Brief 
Intelligence Test (K-BIT) measured cognitive ability (Kaufman & Kaufman, 1990). 
Individually administered to youth, the vocabulary subscale assessed word knowledge and 
verbal concept formation; the matrices subscale measured nonverbal ability to recognize 
relationships and patterns. Normed on a nationally representative sample, the subscales 
demonstrated adequate reliability and validity. Internal consistency for the vocabulary 
subscale among children aged 4 to 19 years was high (ranging from .89 to .98) and moderate 
to high for the matrices subscale (ranging from .74 to .95). Internal consistency for this 
sample was also adequate for the vocabulary (α = .76) and matrices (α = .79) subscale 
scores. Vocabulary and matrices raw scores were used, as well as a summed score to capture 
overall cognitive development.

Behavior problems—Youth behavioral and emotional problems were assessed with the 
118-item Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) for children aged 4 to 18 years (Achenbach, 
1991). Caregivers rated children’s problem behaviors on a 3-point Likert-type scale (0 = not 
true, 1 = somewhat/sometimes true, 2 = very true/often true). The externalizing subscale 
captured parent-rated delinquency and aggression. Cronbach’s alpha in this sample was high 
(α = .92). The CBCL has been used extensively, demonstrating adequate validity in 
nationally representative samples (Achenbach et al., 1995). Raw scores were used in 
analyses to capture range in symptoms across different ages.

Family instability—Changes in children’s family environments were captured through 
caregiver-reported disturbances in parental figures living with children. Caregivers indicated 
parental changes due to divorce or separation, marriage or remarriage, or death; parent-child 
separations due to health or mental health problems, substance abuse, incarceration, or 
employment changes; return of absent parents to the home; child returns to home after 
separations; and other disruptions. The number of disruptions was summed 12 months prior 
to baseline and between interviews; higher scores represented greater family instability.

Child maltreatment—Caregivers self-reported frequency of engaging in minor physical 
assault and neglect in the past 12 months. The Parent Child Conflict Tactics Scale (CTS-PC) 
administered using audio computer-assisted self-interview assessed frequency of events 
from 0 (none) to six (>20 times). Example minor assault items included, “Hit CHILD on the 
bottom with something life a belt, hairbrush, a stick or some other hard object”, and

“slapped CHILD on the hand, arm, or leg”. Neglect example items included, “called CHILD 
dumb or lazy or some other name like that?” and “leave your CHILD home alone, even 
when you thought some adult should be with him/her?” The current caregiver completed 
assessments at baseline, 24-months, and 36-months. The CTS-PC has demonstrated strong 
psychometric properties and has been used in multiple national studies (CTS-PC; Straus, 
Hamby, Finkelhor, Moore, & Runyan, 1998).

Child welfare services—Families who received services to address child safety through 
the child welfare system were identified. A dichotomous indicator triangulated information 
from child protective services and caregiver interviews on in-home service-receipt; 43.0% of 
families received services to keep children in the home. The remaining investigations were 
closed without providing any resources.

Abuse Type—Child protective services caseworkers provided the most serious allegations 
of abuse and neglect that triggered investigation by the child welfare system. From 17 
different types of abuse, this study categorized reasons for investigation into four types: 
physical abuse, sexual abuse, emotional abuse (i.e., emotional maltreatment, moral/legal 
maltreatment, educational maltreatment, exploitation), and neglect (i.e., physical neglect, no 
supervision, and abandonment). Each category was dichotomized to compare the primary 
reason to other types of abuse. Alleged reports were used instead of substantiated cases 
given evidence from the NSCAW study that suggested this differentiation failed to reflect 
elevated risk (Kohl, Jonson-Reid, & Drake, 2009).

Caregiver mental health—Caregivers completed the Short Form Health Survey (SF-12) 
to assess perceived physical and mental health (Ware, Kosinski, & Keller, 1996). This study 
used the six-item mental health subscale. Sample items included, “During the past 4 weeks, 
how much of the time have you felt downhearted and blue?” and “During the past 4 weeks, 
did you feel you didn’t do work or other activities as carefully as usual as a result of any 
emotional problems such as feeling depressed or anxious?” Test-retest reliability was 
adequate for mental health (α = .76; Ware et al., 1996). Higher scores indicated better 
mental health.

Family income—Caregivers reported total family income from all sources in the past 12 
months at baseline in $5,000 increments from $0 to $50,000 and above. The distribution of 
income strata was examined, and a four-level interval variable was created to capture the 
relatively normal distribution of annual incomes: below $10,000, $10,000 – $19,999, 
$20,000 –$39,999, and $40,000 and more in a 12-month period.

Youth demographics—Child age, race, and gender were assessed using a multi-
informant procedure that triangulated reports across sources (child, caregiver, and 
caseworker). Child age at the initial interview was trichotomized to reflect different 
developmental periods. Preschoolers included children aged 4 to 6 years (n = 690, M = 4.99, 
SD = .84); school-aged children aged 7 to 10 years (n = 903, M = 8.45, SD = 1.11); and 
adolescents aged 11 to 16 years with more than 90% under age 15 (n = 849, M = 12.68, SD 
= 1.29).

Procedures

Page 9

Families were selected using a two-stage stratified probabilistic sampling design (Dowd et 
al., 2003). The first stage divided the United States into nine sampling strata; eight strata 
comprised the eight states with the largest child welfare caseloads, and one stratum included 
the remaining 42 states and the District of Columbia. Ninety-two primary sampling units 
(PSUs) were selected from the nine strata, with each PSU representing the geographic 
location served by one child protective services agency. The second stage randomly selected 
families investigated for child abuse or neglect from monthly lists generated by each PSU 
from October, 1999 to December, 2000. A stratified sampling strategy ensured selected 
families represented the child welfare population based on age and level of service.

One child from each family was randomly selected as the study target; caregiver and child 
welfare caseworker report focused on this child, who was administered age-appropriate 
observation and/or assessments. Trained field representatives conducted structured 
interviews with children, caregivers, and caseworkers via laptop computers, usually in 
families’ homes. Caregivers provided written consent for surveyed children, and youth aged 
11 years and older gave written assent. Children aged 7 to 10 years verbally assented to 
participate. Data quality was assured through extensive training and supervision.

Analytic Approach

Latent Growth Modeling (LGM) was used to analyze data in three steps (Muthen, 2004). 
First, initial analyses examined unconditional LGMs for cognitive development to test the 
extent to which models including intercept and slope factors adequately described patterns 
of change. Unconditional models examined change without predictors of growth factors. 
Slopes estimated linear change across three time points at baseline, 18- and 36-month 
follow-ups. Time was centered at 18-months to examine development across the follow-up 
period. Model fit was evaluated across multiple indices of absolute and incremental fit 
(Preacher, Wichman, MacCallum, & Briggs, 2008). The chi-square test was examined, 
recognizing sensitivity to sample size of this study. The Root Mean Square Error of 
Approximation (RMSEA) evaluated absolute fit penalizing for model complexity with 
values below .05 representing adequate fit to the data. The Comparative Fit Index (CFI) 
assessed incremental fit while correcting for model complexity. Values above .90 on the CFI 
represented adequate fit to the data. In addition, adjustments based on review of 
modification indices were conducted iteratively to enhance fit to the data.

Second, conditional models simultaneously estimated change in cognitive development and 
externalizing problems, including predictors of growth factors. Paths were included from 
initial levels of growth and cross-domain slope factors to capture potential parallel 
influences on cognition and externalizing behavior over time. Conditional models 
incorporated time-invariant and variant covariates. Growth factors were regressed on 
baseline report of housing mobility, primary abuse type investigated by child protective 
services, child welfare services receipt, child gender, child ethnicity, family income, and 
caregiver mental health. Lagged time-varying covariates that assessed family instability, 
child maltreatment, and address changes were regressed on outcomes at each wave. Similar

models examined change in verbal and nonverbal abilities separately to investigate co-
occurring patterns.

Third, multiple group analyses tested whether child age or early exposure to mobility 
moderated the relationship between recent housing mobility and growth factors. Analyses 
compared model fit when paths between housing mobility and growth factors were allowed 
to estimate freely across moderating conditions versus when paths were constrained to be 
equal. Scaled difference test evaluated differences in models (Satorra & Bentler, 2001). 
Significant omnibus tests were followed up by testing specific paths between housing 
mobility and particular intercept and slope factors. Figure 2 presents the overall analytic 
framework. All models were estimated using MPLUS Version 5.0 (Muthen & Muthen, 
2007). Maximum likelihood estimation enabled use of full information to address missing 
data.

Table 1 presents correlations among all study variables, as well as variable means and 
standard deviations for the full sample. Youth in this sample obtained lower scores on the 
cognitive assessment compared to normative samples, likely reflecting the risks experienced 
by the population. Patterns of relationships between study variables generally reflected 
findings from prior research on mobility and risk. Of importance, small negative correlations 
existed between housing mobility and cognitive development across time points. African 
Americans, lower-income families, families receiving child welfare services, and instable 
families were more likely to experience moves, as were families who reported early 
mobility. Minority and lower-income children had lower scores on cognitive development, 
as did children investigated for suspected neglect and children who received child welfare 
services. Investigations for sexual abuse related with cognitive scores. Similar patterns 
emerged when examining verbal and nonverbal cognitive abilities separately.

Unconditional Latent Growth Models

Preliminary unconditional models examined whether LGMs adequately described patterns 
of change in cognitive development when including intercept and slope parameters. The 
unconditional model of cognitive development provided reasonable fit to the data [χ2(1) = 
35.05, p<.01; CFI = .96, RMSEA = .12], with significant values of intercept (estimate = 
66.58, SE = 41) and slope (estimate = 6.79, SE = .13). Positive growth existed in cognitive 
ability. Model fit improved when separately examining change in verbal abilities (χ2(1) = 
24.57, RMSEA = .10, CFI = .97) and nonverbal abilities (χ2(1) = 26.54, RMSEA = .10, CFI 
= .98).

Conditional Latent Growth Models

Conditional models estimated the effect of housing mobility on cognitive development, 
accounting for time-variant and invariant covariates. Fit statistics presented in Table 2 
suggested reasonable model fit across indicators and outcomes. Although significant chi-
squares were expected given the relatively large sample size, the CFI fell above .90 and 
RMSEAs fell at or below .05. Estimates suggested adequate fit for the relatively complex

parallel process models. Cognitive development demonstrated positive growth over time 
(intercept estimate = 62.45, SE = 2.41; slope estimate = 7.67, SE = .79) with significant 
unexplained variance in growth terms (intercept residual variance = 348.56, SE = 10.71; 
slope residual variance = 24.70, SE = 3.50). A similar pattern emerged within cognitive 
domains; youth exhibited improvements in verbal development (intercept estimate = 39.07, 
SE = 1.58, slope estimate = 4.55, SE = .49 and nonverbal development (intercept estimate = 
23.78, SE = .89, slope estimate = 2.89, SE = .41). Cognitive abilities grew with time, while 
individual differences existed in overall levels and rate of change.

Early housing mobility also related to cognitive development. Children whose caregivers 
reported two or more moves in infancy had lower overall cognitive scores that remained 
suppressed over time. A differential pattern emerged when examining performance by 
cognitive domain. Verbal development demonstrated a similar rebound as housing mobility 
in the past 12 months (e.g., Figure 3); children scored lower on verbal abilities that partially 
rebounded over time. Early mobility related with poorer nonverbal abilities that remained 
lower over time compared to children who moved once or less in infancy.

Table 3 provides estimates of time varying and invariant covariate effects on growth 
parameters for overall development and by cognitive domain. Results suggested increased 
housing mobility in the 12 months before baseline related with lower overall levels of 
cognitive development, after adjustments for co-occurring development of behavior 
problems, as well as various dimensions of family instability, child maltreatment, child 
welfare involvement, and socioeconomic status. Housing mobility predicted significant 
increases in the slope of cognitive development across time, which suggested partial 
cognitive rebounds. As displayed in Figure 3, children who moved two or more times within 
12 months demonstrated lower cognitive abilities that partially rebounded over time. A 
threshold existed such that a single move within a 12-month period did not relate with 
cognitive deficits, but two or more moves related with lower scores that partially caught up 
across the follow-up period. The same pattern emerged when examining cognition by verbal 
and nonverbal domains separately; housing mobility predicted poorer overall verbal and 
nonverbal abilities and related to improvements in both domains over time.

Housing effects emerged above and beyond effects of other individual and familial risks as 
shown in Table 3. Higher levels of caregiver-reported externalizing problem behaviors 
slowed co-occurring growth of cognitive development for both verbal and nonverbal 
abilities. As in prior research, children from lower-income families, African Americans, and 
children whose parents reported worse mental health scored lower on initial cognitive 
development. Latino children also initially scored lower but scores increased more sharply 
over time. Boys exhibited significantly slower growth in cognitive scores over time 
compared to girls. Exposure to minor abuses related with poorer cognitive scores at wave 2.

Counterintuitive associations also existed. As expected, neglect as a primary reason for child 
protective services investigation related with lower overall levels of cognitive abilities over 
time, however caregiver reported frequency of neglect related with higher baseline scores. 
These variables were uncorrelated, suggesting they represent different constructs. In 
addition, contemporaneous family instability predicted higher cognitive ability scores at the

Multiple Group Moderating Analyses

To examine whether youth age and early exposure moderated the relationships between 
housing mobility in the past 12 months and growth in cognitive outcomes, multiple group 
analyses compared model fit of freely estimating versus fixing the paths between housing 
mobility and cognitive growth factors. Model comparisons for child age appear in Table 2. 
Child age at exposure to housing mobility did not moderate the effects of mobility on 
growth of cognitive development; constraining these effects across age groups did not 
worsen model fit to the data. Support for moderation also did not exist when testing verbal 
and nonverbal abilities separately. Thus, the effects of mobility in the past 12 months were 
similar for preschoolers, school-aged, and adolescents.

Analyses also tested whether early mobility exacerbated the effects of more recent housing 
mobility on cognitive development. As shown in Table 2, early exposure to mobility –
multiple moves within the child’s first 12 months – moderated the effect of recent housing 
mobility on cognitive development. Constraining housing mobility effects to be equal across 
early mobility groups worsened model fit for overall cognitive development and verbal 
development in particular. Effects did not vary on nonverbal development across early 
mobility groups. Table 4 displays housing mobility coefficients on overall and verbal 
cognitive development by early mobility group. The pattern of effects showed a similar 
partial cognitive rebound (see Figure 3) among youth who had not experienced early 
mobility, and the effect on cognitive abilities was driven by the impact on verbal abilities. 
For youth who experienced early mobility, more recent housing mobility did not relate with 
cognitive development.

Discussion

The present study tests an ecobiodevelopmental model of housing stability for healthy child 
development. Longitudinal analyses suggest housing mobility relates with disruptions in 
cognitive development beyond other multilevel risks experienced by a vulnerable population 
of children and families. Children who move two or more times in a 12-month period 
exhibit cognitive deficits that partially catch-up over a three-year follow-up. The rebound 
associated with housing mobility occurs across cognitive domains and for preschoolers, 
school-aged children, and adolescents. Frequent moves in infancy exhibit more enduring 
effects on nonverbal development and desensitize youth to disruptions associated with 
subsequent mobility. The pattern of effects emerges in the context of co-occurring threats 
associated with socioeconomic status, child maltreatment, family instability, and parallel 
growth of behavior regulation.

Findings extend prior research on cognitive development in the context of inadequate 
housing and other environmental adversities. As seen in previous research on poverty, the 
at-risk children in this study exhibit suppressed cognitive development (Farah et al., 2008; 
Noble et al., 2006; Noble et al., 2005), and mobile children exhibit even poorer cognitive 
performance after controlling for socioeconomic status. This result contradicts previous

conclusions that poverty explains the effects of housing mobility (Hango, 2006; Pribesh & 
Downey, 1999). Moreover, the partial rebound of abilities associated with housing mobility 
resembles the context-dependent effects of severe maltreatment and physical deprivation 
experienced in childhood which rebound following stabilization of the environment (Beckett 
et al., 2010; Jaffee, 2007; Straus & Paschall, 2009). The current results suggest that children 
partially adapt to the time-limited shock to learning introduced by inadequate housing, and 
this potential for adaptation to housing instability remains consistent across childhood and 
adolescence.

Results correspond with the proposed ecobiodevelopmental framework although not as 
expected. The theory supposes unique effects of housing through exposure to environmental 
adversities and disruption of important relationships that support learning. However, 
families stabilize and adapt to new environments, which helps explain partial rebounds in 
cognitive performance. Moreover, single moves and other short-term family changes fail to 
impair and may enhance cognitive development over time; movement toward stability likely 
promotes connections between systems that support learning. The ecobiodevelopmental 
theory also contextualizes prior research showing inconsistent effects of housing mobility on 
development (Coley et al., 2015; Hango, 2006). Threshold effects and developmental timing 
differences mask potentially important developmental processes triggered by inadequate 
housing. The dynamics of housing mobility and stabilization depend on characteristics and 
timings of moves.

Counterintuitive findings of the study also point to the complexity involved in raising 
children in the context of family instability. Unexpectedly, greater frequency of neglect as 
reported by caregivers was associated with higher baseline cognitive abilities, indicating a 
measure of parenting stress and lack of support. Caregiver reports of neglect focused on 
difficulties providing for children, such as inability to make sure the child had food, unable 
to make sure the child got to a doctor or hospital when needed, and left the child home 
alone. Increased scores might reflect greater recognition of important parenting behaviors 
that support child development. A second unexpected finding related to family instability, 
with family structure disruptions predicting higher scores of cognitive abilities. Similar to 
single residential moves, family changes could represent movement toward stabilization that 
promotes learning. The pattern of effects across cognitive domains suggested effects are not 
random or a function of multiple tests; however, interpretations are made cautiously and 
require future research.

An important implication of study findings reflects the failure of mobile children to fully 
catch-up in cognitive processes. Housing mobility related with persistent deficits in both 
verbal and nonverbal abilities over the three-year follow-up period and in the context of 
other co-occurring risks. Similar to poverty, inadequate housing might trigger 
neuropathophysiological processes that disrupt stress responses and subsequent brain 
development (Blair et al., 2011; Evans & Kim, 2012). Yet, malleability exists for children to 
overcome chaos associated with instable housing. Housing effects beyond poverty suggest 
unique but parallel pathways of mobility and poverty on cognitive development. Although 
improvements occur over time, housing mobility remains a unique threat to child well-being 
with meaningful implications for future functioning. The current study emphasizes the need

for empirically informed early intervention and prevention of housing instability among at-
risk families.

Affordable housing remains limited in most communities across the country. Only one-in-
four eligible families receive rental assistance through public housing programs (Rice & 
Sard, 2009), and communities struggle to provide timely emergency housing through the 
homeless system. Although mobile families frequently interact with other public agencies 
including the child welfare system, housing resources are scarce with little evidence to 
support their utility in stabilizing families (Fowler et al., 2013). Opportunities to intervene 
with insecurely housed families are frequently missed.

Interventions that promote cognitive functioning must be developed and tested to provide 
mobile children opportunities to catch-up. Strategies that pair cognitive and behavioral 
preventive interventions may prove most effective given developmental cascades associated 
with housing instability (Fowler et al., 2014). Targeted and timely services depend on 
reliable and valid assessments of housing instability, as well as other housing problems 
related to child development, such as overcrowding, dilapidated conditions, and 
unaffordability. Simply asking families about current and past housing experiences presents 
clinically meaningful information. As demonstrated in this study, a single item queried to 
caregivers under child welfare investigation on number of moves in the past year provides 
information on a risk to child development that exceeds maltreatment and other 
environmental adversities. Risk assessments in child welfare should include this indicator, 
while future research will augment measurement to briefly and accurately capture 
concurrent risks with other aspects of housing, such as unaffordability, overcrowding, and 
doubling-up. Moreover, coordinated screenings across social service systems affords the 
best chance for prevention. Inadequately housed families interact with multiple social 
service systems, including healthcare, mental health, schools, speech pathology, 
homelessness services, public assistance, child welfare, as well as others. Few 
comprehensive approaches exist to triage high-risk families (Fowler et al., 2013). 
Connections between service systems provide opportunities to direct housing resources to 
prevent instability and promote healthy child development.

A number of limitations contextualize study findings. Although models include an extensive 
array of potential confounds that explain associations between mobility and child outcomes, 
the observational design limits the ability account for selection processes that lead to 
frequent moves, which may bias estimates of housing effects. In particular, models that 
more comprehensively investigate the multilevel processes that lead to moves will enhance 
future research. The measurement of housing mobility is also limited; the study depends on 
retrospective reports of moves, as well as tracking address changes at follow-up interviews. 
Memory and recall biases threaten validity and fail to capture contributors to moves and 
other meaningful aspects of housing. In addition, a gap remains in housing histories between 
infancy and initial child proactive services investigation that provide meaningful 
information on child outcomes. Future research will benefit from examining onset and offset 
of housing instability and the subsequent effects on child development using a life course 
perspective.

Another limitation reflects lack of data on infants and toddlers. The study included youth as 
young as 4 years of age to capture developmentally congruent constructs of cognitive 
development. Future work that explicitly tests models of housing mobility in younger 
children will provide a more comprehensive picture of instability and stabilization effects. 
Furthermore, this study used broad assessments of cognitive ability that do not directly 
target specific cognitive domains, such as executive functioning, working memory, 
processing speed, or associations with specific academic skills and social-cognition. 
Research that identifies mediating cognitive processes further supports targeted preventive 
interventions. Finally, the study uses a nationally representative sample of families under 
investigation for child abuse and neglect. Although the population provides a rigorous test of 
housing mobility effects in the presence of co-occurring family risks, findings may not 
generalize to other populations.

Despite limitations, the present study provides a useful test of the ecobiodevelopmental 
model of housing stabilization on child development. The study demonstrates a unique 
cognitive rebound in verbal and nonverbal abilities associated with frequent mobility. 
However, failure of mobile children to catch-up fully in cognitive development highlights 
the importance of interventions aimed to stabilize families.
