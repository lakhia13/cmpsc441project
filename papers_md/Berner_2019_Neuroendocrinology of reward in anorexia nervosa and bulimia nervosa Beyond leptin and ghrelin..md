nervosa: Beyond leptin and ghrelin

Abstract

The pathophysiology of anorexia nervosa (AN) and bulimia nervosa (BN) are still poorly 
understood, but psychobiological models have proposed a key role for disturbances in the 
neuroendocrines that signal hunger and satiety and maintain energy homeostasis. Mounting 
evidence suggests that many neuroendocrines involved in the regulation of homeostasis and body 
weight also play integral roles in food reward valuation and learning via their interactions with the 
mesolimbic dopamine system. Neuroimaging data have associated altered brain reward responses 
in this system with the dietary restriction and binge eating and purging characteristic of AN and 
BN. Thus, neuroendocrine dysfunction may contribute to or perpetuate eating disorder symptoms 
via effects on reward circuitry. This narrative review focuses on reward-related neuroendocrines 
that are altered in eating disorder populations, including peptide YY, insulin, stress and gonadal 
hormones, and orexins. We provide an overview of the animal and human literature implicating 
these neuroendocrines in dopaminergic reward processes and discuss their potential relevance to 
eating disorder symptomatology and treatment.

Introduction

Anorexia nervosa (AN) and bulimia nervosa (BN) are serious psychiatric disorders with 
often chronic courses, multifactorial etiopathogeneses, and poorly understood biological 
maintenance factors (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). A large body of research 
aimed at identifying these factors has focused on potential alterations in the neurobiology of 
hunger and satiety. This includes neurotransmitters and central and peripheral neuropeptides 
involved in promoting and inhibiting eating behavior to maintain energy balance and body 
weight via the hypothalamus (Bailer and Kaye, 2003), and the insula, which merges sensory

taste experience (Fudge et al, 2005; Small, 2010) with interoceptive signaling from the 
ventral striatum and hypothalamus to guide behavior.

However, eating is a complex process that involves integration of additional homeostatic 
signals (e.g., for energy balance, reproductive health, stress level) and input from reward 
circuitry. In humans and rodents, ventral tegmental area (VTA), nucleus accumbens (NAc), 
ventral caudate and putamen, amygdala, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and orbitofrontal 
cortex (OFC) are involved in the anticipation and processing of rewards (Baker et al, 2016; 
Daniel and Pollmann, 2014; Diekhof et al, 2012; Grabenhorst and Rolls, 2011; Izquierdo, 
2017). Critical for mediating the rewarding and reinforcing effects of food, in particular, is 
the mesolimbic dopamine (DA) pathway, which includes projection neurons from VTA to 
NAc and dopaminergic D1 and D2 receptors that are involved in reward learning and 
incentive salience (Berridge, 2009; Berridge and Robinson, 1998; Kelley, 2004; Roitman et 
al, 2004; Schultz et al, 1997). A large body of evidence from human neuroimaging studies 
and animal models of eating disorders suggests that the structure and function of reward 
circuitry is altered in association with binge eating, purging, and dietary restriction in BN 
and AN, and that some of these alterations are apparent early in illness onset and persist 
after symptoms remit (for review, see Avena and Bocarsly, 2012; Frank, 2013; Kaye et al, 
2013; O’Hara et al, 2015).

Disturbances in the integration of homeostatic and reward signaling may promote hedonic 
eating, or food approach and eating past satiety or energy requirements, which likely also 
plays a critical role in eating disorder onset and/or symptom maintenance (Keating et al, 
2012). Although decades of research have documented neuroendocrine alterations in 
individuals with AN and BN relative to controls (for review, see Culbert et al, 2016; 
Tortorella et al, 2014), only more recently have these alterations been hypothesized to 
contribute to the altered neural bases of reward processes in eating disorders. Improved 
understanding of how neuropeptides influence reward circuitry and food reward specifically 
has potential for significant clinical impact, as it could inform targeted interventions for 
eating disorders.

This narrative review focuses on select neuroendocrine signals that show alterations in 
individuals with AN and BN and interface with reward circuitry--specifically, striatal DA 
pathways shown to play an integral role in feeding reward behavior (Ferrario et al, 2016). 
Several neuropeptides play a role in peripheral homeostatic regulation of energy balance. 
Some of these peptides serve as signals for energy stores or cellular metabolism, and, when 
integrated with reward signals, influence motivated eating behavior (Volkow et al, 2011). 
Alterations in these signals or their integration with DA reward signaling may potentiate 
eating disorder symptoms. Interactions of gonadal hormones known to regulate food intake 
and energy metabolism (Xu and López, 2018) with the reward system also may play an 
important role in disordered eating. Several prior reviews have focused on potential reward-
related roles of leptin and ghrelin in eating disorders (Monteleone et al, 2018; Monteleone et 
al, 2008; Monteleone and Maj, 2013). In addition, previous reviews have posited a potential 
reward-related role for insulin alterations in obesity (Murray et al, 2014), but not eating 
disorders. The current review is the first to focus on interactions of DA reward circuitry with

peptide YY (PYY), insulin, orexins, and stress and gonadal hormones and the resulting 
potential implications for AN and BN symptoms and treatment.

Studies through June 2018 were identified using the following search terms in Google 
Scholar, PubMed, and PsycINFO search engines: eating disorders, anorexia nervosa, bulimia 
nervosa, binge eating, eating, feeding, stress, peptide YY, PYY, insulin, orexin, cortisol, 
glucocorticoid, HPA axis, estrogen, estradiol, progesterone, testosterone, androgen, reward, 
dopamine, animal model, rodent, neuroimaging, fMRI. Of note, to maintain a focused scope 
for this review, we address research related to AN and BN, and we do not address other 
reward pathways (e.g., opiodergic) that are also likely implicated in altered reward signaling 
in eating disorders (Berridge, 2009). This narrative review provides updated examples from 
the literature and does not represent a systematic or complete update to the entire body of 
work. For each hormone, we review (1) its basic function, (2) animal and human 
neuroimaging and biological studies that have revealed its interaction with the dopaminergic 
reward system, (3) case-control comparison studies that have documented altered levels of 
the hormone in individuals with AN and BN, and (4) studies that have directly evaluated 
associations of levels of the hormone with eating disorder symptomatology and related 
implications for novel interventions for AN and BN symptoms.

2.  Peptide YY (PYY)

PYY is a 36-amino acid polypeptide anorexigenic hormone that is released in the endocrine 
L cells of the distal ileum and colon in response to food intake (Adrian et al, 1985; 
Pedersen-Bjergaard et al, 1996) resulting in increased satiety. While the peptide exists in two 
primary forms (PYY1–36 and PYY3–36), this review will focus on PYY3–36, which is the 
main circulating form of PYY released in fasting and postprandial states. PYY3–36 binds 
with the greatest affinity to the Y2 receptor (Abbott et al, 2005), which signals satiety by 
inhibiting Neuropeptide Y and stimulating proopiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons in the 
arcuate nucleus (le Roux and Bloom, 2005). Peripheral PYY also functions as a satiety 
signal in response to a meal in part by signaling decreased ghrelin production (Batterham 
and Bloom, 2003a). Translational research supports that PYY3−36 exerts its anorectic 
effects by acting upon central appetite-regulating circuits, with the hypothalamic arcuate 
nucleus and brain stem regions identified as key areas (Chandarana and Batterham, 2008; 
Ghitza et al, 2007). PYY levels start to increase approximately 15 minutes after food 
ingestion, reaching a peak 1–2 hours postprandially and remaining elevated several hours 
later (Adrian et al, 1985).

2.1 

Interactions with the Dopaminergic Reward System

2.1.1  Animal Studies.—Animal studies suggest that PYY3–36 inhibits DA and 
norepinephrine release in the hypothalamus through binding to Y2 receptors (Brunetti et al, 
2005) but increases the synthesis and release of DA in the rat striatum (Adewale et al, 2007). 
These dopaminergic effects are thought to be indirectly mediated by other neurotransmitter 
systems that are functionally connected with dopaminergic pathways (Stadlbauer et al, 
2014).

Peripheral infusion of PYY3–36 inhibits food intake in a dose-dependent manner in rats 
(Batterham et al, 2002; Chelikani et al, 2004) and produces sustained reductions in food 
intake and weight gain when administered for 7 to 10 days (Batterham et al, 2002; Chelikani 
et al, 2006). Additional studies have examined mechanisms of action of PYY3–36 when 
administered centrally and peripherally. Injection of PYY3–36 directly into the arcuate 
nucleus of the hypothalamus inhibits food intake by releasing neuropeptide Y and 
stimulating release of alpha-Melanocyte-stimulating hormone (Batterham et al, 2003b; 
Batterham et al, 2002). To mimic peripheral prandial release of PYY, Stadlbauer et al. 
(Stadlbauer et al, 2013) examined the acute effects of brief, intrameal PYY3–36 infusions 
into the hepatic portal vein in the GI tract on feeding behavior in mice. PYY3−36 infusions 
reduced meal size in mice compared to vehicle control, and increased the number of c-Fos 
expressing cells in metabolic regulation and reward regions including: the nucleus of the 
solitary tract, the hypothalamic arcuate and paraventricular nuclei, the central amygdala, and 
the NAc.

2.1.2  Human Neuroimaging and Biological Studies.—PYY3–36 plays a similar 
role in reducing food intake in humans. Batterham et al. (2002) administered a 90-min 
infusion of PYY3–36 to healthy humans, which resulted in 36% decreased energy intake 
during an ad libitum meal, compared to saline control. These anorexigenic effects lasted for 
up to 12 hours following PYY administration. In a subsequent study, comparable decreases 
in ad libitum buffet food intake were found following exogenous PYY infusion in both 
normal-weight and obese adults (Batterham et al, 2003b).

Additional information on the central mechanism of action of PYY3–36 in humans comes 
from multiple studies combining PYY3–36 infusion with fMRI. Indeed, PYY3–36 infusion 
modulates neuronal activity in homeostatic (brainstem parabrachial nucleus and 
hypothalamus) and reward regions (amygdala, OFC, VTA, ventral striatum, and insula), with 
the greatest effects on activity in the left caudolateral OFC (Batterham et al, 2007). After 
PYY infusion, mimicking a fed state, changes in OFC activation predicted food intake, 
while under the saline condition, mimicking a relatively fasted state, hypothalamic activity 
predicted food intake. During PYY infusion, but not saline, change in OFC activation 
negatively correlated with meal pleasantness, suggesting that PYY modulates the OFC to 
decrease the reward value of food. Consistent with these results, De Silva et al. (2011) found 
attenuated neural activity across brain regions implicated in reward including the OFC, 
amygdala, insula, caudate, putamen, and NAc in response to food images during 
administration of PYY3−36 (versus saline). In a combined PET/MRI study, Weise et al. 
(2011) found that higher postprandial PYY concentrations were associated with greater grey 
matter volume and lower regional cerebral blood flow in the bilateral caudate nucleus. 
Postprandial caudate activity was also strongly negatively correlated with blood flow in the 
right OFC. Thus, pharmacological neuroimaging findings suggest that PYY3–36 exerts its 
effects on reducing food intake by acting on brain circuits related to both reward and energy 
homeostasis, with particular emphasis on attenuating activity of the OFC.

2.2  Case-Control Comparisons: Altered Levels among Individuals with AN and BN 
Relative to Healthy Controls

Studies examining basal levels of PYY in participants currently meeting diagnostic criteria 
for AN have demonstrated mixed findings, with some studies reporting lower levels of PYY 
(Germain et al, 2010; Germain et al, 2007), some finding higher levels (Misra et al, 2006; 
Nakahara et al, 2007), and some finding no differences between individuals with AN and 
controls (Berrettini et al, 1988; Fernández-Aranda et al, 2016; Sedlackova et al, 2012; Stock 
et al, 2005). After recovery from AN, plasma PYY levels appear to normalize (Gendall et al, 
1999a). In regard to differences between AN subtypes, Eddy et al., (2015) demonstrated that 
PYY3–36 levels were lower among individuals currently meeting diagnostic criteria for the 
binge-eating/purging subtype of AN (AN-BP) versus restricting-type AN. However, after 
recovery, levels of PYY are comparable across AN subtypes (Gendall et al, 1999a). In 
response to a test meal, individuals with AN have been shown to display either a time-
delayed PYY response (Stock et al, 2005) or increased PYY response (Nakahara et al, 2007) 
compared to controls. After treatment and acute weight gain, Nakahara et al. (2007) found 
that plasma PYY3–36 response to eating was improved, but not normalized. Plasma PYY 
alterations in response to eating also seem to be nutrient specific, as levels reached 
significantly higher values in AN during a high protein versus high carbohydrate breakfast, 
to a greater degree than controls (Sedlackova et al, 2012). Further, in adolescent AN, greater 
levels of PYY predicted lower fat intake, lower percentage of calories derived from fat, and 
higher percentage of calories derived from carbohydrates (Misra et al, 2006).

Studies examining plasma levels of PYY among individuals with BN have been similarly 
mixed, demonstrating either lower plasma PYY levels compared to controls (Germain et al, 
2010) or no differences between BN groups and controls (Berrettini et al, 1988; Gendall et 
al, 1999b; Sedlackova et al, 2012). Individuals with BN who had been abstinent from binge 
eating or purging for 30 days demonstrated significantly higher CSF PYY values compared 
to normal controls (Berrettini et al, 1988; Kaye et al, 1990) and relative to their own values 
when actively engaging in binge eating and purging (Berrettini et al, 1988). In contrast, 
plasma PYY levels appear to normalize after at least one year of recovery from BN (Gendall 
et al, 1999a). Mixed results have also been found in response to a test meal, with some 
studies demonstrating no significant difference in PYY response (Devlin et al, 2012; Keel et 
al, 2018), lower response (Kojima et al, 2005b), or higher response (Sedlackova et al, 2012) 
among individuals with BN compared to healthy controls.

2.3  Associations with Eating Disorder Symptoms and Related Implications for Treatment

Results from animal studies and studies of healthy human subjects support that high levels 
of PYY may play a role in reducing the hedonic value of food, contributing to decreased 
food consumption. However, findings from case-control studies of individuals with AN and 
BN may be mixed because of symptom heterogeneity within eating disorder groups or 
because of altered PYY responses to disordered eating, regardless of basal levels. Mixed 
findings among individuals with AN and normalization in PYY levels after recovery make it 
difficult to determine whether alterations in PYY represent a cause or consequence of low 
weight. In addition, analyses within groups of individuals with BN suggest that mixed case-
control findings may be driven by individual differences in responses to eating, and some

authors have suggested that BN symptoms may represent an effort to normalize an altered 
PYY response (Berrettini et al 1988). When PYY levels were examined before, during, and 
immediately after binge-purge episodes, individuals with BN showed slightly higher 
postprandial peak values of PYY compared to healthy controls (Kaye et al, 1990), but after 
vomiting, cerebrospinal fluid PYY levels were comparable to control levels (Berrettini et al, 
1988; Kaye et al, 1990). The maximum number of participants with eating disorders 
included in these prior studies was 22 per group; additional research in larger samples is 
needed to comprehensively examine associations of basal PYY and PYY dynamics with 
symptom clusters and severity.

Regarding implications for treatment, results from studies testing the effect of PYY infusion 
suggest that exogenous administration may reduce short-term food intake (over the course of 
12 hours) in healthy humans. In addition, intranasal PYY has been investigated for reducing 
food intake in obesity (Gantz et al, 2007). Intranasal PYY administered during high-risk 
periods for binge eating could have potential therapeutic value for BN.

3. 

Insulin

Plasma insulin levels vary with adiposity and serve as a signal of long-term energy stores 
(Bagdade et al, 1967). However, this anorexigenic pancreatic hormone is also secreted 
immediately after glucose consumption and is central to glucose metabolism. Animal data 
show that central administration of insulin suppresses food intake (Air et al, 2002a) and 
deletion of insulin receptors potentiates hyperphagia and obesity (Bruning et al, 2000). 
Insulin crosses the blood-brain barrier (Woods et al, 2003), and insulin receptors are highest 
in concentration in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus, hippocampus, and cortex 
(Hopkins and Williams, 1997). Its key mechanism of action for appetite regulation may 
involve the inhibition of norepinephrine reuptake (Boyd Jr et al, 1985). Like leptin, high-fat 
diet impairs the action of insulin (Figlewicz and Benoit, 2009b), even after brief exposure to 
this diet (Figlewicz et al, 2009b). In addition, treatment with insulin mimetics attenuates 
weight gain and adiposity after high-fat diet maintenance in mice (Air et al, 2002b).

3.1 

Interactions with the Dopaminergic Reward System

3.1.1  Animal Studies.—In addition to its role in homeostatic feeding, insulin plays a 
complex role in food reward signaling via the mesolimbic DA system, with seemingly 
differential effects in dorsal and ventral striatum, and NAc shell and core (Caravaggio et al, 
2015). DA neurons in the VTA are rich in insulin receptors (Figlewicz, 2003), and insulin 
reduces excitatory inputs into VTA DA neurons (Labouebe et al, 2013), increases DA 
reuptake transporter synthesis in the VTA (Mebel et al, 2012), and changes the rate of DA 
neuron firing (Figlewicz, 2003). However, insulin increases DA release in the NAc, caudate, 
and putamen to signal reward (Stouffer et al, 2015). In animals, data show that insulin may 
also impact dorsal striatal DA release, which has been associated in humans with food 
pleasantness ratings (Morris et al, 2011; Small et al, 2003).

Across several behavioral paradigms, insulin has been demonstrated to modify both acute 
and learned reward valuation (Figlewicz et al, 2009b). Preclinical models show that insulin’s 
reduction of excitatory inputs into VTA DA neurons reduces the motivational salience of

contextual cues associated with palatable, sweetened and high-fat food, but has no effect on 
the effort expended to obtain the food (Labouebe et al, 2013). Insulin’s effects on VTA DA 
may therefore affect reward-based learning without directly impacting the reward value of 
palatable food stimuli. In contrast, insulin has been shown to increase DA release in the NAc 
shell via cholinergic interneurons, and is required for conditioned preference for a flavor that 
signals glucose, suggesting that insulin in the NAc shell may play a role in food preferences 
(Stouffer et al, 2015). Chronic food restriction in animals promotes hypoinsulinemia and 
increases the sensitivity of this striatal DA release to insulin, whereas an obesogenic diet 
promotes hyperinsulinemia and decreases this sensitivity (Stouffer et al, 2015). Together, 
these data support that at some sites, insulin serves as a satiety signal, but at others, it serves 
as a signal of the rewarding value of the food that was eaten to promote future, similar eating 
(Stouffer et al, 2015). Insulin’s action in the NAc, involved in learning about food’s 
rewarding and nutritional properties (Woods et al, 2016), could complement insulin’s satiety 
signaling in the hypothalamus and VTA (Schulingkamp et al, 2000).

3.1.2  Human Neuroimaging and Biological Studies.—Data from healthy adults 
indicate that insulin levels are positively correlated with ventral striatal endogenous DA at 
D2/3 receptors and that acute DA depletion decreases insulin sensitivity and increases 
insulin levels (Caravaggio et al, 2015). Moreover, human neuroimaging findings indicate 
that non-insulin-resistant individuals show NAc activation during food valuation, but that 
non-diabetic, insulin-resistant individuals do not (Tiedemann et al, 2017). Moreover, among 
individuals with no insulin resistance, intranasal insulin reduces self-reported food valuation 
ratings and neural activation in the NAc and VTA during food valuation, but increases these 
signals in individuals with insulin resistance (Tiedemann et al, 2017). Results of dynamic 
causal modeling indicate that insulin negatively modulates projections from the VTA to the 
NAc, but not from the NAc to the VTA, and this negative modulation from the VTA to NAc 
predicts reduced self-reported valuation ratings of food cues (Tiedemann et al, 2017). These 
findings directly extend animal data (Labouebe et al, 2013; Mebel et al, 2012) by suggesting 
that in non-insulin-resistant individuals, insulin suppresses the NAc salience response to 
food cues via negative modulation from the VTA. In addition, these findings are consistent 
with prior reports of an inverse association in healthy-weight men between post-meal 
increases in plasma insulin concentrations and blood oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) signal 
in salience and reward circuitry (insula and OFC) (Tataranni et al, 1999). Intranasal insulin 
reduces both OFC and hypothalamic activation (as measured by fractional amplitude of low-
frequency fluctuations) in healthy-weight adult females (Kullmann et al, 2013).

3.2  Case-Control Comparisons: Altered Levels among Individuals with AN and BN 
Relative to Healthy Controls

Findings regarding insulin levels across eating disorder diagnoses have been mixed. A recent 
meta-analysis of 13 studies supports increased insulin sensitivity in AN (Iyas et al, 2017), 
although increased, attenuated, and normal postprandial insulin secretion levels have been 
documented during the underweight, acutely ill state (Misra and Klibanski, 2010; Prince et 
al, 2009). Data seem to consistently suggest that these levels normalize in recovery (Misra et 
al, 2010; Prince et al, 2009), but a recently documented positive association between genetic 
factors for insulin sensitivity (insulin resistance and fasting insulin) and AN (Duncan et al,

2017) may point to a more trait-like, overlapping neurobiological vulnerability in appetitive 
and reward alterations.

Data are similarly mixed in BN. One study reported normal insulin levels and insulin 
sensitivity in BN (Raphael et al, 1995) and another reported normative insulin response to an 
intravenous glucose challenge test (Blouin et al, 1993), whereas others report an elevated 
insulin response to a test meal (Schweiger et al, 1987), and still others report attenuated 
fasting insulin concentrations and peak insulin values relative to controls after a non-binge 
eating episode (Kojima et al, 2005a; Naessen et al, 2011). Notably, the altered pattern of 
insulin response in BN may vary widely depending on behavioral symptoms of the disorder. 
Data collected throughout the process of binge eating and purging suggest that peripheral 
insulin levels tend to increase during binge episodes but precipitously decline following 
vomiting (Kaye et al, 1988). However, relative to healthy controls who ingest a large meal, 
individuals with BN show exaggerated insulin release for 3 hours after binge eating and 
vomiting (Kaye et al, 1989). In addition, insulin response to an oral glucose tolerance test 
was highest in individuals with the least frequent binge eating and vomiting and blunted in 
individuals with the most frequent binge eating and vomiting and the greatest weight 
instability (Russell et al, 1996). The authors speculate that this may be related to the greater 
degree of nutritional depletion in this group of patients.

3.3  Associations with Eating Disorder Symptoms and Related Implications for Treatment

Overall, data suggest that insulin levels and/or insulin sensitivity may alter the reward signal 
from food via modulation of DA pathways. Chronically high insulin levels or increased 
insulin resistance could affect this modulation (Tiedemann et al, 2017). Increased insulin 
sensitivity among individuals with AN who engage in chronic food restriction could 
attenuate motivation to eat, or, as has been proposed for altered ghrelin levels in AN 
(Monteleone et al, 2018), promote reward-based learning about restrictive behaviors. 
Hypoinsulinemia or increased insulin sensitivity could also, via action in the NAc, 
ultimately promote overeating, explaining the common onset of binge eating and purging 
symptoms in individuals originally presenting with restricting-type AN (Eddy et al, 2008). It 
has been proposed that since insulin may promote DA neuron growth, chronic starvation and 
chronically low levels of circulating insulin could more directly impact DA neuronal 
function and result in anhedonic mood and amotivation, which are commonly observed in 
AN, even after weight restoration (Boehm et al, 2018). However, insulin insensitivity and/or 
altered postprandial insulin release in individuals with BN, mimicking that seen in obese 
rats, may reduce reward after food ingestion and promote further consumption of high-
glucose foods (Stouffer et al, 2015). Intranasal insulin has been shown to reduce appetite and 
intake in rodents and healthy individuals (Jauch-Chara et al, 2012), and could help to 
normalize reward responsivity to food stimuli in the context of insulin insensitivity in eating 
disorder populations.

4.  HPA Axis Neuroendocrines

The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis constitutes a major neuroendocrine system 
that regulates stress and influences appetite and eating. The cascading hormonal release by

the HPA axis in response to a physical or psychological stressor begins with corticotrophin 
releasing hormone (CRH), released from the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, 
which stimulates the release of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) from the anterior 
pituitary gland, which in turn induces release of glucocorticoids (GC) from the adrenal 
cortex. In humans, the primary GC is cortisol (Adam and Epel, 2007; Herman et al, 2003; 
Ulrich-Lai and Herman, 2009). GCs bind to two receptor types in the brain: the 
glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR; ter Heedge et al, 
2015). Ultimately this HPA-mediated hormonal cascade serves to mobilize energy reserves 
to facilitate either reactive or anticipatory adaption to a stressor (Herman et al, 2016). 
Following termination of a stressor, GCs inhibit HPA axis function through negative 
feedback, with additional inhibitory influences on associated cortical regions including 
limbic areas and the prefrontal cortex to return to homeostasis (Herman et al, 2003; Herman 
et al, 2016; Oitzl et al, 2010). Of particular relevance to eating disorders, GCs impact 
appetite, food intake, and weight in humans (Epel et al, 2001; Tataranni et al, 1996; 
Wolkowitz et al, 2001), and play a key role in reward-based eating in response to stress 
(Adam et al, 2007).

4.1 

Interactions with the Dopaminergic Reward System

The limbic and paralimbic neural circuits regulating stress and food reward have 
considerable overlap. This circuitry includes the hypothalamus, amygdala, hippocampus, 
ventral striatum, and insula (Cleck and Blendy, 2008; Monteleone et al, 2018). In these 
regions, densely concentrated receptors (CRF1, CRF2, GR, and MR) for stress hormones 
modulate both the stress response and appetite (Chalmers et al, 1995; Chalmers et al, 1996; 
Lawson et al, 2013; McEwen, 1988; McEwen et al, 1986; McEwen et al, 1969; Struber et al, 
2014). The primary hormones involved in the HPA axis-mediated stress response (CRH, 
ACTH, cortisol) have complex and in some cases opposite effects on reward-driven appetite 
and eating. Typically, during acute stress, CRH is anorexigenic and induces a similarly 
anorexigenic effect of cortisol. However, during prolonged stress, chronically elevated 
cortisol promotes inhibition of CRH and ultimately results in increased appetite and food 
intake (an overall orexigenic effect; Adam et al, 2007; Cavagnini et al, 2000; Crespo et al, 
2014; Greeno and Wing, 1994). This shift from acute to chronic effects of stress on appetite 
is thought to be an important mechanism underlying the association between stress and 
weight gain (Gluck, 2006; Torres and Nowson, 2007).

4.1.1  Animal Studies.—Emerging evidence from the addiction literature suggests GCs 
directly interact with the mesolimbic DA system. In rats, GC release appears to directly 
activate GRs in DA-sensitive neurons in mesolimbic regions, triggering functional changes 
in this system and sensitizing response to appetitive stimuli (e.g., psychostimulant drugs; 
Cho and Little, 1999; Hensleigh and Pritchard, 2013). This stress-induced sensitization is 
thought to result from increased synaptic excitability in VTA DA neurons after activation of 
GRs (Daftary et al, 2009; Graf et al, 2013; Saal et al, 2003), with recent work suggesting 
that corticosterone may also decrease DA uptake in the NAc (Wheeler et al, 2017).

An expansive animal literature has investigated HPA axis function with regard to feeding 
behavior, particularly in relation to stress (Adam et al, 2007; Gluck, 2006; Guarda et al,

2015; Jahng, 2011; Torres et al, 2007; Yau and Potenza, 2013). Evidence indicates that acute 
increases in GC (e.g., prompted by stressors) may enhance motivation for food intake, 
particularly when the stressor is mild to moderate in nature and the food is palatable (Bell et 
al, 2000; Bhatnagar et al, 2000; Dallman et al, 2004; Torres et al, 2007). GC administration 
and corticosterone (the primary GC in rodents) replacement induce hyperphagia, increased 
fat intake, and weight gain (Bray, 1985; Castonguay, 1991; Dallman et al, 1995; Dallman et 
al, 2003; Zakrzewska et al, 1999). In contrast, centrally administered CRH decreases feeding 
behavior and reduces food approach behaviors (Dunn and Berridge, 1990; Glowa and Gold, 
1991). Studies of adrenalectomized rats have demonstrated reduced food intake that is 
reversible via GC administration (Bell et al, 2000; Bhatnagar et al, 2000; Freedman et al, 
1986). Notably, food deprivation in rodents is associated with marked increases ACTH and 
corticosterone, as well as reduced efficacy of the negative feedback of corticosterone on 
HPA axis activity (Dallman et al, 1999; Jahng et al, 2005; Kim et al, 2005; Makimura et al, 
2003; Timofeeva et al, 2002).

HPA axis function has also been investigated in studies using animal models of eating 
disorders, such as the activity-based anorexia (ABA) model, dietary restriction models, and 
models of binge eating behavior (Corwin et al, 2011; Klenotich and Dulawa, 2012; Siegfried 
et al, 2003). For example, HPA axis activity and plasma levels of corticosterone have been 
found to be increased in ABA rodents undergoing weight loss (Broocks et al, 1991; de Rijke 
et al, 2005), and evidence suggests that ABA exposure during adolescence has lasting 
impacts on HPA axis function and anxiety-like behavior even following return to normal 
body weight (Kinzig and Hargrave, 2010). Altered HPA axis function, such as elevated 
corticosterone levels, has also been implicated in animal models of binge eating and during 
withdraw from a highly palatable diet (Artiga et al, 2007; Corwin et al, 2011; Teegarden and 
Bale, 2007). Stress hormones may thus promote continuation of binge-like behavior, 
particularly when highly palatable food is available. Notably, substantial evidence from 
animal models suggests sex differences in HPA axis functioning, including greater GC 
secretion in females versus males in response to various behavioral and physiological 
stressors, as well as well as more rapid increases and prolonged duration of elevated levels 
(Goel et al, 2014). Such differences could in theory confer greater risk of problematic eating 
patterns in response to stress among females, perhaps contributing to the known sex 
differences in disordered eating among humans.

4.1.2  Human Neuroimaging and Biological Studies.—In human studies, higher 
levels of stress and cortisol have been found to promote selection and intake of more 
palatable and calorically dense foods with greater fat and sugar content (Born et al, 2010b; 
Epel et al, 2001; Newman et al, 2007). Additionally, cortisol levels have been found to 
differentiate appetite-based subgroups (decreased versus increased) in major depressive 
disorder, with cortisol values also demonstrating a negative correlation with ventral striatal 
response to food cue exposure (Simmons et al, 2018). Together, these studies suggest stress 
hormones influence food preference and consumption via influences on reward circuitry.

Studies using stress induction tasks during fMRI reveal that the experience of acute stress 
dampens brain response to food cues in limbic reward circuitry in healthy weight individuals 
(Born et al, 2010a). In contrast, in overweight or obese individuals, acute stress elicits

greater amygdala response to taste of highly palatable food (milkshake), with a significant 
association between amygdala response and basal cortisol (Rudenga et al, 2013), which may 
drive appetitive “stress” eating. In BN, activation to food cues in the precuneus, ACC, 
amygdala, and ventral medial prefrontal cortex is reduced following acute stress (Fischer et 
al, 2017), and this decreased response is associated with increased perceived stress prior to 
binge eating, linking brain response to clinical symptoms (Collins et al, 2017; Fischer et al, 
2017). Given the precuneus’ role in self-referential thought, these findings have been 
interpreted to support escape theories of binge eating in BN (i.e., the notion that binge eating 
is triggered by acute stress and is negatively reinforcing as it serves to distract from or 
reduce self-awareness and negative self-referential thought; Collins et al, 2017; Heatherton 
and Baumeister, 1991).

fMRI studies in AN suggest that HPA axis disturbances may suppress appetitive drive 
through directly affecting appetite-regulating brain regions (Lawson et al, 2013). 
Independent of BMI, individuals with AN compared to healthy controls show decreased 
activation in response to food cues in hypothalamus, amygdala, hippocampus, OFC, and 
insula, and this decreased activation is associated with elevated cortisol levels (Lawson et al, 
2013). Furthermore, in a recent study of prediction error brain reward response in AN (Frank 
et al, 2018), cortisol levels were positively associated with prediction error response for 
sweet taste in the right superior frontal gyrus and caudate head among participants with AN. 
Accordingly, Frank et al hypothesize a model of AN maintenance in which elevated stress 
hormones, promoted by cognitive symptoms of AN, function to both suppress food intake 
and enhance reward prediction error signaling.

4.2  Case-Control Comparisons: Altered Levels among Individuals with AN and BN 
Relative to Healthy Controls

Dysregulated HPA axis function, in response to both acute and chronic stress, has been 
implicated in eating disorder pathophysiology (Lo Sauro et al, 2008; Mazurak et al, 2011; 
Monteleone et al, 2018; Peschel et al, 2016). Basal serum and salivary cortisol levels in 
individuals with AN and BN indicate HPA axis hyperactivity (Culbert et al, 2016). Cortisol 
awakening response (CAR), or the rapid increase in cortisol approximately 30 minutes after 
awakening thought to reflect the reactivity capacity of the HPA axis, is also altered in AN. 
Women with current AN, particularly those with AN-BP, show elevated CAR compared to 
controls, suggesting a potentially cumulative relationship between chronic starvation and 
binge-purge behaviors to HPA axis dysfunction in AN (Culbert et al, 2016; Monteleone et al, 
2016a; Monteleone et al, 2016b). However, this enhanced salivary cortisol response is not 
present following weight restoration (Monteleone et al, 2016b), and starvation and weight 
loss have known effects on HPA hyperactivity (Fichter et al, 1986). Thus, elevated CAR in 
AN may be a consequence of the physical stress associated with starvation, or a 
compensatory response to starvation, rather than psychological symptoms of AN or a 
biological risk factor for AN development (Monteleone et al, 2016b). Consistent with this 
hypothesis, CAR levels are not altered in normal-weight individuals with BN (Monteleone et 
al, 2014).

Data on response to acute, laboratory-based physical and/or psychosocial stress exposure in 
eating disorders are more variable (Culbert et al, 2016; Het et al, 2014; Vannucci et al, 
2015). Overall, however, in contrast to evidence of elevated basal cortisol levels in AN and 
BN, these individuals show a blunted cortisol response to acute stress (Culbert et al, 2016; 
Ginty et al, 2012; Het et al, 2014; Vannucci et al, 2015). This blunted stress reactivity could 
reflect HPA axis hormone downregulation due to chronic and pervasive stress exposure.

4.3  Associations with Eating Disorder Symptoms and Related Implications for Treatment

Disturbance of HPA axis functioning associated with both acute and chronic stressors in 
eating disorders is particularly concerning given that dysfunctional and/or protracted 
activation of the HPA axis is energetically costly and has been proposed as a potent 
maintaining factor for psychiatric illness (Herman et al, 2016). Average nocturnal cortisol 
levels were positively associated with multiple cognitive measures of eating disorder 
psychopathology in a sample of women ranging from underweight to obese, controlling for 
BMI (Lawson et al, 2011). Emerging evidence suggests that altered HPA axis function in 
AN may contribute to the maintenance of behavioral symptoms, such as food restriction, by 
reducing appetite and the motivation to eat, possibly by altering food reward and motivation 
circuity (Lawson et al, 2013). Indeed, elevated serum cortisol levels are associated with 
lower fasting homeostatic and hedonic measures of subjective appetite in AN (Lawson et al, 
2013). Less is known about the role of HPA axis function in BN, although recent imaging 
findings provide preliminary support for the notion that stress may perpetuate binge episodes 
by reducing brain reward response to food or food anticipation and reducing brain activation 
in attention or self-referential networks, thus facilitating distraction from self-awareness 
consistent with escape theories of binge eating in BN (Collins et al, 2017; Fischer et al, 
2017).

Notably, a potential confound in this research is the role of trauma exposure. HPA axis 
dysfunction is also strongly implicated in those who have experienced early-life traumas 
(e.g., abuse or neglect in childhood; Heim and Nemeroff, 2001), and these experiences are 
associated with greater eating disorder psychopathology (Smolak and Murnen, 2002). It is 
possible that altered HPA axis activity resulting from childhood trauma exposure could 
relate to the development of eating disorder psychopathology; however, prospective research 
will be needed to address this hypothesis.

5.  Gonadal Hormones

Estrogen, progesterone, and androgens (testosterone) are steroid hormones that have distinct 
effects on the central nervous system depending on the developmental timing of their 
activity. Pre- and perinatal levels have been shown to have “organizational effects” on brain 
development and anatomical structure and function that are considered permanent, whereas 
acute levels can temporarily affect behavior and cognition via “activational effects” (Arnold 
and Breedlove, 1985). In male and female brains, estradiol is produced from testosterone. 
Given well-documented sex differences in both reward sensitivity (Becker and Chartoff, 
2018) and risk for eating disorder development (American Psychiatric Association, 2013), as 
well as a link between early pubertal onset, when gonadal hormone levels surge, and risk for

eating pathology across sexes (Ullsperger and Nikolas, 2017), a growing body of research 
has focused on the notion that these hormones may influence reward circuit alterations that 
contribute to eating disorders.

5.1 

Interactions with the Dopaminergic Reward System

5.1.1  Animal Studies.—Research supports both organizational and activational effects 
of gonadal hormones on reward circuity implicated in eating behavior. Of the ovarian 
hormones, estradiol is typically theorized to primarily affect DA release in the dorsal and 
ventral striatum, but data suggest that progesterone also plays an important role, and that 
these hormones may have interactive or synergistic effects (Yoest et al, 2018). Within 
minutes, estradiol can enhance striatal DA release, activity of the D1 receptor, and decrease 
the affinity and number of inhibitory D2 receptors (Yoest et al, 2018). In humans, prenatal 
testosterone exposure is associated with increased reward sensitivity (Lombardo et al, 2012) 
and, in females, increased impulsivity (Lucas and Koff, 2010). In rats, progesterone further 
potentiates dorsal striatal and NAc DA release and increases striatal DA D2 receptor binding 
in estradiol-primed females. However, progesterone administration alone decreases D2 
receptor binding. Relatively fewer studies have focused on estradiol effects on ventral 
striatum DA, but estrogen receptors are expressed in the VTA, and specifically on VTA cell 
bodies that project to the NAc. The exact mechanism of action is unclear, but similar to the 
dorsal striatum, estradiol seems to increase DA release in the NAc. Notably, animal data 
suggest that estradiol and progesterone have an inverted U shape effect on DA activity, such 
that higher doses inhibit DA activity (Yoest et al, 2018).

Animal data suggest that testosterone modulates reward sensitivity via interactions with the 
mesolimbic DA system (Wood, 2008), and male rats, which are exposed perinatally to 
increased levels of testosterone, begin to show a greater density of DA D1 receptors in the 
NAc relative to females during puberty (Andersen et al, 1997). In addition, testosterone may 
alter nigrostriatal responsivity to DA by binding to androgen receptors that alter gene 
expression of DA transporter and D2 and D3 receptors in the substantia nigra and striatum 
(Purves-Tyson et al, 2014). Pubertal changes in all gonadal hormones can have 
neurodevelopmental effects on the mesolimbic dopamine system (Yoest et al, 2018).

Preclinical models have specifically suggested a role for gonadal hormone alterations in 
food reward and eating behavior. Estrogens have repeatedly been shown to inhibit standard 
chow consumption in rodents (Drewett, 1973). On days of high estrogen signaling with 
natural cycle variation in female rats, operant responding for sucrose is lowest, and injection 
of beta-estradiol, both directly in the VTA and peripherally, reduces operant responding for 
sucrose with no effect on standard chow intake (Richard et al, 2017). However, female rats 
are more likely to show conditioned place preference for palatable food than male rats, via 
increased activation of mesolimbic reward circuity (Sinclair et al, 2017). In addition, female 
rats after puberty show increased preference for sweet tastes relative to male rats, and this 
effect is mediated by both early testosterone exposure and circulating estrogen (Wade, 1976; 
Wade and Zucker, 1969). These seemingly contradictory findings may be related to the 
inverted U relationship between estrogen and DA activity, such that when levels are at their 
highest, food reward behaviors are inhibited. Although data from mouse models of binge-

like eating suggest that estrogen’s action at their receptors stimulate serotonin neurons in the 
dorsal raphe nucleus, which suppresses binge-like eating of pure fat (Cao et al, 2014), 
additional research is needed to clarify how estrogen effects on DA may attenuate palatable 
food consumption.

Some data suggest that progesterone in combination with estrogen stimulates food intake, 
but has little to no effect on intake in the absence of estrogen (Asarian and Geary, 2006). 
Ovariectomy increases binge-like eating in female rats (Klump et al, 2011) and estradiol and 
progesterone replacement attenuates binge-like eating (Yu et al, 2008). In contrast, Yu et al 
(Yu et al, 2011) found that estrogen alone and estrogen plus progesterone decrease standard 
chow intake and binge-like fat consumption, except when the limited access schedule that 
potentiates these binge-like episodes is novel (Yu et al, 2011). This suggests that estrogen 
and progesterone may have no effect on the size of binge-like eating episodes in 
“experienced” rats.

Prepubertally, female rodents with neonatal exposure to either testosterone or to additional 
estradiol made more impulsive choices on a delay-based impulsive choice food task (Bayless 
et al, 2013). Similarly, higher prenatal testosterone in female rats is associated with 
increased size of eating episodes (Madrid et al, 1993; Wade, 1972), but the timing of effects 
on eating, and whether those effects apply to standard or palatable foods or are apparent in 
ad libitum- versus limited-access paradigms may be particularly important. For example, 
neonatal testosterone injections in female rats increases standard chow intake but decreases 
sucrose consumption only after pubertal onset (Asarian et al, 2006). In animal models of 
binge-like eating using limited access to palatable food paradigms, perinatal testosterone 
exposure reduces the risk for binge-like eating in female rats to the level of male risk after 
mid-puberty (Culbert et al, 2018). These results suggest that early testosterone exposure may 
be protective against the development of binge eating after puberty, perhaps via reduced 
reward value of binge-like consumption. Overall, data indicate that some combination of 
organizational effects from early hormone exposure and acute effects during puberty and 
after could contribute to the sexual dimorphism of multiple reward-based behaviors, and 
specifically eating and binge-like behaviors (Culbert et al, 2018; Parylak et al, 2008).

5.1.2  Human Neuroimaging and Biological Studies.—To date, only two human 
imaging studies have experimentally manipulated ovarian hormones to examine effects on 
reward circuitry in women. One found that administration of goserelin, which decreases 
estrogen and testosterone, reduces amygdala response to monetary rewards in young women 
(Macoveanu et al, 2016). The other, consistent with preclinical studies, found that 2 months 
of an estrogen-progesterone combination hormonal treatment in perimenopausal women 
increased activation in the ventral striatum and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex during 
monetary reward anticipation and receipt (Thomas et al, 2014). These results suggest that 
estrogen suppression may somewhat reduce reward responsivity, and prolonged exogenous 
replacement of estrogen and progesterone increases reward responsivity.

In other studies, menstrual cycle has served as a naturalistic proxy of hormonal variation. As 
in rodents, menstrual cycle phase in humans has a significant impact on neural response to 
reward, and this may be related to estradiol fluctuations (Dreher et al, 2007). Probabilistic

learning from rewards has been shown to be enhanced during the late follicular phase, when 
estrogen is high and progesterone is low (Diekhof and Ratnayake, 2016). Data from fMRI 
studies are somewhat mixed. BOLD response in reward-related areas of the brain to 
monetary reward anticipation and receipt as well as high-calorie food pictures is greater 
when levels of estrogen elevated and progesterone is low (the follicular phase) relative to 
when both estrogen and progesterone levels are high in the luteal phase (Dreher et al, 2007; 
Frank et al, 2010). However, overeating and emotional eating increase when both estrogen 
and progesterone levels are high compared with phases when estrogen is elevated and 
progesterone is low (Buffenstein et al, 1995; Edler et al, 2007; Klump et al, 2013). Together, 
these results suggest that decreased reward from food during the luteal phase potentiates 
continued eating. This could explain why another study found the greatest ventral striatal 
response to monetary reward anticipation when estrogen and progesterone are both 
decreasing after reaching a high during the premenstrual phase, perhaps potentiating a 
downregulation of DA activity that sensitizes the DA system (Ossewaarde et al, 2011).

Consistent with animal literature, fMRI data indicate that women acutely administered 
testosterone show elevated ventral striatal BOLD response to monetary reward anticipation, 
and this effect is most pronounced among individuals with low self-reported appetitive 
responses (Hermans et al, 2010). Similarly, elevated prenatal testosterone measured via 
amniotic fluid was found to be prospectively associated with increased behavioral approach 
tendencies, and this effect was mediated by increased caudate, putamen, and NAc activation 
in response to positively valenced cues (Lombardo et al, 2012). Prenatal testosterone may 
have organizational effects that impact reward sensitivity and behavior, biasing toward 
approach-related problems in children, and in adolescence and adulthood, acute rises in 
testosterone levels may have similar effects. Given that perinatal testosterone exposure was 
only protective against binge-like eating after puberty in animal models (Culbert et al, 2018), 
a combination of perinatal organizational effects and pubertal activational effects of 
testosterone may be required to attenuate binge eating risk.

5.2  Case-Control Comparisons: Altered Levels among Individuals with AN and BN 
Relative to Healthy Controls

Relative to controls, individuals with AN and BN exhibit reduced estrogen concentrations, 
but only those with AN exhibit reduced testosterone levels (Monteleone et al, 2001). Women 
with BN have been shown to have increased circulating testosterone levels relative to 
controls (Sundblad et al, 1994), and female children of women with a lifetime history of BN 
show markers of higher prenatal testosterone exposure (Kothari et al, 2014). These hormonal 
differences relative to controls may be sequelae of dramatic weight and fat tissue loss, but 
nonetheless have consequences for reward processes that maintain AN and BN pathology. 
Very little research has focused on altered gonadal hormones in males with eating disorders, 
but existing data from adolescent males with AN are consistent with findings in females and 
point to reduced testosterone and estradiol levels (Misra et al, 2008).

5.3  Associations with Eating Disorder Symptoms and Related Implications for Treatment

The inverted U relationship between estrogen and progesterone with DA activity observed in 
rodents may also hold true in humans (Diekhof, 2015) and could explain associations over

time between ovarian hormones and risk for binge eating and emotional eating. Among 
women with threshold BN—both the lute al phase, when estrogen and progesterone are the 
highest, and the premenstrual phase, when both estrogen and progesterone are at their 
lowest, are associated with increased binge eating in BN (Lester et al, 2003). This finding is 
consistent with data from a large community sample indicating an interactive effect between 
estradiol and progesterone such that when estrogen and progesterone are high, emotional 
eating risk is highest (Klump et al, 2013). Data from women with BN are also consistent 
with those from women with clinically significant binge eating suggesting the risk for binge 
eating is greatest when both progesterone and estrogen are low (Klump et al, 2014). Perhaps 
these hormone-specific increases in risk for binge eating are mediated by enhanced reward-
based learning about behaviors when DA release is particularly high or particularly low, 
making these behaviors more likely in the future. As this hypothesis is inconsistent with 
pilot research in threshold BN suggesting that increased binge eating episode frequency is 
associated with decreasing estradiol and increasing progesterone (Edler et al, 2007), further 
research is needed to more conclusively establish the potential causal link between changes 
in ovarian hormones and risk for binge eating. Elevated testosterone levels in adolescent and 
adult females with BN also may promote binge eating and purging. Chronically high 
testosterone, like repeated over-consumption of food, could potentiate D2 receptor 
downregulation and DA desensitization (Décarie-Spain et al, 2016), possibly explaining 
neuroimaging findings of an attenuated food reward response in women with BN (Frank et 
al, 2011). Moreover, initial data suggest that testosterone antagonism improves bulimic 
behavior (Bergman and Eriksson, 1996).

In AN, although reduced ovarian hormone levels would presumably promote motivated 
behavior to obtain food rewards, it has been hypothesized that these low levels instead 
increase anxiety and promote avoidance-related learning that perpetuates restriction in AN 
(Guarda et al, 2015). Estrogen replacement therapy in AN seems to attenuate anxiety but 
have no impact on BMI or consummatory behaviors (Misra et al, 2013), but research in 
larger samples is needed. Similarly, testosterone replacement therapy for women with AN 
has beneficial effects on bone formation, depressive symptoms, and spatial cognition (Miller 
et al, 2005). Healthy women acutely administered testosterone show elevated ventral striatal 
BOLD response to monetary reward anticipation, and this effect is most pronounced among 
individuals with low scores on a self-report measure of appetitive responses (Hermans et al, 
2010). Given that individuals with AN score lower than controls on this measure (Harrison 
et al, 2010), testosterone administration could address reward dysfunction in AN and change 
eating behavior. A current phase II clinical trial is investigating the impact of transdermal 
testosterone on body weight in individuals with AN (National Institute of Mental Health 
Massachusetts General Hospital).

6.  Orexins

Orexins (also termed hypocretins) are implicated in a broad array of regulatory functions 
within the central nervous system including feeding, autonomic control, sleep/wakefulness, 
memory, and reward (de lecea et al, 1998; Sakurai et al, 1998). Of the neuroendocrines 
reviewed thus far, orexins have been the least studied in eating disorders and using human 
neuroimaging. However, preclinical literature supports their potential relevance for reward

alterations in AN and BN. Orexins stimulate feeding behavior (indeed, orexin stems from 
the word “appetite” in Greek) and exist in two primary forms: orexin-A (a 33-amino acid 
peptide) and orexin-B (a 28-amino acid peptide). Both peptides are localized in the lateral 
hypothalamus, a region strongly associated with feeding behavior, and perifornical and 
dorsomedial hypothalamic nuclei (de lecea et al, 1998; Sakurai et al, 1998). The orexins 
were initially identified as endogenous ligands for two orphan G-protein-coupled receptors, 
orexin 1 (OX1-R) and orexin 2 (OX2-R). OX1-R have an affinity for orexin-A, while OX2-R 
have equal affinity for both orexin-A and -B (Sakurai et al., 1998). Orexin-A and OX1-R 
have been implicated more strongly in the regulation of feeding behavior than orexin-B and 
OX2-R (Arch, 2000; Dube et al, 1999; Haynes et al, 2002; Haynes et al, 2000). Thus, the 
present review will focus more strongly on orexin-A. Orexin-A can cross the blood brain 
barrier (Kastin and Akerstrom, 1999) and plasma levels of orexin-A in humans reflect the 
peptide released from both the brain and the gut (Arihara et al, 2001; Kirchgessner, 2002). 
Importantly, while orexins increase food intake, they also simultaneously increase energy 
expenditure, typically resulting in a net effect of decreased body weight (Teske and Mavanji, 
2012).

6.1 

Interactions with the Dopaminergic Reward System

Orexins interact with reward circuitry in several ways. Anatomical rat research indicates that 
hypothalamic orexin neurons project to reward-related brain regions, including the NAc and 
the dopaminergic VTA (Fadel and Deutch, 2002), and orexin neurons receive projections 
from the VTA, NAc, and lateral septum (Yoshida et al, 2006). Additionally, orexin receptors 
are expressed on the surface of VTA DA neurons (Marcus et al, 2001; Narita et al, 2006), 
and orexin administration increases the firing rate of VTA neurons (Korotkova et al, 2003). 
Further supporting the role for orexins in reward seeking, orexins have been implicated in 
addictive behaviors, drug-related mesolimbic dopaminergic activity (Harris et al, 2005a; 
Narita et al, 2006), and preferences for cues associated with drug rewards (Harris et al, 
2005b).

Orexin’s potential impact on human reward circuitry in healthy individuals or individuals 
with eating disorders has not been tested using neuroimaging. However, animal research has 
demonstrated a clear role for orexin in stimulating feeding behavior and reward-related 
activity. Orexin injections induce feeding behavior in rats and mice (Haynes et al, 2002; 
Haynes et al, 2000; Sakurai et al, 1998) and central administration of orexins in non-fasted 
rats stimulates food intake in a dose-dependent fashion (Sakurai et al, 1998). Supporting that 
orexin neurons are associated with consummatory reward, activation of lateral hypothalamus 
orexin neurons in rodents is strongly linked to preferences for cues associated with food 
rewards during a conditioned place preference test, and the amount of c-Fos expression, an 
indirect marker of activity, in these neurons is positively correlated with the intensity of food 
reward-seeking (Harris et al, 2005a). Anticipation of food specifically may activate orexin 
neurons to regulate reward-based feeding behavior. Consistent with this, rats trained to 
expect a palatable food show increased activation of orexin neurons when in a food-cued 
location (Choi et al, 2010). Orexin-A may play a role in food reward valuation, as injection 
of orexin-A significantly increases chow intake and break point response for sucrose pellets

in a progressive ratio task compared to vehicle-treated controls (Choi et al, 2010) and 
antagonizing OX1-R decreases responding for high fat pellets.

Terrill and colleagues (2016) found that VTA administration of orexin-A increased palatable 
food intake (energy-dense high fat chow) both in rats that consumed a chow pre-load and in 
rats given acute daily access to palatable food without a chow preload. Within the same 
study, administration of orexin-A in the VTA also increased consumption of a sucrose 
solution, whereas OX1-R antagonism in the VTA decreased sucrose intake. Interestingly, 
both for the high fat food and sucrose solution, VTA-administered orexin increased 
consumption only towards the end of the meal. The authors suggest that orexin activity in 
the VTA may increase palatable food intake by counteracting post-ingestive feedback that 
would otherwise decrease intake in a homeostatic fashion towards the end of a meal. This 
might implicate orexin in the sense of “loss of control,” or difficulty stopping eating once 
one has started, that defines binge episodes.

As noted above, although acute orexin administration stimulates food intake, chronic orexin 
overexpression increases energy expenditure and decreases consumption. Mice bred to 
overexpress orexin exhibit resistance to high-fat diet-induced obesity and insulin 
insensitivity (Funato et al, 2009). This resistance occurs by orexin overexpression also 
increasing energy expenditure, an effect that was mediated by OX2-R signaling (Funato et 
al, 2009). Additionally, orexin overexpression increased the anorectic effects of leptin, while 
orexin overexpression did not have any effect in obese leptin-deficient mice. This suggests 
that increased OX2-R signaling may reduce risk for diet-induced weight gain, in part by 
increasing the effect of leptin.

6.2  Case-Control Comparisons: Altered Levels among Individuals with AN and BN 
Relative to Healthy Controls

Limited research has examined plasma orexin-A levels in individuals with AN, and has 
yielded mixed findings. Bronsky and colleagues (2011) demonstrated that orexin-A levels 
were higher in adolescents with AN compared to healthy controls, while Sauchelli et al 
(2016) found no difference in plasma orexin-A levels in AN relative to controls. Plasma 
orexin-A levels do appear to decrease over the course of 3- to 6-months of treatment (Janas-
Kozik et al, 2011) and 8-weeks of refeeding (Bronsky et al, 2011). Thus, limited evidence 
suggests that orexin-A levels may be altered in AN, and normalize as patients recover, 
however additional research on this topic is needed before drawing definitive conclusions. 
Further, given the role of orexin in stimulating food intake, additional information on orexin 
levels in patients with BN is needed.

6.3  Associations with Eating Disorder Symptoms and Related Implications for Treatment

Given the role that the hypothalamus plays in feeding behavior and preclinical research 
demonstrating that orexin stimulates feeding and particularly hedonic eating, orexins have 
implications in eating disorder psychopathology and possibly treatment. The simultaneous 
role that orexin plays in increasing energy expenditure, resulting in an overall net decrease in 
body weight, also has implications for the complex metabolic reactions and increased energy 
expenditure observed in AN. Regarding potential implications for treatment, results from an

animal model of binge eating suggest that there may be a potential role for OX1-R 
antagonists in reducing binge eating episodes that are preceded by stress and dietary 
restriction (Piccoli et al, 2012). An OX1-R antagonists inhibited increases in binge eating-
like consumption of highly palatable foods when exposed to chronic stress and food 
restriction, while food intake was unaffected in control animals that were neither food 
restricted nor subjected to stress. However, a more recent study found that although 
hypothalamic orexin neurons were activated in response to high fat food, blockage of the 
OX1-R signaling was not successful in blocking hyperphagia in rats given intermittent 
access to a high fat diet (Valdivia et al, 2015). While the initial consumption of a high fat 
diet requires OX1-R signaling, the neuronal mechanisms that occur in the escalation of 
eating are independent of the orexin signaling. Alternatively, orexin may play a more 
nuanced role in escalation of eating behavior under certain conditions (stress, food 
restriction).

Conclusions and Future Directions

Taken together, data from preclinical and human research suggest that neuroendocrine 
signals that regulate both homeostatic and hedonic eating may serve as useful novel targets 
for the treatment of AN and BN. Although many neuroendocrine alterations in eating 
disorders are illness state-dependent to some degree, evidence suggests they may maintain 
eating disorder symptoms. Future, longitudinal research in larger samples is necessary to 
determine whether neuroendocrine alterations may impact the development of dopaminergic 
reward systems in humans and precipitate the development of AN and BN symptoms. Such 
studies will be particularly helpful in disentangling the effects of altered gonadal hormones 
on the risk for and maintenance of eating disorders, and potential sex differences in these 
effects. In addition, as most research has focused on AN and BN, additional research on 
neuroendocrine interactions with reward among individuals with binge eating disorder are 
needed. As more data become available, future meta-analyses will be helpful in evaluating 
the relative impact of neuroendocrines on eating disorder symptoms.

Further, additional research is needed to clarify the potentially interacting roles of 
neuroendocrine signals on altered reward circuitry in eating disorder populations. For 
example, ghrelin has been shown to interact with orexins and leptin to alter food intake 
(Perello and Dickson, 2015; Perello et al, 2010) and orexin-A may mediate the effects of 
leptin and insulin (Figlewicz and Benoit, 2009a). In addition, estrogen alters sensitivity to 
the anorexigenic effects of leptin and insulin (Clegg et al, 2006) and is thought to be a 
protective factor against insulin insensitivity (Hong et al, 2009). Research with 
adrenalectomized rodents has supported a role for corticosterone’s interactions with insulin 
function in overeating and obesity (Chavez et al, 1997; la Fleur et al, 2004). Given the 
complex interplay of these neuroendocrines, future neuroimaging studies of food reward in 
eating disorders should be carefully controlled. The preference for and nutritional 
composition of food stimuli presented, the method of presentation, how recently participants 
have eaten, and menstrual status, phase, and pubertal age of participants may all impact 
reward-related findings via neuroendocrine effects. As neuroendocrines affect distinct 
reward-related processes, future eating disorder imaging studies should measure valuation of 
food palatability, food reward consumption, other rewarding sensory aspects of eating

including smell, and effort exerted to obtain food (e.g., Bragulat et al, 2010; Fernández-
Aranda et al, 2016). Studying neuroendocrines in conjunction with fMRI (e.g., via 
pharmacological neuroimaging) could improve characterization of aspects of reward 
circuitry that play key roles in eating disorder pathophysiology. As current human imaging 
technologies cannot distinguish some small, reward-related regions with distinct 
neuroendocrine-mediated responses (e.g., the NAc shell and core), conducting 
pharmacological fMRI research in concert with parallel preclinical studies will be 
particularly valuable.
