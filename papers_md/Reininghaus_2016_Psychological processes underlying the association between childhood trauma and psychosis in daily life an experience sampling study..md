Background. Evidence has accumulated that implicates childhood trauma in the aetiology of psychosis, but our under-
standing of the putative psychological processes and mechanisms through which childhood trauma impacts on indivi-
duals and contributes to the development of psychosis remains limited. We aimed to investigate whether stress
sensitivity and threat anticipation underlie the association between childhood abuse and psychosis.

Method. We used the Experience Sampling Method to measure stress, threat anticipation, negative affect, and psychotic
experiences in 50 ﬁrst-episode psychosis (FEP) patients, 44 At-Risk Mental State (ARMS) participants, and 52 controls.
Childhood abuse was assessed using the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire.

Results. Associations of minor socio-environmental stress in daily life with negative affect and psychotic experiences
were modiﬁed by sexual abuse and group (all pFWE < 0.05). While there was strong evidence that these associations
were greater in FEP exposed to high levels of sexual abuse, and some evidence of greater associations in ARMS exposed
to high levels of sexual abuse, controls exposed to high levels of sexual abuse were more resilient and reported less in-
tense negative emotional reactions to socio-environmental stress. A similar pattern was evident for threat anticipation.

Conclusions. Elevated sensitivity and lack of resilience to socio-environmental stress and enhanced threat anticipation in daily
life may be important psychological processes underlying the association between childhood sexual abuse and psychosis.

Introduction

Over the past decade, evidence has accumulated that
implicates childhood trauma in the aetiology of psych-
osis. Childhood trauma refers to a range of early nega-
tive and potentially harmful experiences including
sexual, physical and emotional abuse (Morgan &
Fisher, 2007). Findings from a modest number of epi-
demiological studies suggest childhood trauma confers

risk of experiencing psychotic symptoms (Morgan &
Fisher, 2007; Varese et al. 2012). While most studies
to date have focused on the role of childhood sexual
abuse (Morgan & Fisher, 2007; Varese et al. 2012;
Matheson et al. 2013), and some authors have argued
that sexual and physical abuse are potent risk factors
(Read et al. 2005; Bentall et al. 2014), emotional abuse
has also been associated with an increased risk of
psychosis (Varese et al. 2012).

Although we know there is an association between
childhood abuse and psychosis, we know little about
the psychological processes and mechanisms involved.
Current models of psychosis suggest that exposure to
trauma in childhood makes individuals more sensitive
to subsequent adversity through enhanced stress sensi-
tivity and threat anticipation (Myin-Germeys et al.

2001; Morgan & Hutchinson, 2010; Morgan et al. 2010,
2014; Howes & Murray, 2014). This type of model is
supported by an experience sampling study in general
practice, which showed that individuals exposed to
childhood physical and sexual abuse reported more in-
tense negative emotional reactions to daily life stress
(Glaser et al. 2006). Similar results have been found in
responses to daily hassles in individuals with depres-
sion (Wichers et al. 2009) and enduring psychotic dis-
order (Lardinois et al. 2011).

social

stress)

Childhood trauma may increase sensitivity not only
to minor stressful events but also to more minor ad-
verse social contexts and experiences later in daily
life, including distinctive unpleasant social situations
(referred to here as ‘social stress’)
(Myin-Germeys
et al. 2001; Morgan et al. 2014), subjective experiences
of outsider status (as one speciﬁc, potentially relevant
form of
(Morgan & Fisher, 2007;
Morgan et al. 2010; Gevonden et al. 2015), and unpleas-
ant neighbourhoods (referred to here as ‘area-related
stress’)
(Jaffee et al. 2007; Kirkbride et al. 2014).
Further, exposure to adverse and threatening experi-
ences during childhood may lead individuals to antici-
pate more unpleasant events and threat from their
environment to create an enduring sense of threat an-
ticipation (Morgan et al. 2010; Bentall et al. 2014). The
Experience Sampling Method (ESM) provides a
context-sensitive approach to study whether childhood
trauma may amplify threat anticipation as well as
stress sensitivity and, thereby, contribute to the devel-
in daily life.
opment of psychotic
However, previous studies have not investigated this
in individuals with ﬁrst-episode psychosis (FEP) com-
pared to individuals with an At-Risk Mental State
(ARMS; also known as High-Risk or Ultra-High-Risk
states) for psychosis (Yung et al. 2005; Fusar-Poli et al.
2013a), and controls. This would allow us to minimize
bias due to the potential effects of illness chronicity and
further elucidate the impact of putative psychological
mechanisms across different stages in the development
of psychosis.

experiences

Using data from an experience sampling study of
FEP individuals, ARMS individuals, and controls
with no personal or family history of psychosis, we
aimed to investigate whether elevated stress sensitivity
and enhanced threat anticipation are important psy-
chological mechanisms underlying the association be-
tween childhood sexual, physical and emotional
abuse and psychosis. We previously demonstrated in
this sample that elevated stress sensitivity, character-
ized by intense emotional reactions to event-related
stress, social stress, area-related stress and experiences
of outsider status, as well as enhanced threat anticipa-
tion are important psychological processes in the de-
velopment of psychotic experiences in daily life

across different stages of subclinical, prodromal, and
FEP (Reininghaus et al. 2016c). In the current study,
we aimed to investigate whether associations of puta-
tive psychological mechanisms (event-related stress,
social stress, area-related stress, experiences of outsider
status, threat anticipation) with (i) negative affect and
(ii) psychotic experiences were modiﬁed by prior ex-
posure to childhood abuse (sexual, physical, and emo-
tional abuse) and group (FEP, ARMS, controls).
Speciﬁcally, we sought to test the following hypoth-
eses: (1) within each group, the magnitude of associa-
tions of each psychological mechanism with (i)
negative affect and (ii) psychotic experiences is greater
in individuals exposed to high levels of abuse v. those
the
exposed to low levels of abuse (or,
responses to stress and threat anticipation are more
pronounced in those exposed) [ﬁrst set of hypotheses
(H1)]; and (2) the difference in magnitude of associa-
tions of each putative psychological mechanism with
(i) negative affect and (ii) psychotic experiences (put
simply, the difference in responses to stress and threat
anticipation) between those exposed to high levels and
those exposed to low levels of abuse is greater in (a)
FEP than in controls, (b) ARMS than in controls, and
(c) FEP than in ARMS [second set of hypotheses (H2)].

Sample

We recruited a sample of FEP individuals, ARMS indi-
viduals, and controls with no personal or family history
of psychosis identiﬁed in the Childhood Adversity and
Psychosis (CAPsy) study and the London centre of the
European Network of National Networks studying
Gene-Environment Interactions in Schizophrenia (EU-
GEI, 2014). Individuals with FEP were recruited from
mental health services within deﬁned catchment areas
in South-East London, UK. ARMS individuals were

Sexual, physical and emotional abuse

ESM measures

i.e.

Sexual, physical and emotional abuse were measured
using an established self-report measure,
the
Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ; Bernstein &
Fink, 1998), which measures the severity continuously
with ﬁve items for each type of abuse before the age of
16. The CTQ asks participants to rate each item on a
5-point Likert scale (1 = never true, 5 = very often
true) and allows computation of mean scores for each
type of abuse ranging from 1 to 5 as well as categorical
severity scores. Good psychometric properties have

Data on stress, threat anticipation, negative affect, and
psychotic experiences were collected with ESM assess-

were given an electronic momentary assessment tech-
nology device (the PsyMate®, www.psymate.eu/)
(Myin-Germeys et al. 2011). A detailed description of
the ESM procedure and measures (Myin-Germeys
et al. 2001, 2005; Delespaul et al. 2002; Corcoran et al.
2006; Bentall et al. 2008, 2009; Freeman et al. 2013) is

Statistical analysis

ESM data have a multilevel structure, such that mul-
tiple observations are nested within participants. In
two-level, linear mixed models, multiple observations
(level 1) were treated as nested within participants
(level 2) using the ‘xtmixed’ command in Stata v. 13
(StataCorp., 2013). We ﬁtted models with each putative
psychological mechanism (event-related stress, social
stress, area-related stress, experiences of outsider status,
threat anticipation) as the continuous independent vari-
able and (i) negative affect and (ii) psychotic experiences
as the outcome variable, while controlling for potential
confounders (i.e. age, gender, ethnicity, level of educa-
tion, employment status). We added two-way (mechan-
ism × abuse, mechanism × group, abuse × group) and
three-way (mechanism × abuse × group) interactions to
test whether
associations between psychological
mechanisms and (i) negative affect and (ii) psychotic
experiences were modiﬁed by prior exposure to child-
hood abuse (continuous CTQ sexual, physical, and
emotional abuse mean scores) and group (FEP, ARMS,
controls). Likelihood ratio tests were used to evaluate
improvement in model ﬁt as well as the ‘lincom’ com-
mand to compute linear combinations of coefﬁcients
for testing the hypotheses that: (1) within each group,
the magnitude of associations of each mechanism with
(i) negative affect and (ii) psychotic experiences was
greater in individuals exposed to high v. low levels of
childhood abuse (mean ± 1 S.D. of continuous CTQ
scores) (Aiken & West, 1991; Cohen et al. 2003) (H1);
and (2) the difference in magnitude of associations of
each mechanism with (i) negative affect and (ii) psych-
otic experiences in those exposed to high v. low levels
of abuse was greater in (a) FEP than in controls, (b)
ARMS than in controls, and (c) FEP than in ARMS
(H2). We standardized continuous ESM and CTQ vari-
for interpreting signiﬁcant
ables (mean = 0,
three-way interaction terms (Dawson & Richter, 2006)
and adjusted signiﬁcance levels of

values (pFWE) computed by multiplying the unadjusted
p value by the total number of tests.

level

During the study period, a total of 146 participants (50
FEP individuals, 44 ARMS individuals, and 52 con-
trols) completed the CTQ and ESM assessment (with
520 valid responses). ARMS and FEP individuals
were younger, more often unemployed and educated
to school
than controls (see Supplementary
Table S1). FEP individuals reported on average higher
levels of sexual [B = 0.32, 95% conﬁdence interval (CI)
0.003–0.64, p = 0.048], physical (B = 0.34, 95% CI 0.05–
0.63, p = 0.022), and emotional (B = 0.53, 95% CI 0.17–
0.88, p = 0.004) abuse than controls. Levels of sexual
abuse were similar in ARMS individuals and controls
(B = 0.14, 95% CI −0.20 to 0.47, p = 0.422). However,
physical (B = 0.45, 95% CI 0.15–0.75, p = 0.004) and
emotional (B = 1.06, 95% CI 0.70–1.43, p < 0.001) abuse
levels were markedly elevated in ARMS individuals.
While there was no evidence of marked differences
in sexual (B = 0.19, 95% CI −0.15 to 0.47, p = 0.268)
and physical (B = −0.11, 95% CI −0.41 to 0.19, p =
0.476) abuse across FEP and ARMS individuals, FEP
individuals reported markedly lower levels of emo-
tional abuse (B = −0.54, 95% CI −0.90 to −0.17, p =
0.004) than ARMS individuals. In the ARMS group,
17 individuals had a SCID diagnosis of anxiety (n =
12), mood (n = 2), or mood and anxiety (n = 3) disorder.

Psychological mechanisms underlying sexual abuse
in FEP, ARMS, and controls

abuse × group,

As can be seen in Table 3, we found no evidence that
the association between event-related stress and (i)
negative affect and (ii) psychotic experiences was mod-
iﬁed by prior exposure to childhood sexual abuse in
FEP, ARMS, and controls. However, there was strong
evidence for interaction effects (all pFWE < 0.05) of social
stress × sexual
area-related stress ×
sexual abuse × group, outsider status × sexual abuse ×
group, and threat anticipation × sexual abuse × group
on (i) negative affect and (ii) psychotic experiences.
These indicated that the magnitude of associations of
each psychological mechanism with (i) negative affect
and (ii) psychotic experiences differed between high
and low levels of abuse within (H1) and across (H2)
groups as detailed in the following.

There was a greater association in FEP individuals

Event-related and social stress was operationalized as minor disturbances and distinctive unpleasant events
and social situations that occur in the natural ﬂow of daily life [based on previous ESM studies, in which
good internal consistency and concurrent validity with other stress measures have been reported
(Myin-Germeys et al. 2001; Palmier-Claus et al. 2011)]
Event-related stress was measured with one item asking participants to rate the most important event since
the last beep on a 7-point Likert scale ranging from ‘very unpleasant’ (rating of −3) to ‘very pleasant’
(rating of 3) (Myin-Germeys et al. 2001). We reversed the coding of this item in order for higher ratings to
indicate higher levels of stress (with ratings of −3 (i.e. ‘very unpleasant’) coded as 7 and ratings of 3 (i.e.
‘very pleasant’) coded as 1) (Myin-Germeys et al. 2001)
The ESM social stress measure we used consisted of two items to assess moments where an individual’s
current social environment induces minor stress in the natural ﬂow of daily life [based on previous ESM
studies (Myin-Germeys et al. 2001)]. Participants were ﬁrst asked to indicate on a categorical item ‘Who am
I with?’ (partner, family, friends, colleagues, acquaintances, strangers, others, nobody) and then asked to
rate their current social context on a 7-point Likert scale ranging from ‘not at all’ (rating of 1) to ‘very much’
(rating of 7)) using the following two items: (1) ‘I would prefer to be alone [if with someone]/I would prefer
to have company [if alone]’; (2) ‘I ﬁnd being with these people pleasant [if with someone]/it is pleasant to
be alone [if alone]’. The coding of item 2 was reversed and the mean score of these two items computed as a
measure of minor social stress in daily life (Cronbach’s α = 0.62) (Myin-Germeys et al. 2001)
Area-related stress was assessed by asking participants to rate one item ‘I ﬁnd being in this neighbourhood
unpleasant’ on a 7-point Likert scale
Based on previous research that suggests exposure to social adversity may sensitize individuals to subjective
experiences of outsider status as one potentially relevant form of social stress (Morgan & Fisher, 2007;
Morgan et al. 2010; Gevonden et al. 2015), following ratings of current social context, participants were
asked to rate one item (‘I feel I am an outsider’) on a 7-point Likert scale to assess experiences of outsider
status. The association of this item with the ESM social (r = 0.33, p < 0.001) and area-related (r = 0.35, p <
0.001) stress measures indicated the item taps a distinct but related aspect of social stress and, overall,
reasonable concurrent validity
We used a 5-item ESM measure for assessing negative affect. This measure asks participants to rate the
following items at each entry point on a 7-point Likert scale: ‘I feel anxious’, ‘I feel down’, ‘I feel lonely’, ‘I
feel insecure’, and ‘I feel annoyed’ (Cronbach’s α = 0.86) (Myin-Germeys et al. 2001)

Threat anticipation Our ESM measure of threat anticipation was based on a self-report format used for assessing this

Psychotic

experiences

mechanism in previous cross-sectional studies asking participants to rate the likelihood of negative events
happening to them in the future (Corcoran et al. 2006; Bentall et al. 2008, 2009; Freeman et al. 2013). At each
entry point, participants were asked to think of what might happen in the next few hours and to rate the
item ‘I think that something unpleasant will happen’ on a 7-point Likert scale (1, ‘not at all’; 7 ‘very much’).
We found good concurrent validity of the ESM threat anticipation item with anxious mood (r = 0.49, p <
0.001), which has been previously reported to be closely linked to threat anticipation (Freeman et al. 2013).
The ESM psychosis measure was used to assess intensity of psychotic experiences. It consists of eight items
(i.e. ‘I feel paranoid’, ‘I feel unreal’, ‘I hear things that aren’t really there’, ‘I see things that aren’t really
there’, ‘I can’t get these thoughts out of my head’, ‘My thoughts are inﬂuenced by others’, ‘It’s hard to
express my thoughts in words’, ‘I feel like I am losing control’) rated on a 7-point Likert scale (Cronbach’s
α = 0.90) (Myin-Germeys et al. 2005; Palmier-Claus et al. 2011). We observed good concurrent validity of
ESM measures of negative affect and psychotic experiences (r = 0.68, p < 0.001)

a ESM procedure: On each day over an assessment period of six consecutive days, the PsyMate® emitted ten ‘beep’ signals
at random moments within set blocks of time. During an initial brieﬁng session, participants were asked to stop their activity
and answer questions about thoughts, feelings, behaviours, social situations, and neighbourhood surroundings each time the
device emitted the beep signal. The ESM questionnaire was available to participants for the duration of 10 min after emission
of the beep signal. Participants were contacted at least once during the assessment period to assess their adherence to
instructions, identify any potential distress associated with the method, and maximize the number of observations per
participant. At the end of the assessment period, participants’ reactivity to, and compliance with, the method was examined
in a debrieﬁng session. Participants were required to provide valid responses to at least one-third of the emitted beeps to be
included in the analysis (Delespaul et al. 2002).

v.
tense psychotic experiences in ARMS exposed to high
levels of sexual abuse than ARMS exposed to low

the associations of other putative psychological
mechanisms with (i) negative affect and (ii) psychotic
experiences were greater in ARMS exposed to high v.
low levels of
sexual abuse (see Supplementary
Fig. S1a–g, explanatory notes).

In contrast to FEP (and, in part, ARMS) individuals, in
controls exposed to high levels of sexual abuse, social
stress (adj. β
low = −0.14, p = 0.013), area-related
stress (adj. β
high v. low = −0.17, p = 0.019) and experiences
of outsider status (adj. β
high v. low = −0.29, p = 0.037) were
associated with less intense negative affect, as well as
enhanced threat anticipation with less intense psychotic
experiences (adj. β
high v. low = −0.11, p = 0.047), than in
controls exposed to low levels of sexual abuse (see
Supplementary Fig. S1a–g, explanatory notes).

Group comparison (H2)

When we examined differences in the magnitude of
associations of putative psychological mechanisms
with (i) negative affect and (ii) psychotic experiences
between those exposed to high v. low levels of sexual
abuse across groups, we consistently observed marked
differences across FEP and controls and, less consistent
and marked, ARMS and controls (see Table 3, note c;
Supplementary Fig. S1, explanatory notes). So for ex-
ample, there was evidence that the difference in emo-
stress between those
tional
exposed to high v. low levels of sexual abuse signiﬁ-
cantly varied across FEP v. controls (adj. βΔhigh v. low
= 0.25, p < 0.0005) and ARMS v. controls (adj. βΔhigh v.
low = 0.16, p = 0.028); also, the difference in associations
of social stress and psychotic experiences between
those exposed to high v. low levels of sexual abuse
across groups was greatest in FEP v. controls (adj.

βΔhigh v.
low = 0.18, p < 0.0005), followed by ARMS v.
controls (adj. βΔhigh v.
low = 0.11, p = 0.032). When we
further compared FEP and ARMS, differences in asso-
ciations of area-related stress, outsider status and (i)
negative affect and (ii) psychotic experiences between
those exposed to high v. low levels of sexual abuse
were greater in FEP than in ARMS.

Psychological mechanisms underlying physical abuse
in FEP, ARMS, and controls

We found no interaction effects of event-related stress ×
physical abuse × group, social stress × physical abuse ×
group, area-related stress × physical abuse × group, and
outsider status × physical abuse × group on (i) negative
affect and (ii) psychotic experiences (see Table 4).
However, an interaction effect of threat anticipation ×
physical abuse × group on psychotic experiences (see
Supplementary Fig. S2) indicated that enhanced threat
anticipation was associated with more intense psychot-
ic experiences in ARMS individuals exposed to high v.
low levels of physical abuse (adj. β
high v. low = 0.22, p <
0.001). In FEP (adj. β
high v. low = 0.04, p = 0.286) and con-
trols (adj. β
high v. low = −0.03, p = 0.716), this association
was similar in those with high v. low levels of physical
abuse.

Psychological mechanisms underlying emotional
abuse in FEP, ARMS, and controls

There was no evidence that associations between
event-related stress, social stress, area-related stress, out-
sider status and (i) negative affect and (ii) psychotic
experiences were modiﬁed by childhood emotional
abuse in FEP, ARMS, and controls (see Table 5).
However, we found an interaction effect of threat antici-
pation × emotional abuse × group (see Supplementary
Fig. S3). This indicated that enhanced threat anticipation
was associated with more psychotic experiences in
ARMS individuals exposed to high v. low levels of emo-
tional abuse (adj. β
high v. low = 0.20, p < 0.001), but neither
in FEP individuals (adj. β
high v. low = −0.03, p = 0.392) nor
controls (adj. β
high v. low = 0.02, p = 0.709) with high and
low levels of emotional abuse.

Discussion

Principal ﬁndings

Using an experience sampling design, this study found
strong and consistent evidence that various forms of
minor interpersonal and environmental stress in daily
life (i.e. social stress, outsider status, area-related stress)
were associated with both elevated negative affect and
more intense psychotic experiences in FEP individuals
exposed to high v.
low levels of childhood sexual

abuse. The association between threat anticipation and
psychotic experiences was also greater in FEP indivi-
duals exposed to high v. low levels of sexual abuse.
Our ﬁndings further suggest that, controls exposed to
high levels of sexual abuse were, by contrast, more re-
silient, with minor socio-environmental stressors being
associated with less
intense negative affect and
enhanced threat anticipation with less intense psychot-
ic experiences than in controls exposed to low levels of
sexual abuse. ARMS individuals formed an intermedi-
ate group, with only some evidence of more intense
psychotic experiences associated with experiences of
outsider status and enhanced threat anticipation in
those exposed. A less clear-cut pattern emerged from
ﬁndings on putative psychological mechanisms under-
lying physical and emotional abuse. ARMS indivi-
duals, but not FEP individuals and controls, exposed
to physical and emotional abuse reported more intense
psychotic experiences in relation to enhanced threat
anticipation.

Comparison with previous research

In recent years, it has been repeatedly proposed that
exposure to trauma and abuse early in life may impact
on the development of psychosis by increasing vulner-
ability to the negative effects of subsequent adversity
via elevated stress sensitivity and enhanced threat an-
ticipation as important psychological mechanisms on a
socio-developmental pathway to psychosis (Morgan &
Hutchinson, 2010; Morgan et al. 2010, 2014). However,
evidence in support of this proposition remained lim-
ited. We observed a consistent pattern of ﬁndings in
FEP individuals that suggests exposure to sexual
abuse may sensitize individuals to the negative effects
of more minor adverse social contexts and experiences
later in daily life, indexed by elevated sensitivity to so-
cial stress, area-related stress, and experiences of out-
sider status, as a potential psychological process
associated with the development of psychotic experi-
ences. Exposure to adverse social experiences such as
childhood sexual abuse, which have recently been
linked to increased striatal dopamine
synthesis
(Egerton et al. 2014) and involve the quality of interper-
sonal violence and threat, have been posited as having
a particular relevance for, and speciﬁcity to, psychotic
disorders (Harris, 1987; Bebbington et al. 2004; Morgan
& Hutchinson, 2010). Notably, exposure to childhood
sexual abuse speciﬁcally increased sensitivity to inter-
personal stress in daily life (i.e. unpleasant social situa-
tions,
status) but not
event-related stress or daily hassles in our case sample.
A similar pattern was evident in ARMS individuals,
who reported more intense psychotic experiences in re-
sponse to experiences of outsider status following

experiences of outsider

exposure to high levels of sexual abuse. We may there-
fore speculate that one speciﬁc pathway for the impact
of childhood sexual abuse on psychosis may be via
heightened interpersonal sensitivity by creating an en-
during sense of feeling vulnerable in the presence of
others (Bell & Freeman, 2014), which has been previ-
ously reported to be a relevant psychological mechan-
ism in individuals with a psychotic disorder and
ARMS (Bell & Freeman, 2014). What is more, our
ﬁndings extended beyond interpersonal sensitivity
and also involved sensitivity to wider adverse socio-
environmental contexts in daily life (i.e. unpleasant
neighbourhoods) and, as has been previously pro-
posed, an enduring sense of anticipating further un-
(Corcoran et al. 2006;
pleasant events and threat
Bentall et al. 2009, 2014; Morgan et al. 2010; Freeman
et al. 2013).

in fact, more resilient

In contrast to our ﬁrst hypothesis (of greater associa-
tions in those exposed within each group), we observed
that social stress, area-related stress and experiences of
outsider status were associated with less intense nega-
tive affect, as well as enhanced threat anticipation with
a lower intensity of psychotic experiences in controls
exposed to high levels of sexual abuse. Also, the differ-
ence in these associations between those exposed to
high and low levels of abuse were not, as predicted,
greater in FEP individuals than controls, as, by con-
trast, associations were reversed in controls. This is a
striking ﬁnding, which strongly points toward controls
with prior exposure to sexual abuse being less sensitive
to socio-environmental
and,
stress in daily life. It links in with consistent evidence
that a considerable proportion of individuals exposed
to sexual abuse in childhood subsequently show resili-
ence to psychopathology and positive psychosocial
functioning in adolescence and adulthood (Collishaw
et al. 2007; Jaffee et al. 2007; Rutter, 2007). Good quality
interpersonal
relationships have previously been
found to be associated with resilience to the develop-
ment of adult psychopathology in individuals exposed
to severe sexual or physical abuse in childhood
(Collishaw et al. 2007). Further, a recent systematic re-
view by Gayer-Anderson & Morgan (2013) reported
in controls
increased social networks and support
than individuals with psychotic
experiences or
ﬁrst-episode psychosis. Although tentative, one possi-
bility therefore is that (better) access to, and good qual-
ity of, social networks and support may have enhanced
interpersonal resilience to adverse social experiences
(i.e. unpleasant social situations, experiences of out-
sider status) in daily life and, thereby, averted expos-
ure to sexual abuse from exerting its detrimental
effects in controls. Along similar lines, growing up in a
positive home environment and low-crime, high-social
cohesion neighbourhoods have been previously found

2810 U. Reininghaus et al.

to be associated with resilience in children exposed to
childhood trauma (Jaffee et al. 2007; Rutter, 2007). There
is also some evidence that resilience is associated with
more rapid recovery from anticipation of
threat
(Tugade & Fredrickson, 2004; Waugh et al. 2008).
Genetic moderation of resilience to the environment
may potentially explain further why controls responded
differently to sexual abuse than FEP individuals
(Rutter, 2007). While speculative, resilience to adverse
socio-environmental contexts (i.e. area-related stress)
and anticipation of threat, in interaction with (lower)
polygenic risk, may in part account for our ﬁndings in
controls exposed to high levels of sexual abuse. Viewed
this way, ARMS individuals may, then, form an inter-
mediate group of resilient and non-resilient individuals,
for whom we found only some, limited evidence of ele-
vated sensitivity to socio-environmental stress (i.e.
experiences of outsider status) in those exposed to child-
hood sexual abuse at a group level. Given, further, a con-
siderable proportion of ARMS individuals experience
comorbid anxiety (Fusar-Poli et al. 2013b), possibly as a re-
sult of higher levels of emotional abuse (as observed in
our sample), and anxiety is commonly considered to
drive increased threat anticipation (Freeman et al. 2013),
a speciﬁc affective pathway from emotional abuse via ele-
vated anxiety and increased threat anticipation may crys-
tallize in this group.

Methodological considerations

These ﬁndings should be viewed in the light of several
potential methodological
issues. First, we used the
CTQ, a retrospective, self-report measure of childhood
sexual, physical and emotional abuse. One common
concern about retrospective measures of childhood
trauma is that they may be susceptible to recall bias
and affected by cognitive impairments or positive
symptoms associated with psychotic disorder (Fisher
et al. 2011; Susser & Widom, 2012). ESM ratings of pu-
tative psychological mechanisms and psychotic experi-
ences were also based on subjective self-report.
However, good reliability and validity has recently
been reported for retrospective self-reports of early
experiences obtained from individuals with a psychot-
ic disorder (Fisher et al. 2011). Similarly, the ESM has
been found to be a reliable and valid assessment
method in individuals with ARMS and psychotic dis-
order in previous studies (Myin-Germeys et al. 2001,
2005, 2009; Palmier-Claus et al. 2012). This allowed us
to assess psychological mechanisms and psychotic
experiences in the real world and in real time. In add-
ition, we adopted a recently suggested approach to re-
ducing recall bias by measuring childhood trauma
before the outcome of interest (i.e. psychotic disorder)
in the ARMS sample (Susser & Widom, 2012) and

for

criteria

moved beyond previous experience sampling research
in restricting our sample of patients to those with a ﬁrst
episode of psychosis. Although not drug-naïve, this
sample allowed us to minimize the impact of illness
chronicity and other consequences of psychotic dis-
order, which may have affected ﬁndings from previous
studies in patients with enduring psychosis (Lardinois
et al. 2011). Coupled with our ARMS sample without
any prior treatment with an antipsychotic for a psych-
otic episode, this provided evidence on childhood
trauma and putative causal mechanisms prior to (i.e.
during the prodromal period in (some of) the ARMS
individuals) and at ﬁrst onset of psychotic disorder.
Second, ESM data collection is time intense and may
be associated with assessment burden for participants.
Therefore, we cannot rule out that selection bias may
have occurred as a result of this. Third, cross-sectional
modelling of experience sampling data did not allow
us to systematically examine temporal priority of puta-
tive psychological mechanisms over psychotic experi-
ences or other
establishing causal
relations. We therefore cannot rule out that the differ-
ences across groups may be explained by the different
stages of early psychosis. Fourth, while the prevalence
of sexual abuse was similar to what has been previous-
ly reported (Fisher et al. 2009; Pereda et al. 2009;
Thompson et al. 2014), the number of participants
reporting moderate or severe abuse was, in absolute
terms,
(see Supplementary
Table S1). This did not allow for probing ﬁndings
further, for example, with regard to potential gender
differences that may have operated on putative
psychological mechanisms given the prevalence and
impact of childhood trauma on later psychopathology
has been previously found to differ between men and
women (e.g. Fisher et al. 2009; Pereda et al. 2009). Last,
the number of tests for assessing three-way interactions
that we conducted for each type of abuse and psycho-
logical mechanism may have inﬂated Type I error.
However, we adjusted signiﬁcance levels of
these
tests and only considered pFWE for assessing evidence
of three-way interactions. In addition, for statistically
signiﬁcant three-way interactions, effect sizes for the
difference in associations between individuals exposed
to high and low levels of abuse within and across
groups were overall of small to moderate magnitude
(in particular, within FEP and when comparing FEP
and controls), which reﬂects a substantial, cumulative
impact of abuse on putative psychological mechanisms
in daily life.

Conclusions

Our ﬁndings suggest that enhanced threat anticipation
and elevated sensitivity to socio-environmental stress

Psychological processes, childhood trauma, and psychosis 2811

in daily life are important psychological processes
underlying the association between childhood sexual
abuse and psychosis. Some initial evidence of speciﬁ-
city emerged for the impact of socio-environmental
exposures involving the quality of interpersonal threat
such as childhood sexual abuse via pathways through
heightened interpersonal sensitivity in daily life. At the
same time, ﬁndings in our control sample tentatively
suggest interpersonal resilience and, more broadly, re-
silience to adverse social contexts may potentially take
on the role of protective factors associated with the de-
velopment of psychotic experiences. More generally,
this supports the proposition that speciﬁc risk and pro-
tective factors of psychosis emerge over time, with dis-
effects by increasing
tal
vulnerability or resilience to the effects of more prox-
imal exposures via speciﬁc psychological mechanisms.
