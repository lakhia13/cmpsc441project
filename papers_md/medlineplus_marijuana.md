### What is medical marijuana?

The marijuana plant has chemicals that can help with some health problems. More states are making it legal to use the plant as medicine for certain medical conditions. But there isn't enough research to show that the whole plant works to treat or cure these conditions. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved the marijuana plant as a medicine. Marijuana is still illegal at the national level.

However, there have been scientific studies of cannabinoids, the chemicals in marijuana. The two main cannabinoids that are of medical interest are THC and CBD. The FDA has approved two drugs that contain THC. These drugs treat nausea caused bychemotherapyand increase appetite in patients who have severe weight loss fromAIDS. There is also a liquid drug that contains CBD. It treats two forms of severe childhoodepilepsy. Scientists are doing more research with marijuana and its ingredients to treat many diseases and conditions.
