Abstract 
Background:  Eating disorders have serious psychological and physical consequences. Current evidence-based 
treatments for adolescents with eating disorders have modest effects, underscoring the need to improve current 
treatment approaches. Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) and dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) have been proposed 
as alternative treatment options, with burgeoning research in this area. This review aims to summarize and critically 
analyze the current literature on the feasibility, acceptability, effectiveness, and efficacy of CBT and DBT for adolescent 
eating disorders, and then proposes areas of future research.

Methods:  PsycINFO and PubMed were searched using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and 
Meta-Analyses guidelines to identify studies examining the feasibility, acceptability, effectiveness and/or efficacy of 
CBT or DBT for adolescent eating disorders.

Results:  Eligible studies (N 
acceptable, and possibly effective for adolescent eating disorders across diagnoses and levels of care, though efficacy 
trials are lacking.

Conclusions:  CBT and DBT demonstrate promise as alternatives to family-based approaches for adolescent eating 
disorders. Adequately powered trials to establish the effectiveness and efficacy of CBT and DBT are needed, particu-
larly ones that compare these treatments against other leading approaches.

Plain English summary:  Despite high rates of relapse and likelihood for severe and enduring illness, there is a dearth 
of evidence-based treatment options for adolescents with eating disorders. Potentially viable but less well-studied 
treatments for adolescents with eating disorders include cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) and dialectical behavior 
therapy (DBT). This systematic review of CBT and DBT for adolescent eating disorders focuses on feasibility (i.e., how 
easy it was to implement the treatment), acceptability (i.e., how well the intervention was received by patients and 
therapists), effectiveness (i.e., how well the intervention performed under routine, real-world circumstances), and 
efficacy (i.e., how well the intervention performed in highly-controlled research settings). This review concludes 
that research supports the feasibility and acceptability of these approaches, as well as preliminary evidence of their 
effectiveness. However, the field is lacking studies that systematically compare CBT and DBT to other evidence-based 
approaches. Recommendations to advance research on CBT and DBT for adolescent eating disorders are provided, 
including a call for efficacy studies that clarify their performance compared to other leading approaches.

Background
Eating  disorders  are  associated  with  high  rates  of  co-
occurring  psychiatric  disorders  [1,  2]  and  serious  medi-
cal  risks  including  death  [3,  4].  In  adolescents,  some  of 
the  medical  complications  resulting  from  malnutrition 
(e.g.,  osteoporosis,  growth  arrest)  may  be  irreversible  if 
weight restoration is not attained [5]. Existing evidence-
based treatments for youth with eating disorders produce 
modest  effects  at  best.  Indeed,  over  half  of  adolescents 
who  receive  the  treatment  most  supported  by  research 
evidence—family-based  treatment  (FBT)  for  anorexia 
nervosa  (AN)  [6]—are  still  not  recovered  one  year  after 
completing treatment [7, 8]. Furthermore, FBT is not fea-
sible or clinically indicated for all youth (e.g., caregiver(s) 
unavailable  or  not  willing  to  participate,  prior  and/or 
current  abuse  in  the  home,  co-occurring  suicidality  and 
emotion  dysregulation  that  is  better  managed  within  a 
dialectical  behavior  therapy  [DBT]  framework).  There-
fore,  increasing  the  availability  of  other  treatments  and 
improving treatment outcomes overall is critical.

Cognitive  behavior  therapy  (CBT)  and  DBT—a  third-
wave  CBT—have  been  proposed  as  alternative  treat-
ments that may be appropriate when FBT is not feasible. 
CBT  is  widely  considered  the  first-line  of  treatment  for 
adults  with  bulimia  nervosa  (BN)  and  binge  eating  dis-
order  (BED)  [9],  and  has  been  “enhanced”  to  target 
transdiagnostic  eating  disorders  in  adults  (CBT-E:  [10]) 
and  more  recently  adolescents  [11].  CBT  may  be  suit-
able for adolescents with eating disorders given its focus 
on  mechanisms  hypothesized  to  maintain  the  disorder 
(e.g.,  overvaluation  of  weight  and  shape;  [12]),  efficacy 
for  other  disorders  in  adolescents  (e.g.,  depression  and 
anxiety; [13, 14]), and developmental appropriateness for 
adolescents (e.g., collaborative style and techniques sup-
port motivation while respecting adolescents’ developing 
autonomy; [15]).

Meanwhile,  DBT  was  originally  developed  for  adults 
with borderline personality disorder [16]. It incorporates 
both  cognitive  behavioral  and  mindfulness-based  strat-
egies  in  order  to  increase  interpersonal  effectiveness, 
improve  emotion  regulation,  and  build  distress  toler-
ance. DBT has since been applied to adolescent popula-
tions  with  borderline  personality  disorder  features  [17, 
18]  and  adults  with  other  presenting  concerns  [19,  20], 
and  may  be  particularly  appropriate  for  adolescents 
whose  eating  disorder  psychopathology  is  perpetuated 
by mechanisms targeted in DBT, including emotion regu-
lation  (i.e.,  inhibited  emotion  expression,  more  typical 
in  AN;  emotion  intensity  and  dysregulation,  more  typi-
cal in BN and BED; [21]). Moreover, DBT’s framework is 
designed to focus on multiple target behaviors simultane-
ously,  which  is  often  crucial  for  adolescents  with  eating 
disorders with co-occurring disorders and related target 

symptoms (e.g., suicidal ideation, non-suicidal self-injury, 
substance  abuse). The  ability  to  focus  on  multiple  prob-
lem areas in an integrated and structured manner—con-
sistent  with  high  fidelity  to  the  treatment  model—is  a 
unique asset of DBT, in contrast to alternative, evidence-
based  frameworks  (e.g.,  CBT,  FBT)  that  require  almost 
exclusive  focus  on  the  eating  disorder,  particularly  early 
in treatment.

The  present  review  aims  to  add  to  the  literature  by 
providing  an  update  on  second-  and  third-wave  CBT 
approaches  for  adolescents  across  eating  disorder  diag-
noses,  inclusive  of  non-randomized  study  designs  (i.e., 
case  series,  case  studies,  and  naturalistic  study  designs). 
To  date,  there  has  only  been  one  systematic  review  that 
included  second-  and  third-wave  CBTs  for  adolescent 
eating  disorders,  which  focused  exclusively  on  rand-
omized  controlled  trials  for  adolescent  AN  or  BN  [22]. 
Data from non-randomized study designs provide impor-
tant  information  on  treatment  feasibility,  acceptability 
and effectiveness within real-world settings. In contrast, 
highly controlled research designs frequently fail to con-
sider factors that impact real-world implementation (e.g., 
patient characteristics such as co-occurring disorders, or 
clinician  characteristics  such  as  level  of  training),  creat-
ing  a  gap  between  research  and  clinical  conditions  that 
limit their practical value [23].

With the ultimate goal of supporting clinicians to make 
appropriate treatment real-world clinical decisions, stud-
ies  that  examine  treatments  in  usual  care  settings  are 
crucial.  Therefore,  this  review  includes  studies  investi-
gating  treatments  with  multiple  components  (e.g.,  FBT 
integrated  with  DBT  skills),  rather  than  including  only 
studies of “pure” CBT or DBT. Although multiple third-
wave CBTs have been proposed for eating disorders (e.g., 
acceptance and commitment therapy), we focus on DBT 
since it is the most widely studied to-date [24]. Given the 
diversity in diagnosis, treatment type, treatment setting, 
study  methodology,  and  outcome  measurement,  a  sys-
tematic  review  was  deemed  most  appropriate  to  sum-
marize  the  available  data,  rather  than  a  meta-analysis, 
which  would  have  yielded  an  effect  estimate  that  would 
have been difficult to interpret given the heterogeneity of 
the  data.  Overall,  this  review  summarizes  and  critically 
analyzes  the  literature  on  CBT  and  DBT  for  adolescent 
eating  disorders,  with  the  objective  of  clarifying  current 
knowledge  about  the  feasibility,  acceptability,  effective-
ness, and efficacy of these approaches, and providing rec-
ommendations for future research.

Methods
PsycINFO  (Ovid)  and  PubMed  were  searched  using  the 
Preferred  Reporting  Items  for  Systematic  Review  and 
Meta-Analyses  guidelines  [25].  The  following  search

algorithms  were  used,  inclusive  of  all  papers  published 
through  December  2020:  [(cognitive  behavior  therapy 
OR  CBT)  AND  (adolesc*)  AND  (eating  disorder)],  and 
[(dialectical  behavior  therapy  OR  DBT)  AND  (adolesc*) 
AND  (eating  disorder)].  The  first  author  screened  CBT 
titles and abstracts for relevance, and the second author 
screened  DBT  titles  and  articles  and  abstracts  for  rel-
evance.  Articles  deemed  relevant  based  on  title  and 
abstract were then reviewed. Each author replicated and 
verified the other author’s search, to control for bias. Dis-
crepancies  were  discussed  and  resolved  in  consultation 
with  the  senior  author.  Eligible  articles  (1)  assessed  the 
feasibility,  acceptability,  effectiveness  and/or  efficacy  of 
CBT,  DBT,  or  any  other  psychological  treatment  based 
at  least  in  part  on  CBT  or  DBT  (2)  in  adolescents  with 
eating disorders (3) and were published in peer-reviewed, 
academic  journals  (4)  in  the  English  language.  Studies 
that  assessed  interventions  in  a  partial  hospitalization 
setting (n = 2 CBT studies: one for AN and one for avoid-
ant/restrictive  food  intake  disorder,  n = 3  DBT  studies: 
one  for  restrictive  eating  disorders  and  two  for  transdi-
agnostic  eating  disorders)  were  excluded  because  there 
were  too  few  studies  by  treatment  type  and  diagnostic 
category  within  this  setting  type  to  draw  meaningful 
conclusions.

Variables extracted from studies included sample char-
acteristics (sample size, mean age, diagnoses); treatment 
attrition  rate;  treatment  characteristics  (treatment  type, 
setting,  length);  study  follow-up  time-points;  variables 
related to eating disorder psychopathology, behavior, and 
weight restoration; additional primary outcomes relevant 
to  the  effectiveness  or  efficacy  of  the  intervention;  and 
any outcome variables related to the feasibility or accept-
ability of the intervention. The study results are grouped 
by  intervention  type  (CBT,  DBT)  and  level  of  care  (e.g., 
outpatient,  inpatient)  (see  Tables  1,  2),  then  organized 
by eating disorder diagnosis in the results section below. 
Given the inclusion of non-randomized designs, our con-
clusions are based on a qualitative synthesis of the data.

Risk  of  bias  for  each  study  was  evaluated  using  study 
quality assessment tools recommended in a recent review 
[26],  published  by  the  National  Institute  of  Health  [27] 
and the Joanna Briggs Institute [28]. Cohort studies (i.e., 
longitudinal  studies  sampled  based  on  exposure  to  the 
intervention  rather  than  outcome;  [29])  with  no  con-
trol group were rated using the NIH Quality Assessment 
Tool  for  Before-After  (Pre-Post)  Studies  with  No  Control 
Group. Randomized controlled trials were rated using the 
NIH Quality Assessment of Controlled Intervention Stud-
ies.  The  NIH  Quality  Assessment  Tool  for  Observational 
Cohort  and  Cross-Sectional  Studies,  and  the  Joanna 
Briggs  Institute  Critical  Appraisal  Checklist  for  Case 
Reports were used for these respective study designs (see 

Tables 1, 2 for study design type for each paper). The first 
and second authors rated each study independently, and 
resolved discrepancies via discussion of individual check-
list items, and in consultation with the senior author. The 
NIH quality assessment tools evaluate the internal valid-
ity  of  studies  with  consideration  of  individual  checklist 
items  and  an  overall  rating  of  “good,”  “fair,”  or  “poor”;  a 
higher  rating  indicates  lower  risk  of  bias  based  on  the 
study design or execution, while a lower rating indicates 
higher  risk  of  bias.  The  Joanna  Briggs  Institute  Critical 
Appraisal  Checklist  for  Case  Reports  provides  an  overall 
rating of “include,” “exclude” or “seek further information” 
based  on  consideration  of  eight  survey  items.  Two  case 
reports  meeting  eligibility  criteria  received  an  “exclude” 
quality  appraisal  rating,  and  were  excluded  from  the 
review.  Overall  ratings  for  each  study  are  reported  in 
Tables 1 and 2.

Results
The  PsycINFO  search  yielded  209  results  for  CBT  stud-
ies  and  38  results  for  DBT  studies.  The  PubMed  search 
yielded  680  results  for  CBT  studies  and  48  results  for 
DBT studies. Fifty articles (CBT: n = 40, DBT: n = 10) met 
eligibility  criteria  and  were  included  in  this  review  (see 
Fig. 1). Tables 1 and 2 provide a complete list of the vari-
ables  extracted  and  a  summary  of  relevant  findings  for 
each study, including outcome measures.

CBT for adolescent eating disorders
Outpatient settings

Thirty  articles  examined  the  feasibility,  acceptability, 
effectiveness, and/or efficacy of outpatient CBT for ado-
lescents, representing 24 different studies (one study pro-
duced one secondary analysis article, one study produced 
two  secondary  analysis  articles,  and  another  produced 
three secondary analysis articles). Excluding articles that 
reported data from the same study (n = 6), these studies 
reported outcomes for adolescents with AN (n = 11), BN 
(n = 10), BED (n = 1), or transdiagnostic eating disorders 
(n = 4) using randomized controlled trial designs (n = 7), 
pre-post designs with no control group (i.e., cohort stud-
ies;  n = 11),  an  observational  cross-sectional  design 
(n = 1),  and  case  studies  (n = 5).  About  one-half  of  the 
original  studies  (n = 13,  54%)  reported  follow-up  data. 
The  majority  of  studies  (n = 19,  76%)  evaluated  individ-
ual  CBT,  a  subset  of  which  (n = 6,  32%)  evaluated  CBT-
E.  Four  studies  integrated  CBT  with  at  least  one  other 
treatment  type  (e.g.,  FBT,  parental  counseling,  and/or 
or dietary therapy), and two evaluated group CBT. Most 
studies  (n = 18,  72%)  reported  some  form  of  parental 
involvement, though this varied greatly from peripheral, 
“as-needed” involvement (e.g., recruiting parents to help 
with  meal  planning;  [30]),  to  formal  parent  sessions  at

ity of studies examined eating disorder psychopathology 
(n = 22) and/or behaviors (n = 15); less than half (n = 12) 
examined weight restoration.

AN outcomes

Results of randomized controlled trials and cohort stud-
ies  (n = 10)  supported  the  feasibility  and  acceptabil-
ity  of  outpatient  CBT  for  adolescent  AN.  Three  studies

evaluated manualized CBT-E, while other studies evalu-
ated  generic  forms  of  CBT  adapted  for  adolescent  AN, 
group CBT, or a CBT module integrated with FBT. Mean 
treatment  attrition  was  24%  (range:  [9–31],  n = 9),  and 
studies  demonstrated  higher  parent  satisfaction  with 
CBT than community-based usual care, [32] but no sig-
nificant difference in satisfaction between CBT and DBT 
[33], and no difference in cost between CBT, community-
based care, or hospitalization [34]. Effectiveness was par-
tially  supported.  Statistically  significant  improvements 
in weight and/or body mass index was observed (n = 4), 
though  the  proportion  of  participants  that  reached  nor-
mative  weight  (i.e.,  95%  expected  body  weight)  by  the 
end  of  treatment  varied  from  one  third  [35]  to  about 
one  half  [31,  36].  While  eating  disorder  psychopathol-
ogy also significantly improved in the majority of studies 
that  reported  this  outcome  (n = 5/7,  71.4%),  clinical  sig-
nificance was mixed. Normative levels of eating disorder 
psychopathology were achieved by the end of treatment 
for nearly all patients in one study [35], while all patients 
in  another  study  remained  symptomatic  at  the  end  of 
treatment [37]. Multiple studies (n = 4) did not report on 
clinical  significance  (i.e.,  effect  sizes  or  interpretation  of 
eating disorder psychopathology scores).

Finally, only two studies used a definition of remission 
that  set  a  high  bar  for  both  cognitive  (i.e.,  global  eating 
disorder psychopathology within community norms) and 
weight  status  (i.e.,  achieved  95%  expected  body  weight, 
or  body  mass  index  equivalent  to  an  adult  body  mass 
index ≥ 18.5  kg/m2)  outcome.  These  studies  suggested 
that  over  half  of  adolescents  who  completed  treatment 
achieved  full  remission  post-treatment,  in  CBT-E  [31] 
and an intervention that integrated a CBT module within 
FBT [36]. Randomized controlled trial data (n = 3) found 
that CBT was neither superior nor inferior to other active 
treatments  (i.e.,  behavioral  family  therapy,  DBT,  inpa-
tient,  or  community-based  care)  with  respect  to  eating 
disorder psychopathology or weight outcomes.

BN outcomes

Of  the  cohort  studies  and  randomized  controlled  trials 
that  investigated  CBT  for  adolescent  BN  (n = 6),  most 
(n = 5)  used  a  manualized  version  of  CBT  adapted  for 
adolescents from the Fairburn [38] manual for adult BN, 
while  one  study  [39]  used  a  manualized  version  of  CBT 
derived  from  CBT-E  [10],  but  adapted  to  the  treatment 
setting  [40].  Across  studies,  acceptability  was  supported 
by  relatively  low  attrition  (M = 14%,  range:  [0–39]),  and 
effectiveness was supported by clinically meaningful and 
statistically  significant  improvement  in  eating  disorder 
psychopathology.  By  the  end  of  treatment,  two  stud-
ies  reported  significant  reductions  in  binge  eating  and 
purging [39, 41], while one reported reductions in binge 

eating only [42]. Both cohort studies found that over half 
the sample was abstinent from binge eating and purging 
at the end of treatment [42, 43]. Further, the two studies 
that reported improvements in eating disorder psychopa-
thology and behaviors (both binge eating and purging) at 
the end of treatment found that gains were maintained at 
3- and 12-month follow-ups [39, 41].

Randomized controlled trial results demonstrated that 
FBT—compared  to  CBT—resulted  in  superior  reduc-
tions  in  binge  eating  and  purging  at  the  end  of  treat-
ment and 6-month follow-up, though outcomes were no 
longer  different  between  treatment  groups  at  12-month 
follow-up  [44].  Improvements 
in  cognitive  compo-
nents  of  eating  disorder  psychopathology  [44],  depres-
sion,  and  self-esteem  did  not  differ  between  CBT  and 
FBT  at  any  time-point  [45].  In  another  study,  patients 
who  received  CBT  showed  slightly  greater  reductions 
in  frequency  of  binge  eating  and  purging  but  somewhat 
less  improvement  in  eating  concern  at  the  end  of  treat-
ment  than  those  who  received  psychodynamic  therapy, 
while psychodynamic therapy showed a small advantage 
over CBT in eating concern at the end of treatment [39]. 
Together,  these  findings  indicate  relatively  small  dif-
ferences  between  outcomes  with  CBT  and  other  active 
treatments.

BED outcomes

One study representing two articles investigated CBT for 
BED,  using  a  manual  for  adult  BED  adapted  for  adoles-
cents. Attrition rate was 32%, though results showed high 
levels  of  therapist  treatment  adherence  and  therapeu-
tic  alliance  [46],  supporting  feasibility  and  acceptability. 
Comparison  to  a  wait-list  control  group  demonstrated 
that the CBT group had significantly higher rates of absti-
nence from binge eating, significantly less eating disorder 
psychopathology, and greater diagnostic remission at the 
end of treatment [47]. In addition, the CBT group main-
tained its advantage relative to wait-list control in eating 
disorder behaviors and psychopathology at all follow-ups 
through two years.

Transdiagnostic outcomes

Two  studies  combined  results  for  BN  and  BED;  one 
reported  on  a  transdiagnostic  sample  of  adolescents 
with  AN,  BN,  or  eating  disorder  not  otherwise  speci-
fied; one reported results for any DSM-5 eating disorder, 
excluding  avoidant  restrictive  intake  disorder.  Studies 
evaluated  manualized  CBT-E  (n = 2),  CBT  adapted  (by 
the  research  team)  for  adolescents  (n = 1),  and  eclec-
tic  approaches  that  integrated  CBT  components  (n = 1). 
Feasibility and acceptability of the interventions was sup-
ported  by  an  acceptable  average  attrition  across  three 
studies (M = 28.3%, range: [23–37]) [30, 48, 49] and high 

 Vogel et al. J Eat Disord           (2021) 9:131

post-treatment  patient  satisfaction  in  one  study  [30]. 
Effectiveness and efficacy were supported by statistically 
significant  improvements  in  eating  disorder  psychopa-
thology  from  pre-  to  post-treatment  with  a  large  effect 
size  in  a  study  evaluating  CBT-E  [48],  and  higher  rates 
of  abstinence  from  binge  eating  at  the  end  of  treatment 
compared to treatment as usual in a study evaluating an 
adaptation of CBT for adolescents [30]. Further, an effec-
tiveness  trial  demonstrated  that  though  rate  of  weight 
gain  was  slower  in  CBT-E  compared  to  FBT  at  the  end 
of  treatment,  there  were  no  differences  in  weight  gain 
between  the  treatments  six  months  and  one  year  later, 
and  no  differences  in  eating  disorder  psychopathology 
or most measures of global psychopathology and clinical 
impairment  at  any  time  point  [49].  However,  treatment 
was not assigned but rather chosen by patients and their 
families,  such  that  baseline  differences  between  treat-
ment groups (e.g., age, duration of illness) were not unex-
pected.  Finally,  an  observational  cross-sectional  study 
found  that  participants  with  poor  relational/personality 
functioning did particularly well in eclectic forms of CBT 
[50].

Guided self‑help for BN

Five  articles  representing  three  different  studies  (two 
randomized controlled trials, one cohort study) assessed 
the  feasibility,  acceptability,  effectiveness  and/or  efficacy 
of  CBT  guided  self-help  for  adolescents,  all  of  which 
focused exclusively on BN. The interventions were deliv-
ered  online  (n = 1),  via  bibliotherapy  (n = 1),  or  com-
pared online and bibliotherapy formats (n = 1). Minimal, 
optional  parent  involvement  was  reported  in  two  stud-
ies  [51,  52].  Variables  studied  included  eating  disorder 
psychopathology,  treatment  satisfaction,  and  treatment 
cost.  All  three  studies  included  follow-up  data.  Average 
attrition  across  studies  was  26%  (range:  [17–31],  n = 3). 
Acceptability  was  further  supported  by  high  adolescent 
satisfaction  with  treatment  [52],  a  preference  for  a  self-
help  format  in  adolescents  wishing  to  exclude  parents 
from  care,  and/or  seeking  increased  flexibility  and  ano-
nymity  [53].  Qualitative  interview  data  indicated  that 
guided  self-help  may  be  a  feasible  and  acceptable  “step-
ping  stone”  toward  seeking  in-person  therapy  [53].  Fea-
sibility  was  further  supported  by  lower  mean  cost  of 
treatment compared to an adapted form of FBT [54].

Statistically  significant  improvements  were  reported 
across all studies in bulimic behaviors (i.e., binge eating, 
purging  and/or  fasting;  n = 3),  although  rates  of  remis-
sion  were  modest.  One  study  reported  that  about  half 
of  adolescents  had  achieved  abstinence  from  behaviors 
or remission at the end of treatment [55], while another 
reported that the majority of adolescents remained symp-
tomatic at the end of treatment and follow-up [52]. Two 

studies made comparisons to another treatment or treat-
ment  format.  No  differences  emerged  between  online 
versus bibliotherapy guided self-help [55], and compared 
to  family  therapy,  a  significantly  higher  proportion  of 
participants were abstinent from binge eating at 6-month 
follow-up in CBT guided self-help, though significant dif-
ferences between these groups disappeared at 12-month 
follow-up [51].

Inpatient treatment for AN

Five  cohort  studies  assessed  acceptability  and  effective-
ness  for  CBT-based  inpatient  care,  all  of  which  focused 
exclusively  on  AN.  Three  of  the  studies  implemented  a 
CBT  component  (individual  and/or  group  CBT)  within 
a  program  with  multiple  treatment  components,  while 
two examined inpatient programs based on CBT-E. The 
majority (n = 5) incorporated formal family sessions. All 
studies used weight restoration as a measure of outcome, 
and most (n = 5) examined eating disorder psychopathol-
ogy. Only two studies reported follow-up data. Accepta-
bility was supported by relatively low attrition (M = 19%, 
range:  [4–31],  n = 5).  The  effectiveness  of  inpatient  pro-
grams  based  on  CBT-E  was  excellent,  with  nearly  all 
patients  (96%)  across  two  studies  achieving  a  normative 
body mass index at the end of treatment [56, 57]. Results 
of  studies  that  examined  a  multimodal  treatment  pro-
gram  with  a  CBT  component  were  less  strong.  Patients 
across  studies  achieved  statistically  significant  increases 
in body mass index, but results were mixed for the pro-
portion  who  achieved  a  normative  body  mass  index  by 
discharge. One study found that the majority of patients 
achieved  a  normative  body  weight  by  the  end  of  treat-
ment [58], while body weight had not reached normative 
levels,  on  average,  by  discharge  in  two  others  [59,  60]. 
Finally, there were statistically significant albeit clinically 
modest  reductions  in  global  eating  disorder  psychopa-
thology  across  studies;  in  two  studies,  over  half  of  par-
ticipants  continued  to  have  clinically  significant  eating 
disorder psychopathology at discharge [57, 60].

DBT for adolescent eating disorders
Outpatient settings

Ten  articles  representing  nine  different  studies  (i.e.,  one 
study  produced  one  secondary  analysis  paper)  investi-
gated  outpatient  DBT  for  adolescent  eating  disorders. 
Across  unique  studies,  DBT  was  implemented  for  ado-
lescents  with  AN  (n = 1),  BN  (n = 1),  BED  (n = 3),  and 
transdiagnostic  eating  disorders  (n = 4).  Most  studies 
(n = 8, 88.9%) were either cohort studies or case reports, 
and one was a randomized controlled trial. Interventions 
implemented  full-model  DBT  (i.e.,  individual  therapy, 
skills  group,  and  phone  coaching;  n = 2);  DBT-informed 
individual therapy (n = 1); DBT skills groups (n = 3); and 

Vogel et al. J Eat Disord           (2021) 9:131 

Page 33 of 38

“DBT-informed” FBT (n = 3); one study also incorporated 
an optional parent group [61]. All studies assessed eating 
disorder psychopathology, two assessed parent reports of 
eating pathology, and three examined DBT mechanisms 
of  action  (e.g.,  distress  tolerance,  emotion  regulation, 
DBT  skills  use).  Articles  also  examined  aspects  of  feasi-
bility and acceptability (n = 5), including patient satisfac-
tion,  treatment  expectations,  and  therapeutic  alliance. 
Fewer than half of studies (n = 2, 20%) reported follow-up 
data.

AN outcomes

Only one outpatient study examined DBT-enhanced FBT 
in adolescents with AN [62]. Treatment was perceived as 
“appropriate”  and  “acceptable”  by  all  patients  and  their 
parents with moderate to high ratings of therapeutic alli-
ance,  respectively.  Acceptability  was  further  supported 
by a moderate attrition rate (27%). Patients demonstrated 
significant  increases  in  weight  across  treatment,  with  a 
little over one third achieving weight restoration and over 
half demonstrating  clinically meaningful changes in eat-
ing  disorder  psychopathology  at  the  end  of  treatment. 
Small  improvements  in  distress  tolerance  and  emo-
tion  regulation  also  suggested  that  the  intervention  was 
effective  in  promoting  symptom  reduction  in  targeted 
domains.

BN outcomes

One  study  examined  DBT-enhanced  FBT  in  adoles-
cents  with  BN  [63].  Acceptability  was  highly  supported 
by  100%  treatment  retention.  By  the  end  of  treatment, 
patients reported significant improvements in global eat-
ing  disorder  psychopathology,  binge  eating,  and  vomit-
ing,  and  improvements  in  parental  efficacy  and  patient 
emotion regulation were observed.

BED outcomes

Four  articles  representing  three  different  studies  exam-
ined individual and group DBT for adolescents with BED. 
Acceptability  was  supported  by  100%  treatment  reten-
tion in all studies. Studies demonstrated high patient sat-
isfaction, with DBT skills groups being rated as feasible, 
acceptable, and helpful [64, 65]. Patients reported signif-
icant  decreases  in  binge  eating  by  the  end  of  treatment 
in all studies, and 80% of patients no longer met criteria 
for BED post-treatment in one [65]. Significant decreases 
in  emotional  eating  [65]  and  mindless  eating  [64]  were 
also observed. Notably, Safer et al. [66] found significant 
reductions  in  eating  restraint,  but  not  weight,  shape,  or 
eating  concerns,  post-treatment.  In  another  study  [64], 
depression  scores  improved  throughout  treatment,  but 
anxious  and  somatic  symptoms  remained  unchanged. 
Only one study, a case report of DBT-informed individual 

therapy [66], presented follow-up data and found further 
reduction in binge episodes by 3-month follow-up.

In studies that examined DBT skills group mechanisms, 
patients  with  BED  consistently  rated  radical  acceptance 
as the most helpful skill [64, 67], followed by mindful eat-
ing, and three mind states [67]. By the end of treatment, 
patients showed increases in distress tolerance, cognitive 
reappraisal, and expressive suppression.

Transdiagnostic outcomes

Studies  that  investigated  the  feasibility  and  acceptability 
of DBT and DBT-informed therapies for transdiagnostic 
eating  disorder  samples  (i.e.,  AN,  BN,  BED,  and/or  eat-
ing  disorder  not  otherwise  specified)  found  that  both 
therapists and patients rated the treatment highly. Across 
all  four  studies,  acceptability  was  further  supported  by 
relatively  low  attrition  (M = 26%,  range:  [8–33]),  and 
treatment  effectiveness  was  supported  by  significant 
improvements  in  global  eating  disorder  psychopathol-
ogy.  Patients  with  binge  eating  and/or  purging  at  base-
line  either  reported  significant  reductions  in  [61,  68]  or 
abstinence from these behaviors by the end of treatment 
[69].  Depressive  symptomatology  also  showed  marked 
improvement post-treatment [69]. Patients demonstrated 
continued  improvement  through  follow-up,  with  the 
majority  of  patients  across  studies  reporting  abstinence 
from  non-suicidal  self-injury,  binge  eating,  and  purg-
ing; and further decreases in global eating disorder psy-
chopathology [61]. One study found large effect sizes for 
increases in adaptive skills and decreases in dysfunctional 
coping  strategies  [68],  suggesting  high  therapist  fidel-
ity  to  the  treatment  model  that  effectively  targeted  the 
intended mechanisms of change.

Mazzeo et al. [70] performed the only randomized con-
trolled  trial,  comparing  a  DBT  skills  group  to  a  weight 
management  control  group  for  BED  and  loss-of-con-
trol  eating.  DBT  was  feasible  and  satisfactory  (although 
somewhat  less  so  than  for  weight  management),  and 
patients  demonstrated  similar  improvements  in  global 
eating  disorder  psychopathology  as  those  who  received 
weight  management.  However,  the  DBT  group  did  not 
demonstrate improvement in weight concerns, while the 
weight management group did.

Discussion
Treatment  outcomes  for  adolescent  eating  disorders 
remain modest, highlighting the need for innovative and 
novel  treatment  approaches.  This  review  concludes  that 
CBT  and  DBT-informed  interventions  have  good  feasi-
bility  and  acceptability  for  adolescent  eating  disorders, 
with  rates  of  attrition  comparable  to  FBT  trials  [8,  71]. 
Studies  also  demonstrated  high  rates  of  treatment  satis-
faction,  therapeutic  alliance,  and  treatment  fidelity,  but

data  establishing  effectiveness  and  efficacy  compared  to 
other leading approaches were mixed or incomplete.

The  effectiveness  of  CBT  for  AN  received  partial  sup-
port  with  mixed  results  across  studies,  though  efficacy 
trials  demonstrated  that  CBT  for  AN  was  neither  infe-
rior or superior to other outpatient (i.e., behavioral fam-
ily  therapy,  DBT,  community-based  care)  and  inpatient 
treatments.  Support  for  the  effectiveness  of  CBT  was 
strongest  for  BN,  with  consistent,  meaningful  reduc-
tions  in  binge  eating  and  purging  across  studies,  while 
efficacy  was  supported  by  small  differences  in  outcome 
compared to other active treatments (i.e., FBT or psycho-
dynamic  therapy).  CBT  guided  self-help  for  BN  also  led 
to significant reductions in binge eating and purging and 
may have enhanced feasibility and acceptability for ado-
lescents  who  might  not  otherwise  engage  in  treatment. 
Meanwhile,  weight  restoration  outcomes  were  stronger 
in  inpatient  programs  based  on  CBT-E  for  AN  relative 
to  eclectic  inpatient  programs,  though  replication  by 
alternative  research  teams  would  help  clarify  their  fea-
sibility. However, there was a paucity of CBT studies for 
diagnoses other than AN or BN, and additional effective-
ness and efficacy trials are needed across eating disorder 
diagnoses.

A lack of trials comparing CBT to FBT for AN emerged 
as  a  particularly  notable  gap  in  the  literature,  given  that 
FBT is widely considered the first line treatment for ado-
lescent AN but is not always feasible (due to factors such 
as  family  capacity/preferences,  as  well  as  clinician  pref-
erences).  Comparisons  of  FBT  to  CBT  have  supported 
the  effectiveness  of  CBT-E  for  a  majority  underweight 
transdiagnostic  eating  disorders  sample  [49],  as  well  as 
the  efficacy  of  CBT  for  BN  [44];  FBT  resulted  in  faster 
improvement,  but  CBT  “caught  up”  with  no  differences 
in  outcome  one-year  post-treatment  in  both  studies. 
Hybrid  designs  that  randomize  patients  to  treatment  in 
real  world  settings  are  needed  to  compare  FBT  to  CBT 
for AN to clarify their relative efficacy and moderators of 
treatment  outcome.  Consistent  definitions  of  remission 
and  attention  to  the  clinical  significance  of  outcomes, 
particularly in studies of AN, were also lacking and would 
improve  the  interpretation  of  the  relative  effectiveness 
and efficacy of CBT versus FBT in future studies.

DBT  and  DBT-informed  treatments  demonstrated 
high  levels  of  feasibility,  acceptability,  and  effectiveness, 
with reductions in global eating pathology and behaviors 
across  eating  disorders.  Support  for  the  effectiveness  of 
DBT and DBT-informed interventions was strongest for 
BN and BED with consistent reductions in or abstinence 
from  binge  eating  by  the  end  of  treatment,  and  signifi-
cant  reductions  in  purging  for  those  with  BN.  The  only 
available  randomized  controlled  trial  comparing  DBT 
to  weight  management  found  no  significant  differences 

in  outcomes  for  BED  and  loss-of-control  eating.  Addi-
tional  randomized  controlled  trials  are  thus  needed  to 
understand the efficacy of DBT, particularly compared to 
other treatments over the long-term, given potential dif-
ferences between treatments that may not emerge in the 
absence of follow-up data.

Several  differences  between  CBT  and  DBT  emerged. 
First,  contrary  to  CBT,  there  were  no  studies  evaluating 
DBT  adapted  in  inpatient  settings.  The  ability  for  CBT 
(particularly CBT-E; [56, 57]) to span inpatient and out-
patient settings enables a stepped care approach that may 
facilitate continuity when transitioning between levels of 
care (e.g., prevent confusion for adolescents and caregiv-
ers due to disparate strategies at different levels of care). 
While such continuity may be possible in the context of 
DBT-informed higher level of care programs, these have 
not  yet  been  studied.  Second,  though  “pure”  CBT  (i.e., 
manualized CBT or CBT-E) was evaluated for the treat-
ment of AN and BN, “pure” DBT was evaluated primarily 
for BED, with DBT skills being integrated within FBT for 
AN and BN. Indeed, CBT may better target mechanisms 
hypothesized to maintain AN and BN (e.g., overvaluation 
of  shape  and  weight),  while  DBT  may  be  better  suited 
to  target  mechanisms  that  maintain  psychopathology  in 
BED (e.g., emotion dysregulation). As such, CBT may be 
more  appropriate  to  compare  to  FBT  than  DBT  for  the 
treatment  of  AN  and  BN,  particularly  in  randomized 
controlled  trials  examining  mediators  of  change,  as  it 
would  not  be  possible  to  identify  mediators  when  com-
paring  treatments  with  overlapping  components  (e.g., 
FBT vs DBT integrated with FBT).

Notably,  though  this  systematic  review  aimed  to  be 
comprehensive  with  the  inclusion  of  non-randomized 
designs  and  thoughtful  selection  of  key  search  terms,  it 
is  possible  that  the  keyword  search  did  not  encompass 
all  relevant  articles,  and  studies  published  after  Decem-
ber  2020  were  not  included.  The  risk  of  bias  assess-
ment  revealed  multiple  limitations  across  studies:  small 
sample  sizes,  biased  samples  limiting  generalizability, 
inconsistent  reporting  of  follow-up  data,  and  inconsist-
ent reporting of elements critical to study quality assess-
ment,  including  power  to  detect  an  effect,  and  effect 
sizes. In addition, many studies failed to report race/eth-
nicity, and the majority of those that did recruited all or 
majority non-Hispanic White samples. Most studies also 
recruited  majority  female  or  female-only  samples.  The 
homogeneity of these samples is an underrepresentation 
of  the  diversity  in  sex,  gender  identity,  race,  and  ethnic-
ity  within  the  eating  disorders  population  [72–74].  The 
implementation  of  treatments  also  varied  considerably 
across studies, with multiple studies integrating elements 
of CBT or DBT within other treatments. While this lim-
its conclusions about the specific, unique impact of CBT

Page 35 of 38

or  DBT,  combination  treatments  may  hold  promise  in 
enhancing  treatment  outcome.  For  instance,  FBT  com-
bined  with  cognitive-behavioral  techniques  may  capital-
ize on the benefit of family supervision and support while 
also  addressing  maladaptive  cognitions  [36].  However, 
randomized  designs  are  needed  to  clarify  whether  CBT 
may  have  advantages  for  certain  patients  (e.g.,  through 
identification  of  treatment  moderators),  and  whether 
hybrid forms of treatment (e.g., integrating CBT or DBT 
with FBT) may enhance patient outcomes.

Conclusions
CBT  and  DBT  demonstrated  good  feasibility,  accept-
ability,  and  preliminary  effectiveness  across  adolescent 
eating  disorders  in  real-world  clinical  settings,  but 
their  efficacy  relative  to  more  established  treatments  is 
largely unexamined. Ultimately, the availability of addi-
tional evidence-based treatments offers an alternative to 
FBT, which currently predominates in the treatment of 
adolescent eating disorders, and is insufficient for some 
families  (e.g.,  due  to  family  factors  such  as  a  history  of 
caregiver  abuse,  lack  of  caregiver  availability  or  other 
barriers  to  treatment  engagement,  including  caregiver 
unwillingness possibly affected by poor cultural accept-
ability  and  stigma  related  to  mental  health  and  men-
tal  health  treatment;  or  co-occurring  disorders  and/or 
other  psychopathology  better  managed  within  a  DBT 
framework).

New  treatments  or  even  existing  treatments  blended 
with  new  treatments  may  enhance  outcomes  for  diffi-
cult-to-treat  populations  or  reduce  risk  of  relapse.  We 
recommend  that  future  research:  (1)  use  adequately 
powered, randomized designs with representative trans-
diagnostic  eating  disorder  samples  under  real-world 
conditions  to  compare  CBT  and  DBT  to  other  leading 
treatments  (including  FBT);  (2)  evaluate  the  relative 
utility of “pure” versus integrated/hybrid forms of treat-
ment  (e.g.,  the  efficacy  of  broad  CBT-E  vs  CBT  inte-
grated  with  FBT);  (3)  assess  treatment  moderators  to 
better guide treatment matching; (4) evaluate mediators 
of  treatment  response,  and  reasons  for  non-response 
to  inform  treatment  modifications  that  improve  effi-
cacy  and  efficiency;  and  (5)  improve  the  consistency 
of  reporting  elements  critical  to  study  quality  assess-
ment—power and effect sizes—to improve the interpre-
tation  of  outcomes.  Advancing  research  on  alternative 
treatment  options  is  imperative  given  the  serious  con-
sequences of eating disorders [4], relative likelihood for 
a severe and enduring presentation [75, 76], and remis-
sion rates for leading treatments.
