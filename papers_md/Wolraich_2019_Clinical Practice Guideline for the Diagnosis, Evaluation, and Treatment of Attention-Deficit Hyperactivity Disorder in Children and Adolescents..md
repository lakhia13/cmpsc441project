Abstract

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common neurobehavioral 
disorders of childhood and can profoundly affect children’s academic achievement, well-being, 
and social interactions. The American Academy of Pediatrics first published clinical 
recommendations for evaluation and diagnosis of pediatric ADHD in 2000; recommendations for 
treatment followed in 2001. The guidelines were revised in 2011 and published with an 
accompanying process of care algorithm (PoCA) providing discrete and manageable steps by 
which clinicians could fulfill the clinical guideline’s recommendations. Since the release of the 
2011 guideline, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders has been revised to the 
fifth edition, and new ADHD-related research has been published. These publications do not 
support dramatic changes to the previous recommendations. Therefore, only incremental updates 
have been made in this guideline revision, including the addition of a key action statement related 
to diagnosis and treatment of comorbid conditions in children and adolescents with ADHD. The 
accompanying process of care algorithm has also been updated to assist in implementing the 
guideline recommendations. Throughout the process of revising the guideline and algorithm, 
numerous systemic barriers were identified that restrict and/or hamper pediatric clinicians’ ability 
to adopt their recommendations. Therefore, the subcommittee created a companion article

(available in the Supplemental Information) on systemic barriers to the care of children and 
adolescents with ADHD, which identifies the major systemic-level barriers and presents 
recommendations to address those barriers; in this article, we support the recommendations of the 
clinical practice guideline and accompanying process of care algorithm.

INTRODUCTION

This article updates and replaces the 2011 clinical practice guideline revision published by 
the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), “Clinical Practice Guideline: Diagnosis and 
Evaluation of the Child with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder.”1 This guideline, like 
the previous document, addresses the evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment of attention-
deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children from age 4 years to their 18th birthday, 
with special guidance provided for ADHD care for preschool-aged children and adolescents. 
(Note that for the purposes of this document, “preschool-aged” refers to children from age 4 
years to the sixth birthday.) Pediatricians and other primary care clinicians (PCCs) may 
continue to provide care after 18 years of age, but care beyond this age was not studied for 
this guideline.

Since 2011, much research has occurred, and the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of 
Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), has been released. The new research and DSM-5 
do not, however, support dramatic changes to the previous recommendations. Hence, this 
new guideline includes only incremental updates to the previous guideline. One such update 
is the addition of a key action statement (KAS) about the diagnosis and treatment of 
coexisting or comorbid conditions in children and adolescents with ADHD. The 
subcommittee uses the term “comorbid,” to be consistent with the DSM-5.

Since 2011, the release of new research reflects an increased understanding and recognition 
of ADHD’s prevalence and epidemiology; the challenges it raises for children and families; 
the need for a comprehensive clinical resource for the evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment of 
pediatric ADHD; and the barriers that impede the implementation of such a resource. In 
response, this guideline is supported by 2 accompanying documents, available in the 
Supplemental Information: (1) a process of care algorithm (PoCA) for the diagnosis and 
treatment of children and adolescents with ADHD and (2) an article on systemic barriers to 
the care of children and adolescents with ADHD. These supplemental documents are 
designed to aid PCCs in implementing the formal recommendations for the evaluation, 
diagnosis, and treatment of children and adolescents with ADHD. Although this document is 
specific to children and adolescents in the United States in some of its recommendations, 
international stakeholders can modify specific content (ie, educational laws about 
accommodations, etc) as needed. (Prevention is addressed in the Mental Health Task Force 
recommendations.2)

PoCA for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Children and Adolescents With 

ADHD

In this revised guideline and accompanying PoCA, we recognize that evaluation, diagnosis, 
and treatment are a continuous process. The PoCA provides recommendations for 
implementing the guideline steps, although there is less evidence for the PoCA than for the 
guidelines. The section on evaluating and treating comorbidities has also been expanded in 
the PoCA document.

Systems Barriers to the Care of Children and Adolescents With ADHD

There are many system-level barriers that hamper the adoption of the best-practice 
recommendations contained in the clinical practice guideline and the PoCA. The procedures 
recommended in this guideline necessitate spending more time with patients and their 
families, developing a care management system of contacts with school and other 
community stakeholders, and providing continuous, coordinated care to the patient and his 
or her family. There is some evidence that African American and Latino children are less 
likely to have ADHD diagnosed and are less likely to be treated for ADHD. Special 
attention should be given to these populations when assessing comorbidities as they relate to 
ADHD and when treating for ADHD symptoms.3 Given the nationwide problem of limited 
access to mental health clinicians,4 pediatricians and other PCCs are increasingly called on 
to provide services to patients with ADHD and to their families. In addition, the AAP holds 
that primary care pediatricians should be prepared to diagnose and manage mild-to-moderate 
ADHD, anxiety, depression, and problematic substance use, as well as co-manage patients 
who have more severe conditions with mental health professionals. Unfortunately, third-
party payers seldom pay appropriately for these time-consuming services.5,6

To assist pediatricians and other PCCs in overcoming such obstacles, the companion article 
on systemic barriers to the care of children and adolescents with ADHD reviews the barriers 
and makes recommendations to address them to enhance care for children and adolescents 
with ADHD.

ADHD EPIDEMIOLOGY AND SCOPE

Prevalence estimates of ADHD vary on the basis of differences in research methodologies, 
the various age groups being described, and changes in diagnostic criteria over time.7 
Authors of a recent meta-analysis calculated a pooled worldwide ADHD prevalence of 7.2% 
among children8; estimates from some community-based samples are somewhat higher, at 
8.7% to 15.5%.9,10 National survey data from 2016 indicate that 9.4% of children in the 
United States 2 to 17 years of age have ever had an ADHD diagnosis, including 2.4% of 
children 2 to 5 years of age.11 In that national survey, 8.4% of children 2 to 17 years of age 
currently had ADHD, representing 5.4 million children.11 Among children and adolescents 
with current ADHD, almost two-thirds were taking medication, and approximately half had 
received behavioral treatment of ADHD in the past year. Nearly one quarter had received 
neither type of treatment of ADHD.11

Symptoms of ADHD occur in childhood, and most children with ADHD will continue to 
have symptoms and impairment through adolescence and into adulthood. According to a 
2014 national survey, the median age of diagnosis was 7 years; approximately one-third of 
children were diagnosed before 6 years of age.12 More than half of these children were first 
diagnosed by a PCC, often a pediatrician.12 As individuals with ADHD enter adolescence, 
their overt hyperactive and impulsive symptoms tend to decline, whereas their inattentive 
symptoms tend to persist.13,14 Learning and language problems are common comorbid 
conditions with ADHD.15

Boys are more than twice as likely as girls to receive a diagnosis of ADHD,9,11,16 possibly 
because hyperactive behaviors, which are easily observable and potentially disruptive, are 
seen more frequently in boys. The majority of both boys and girls with ADHD also meet 
diagnostic criteria for another mental disorder.17,18 Boys are more likely to exhibit 
externalizing conditions like oppositional defiant disorder or conduct disorder.17,19,20 Recent 
research has established that girls with ADHD are more likely than boys to have a comorbid 
internalizing condition like anxiety or depression.21

Although there is a greater risk of receiving a diagnosis of ADHD for children who are the 
youngest in their class (who are therefore less developmentally capable of compensating for 
their weaknesses), for most children, retention is not beneficial.22

METHODOLOGY

As with the original 2000 clinical practice guideline and the 2011 revision, the AAP 
collaborated with several organizations to form a subcommittee on ADHD (the 
subcommittee) under the oversight of the AAP Council on Quality Improvement and Patient 
Safety.

The subcommittee’s membership included representation of a wide range of primary care 
and subspecialty groups, including primary care pediatricians, developmental-behavioral 
pediatricians, an epidemiologist from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; and 
representatives from the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, the 
Society for Pediatric Psychology, the National Association of School Psychologists, the 
Society for Developmental and Behavioral Pediatrics (SDBP), the American Academy of 
Family Physicians, and Children and Adults with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder 
(CHADD) to provide feedback on the patient/parent perspective.

This subcommittee met over a 3.5-year period from 2015 to 2018 to review practice changes 
and newly identified issues that have arisen since the publication of the 2011 guidelines. The 
subcommittee members’ potential conflicts were identified and taken into consideration in 
the group’s deliberations. No conflicts prevented subcommittee member participation on the 
guidelines.

Research Questions

The subcommittee developed a series of research questions to direct an evidence-based 
review sponsored by 1 of the Evidence-based Practice Centers of the US Agency for 

Pediatrics. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2020 October 01.

Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ).23 These questions assessed 4 diagnostic areas 
and 3 treatment areas on the basis of research published in 2011 through 2016.

The AHRQ’s framework was guided by key clinical questions addressing diagnosis as well 
as treatment interventions for children and adolescents 4 to 18 years of age.

The first clinical questions pertaining to ADHD diagnosis were as follows:

1.

2.

3.

4.

What is the comparative diagnostic accuracy of approaches that can be used in 
the primary care practice setting or by specialists to diagnose ADHD among 
children younger than 7 years of age?

What is the comparative diagnostic accuracy of EEC, imaging, or executive 
function approaches that can be used in the primary care practice setting or by 
specialists to diagnose ADHD among individuals aged 7 to their 18th birthday?

What are the adverse effects associated with being labeled correctly or 
incorrectly as having ADHD?

Are there more formal neuropsychological, imaging, or genetic tests that 
improve the diagnostic process?

The treatment questions were as follows:

1.

2.

3.

What are the comparative safety and effectiveness of pharmacologic and/or 
nonpharmacologic treatments of ADHD in improving outcomes associated with 
ADHD?

What is the risk of diversion of pharmacologic treatment?

What are the comparative safety and effectiveness of different monitoring 
strategies to evaluate the effectiveness of treatment or changes in ADHD status 
(eg, worsening or resolving symptoms)?

In addition to this review of the research questions, the subcommittee considered 
information from a review of evidence-based psychosocial treatments for children and 
adolescents with ADHD24 (which, in some cases, affected the evidence grade) as well as 
updated information on prevalence from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Evidence Review

This article followed the latest version of the evidence base update format used to develop 
the previous 3 clinical practice guidelines.24–26 Under this format, studies were only 
included in the review when they met a variety of criteria designed to ensure the research 
was based on a strong methodology that yielded confidence in its conclusions.

The level of efficacy for each treatment was defined on the basis of child-focused outcomes 
related to both symptoms and impairment. Hence, improvements in behaviors on the part of 
parents or teachers, such as the use of communication or praise, were not considered in the 
review. Although these outcomes are important, they address how treatment reaches the 
child or adolescent with ADHD and are, therefore, secondary to changes in the child’s

behavior. Focusing on improvements in the child or adolescent’s symptoms and impairment 
emphasizes the disorder’s characteristics and manifestations that affect children and their 
families.

The treatment-related evidence relied on a recent review of literature from 2011 through 
2016 by the AHRQ of citations from Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, and the Cochrane 
Database of Systematic Reviews.

The original methodology and report, including the evidence search and review, are available 
in their entirety and as an executive summary at https://effectivehealthcare.ahrq.gov/sites/
default/files/pdf/cer-203-adhd-final_0.pdf.

The evidence is discussed in more detail in published reports and articles.25

Guideline Recommendations and Key Action Statements

The AAP policy statement, “Classifying Recommendations for Clinical Practice 
Guidelines,” was followed in designating aggregate evidence quality levels for the available 
evidence (see Fig 1).27 The AAP policy statement is consistent with the grading 
recommendations advanced by the University of Oxford Centre for Evidence Based 
Medicine.

The subcommittee reached consensus on the evidence, which was then used to develop the 
clinical practice guideline’s KASs.

When the scientific evidence was at least “good” in quality and demonstrated a 
preponderance of benefits over harms, the KAS provides a “strong recommendation” or 
“recommendation.”27 Clinicians should follow a “strong recommendation” unless a clear 
and compelling rationale for an alternative approach is present; clinicians are prudent to 
follow a “recommendation” but are advised to remain alert to new information and be 
sensitive to patient preferences27 (see Fig 1).

When the scientific evidence comprised lower-quality or limited data and expert consensus 
or high-quality evidence with a balance between benefits and harms, the KAS provides an 
“option” level of recommendation. Options are clinical interventions that a reasonable health 
care provider might or might not wish to implement in the practice.27 Where the evidence 
was lacking, a combination of evidence and expert consensus would be used, although this 
did not occur in these guidelines, and all KASs achieved a “strong recommendation” level 
except for KAS 7, on comorbidities, which received a recommendation level (see Fig 1).

As shown in Fig 1, integrating evidence quality appraisal with an assessment of the 
anticipated balance between benefits and harms leads to a designation of a strong 
recommendation, recommendation, option, or no recommendation.

Once the evidence level was determined, an evidence grade was assigned. AAP policy 
stipulates that the evidence supporting each KAS be prospectively identified, appraised, and 
summarized, and an explicit link between quality levels and the grade of recommendation

must be defined. Possible grades of recommendations range from “A” to “D,” with “A” 
being the highest:

•

•

•

•

•

grade A: consistent level A studies;

grade B: consistent level B or extrapolations from level A studies;

grade C: level C studies or extrapolations from level B or level C studies;

grade D: level D evidence or troublingly inconsistent or inconclusive studies of 
any level; and

level X: not an explicit level of evidence as outlined by the Centre for Evidence-
Based Medicine. This level is reserved for interventions that are unethical or 
impossible to test in a controlled or scientific fashion and for which the 
preponderance of benefit or harm is overwhelming, precluding rigorous 
investigation.

Guided by the evidence quality and grade, the subcommittee developed 7 KASs for the 
evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment of ADHD in children and adolescents (see Table 1).

These KASs provide for consistent and high-quality care for children and adolescents who 
may have symptoms suggesting attention disorders or problems as well as for their families. 
In developing the 7 KASs, the subcommittee considered the requirements for establishing 
the diagnosis; the prevalence of ADHD; the effect of untreated ADHD; the efficacy and 
adverse effects of treatment; various long-term outcomes; the importance of coordination 
between pediatric and mental health service providers; the value of the medical home; and 
the common occurrence of comorbid conditions, the importance of addressing them, and the 
effects of not treating them.

The subcommittee members with the most epidemiological experience assessed the strength 
of each recommendation and the quality of evidence supporting each draft KAS.

Peer Review

The guidelines and PoCA underwent extensive peer review by more than 30 internal 
stakeholders (eg, AAP committees, sections, councils, and task forces) and external 
stakeholder groups identified by the subcommittee. The resulting comments were compiled 
and reviewed by the chair and vice chair; relevant changes were incorporated into the draft, 
which was then reviewed by the full subcommittee.

KASS FOR THE EVALUATION, DIAGNOSIS, TREATMENT, AND 

MONITORING OF CHILDREN AND ADOLESCENTS WITH ADHD

KAS 1

The pediatrician or other PCC should initiate an evaluation for ADHD for any child or 
adolescent age 4 years to the 18th birthday who presents with academic or behavioral 
problems and symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, or impulsivity (Table 2). (Grade B: 
strong recommendation.)

KAS 2

The basis for this recommendation is essentially unchanged from the previous guideline. As 
noted, ADHD is the most common neurobehavioral disorder of childhood, occurring in 
approximately 7% to 8% of children and youth.8,18,28,29 Hence, the number of children with 
this condition is far greater than can be managed by the mental health system.4 There is 
evidence that appropriate diagnosis can be accomplished in the primary care setting for 
children and adolescents.30,31 Note that there is insufficient evidence to recommend 
diagnosis or treatment for children younger than 4 years (other than parent training in 
behavior management [PTBM], which does not require a diagnosis to be applied); in 
instances in which ADHD-like symptoms in children younger than 4 years bring substantial 
impairment, PCCs can consider making a referral for PTBM.

To make a diagnosis of ADHD, the PCC should determine that DSM-5 criteria have been 
met, including documentation of symptoms and impairment in more than 1 major setting (ie, 
social, academic, or occupational), with information obtained primarily from reports from 
parents or guardians, teachers, other school personnel, and mental health clinicians who are 
involved in the child or adolescent’s care. The PCC should also rule out any alternative 
cause (Table 3). (Grade B: strong recommendation.)

The American Psychiatric Association developed the DSM-5 using expert consensus and an 
expanding research foundation.32 The DSM-5 system is used by professionals in psychiatry, 
psychology, health care systems, and primary care; it is also well established with third-party 
payers.

The DSM-5 criteria define 4 dimensions of ADHD:

1.

2.

3.

4.

attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder primarily of the inattentive presentation 
(ADHD/I) (314.00 [F90.0]);

attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder primarily of the hyperactive-impulsive 
presentation (ADHD/HI) (314.01 [F90.1]);

attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder combined presentation (ADHD/C) 
(314.01 [F90.2]); and

ADHD other specified and unspecified ADHD (314.01 [F90.8]).

As with the previous guideline recommendations, the DSM-5 classification criteria are based 
on the best available evidence for ADHD diagnosis and are the standard most frequently 
used by clinicians and researchers to render the diagnosis and document its appropriateness 
for a given child. The use of neuropsychological testing has not been found to improve 
diagnostic accuracy in most cases, although it may have benefit in clarifying the child or 
adolescent’s learning strengths and weaknesses. (See the PoCA for more information on 
implementing this KAS.)

Special Circumstances: Preschool-Aged Children (Age 4 Years to the Sixth Birthday)

There is evidence that the diagnostic criteria for ADHD can be applied to preschool-aged 
children.33–39 A review of the literature, including the multisite study of the efficacy of

methylphenidate in preschool-aged children, found that the DSM-5 criteria could 
appropriately identify children with ADHD.25

To make a diagnosis of ADHD in preschool-aged children, clinicians should conduct a 
clinical interview with parents, examine and observe the child, and obtain information from 
parents and teachers through DSM-based ADHD rating scales.40 Normative data are 
available for the DSM-5–based rating scales for ages 5 years to the 18th birthday.41 There 
are, however, minimal changes in the specific behaviors from the DSM-IV, on which all the 
other DSM-based ADHD rating scales obtained normative data. Both the ADHD Rating 
Scale-IV and the Conners Rating Scale have preschool-age normative data based on the 
DSM-IV. The specific behaviors in the DSM-5 criteria for ADHD are the same for all 
children younger than 18 years (ie, preschool-aged children, elementary and middle school-
aged children, and adolescents) and are only minimally different from the DSM-IV. Hence, 
if clinicians do not have the ADHD Rating Scale-5 or the ADHD Rating Scale-IV Preschool 
Version,42 any other DSM-based scale can be used to provide a systematic method for 
collecting information from parents and teachers, even in the absence of normative data.

Pediatricians and other PCCs should be aware that determining the presence of key 
symptoms in this age group has its challenges, such as observing symptoms across multiple 
settings as required by the DSM-5, particularly among children who do not attend a 
preschool or child care program. Here, too, focused checklists can be used to aid in the 
diagnostic evaluation.

PTBM is the recommended primary intervention for preschool-aged children with ADHD as 
well as children with ADHD-like behaviors whose diagnosis is not yet verified. This type of 
training helps parents learn age-appropriate developmental expectations, behaviors that 
strengthen the parent-child relationship, and specific management skills for problem 
behaviors. Clinicians do not need to have made an ADHD diagnosis before recommending 
PTBM because PTBM has documented effectiveness with a wide variety of problem 
behaviors, regardless of etiology. In addition, the intervention’s results may inform the 
subsequent diagnostic evaluation. Clinicians are encouraged to recommend that parents 
complete PTBM, if available, before assigning an ADHD diagnosis.

After behavioral parent training is implemented, the clinician can obtain information from 
parents and teachers through DSM-5–based ADHD rating scales. The clinician may obtain 
reports about the parents’ ability to manage their children and about the child’s core 
symptoms and impairments. Referral to an early intervention program or enrolling in a 
PTBM program can help provide information about the child’s behavior in other settings or 
with other observers. The evaluators for these programs and/or early childhood special 
education teachers may be useful observers, as well.

Special Circumstances: Adolescents (Age 12 Years to the 18th Birthday)

Obtaining teacher reports for adolescents is often more challenging than for younger 
children because many adolescents have multiple teachers. Likewise, an adolescent’s parents 
may have less opportunity to observe their child’s behaviors than they did when the child 
was younger. Furthermore, some problems experienced by children with ADHD are less

obvious in adolescents than in younger children because adolescents are less likely to exhibit 
overt hyperactive behavior Of note, adolescents’ reports of their own behaviors often differ 
from other observers because they tend to minimize their own problematic behaviors43–45

Despite these difficulties, clinicians need to try to obtain information from at least 2 teachers 
or other sources, such as coaches, school guidance counselors, or leaders of community 
activities in which the adolescent participates.46 For the evaluation to be successful, it is 
essential that adolescents agree with and participate in the evaluation. Variability in ratings is 
to be expected because adolescents’ behavior often varies between different classrooms and 
with different teachers. Identifying reasons for any variability can provide valuable clinical 
insight into the adolescent’s problems.

Note that, unless they previously received a diagnosis, to meet DSM-5 criteria for ADHD, 
adolescents must have some reported or documented manifestations of inattention or 
hyperactivity/impulsivity before age 12. Therefore, clinicians must establish that an 
adolescent had manifestations of ADHD before age 12 and strongly consider whether a 
mimicking or comorbid condition, such as substance use, depression, and/or anxiety, is 
present.46

In addition, the risks of mood and anxiety disorders and risky sexual behaviors increase 
during adolescence, as do the risks of intentional self-harm and suicidal behaviors.31 
Clinicians should also be aware that adolescents are at greater risk for substance use than are 
younger children44,45,47 Certain substances, such as marijuana, can have effects that mimic 
ADHD; adolescent patients may also attempt to obtain stimulant medication to enhance 
performance (ie, academic, athletic, etc) by feigning symptoms.48

Trauma experiences, posttraumatic stress disorder, and toxic stress are additional 
comorbidities and risk factors of concern.

Special Circumstances: Inattention or Hyperactivity/impulsivity (Problem Level)

Teachers, parents, and child health professionals typically encounter children who 
demonstrate behaviors relating to activity level, impulsivity, and inattention but who do not 
fully meet DSM-5 criteria. When assessing these children, diagnostic criteria should be 
closely reviewed, which may require obtaining more information from other settings and 
sources. Also consider that these symptoms may suggest other problems that mimic ADHD.

Behavioral interventions, such as PTBM, are often beneficial for children with hyperactive/
impulsive behaviors who do not meet full diagnostic criteria for ADHD. As noted 
previously, these programs do not require a specific diagnosis to be beneficial to the family. 
The previous guideline discussed the diagnosis of problem-level concerns on the basis of the 
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Primary Care (DSM-PC), Child and Adolescent 
Version,49 and made suggestions for treatment and care. The DSM-PC was published in 
1995, however, and it has not been revised to be compatible with the DSM-5. Therefore, the 
DSM-PC cannot be used as a definitive source for diagnostic codes related to ADHD and 
comorbid conditions, although it can be used conceptually as a resource for enriching the 
understanding of problem-level manifestations.

In the evaluation of a child or adolescent for ADHD, the PCC should include a process to at 
least screen for comorbid conditions, including emotional or behavioral conditions (eg, 
anxiety, depression, oppositional defiant disorder, conduct disorders, substance use), 
developmental conditions (eg, learning and language disorders, autism spectrum disorders), 
and physical conditions (eg, tics, sleep apnea) (Table 4). (Grade B: strong recommendation.)

The majority of both boys and girls with ADHD also meet diagnostic criteria for another 
mental disorder.17,18 A variety of other behavioral, developmental, and physical conditions 
can be comorbid in children and adolescents who are evaluated for ADHD, including 
emotional or behavioral conditions or a history of these problems. These include but are not 
limited to learning disabilities, language disorder, disruptive behavior, anxiety, mood 
disorders, tic disorders, seizures, autism spectrum disorder, developmental coordination 
disorder, and sleep disorders.50–66 In some cases, the presence of a comorbid condition will 
alter the treatment of ADHD.

The SDBP is developing a clinical practice guideline to support clinicians in the diagnosis of 
treatment of “complex ADHD,” which includes ADHD with comorbid developmental 
and/or mental health conditions.67

Special Circumstances: Adolescents (Age 12 Years to the 18th Birthday)

At a minimum, clinicians should assess adolescent patients with newly diagnosed ADHD for 
symptoms and signs of substance use, anxiety, depression, and learning disabilities. As 
noted, all 4 are common comorbid conditions that affect the treatment approach. These 
comorbidities make it important for the clinician to consider sequencing psychosocial and 
medication treatments to maximize the impact on areas of greatest risk and impairment 
while monitoring for possible risks such as stimulant abuse or suicidal ideation.

KAS 4

ADHD is a chronic condition; therefore, the PCC should manage children and adolescents 
with ADHD in the same manner that they would children and youth with special health care 
needs, following the principles of the chronic care model and the medical home (Table 5). 
(Grade B: strong recommendation.)

As in the 2 previous guidelines, this recommendation is based on the evidence that for many 
individuals, ADHD causes symptoms and dysfunction over long periods of time, even into 
adulthood. Available treatments address symptoms and function but are usually not curative. 
Although the chronic illness model has not been specifically studied in children and 
adolescents with ADHD, it has been effective for other chronic conditions, such as asthma.68 
In addition, the medical home model has been accepted as the preferred standard of care for 
children with chronic conditions.69

The medical home and chronic illness approach may be particularly beneficial for parents 
who also have ADHD themselves. These parents can benefit from extra support to help them 
follow a consistent schedule for medication and behavioral programs.

Authors of longitudinal studies have found that ADHD treatments are frequently not 
maintained over time13 and impairments persist into adulthood.70 It is indicated in 
prospective studies that patients with ADHD, whether treated or not, are at increased risk for 
early death, suicide, and increased psychiatric comorbidity, particularly substance use 
disorders.71,72 They also have lower educational achievement than those without ADHD73,74 
and increased rates of incarceration.75–77 Treatment discontinuation also places individuals 
with ADHD at higher risk for catastrophic outcomes, such as motor vehicle crashes78,79; 
criminality, including drug-related crimes77 and violent reoffending76; depression71; 
interpersonal issues80; and other injuries.81,82

To continue providing the best care, it is important for a treating pediatrician or other PCC to 
engage in bidirectional communication with teachers and other school personnel as well as 
mental health clinicians involved in the child or adolescent’s care. This communication can 
be difficult to achieve and is discussed in both the PoCA and the section on systemic barriers 
to the care of children and adolescents with ADHD in the Supplemental Information, as is 
the medical home model.69

Special Circumstances: Inattention or Hyperactivity/Impulsivity (Problem 

Level)

Children with inattention or hyperactivity/impulsivity at the problem level, as well as their 
families, may also benefit from the chronic illness and medical home principles.

Recommendations for the Treatment of Children and Adolescents With 

ADHD: KAS 5a, 5b, and 5c

Recommendations vary depending on the patient’s age and are presented for the following 
age ranges:

a.

b.

c.

preschool-aged children: age 4 years to the sixth birthday;

elementary and middle school–aged children: age 6 years to the 12th birthday; 
and

adolescents: age 12 years to the 18th birthday.

The KASs are presented, followed by information on medication, psychosocial treatments, 
and special circumstances.

KAS 5a

For preschool-aged children (age 4 years to the sixth birthday) with ADHD, the PCC should 
prescribe evidence-based behavioral PTBM and/or behavioral classroom interventions as the 
first line of treatment, if available (grade A: strong recommendation). Methylphenidate may 
be considered if these behavioral interventions do not provide significant improvement and 
there is moderate-to-severe continued disturbance in the 4-through 5-year-old child’s 
functioning. In areas in which evidence-based behavioral treatments are not available, the

clinician needs to weigh the risks of starting medication before the age of 6 years against the 
harm of delaying treatment (Table 6). (Grade B: strong recommendation.)

A number of special circumstances support the recommendation to initiate PTBM as the first 
treatment of preschool-aged children (age 4 years to the sixth birthday) with ADHD.25,83 
Although it was limited to children who had moderate-to-severe dysfunction, the largest 
multisite study of methylphenidate use in preschool-aged children revealed symptom 
improvements after PTBM alone.83 The overall evidence for PTBM among preschoolers is 
strong.

PTBM programs for preschool-aged children are typically group programs and, although 
they are not always paid for by health insurance, they may be relatively low cost. One 
evidence-based PTBM, parent-child interaction therapy, is a dyadic therapy for parent and 
child. The PoCA contains criteria for the clinician’s use to assess the quality of PTBM 
programs. If the child attends preschool, behavioral classroom interventions are also 
recommended. In addition, preschool programs (such as Head Start) and ADHD-focused 
organizations (such as CHADD84) can also provide behavioral supports. The issues related 
to referral, payment, and communication are discussed in the section on systemic barriers in 
the Supplemental Information.

In areas in which evidence-based behavioral treatments are not available, the clinician needs 
to weigh the risks of starting methylphenidate before the age of 6 years against the harm of 
delaying diagnosis and treatment. Other stimulant or nonstimulant medications have not 
been adequately studied in children in this age group with ADHD.

For elementary and middle school–aged children (age 6 years to the 12th birthday) with 
ADHD, the PCC should prescribe US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)–approved 
medications for ADHD, along with PTBM and/or behavioral classroom intervention 
(preferably both PTBM and behavioral classroom interventions). Educational interventions 
and individualized instructional supports, including school environment, class placement, 
instructional placement, and behavioral supports, are a necessary part of any treatment plan 
and often include an Individualized Education Program (IEP) or a rehabilitation plan (504 
plan) (Table 7). (Grade A: strong recommendation for medications; grade A: strong 
recommendation for PTBM training and behavioral treatments for ADHD implemented with 
the family and school.)

The evidence is particularly strong for stimulant medications; it is sufficient, but not as 
strong, for atomoxetine, extended-release guanfacine, and extended-release clonidine, in that 
order (see the Treatment section, and see the PoCA for more information on 
implementation).

For adolescents (age 12 years to the 18th birthday) with ADHD, the PCC should prescribe 
FDA-approved medications for ADHD with the adolescent’s assent (grade A: strong 
recommendation). The PCC is encouraged to prescribe evidence-based training interventions

and/or behavioral interventions as treatment of ADHD, if available. Educational 
interventions and individualized instructional supports, including school environment, class 
placement, instructional placement, and behavioral supports, are a necessary part of any 
treatment plan and often include an IEP or a rehabilitation plan (504 plan) (Table 8). (Grade 
A: strong recommendation.)

Transition to adult care is an important component of the chronic care model for ADHD. 
Planning for the transition to adult care is an ongoing process that may culminate after high 
school or, perhaps, after college. To foster a smooth transition, it is best to introduce 
components at the start of high school, at about 14 years of age, and specifically focus 
during the 2 years preceding high school completion.

Psychosocial Treatments

Some psychosocial treatments for children and adolescents with ADHD have been 
demonstrated to be effective for the treatment of ADHD, including behavioral therapy and 
training interventions.24–26,85 The diversity of interventions and outcome measures makes it 
challenging to assess a meta-analysis of psychosocial treatment’s effects alone or in 
association with medication treatment. As with medication treatment, the long-term positive 
effects of psychosocial treatments have yet to be determined. Nonetheless, ongoing 
adherence to psychosocial treatment is a key contributor to its beneficial effects, making 
implementation of a chronic care model for child health important to ensure sustained 
adherence.86

Behavioral therapy involves training adults to influence the contingencies in an environment 
to improve the behavior of a child or adolescent in that setting. It can help parents and 
school personnel learn how to effectively prevent and respond to adolescent behaviors such 
as interrupting, aggression, not completing tasks, and not complying with requests. 
Behavioral parent and classroom training are well-established treatments with preadolescent 
children.25,87,88 Most studies comparing behavior therapy to stimulants indicate that 
stimulants have a stronger immediate effect on the 18 core symptoms of ADHD. Parents, 
however, were more satisfied with the effect of behavioral therapy, which addresses 
symptoms and functions in addition to ADHD’s core symptoms. The positive effects of 
behavioral therapies tend to persist, but the positive effects of medication cease when 
medication stops. Optimal care is likely to occur when both therapies are used, but the 
decision about therapies is heavily dependent on acceptability by, and feasibility for, the 
family.

Training interventions target skill development and involve repeated practice with 
performance feedback over time, rather than modifying behavioral contingencies in a 
specific setting. Less research has been conducted on training interventions compared to 
behavioral treatments; nonetheless, training interventions are well-established treatments to 
target disorganization of materials and time that are exhibited by most youth with ADHD; it 
is likely that they will benefit younger children, as well.25,89 Some training interventions, 
including social skills training, have not been shown to be effective for children with 
ADHD.25

Some nonmedication treatments for ADHD-related problems have either too little evidence 
to recommend them or have been found to have little or no benefit. These include 
mindfulness, cognitive training, diet modification, EEG biofeedback, and supportive 
counseling. The suggestion that cannabidiol oil has any effect on ADHD is anecdotal and 
has not been subjected to rigorous study. Although it is FDA approved, the efficacy for 
external trigeminal nerve stimulation (eTNS) is documented by one 5-week randomized 
controlled trial with just 30 participants receiving eTNS.90 To date, there is no long-term 
safety and efficacy evidence for eTNS. Overall, the current evidence supporting treatment of 
ADHD with eTNS is sparse and in no way approaches the robust strength of evidence 
documented for established medication and behavioral treatments for ADHD; therefore, it 
cannot be recommended as a treatment of ADHD without considerably more extensive study 
on its efficacy and safety.

Special Circumstances: Adolescents

Much less research has been published on psychosocial treatments with adolescents than 
with younger children. PTBM has been modified to include the parents and adolescents in 
sessions together to develop a behavioral contract and improve parent-adolescent 
communication and problem-solving (see above).91 Some training programs also include 
motivational interviewing approaches. The evidence for this behavioral family approach is 
mixed and less strong than PTBM with preadolescent children92–94 Adolescents’ responses 
to behavioral contingencies are more varied than those of younger children because they can 
often effectively obstruct behavioral contracts, increasing parent-adolescent conflict.

Training approaches that are focused on school functioning skills have consistently revealed 
benefits for adolescents.95–97 The greatest benefits from training interventions occur when 
treatment is continued over an extended period of time, performance feedback is 
constructive and frequent, and the target behaviors are directly applicable to the adolescent’s 
daily functioning.

Overall, behavioral family approaches may be helpful to some adolescents and their 
families, and school-based training interventions are well established.25,94 Meaningful 
improvements in functioning have not been reported from cognitive behavioral approaches.

Medication for ADHD

Preschool-aged children may experience increased mood lability and dysphoria with 
stimulant medications.83 None of the nonstimulants have FDA approval for use in 
preschool-aged children. For elementary school–aged students, the evidence is particularly 
strong for stimulant medications and is sufficient, but less strong, for atomoxetine, extended-
release guanfacine, and extended-release clonidine (in that order). The effect size for 
stimulants is 1.0 and for nonstimulants is 0.7. An individual’s response to methylphenidate 
verses amphetamine is idiosyncratic, with approximately 40% responding to both and about 
40% responding to only 1. The subtype of ADHD does not appear to be a predictor of 
response to a specific agent. For most adolescents, stimulant medications are highly effective 
in reducing ADHD’s core symptoms.73

Stimulant medications have an effect size of around 1.0 (effect size = [treatment M − control 
M)/control SD]) for the treatment of ADHD.98 Among nonstimulant medications, 1 
selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, atomoxetine,99,100 and 2 selective α-2 
adrenergic agonists, extended-release guanfacine101,102 and extended-release clonidine,103 
have also demonstrated efficacy in reducing core symptoms among school-aged children and 
adolescents, although their effect sizes, —around 0.7 for ah 3, are less robust than that of 
stimulant medications. Norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors and α-2 adrenergic agonists are 
newer medications, so, in general, the evidence base supporting them is considerably less 
than that for stimulants, although it was adequate for FDA approval.

A free list of the currently available, FDA-approved medications for ADHD is available 
online at www.ADHDMedicationGuide.com. Each medication’s characteristics are provided 
to help guide the clinician’s prescription choice. With the expanded list of medications, it is 
less likely that PCCs need to consider the off-label use of other medications. The section on 
systemic barriers in the Supplemental Information provides suggestions for fostering more 
realistic and effective payment and communication systems.

Because of the large variability in patients’ response to ADHD medication, there is great 
interest in pharmacogenetic tools that can help clinicians predict the best medication and 
dose for each child or adolescent. At this time, however, the available scientific literature 
does not provide sufficient evidence to support their clinical utility given that the genetic 
variants assayed by these tools have generally not been fully studied with respect to 
medication effects on ADHD-related symptoms and/or impairment, study findings are 
inconsistent, or effect sizes are not of sufficient size to ensure clinical utility.104–109 For that 
reason, these pharmacogenetics tools are not recommended. In addition, these tests may cost 
thousands of dollars and are typically not covered by insurance. For a pharmacogenetics tool 
to be recommended for clinical use, studies would need to reveal (1) the genetic variants 
assayed have consistent, replicated associations with medication response; (2) knowledge 
about a patient’s genetic profile would change clinical decision-making, improve outcomes 
and/or reduce costs or burden; and (3) the acceptability of the test’s operating characteristics 
has been demonstrated (eg, sensitivity, specificity, and reliability).

Stimulants’ most common short-term adverse effects are appetite loss, abdominal pain, 
headaches, and sleep disturbance. The Multimodal Treatment of Attention Deficit 
Hyperactivity Disorder (MTA) study results identified stimulants as having a more persistent 
effect on decreasing growth velocity compared to most previous studies.110 Diminished 
growth was in the range of 1 to 2 cm from predicted adult height. The results of the MTA 
study were particularly noted among children who were on higher and more consistently 
administered doses of stimulants.110 The effects diminished by the third year of treatment, 
but no compensatory rebound growth was observed.110 An uncommon significant adverse 
effect of stimulants is the occurrence of hallucinations and other psychotic symptoms.111

Stimulant medications, on average, increase patient heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP) 
to a mild and clinically insignificant degree (average increases: 1–2 beats per minute for HR 
and 1–4 mm Hg for systolic and diastolic BP).112 However, because stimulants have been

linked to more substantial increases in HR and BP in a subset of individuals (5%–15%), 
clinicians are encouraged to monitor these vital signs in patients receiving stimulant 
treatment.112 Although concerns have been raised about sudden cardiac death among 
children and adolescents using stimulant and medications,113 it is an extremely rare 
occurrence. In fact, stimulant medications have not been shown to increase the risk of 
sudden death beyond that observed in children who are not receiving stimulants.114–118 
Nevertheless, before initiating therapy with stimulant medications, it is important to obtain 
the child or adolescent’s history of specific cardiac symptoms in addition to the family 
history of sudden death, cardiovascular symptoms, Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, 
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and long QT syndrome. If any of these risk factors are 
present, clinicians should obtain additional evaluation to ascertain and address potential 
safety concerns of stimulant medication use by the child or adolescent.112,114

Among nonstimulants, the risk of serious cardiovascular events is extremely low, as it is for 
stimulants. The 3 nonstimulant medications that are FDA approved to treat ADHD (ie, 
atomoxetine, guanfacine, and clonidine) may be associated with changes in cardiovascular 
parameters or other serious cardiovascular events. These events could include increased HR 
and BP for atomoxetine and decreased HR and BP for guanfacine and clonidine. Clinicians 
are recommended to not only obtain the personal and family cardiac history, as detailed 
above, but also to perform additional evaluation if risk factors are present before starting 
nonstimulant medications (ie, perform an electrocardiogram [ECG] and possibly refer to a 
pediatric cardiologist if the ECG is not normal).112

Additional adverse effects of atomoxetine include initial somnolence and gastrointestinal 
tract symptoms, particularly if the dosage is increased too rapidly, and decreased appetite.
119–122 Less commonly, an increase in suicidal thoughts has been found; this is noted by an 
FDA black box warning. Extremely rarely, hepatitis has been associated with atomoxetine. 
Atomoxetine has also been linked to growth delays compared to expected trajectories in the 
first 1 to 2 years of treatment, with a return to expected measurements after 2 to 3 years of 
treatment, on average. Decreases were observed among those who were taller or heavier 
than average before treatment.123

For extended-release guanfacine and extended-release clonidine, adverse effects include 
somnolence, dry mouth, dizziness, irritability, headache, bradycardia, hypotension, and 
abdominal pain.30,124,125 Because rebound hypertension after abrupt guanfacine and 
clonidine discontinuation has been observed,126 these medications should be tapered off 
rather than suddenly discontinued.

Adjunctive Therapy

Adjunctive therapies may be considered if stimulant therapy is not fully effective or limited 
by side effects. Only extended-release guanfacine and extended-release clonidine have 
evidence supporting their use as adjunctive therapy with stimulant medications sufficient to 
have achieved FDA approval.127 Other medications have been used in combination on an 
off-label basis, with some limited evidence available to support the efficacy and safety of 
using atomoxetine in combination with stimulant medications to augment treatment of 
ADHD.128

Special Circumstances: Preschool-Aged Children (Age 4 Years to the Sixth Birthday)

If children do not experience adequate symptom improvement with PTBM, medication can 
be prescribed for those with moderate-to-severe ADHD. Many young children with ADHD 
may require medication to achieve maximum improvement; methylphenidate is the 
recommended first-line pharmacologic treatment of preschool children because of the lack 
of sufficient rigorous study in the preschool-aged population for nonstimulant ADHD 
medications and dextroamphetamine. Although amphetamine is the only medication with 
FDA approval for use in children younger than 6 years, this authorization was issued at a 
time when approval criteria were less stringent than current requirements. Hence, the 
available evidence regarding dextroamphetamine’s use in preschool-aged children with 
ADHD is not adequate to recommend it as an initial ADHD medication treatment at this 
time.80

No nonstimulant medication has received sufficient rigorous study in the preschool-aged 
population to be recommended for treatment of ADHD of children 4 through 5 years of age.

Although methylphenidate is the ADHD medication with the strongest evidence for safety 
and efficacy in preschool-aged children, it should be noted that the evidence has not yet met 
the level needed for FDA approval. Evidence for the use of methylphenidate consists of 1 
multisite study of 165 children83 and 10 other smaller, single-site studies ranging from 11 to 
59 children, for a total of 269 children.129 Seven of the 10 single-site studies revealed 
efficacy for methylphenidate in preschoolers. Therefore, although there is moderate evidence 
that methylphenidate is safe and effective in preschool-aged children, its use in this age 
group remains on an “off-label” basis.

With these caveats in mind, before initiating treatment with medication, the clinician should 
assess the severity of the child’s ADHD. Given current data, only preschool-aged children 
with ADHD and moderate-to-severe dysfunction should be considered for medication. 
Severity criteria are symptoms that have persisted for at least 9 months; dysfunction that is 
manifested in both home and other settings, such as preschool or child care; and dysfunction 
that has not responded adequately to PTBM.83

The decision to consider initiating medication at this age depends, in part, on the clinician’s 
assessment of the estimated developmental impairment, safety risks, and potential 
consequences if medications are not initiated. Other considerations affecting the treatment of 
preschool-aged children with stimulant medications include the lack of information and 
experience about their longer-term effects on growth and brain development, as well as the 
potential for other adverse effects in this population. It may be helpful to obtain consultation 
from a mental health specialist with specific experience with preschool-aged children, if 
possible.

Evidence suggests that the rate of metabolizing methylphenidate is slower in children 4 
through 5 years of age, so they should be given a low dose to start; the dose can be increased 
in smaller increments. Maximum doses have not been adequately studied in preschool-aged 
children.83

Special Circumstances: Adolescents (Age 12 Years to the 18th Birthday)

As noted, before beginning medication treatment of adolescents with newly diagnosed 
ADHD, clinicians should assess the patient for symptoms of substance use. If active 
substance use is identified, the clinician should refer the patient to a subspecialist for 
consultative support and guidance.2,130–134

In addition, diversion of ADHD medication (ie, its use for something other than its intended 
medical purposes) is a special concern among adolescents.135 Clinicians should monitor the 
adolescent’s symptoms and prescription refill requests for signs of misuse or diversion of 
ADHD medication, including by parents, classmates, or other acquaintances of the 
adolescent. The majority of states now require prescriber participation in prescription drug 
monitoring programs, which can be helpful in identifying and preventing diversion activities. 
They may consider prescribing nonstimulant medications that minimize abuse potential, 
such as atomoxetine and extended-release guanfacine or extended-release clonidine.

Given the risks of driving for adolescents with ADHD, including crashes and motor vehicle 
violations, special concern should be taken to provide medication coverage for symptom 
control while driving.79,136,137 Longer-acting or late-afternoon, short-acting medications 
may be helpful in this regard.138

Special Circumstances: Inattention or Hyperactivity/Impulsivity (Problem Level)

Medication is not appropriate for children whose symptoms do not meet DSM-5 criteria for 
ADHD. Psychosocial treatments may be appropriate for these children and adolescents. As 
noted, psychosocial treatments do not require a specific diagnosis of ADHD, and many of 
the studies on the efficacy of PTBM included children who did not have a specific 
psychiatric or ADHD diagnosis.

Combination Treatments

Studies indicate that behavioral therapy has positive effects when it is combined with 
medication for preadolescent children.139 (The combined effects of training interventions 
and medication have not been studied.)

In the MTA study, researchers found that although the combination of behavioral therapy 
and stimulant medication was not significantly more effective than treatment with 
medication alone for ADHD’s core symptoms, after correcting for multiple tests in the 
primary analysis,139 a secondary analysis of a combined measure of parent and teacher 
ratings of ADHD symptoms did find a significant advantage for the combination, with a 
small effect of d = 0.28.140 The combined treatment also offered greater improvements on 
academic and conduct measures, compared to medication alone, when the ADHD was 
comorbid with anxiety and the child or adolescent lived in a lower socioeconomic 
environment.

In addition, parents and teachers of children who received combined therapy reported that 
they were significantly more satisfied with the treatment plan. Finally the combination of

medication management and behavioral therapy allowed for the use of lower stimulant 
dosages, possibly reducing the risk of adverse effects.141

School Programming and Supports

Encouraging strong family-school partnerships helps the ADHD management process.142 
Psychosocial treatments that include coordinating efforts at school and home may enhance 
the effects.

Children and adolescents with ADHD may be eligible for services as part of a 504 
Rehabilitation Act Plan (504 plan) or special education IEP under the “other health 
impairment” designation in the Individuals with Disability Education Act (IDEA).143 
(ADHD qualifies as a disability under a 504 plan. It does not qualify under an IEP unless its 
severity impairs the child’s ability to learn. See the PoCA for more details.) It is helpful for 
clinicians to be aware of the eligibility criteria in their states and school districts to advise 
families of their options. Eligibility decisions can vary considerably between school 
districts, and school professionals’ independent determinations might not agree with the 
recommendations of outside clinicians.

There are essentially 2 categories of school-based services for students with ADHD. The 
first category includes interventions that are intended to help the student independently meet 
age-appropriate academic and behavioral expectations. Examples of these interventions 
include daily report cards, training interventions, point systems, and academic remediation 
of skills. If successful, the student’s impairment will resolve, and the student will no longer 
need services.

The second category is intended to provide changes in the student’s program so his or her 
ADHD-related problems no longer result in failure and cause distress to parents, teachers, 
and the student.144 These services are referred to as “accommodations” and include 
extended time to complete tests and assignments, reduced homework demands, the ability to 
keep study materials in class, and provision of the teacher’s notes to the student. These 
services are intended to allow the student to accomplish his work successfully and 
communicate that the student’s impairment is acceptable. Accommodations make the 
student’s impairment acceptable and are separate from interventions aimed at improving the 
students’ skills or behaviors. In the absence of such interventions, long-term 
accommodations may lead to reduced expectations and can lead to the need for 
accommodations to be maintained throughout the student’s education.

Encouraging strong family-school partnerships helps the ADHD management process, and 
addressing social determinants of health is essential to these partnerships.145,146 
Psychosocial treatments that include coordinating efforts at school and home may enhance 
the effects.

The PCC should titrate doses of medication for ADHD to achieve maximum benefit with 
tolerable side effects (Table 9). (Grade B: strong recommendation.)

The MTA study is the landmark study comparing effects of methylphenidate and behavioral 
treatments in children with ADHD. Investigators compared treatment effects in 4 groups of 
children who received optimal medication management, optimal behavioral management, 
combined medication and behavioral management, or community treatment. Children in the 
optimal medication management and combined medication and behavioral management 
groups underwent a systematic trial with 4 different doses of methylphenidate, with results 
suggesting that when this full range of doses is administered, more than 70% of children and 
adolescents with ADHD are methylphenidate responders.140

Authors of other reports suggest that more than 90% of patients will have a beneficial 
response to 1 of the psychostimulants if a range of medications from both the 
methylphenidate and amphetamine and/or dextroamphetamine classes are tried.147 Of note, 
children in the MTA study who received care in the community as usual, either from a 
clinician they chose or to whom their family had access, showed less beneficial results 
compared with children who received optimal medication management. The explanation 
offered by the study investigators was that the community treatment group received lower 
medication doses and less frequent monitoring than the optimal medication management 
group.

A child’s response to stimulants is variable and unpredictable. For this reason, it is 
recommended to titrate from a low dose to one that achieves a maximum, optimal effect in 
controlling symptoms without adverse effects. Calculating the dose on the basis of 
milligrams per kilogram has not usually been helpful because variations in dose have not 
been found to be related to height or weight In addition, because stimulant medication 
effects are seen rapidly, titration can be accomplished in a relatively short time period. 
Stimulant medications can be effectively titrated on a 7-day basis, but in urgent situations, 
they may be effectively titrated in as few as 3 days.140

Parent and child and adolescent education is an important component in the chronic illness 
model to ensure cooperation in efforts to achieve appropriate titration, remembering that the 
parents themselves may be significantly challenged by ADHD.148,149 The PCC should alert 
parents and children that changing medication dose and occasionally changing a medication 
may be necessary for optimal medication management, may require a few months to achieve 
optimal success, and that medication efficacy should be monitored at regular intervals.

By the 3-year (ie, 36-month) follow-up to the MTA interventions, there were no differences 
among the 4 groups (ie, optimal medications management, optimal behavioral management, 
a combination of medication and behavioral management, and community treatment). This 
equivalence in poststudy outcomes may, however, have been attributable to convergence in 
ongoing treatments received for the 4 groups. After the initial 14-month intervention, the 
children no longer received the careful monthly monitoring provided by the study and went 
back to receiving care from their community providers; therefore, they all effectively 
received a level of ongoing care consistent with the “community treatment” study arm of the 
study. After leaving the MTA trial, medications and doses varied for the children who had 
been in the optimal medication management or combined medication and behavioral 
management groups, and a number stopped taking ADHD medication. On the other hand,

some children who had been in the optimal behavioral management group started taking 
medication after leaving the trial. The results further emphasize the need to treat ADHD as a 
chronic illness and provide continuity of care and, where possible, provide a medical home.

The PCC, if trained or experienced in diagnosing comorbid conditions, may initiate 
treatment of such conditions or make a referral to an appropriate subspecialist for treatment. 
After detecting possible comorbid conditions, if the PCC is not trained or experienced in 
making the diagnosis or initiating treatment, the patient should be referred to an appropriate 
subspecialist to make the diagnosis and initiate treatment (Table 10). (Grade C: 
recommendation.)

The effect of comorbid conditions on ADHD treatment is variable. In some cases, treatment 
of the ADHD may resolve the comorbid condition. For example, treatment of ADHD may 
lead to improvement in coexisting aggression and/or oppositional defiant, depressive, or 
anxiety symptoms.150,151

Sometimes, however, the comorbid condition may require treatment in addition to the 
ADHD treatment. If the PCC is confident of his or her ability to diagnose and treat certain 
comorbid conditions, the PCC may do so. The PCC may benefit from additional consultative 
support and guidance from a mental health subspecialist or may need to refer a child with 
ADHD and comorbid conditions, such as severe mood or anxiety disorders, to subspecialists 
for assessment and management. The subspecialists could include child and adolescent 
psychiatrists, clinical child psychologists, developmental-behavioral pediatricians, 
neurodevelopmental disability physicians, child neurologists, or child- or school-based 
evaluation teams.

IMPLEMENTATION: PREPARING THE PRACTICE

It is generally the role of the primary care pediatrician to manage mild-to-moderate ADHD, 
anxiety, depression, and substance use. The AAP statement “The Future of Pediatrics: 
Mental Health Competencies for Pediatric Primary Care” describes the competencies needed 
in both pediatric primary and specialty care to address the social-emotional and mental 
health needs of children and families.152 Broadly, these include incorporating mental health 
content and tools into health promotion, prevention, and primary care intervention, 
becoming knowledgeable about use of evidence-based treatments, and participating as a 
team member and comanaging with pediatric and mental health specialists.

The recommendations made in this guideline are intended to be integrated with the broader 
mental health algorithm developed as part of the AAP Mental Health Initiatives.2,133,153 
Pediatricians have unique opportunities to identify conditions, including ADHD, intervene 
early, and partner with both families and specialists for the benefit of children’s health. A 
wealth of useful information is available at the AAP Mental Health Initiatives Web site

Tips-For-Pediatricians.aspx).

It is also important for PCCs to be aware of health disparities and social determinants that 
may impact patient outcomes and strive to provide culturally appropriate care to all children 
and adolescents in their practice.145,146,154,155

The accompanying PoCA provides supplemental information to support PCCs as they 
implement this guideline’s recommendations. In particular, the PoCA describes steps for 
preparing the practice that provide useful recommendations to clinicians. For example, the 
PoCA includes information about using standardized rating scales to diagnose ADHD, 
assessing for comorbid conditions, documenting all aspects of the diagnostic and treatment 
procedures in the patient’s records, monitoring the patient’s treatment and outcomes, and 
providing families with written management plans.

The AAP acknowledges that some PCCs may not have the training, experience, or resources 
to diagnose and treat children and adolescents with ADHD, especially if severity or 
comorbid conditions make these patients complex to manage. In these situations, 
comanagement with specialty clinicians is recommended. The SDBP is developing a 
guideline to address such complex cases and aid pediatricians and other PCCs to manage 
these cases; the SDBP currently expects to publish this document in 2019.67

AREAS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH

There is a need to conduct research on topics pertinent to the diagnosis and treatment of 
ADHD, developmental variations, and problems in children and adolescents in primary care. 
These research opportunities include the following:

•

•

•

•

•

•

assessment of ADHD and its common comorbidities: anxiety, depression, 
learning disabilities, and autism spectrum disorder;

identification and/or development of reliable instruments suitable for use in 
primary care to assess the nature or degree of functional impairment in children 
and adolescents with ADHD and to monitor improvement over time;

refinement of developmentally informed assessment procedures for evaluating 
ADHD in preschoolers;

study of medications and other therapies used clinically but not FDA approved 
for ADHD;

determination of the optimal schedule for monitoring children and adolescents 
with ADHD, including factors for adjusting that schedule according to age, 
symptom severity, and progress reports;

evaluation of the effectiveness and adverse effects of medications used in 
combination, such as a stimulant with an α-adrenergic agent, selective serotonin 
reuptake inhibitor, or atomoxetine;

diagnosed at preschool ages; and

implementation of these guidelines and the PoCA.

CONCLUSIONS

Evidence is clear with regard to the legitimacy of the diagnosis of ADHD and the 
appropriate diagnostic criteria and procedures required to establish a diagnosis, identify 
comorbid conditions, and effectively treat with both psychosocial and pharmacologic 
interventions. The steps required to sustain appropriate treatments and achieve successful 
long-term outcomes remain challenging, however.

As noted, this clinical practice guideline is supported by 2 accompanying documents 
available in the Supplemental Information: the PoCA and the article on systemic barriers to 
the car of children and adolescents with ADHD. Full implementation of the guideline’s 
KASs, the PoCA, and the recommendations to address barriers to care may require changes 
in office procedures and the identification of community resources. Fully addressing 
systemic barriers requires identifying local, state, and national entities with which to partner 
to advance solutions and manifest change.156
