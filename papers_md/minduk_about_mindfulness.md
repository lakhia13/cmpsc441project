- About mindfulness

Many people find practising mindfulness helps them manage their day-to-day wellbeing. But it doesn't always work for everyone.

Our information could help you decide whether it's something you'd like to try.

This page covers:

- How could mindfulness help me?

- How does mindfulness work?

- Can mindfulness help treat mental health problems?

- Is mindfulness right for me?

- What if mindfulness doesn't work for me?

This page is part of our guide to:

Mindfulness is a skill. It requires work like any therapy, and requires practice like any skill. It isn't a shortcut and courses only set the scene, but I find it enjoyable and rewarding. Most of all I find it brings some peace into my life.


## How could mindfulness help me?


Mindfulness aims to help you:

- Become more self-aware

- Feel calmer and less stressed

- Feel more able to choose how to respond to your thoughts and feelings

- Cope with difficult or unhelpful thoughts

- Be kinder towards yourself


## How does mindfulness work?


Mindfulness works by taking your focus to the present moment and away from other thoughts.

The way we think, and what we think about, can affect how we feel and act. For example, if you think or worry a lot about upsetting past or future events, you might often feel sad or anxious.

It's understandable to want to stop thinking about difficult things. But trying to get rid of upsetting thoughts can often make us think about them even more.

The theory behind mindfulness is that by using various techniques to bring your attention to the present, you can:

- Notice how thoughts come and go in your mind.You may learn that they don't have to define who you are, or your experience of the world, and that you can let them come and go.

- Notice what your body is telling you.For example, you might feel tension or anxiety in your body, such as a fast heartbeat, tense muscles or shallow breathing.

- Create space between you and your thoughts.With this space, you may be able to reflect on the situation and react more calmly.

For more information on how mindfulness works, see theOxford Mindfulness website. This organisation also providesonline mindfulness sessions.

I've learnt to be there with those bad feelings, experience them non-judgmentally, without letting them carry me away. I know that they will pass.


## Can mindfulness help treat mental health problems?


Studies show that practising mindfulness can help to manage mental health problems likedepression,anxietyand feelings ofstress.

There's some evidence that mindfulness could help with other mental health problems, such aspsychosisandbipolar disorder. But more research is needed in this area.

You might find mindfulness very helpful. Or you might feel like it doesn't work or makes you feel worse. It's important to do what works for you and your mental health.

You can also talk to your doctor about what kinds of treatments might suit you best. You might find trying mindfulness is useful while waiting to receive other types of treatment.

In some cases, theNational Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE)recommends some structured mindfulness-based therapies which have been developed to treat mental health problems.

However, NICE does not recommend using mindfulness-based treatments for social anxiety. This is because there's not enough evidence that it's effective.

For more information about social anxiety see our page onanxiety disorders.


## Is mindfulness right for me?


Although anyone can try it, being mindful isn't always easy to do. It can take practice, and might not be right for everyone. There's a lot of information available about mindfulness. It can feel overwhelming or confusing.


### Practical considerations


It might help to think about the following before you try mindfulness:

- How do I want to learn mindfulness?There's lots of ways to learn mindfulness. They won't all suit everyone. For more information about your options, see our page onhow and where to learn mindfulness.

- How much will it cost?Many everydaymindfulness exercisesare free to do, but formal courses, apps and learning materials may cost money.

- Can I fit this practice into my life?It's helpful to practise mindfulness regularly. Think about what times might work best for you. If you're attending a mindfulness course, you might also have to travel to weekly sessions, which can be demanding.


### Wellbeing considerations


For your physical and mental health, it might help to think about the following before trying mindfulness:

- Are the exercises safe for me to do?Some may involve sitting still for long periods of time and focusing on your breath. This might not be suitable for everyone. For example, if you have mobility issues or breathing problems. Talk to your GP or a trained mindfulness teacher if you have any concerns.

- Am I prepared to acknowledge my difficult thoughts?This can sometimes be distressing and could make you feel worse at first. If you find the exercises hard to do, then it's best to get advice from a trained professional.

- Is mindfulness the right tool for my problems?Mindfulness tends to be quite a general wellbeing tool. If you want to work on a specific issue, you might find a more focused treatment helps more. But you might find it useful to try mindfulness while waiting to receive another treatment.

- Am I well enough to start something new right now?If you're feeling very unwell, trying to learn a new skill might feel overwhelming. You might need more treatment and support in place before you can begin.

Mindfulness emerged as a powerful tool in my arsenal, enabling me to stay present and aware of how my body and emotions were responding.


## What if mindfulness doesn't work for me?


Although some people find mindfulness helpful, not everyone does. Mindfulness might not be the best option for you. Or it might help you at some times and not others. If you've tried something and it hasn't helped, it's important not to blame yourself.

Looking after your mental health can be really difficult, especially when you're not feeling well. It can take time and may not be straightforward. But many people find that with the right combination of treatments, self-care and support, it is possible to feel better.

For other options you can explore, see our pages onhow to improve your mental wellbeingandseeking help for a mental health problem.

I am not saying Mindfulness is a magic wand, or even that it will help everyone, but it does help me to understand that thoughts are not facts.
