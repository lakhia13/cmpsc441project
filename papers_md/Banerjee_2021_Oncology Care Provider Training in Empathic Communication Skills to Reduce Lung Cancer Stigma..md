BACKGROUND: Despite the clinical importance of assessing smoking history and advising
patients who smoke to quit, patients with lung cancer often experience feelings of blame and
stigma during clinical encounters with their oncology care providers (OCPs). Promoting
empathic communication during these encounters may help reduce patients’ experience of
stigma and improve related clinical outcomes. This paper presents the evaluation of OCP-
and patient-reported data on the usefulness of an OCP-targeted empathic communication
skills (ECS) training to reduce the stigma of lung cancer and improve communication.
RESEARCH QUESTION: What is the impact of the ECS intervention on OCPs’ communication
skills uptake and patient-reported outcomes (lung cancer stigma, satisfaction with commu-
nication, and perceived OCP empathy)?

METHODS: Study subjects included 30 multidisciplinary OCPs treating patients with lung
cancer who participated in a 2.25 h ECS training. Standardized Patient Assessments were
conducted prior to and following training to assess ECS uptake among OCPs. In addition, of a
planned 180 patients who currently or formerly smoked (six unique patients per OCP [three
pretraining, three posttraining]), 175 patients (89 pretraining, 86 posttraining) completed post-
OCP visit surveys eliciting feedback on the quality of their interaction with their OCP.

RESULTS: OCPs exhibited an overall increase in use of empathic communication skills
[t(28) ¼ –2.37; P < .05], stigma-mitigating skills [t(28) ¼ –3.88; P < .001], and breadth of
communication skill use [t(28) ¼ –2.91; P < .01]. Patients reported signiﬁcantly higher
overall satisfaction with communication post-ECS training, compared with pretraining
[t(121) ¼ 2.15; P ¼ .034; Cohen d ¼ 0.35]. There were no signiﬁcant differences from
pretraining to posttraining for patient-reported stigma or perceived OCP empathy.

INTERPRETATION: Empathy-based, stigma-reducing communication may lead to improved
assessments of tobacco use and smoking cessation for patients with smoking-related cancers.
These ﬁndings support the dissemination and further testing of a new ECS model for training
OCPs in best practices for assessment of smoking history and engagement of patients who
currently smoke in tobacco treatment delivery.

Stigma, the experience and internalization of negative
appraisal and devaluation from others, is increasingly
recognized as a threat to the delivery of high-quality care
for patients diagnosed with lung cancer.1,2 The
prominent social scientist Erving Goffman deﬁned
stigma as a “characteristic that designates an individual
as socially devalued.”3 Stigma evokes different emotions
(eg, disgust, fear, anger) and may motivate people to
form or bolster stigma attitudes.4 Due to the association
between lung cancer and smoking, patients diagnosed
with lung cancer often face stigmatizing societal
attitudes1; this is particularly true for those who
currently or formerly smoked.5 The majority of patients
with lung cancer report experiencing stigma,2 and nearly
one-half (48%) report having experienced stigma during
clinical encounters with their oncology care providers
(OCPs), particularly during discussions about smoking.2

Practice guidelines for smoking cessation recommend
routine assessment of smoking status, cessation advice,
and referral or assistance to tobacco treatment.6
However, adoption of these practices in oncology care
has been inconsistent, and patient engagement has been
low.7 Despite the clinical importance of promoting
smoking cessation in the context of cancer care,8,9 there
is a growing concern that routine assessment of smoking
and providing cessation advice may elicit perceived and
internalized lung cancer stigma, resulting in the
unintended consequence of patient avoidance of seeking
tobacco cessation support.1,10 Lung cancer stigma may
also be triggered when clinicians miss or ignore patient-
initiated statements that provide an opportunity for the
clinician to respond empathically.11-14

Among different types of empathic opportunities, the
following three types are particularly relevant to
smoking-related conversations between OCPs and
patients with lung cancer who currently or formerly
smoked: (1) emotion (statement of an affective state; for
example, “I am scared about this diagnosis”); (2)
challenge (statement of barriers related/unrelated to
cancer; for example, “I have tried but haven’t been able

to quit smoking”); and (3) progress (statement of
improvement in condition/quality of life or positive
event; for example, “I have not touched a cigarette in
4 months”).14-16

Each of these provides an opportunity for the OCP to
respond empathically. For instance, when patients
with lung cancer express negative emotions (eg, guilt,
self-blame), OCPs can respond empathically by
normalizing nicotine addiction (eg, “You started
smoking when you were a teenager without full
appreciation for nicotine addiction and the harms of
smoking. It was also a different time when smoking
was much more widespread and acceptable”). They
can also validate patient struggle with tobacco
dependence (eg, “Nicotine is a powerful addiction, and
I understand quitting smoking is not easy”), while
providing a clear recommendation for quitting (eg, “I
recommend that you meet with a counselor to help
with quitting”), emphasizing the beneﬁts of quitting
(eg, “Quitting smoking can improve your cancer
treatment and outcomes”), and expressing a
willingness to help (eg, “I will put in a referral for you
to see a counselor, and they will help you through this
process of quitting”). Responses such as these can help
provide empathy to patients who currently or formerly
smoked.

Our earlier work described the critical need for OCPs to be
trained in communicating empathically with patients who
have lung cancer.1,12,16 Facilitating greater empathic
communication may be particularly important for
improving clinical care, given that patients with lung
cancer frequently experience feelings of blame, shame, and
guilt when OCPs adhere to clinical practice guidelines6 for
routine assessment of smoking history.1,2,11

Communicating empathically with patients is beneﬁcial
for promoting patients’ health17 and engagement with
care.18 Pehrson et al19 deﬁned the goal of empathic
communication as “to recognize or elicit and respond to
patients’ empathic opportunities to communicate
understanding, alleviate distress, and provide support.”
Although several deﬁnitions of empathy exist, we chose
this deﬁnition because it is most pertinent to the clinical
encounter. Neumann et al20 proposed that empathic
communication leads patients to disclose more
information, which results in two pathways to better
outcomes: affective-oriented effects and cognitive/
behavioral-oriented effects. Although the cognitive/
behavioral-intended effects are likely, we focused on
affective-oriented effects as they are relevant for

examining patient-reported stigma. The model theorizes
that the affective-oriented effects of clinical empathy
lead to short-term and intermediate outcomes related to
feeling listened to, valued, understood, and accepted;
that their experiences are valid and normal; and that the
isolation of the illness is bridged.

In an effort to develop an OCP-focused intervention to
reduce stigma, we created an Empathic
Communication Skills (ECS) training module that
focuses on the communication challenges present in
OCPs’ discussions of smoking history with lung cancer
patients.21 The ECS training module was adapted from
prior work19 and was based on focus groups with lung
cancer survivors, recruited via the Go2 Foundation for
Lung Cancer. The focus groups revealed that
stigmatizing interactions with OCPs were common,
and patients provided detailed narrative descriptions of
stigmatizing interactions.22 These descriptions
included repeated unexplained questioning about
smoking behavior (different medical professionals
questioning the patients about smoking; for example,
“.you’re constantly asked the question, ‘Did you

ECS Training

The goal of this 2.25 h ECS training was to enhance clinician recognition
and responsiveness to empathic opportunities with patients with lung
cancer by communicating understanding, alleviating stigma and
distress, and providing support. ECS training was guided by an
established communication skills training model24 developed at MSK
with seven recommended communication strategies: agenda setting,

smoke?’ by every medical professional you come in
contact with”), disbelieving the patient (not believing
the patient is telling the truth; for example, “Well,
you’re still smoking, right? You’re sneaking some
cigarettes”), and blaming statements about smoking
behavior (critical, judgmental presumptions; for
example, “Well, you wouldn’t get lung cancer if you
didn’t smoke”). Participants also suggested
communication preferences based on their experiences
with OCPs. These suggestions helped guide the
development of effective empathic communication
strategies for reducing lung cancer stigma.21

Additional details about ECS training module
development and OCP-reported training appraisal and
self-efﬁcacy have been published elsewhere, with the
results showing that the ECS training was feasible and
acceptable.21 The current study examined the efﬁcacy of
the ECS intervention on OCPs’ communication skills
uptake and patient-reported outcomes (lung cancer
stigma, satisfaction with communication, and perceived
OCP empathy).

opportunity, shared understanding of the patient’s emotion/experience,
empathic responding, coping and connection to social support, and
closing the conversation. The didactic training content was followed
by experiential role-play exercises with standardized patients (trained
actors). In addition, all OCP participants completed Standardized
Patient Assessments (SPAs), one prior to and one following training.
An SPA involved video-recording of an interaction (up to 12 mins)
between the OCP and the standardized patient portraying two distinct
clinical scenarios; standardized scripts were used.

Coding

Two trained coders (T. J. W. and C. M. M.), blinded to the prestatus or
poststatus of the SPA, coded all the SPA videos using the Comskil
Coding System24 adapted within the context of taking a smoking
history. Intercoder agreement was assessed at the beginning of coding
and at the midpoint by double coding 10% of data. Due to the large
number of possible codes for any interaction and the variable units of
analyses, a time-chunk method24 was used to determine intercoder
agreement; we assessed coders’ percent agreement on 15 s blocks of a
12 min interaction. Following each intercoder agreement, we assessed
for percent agreement, resolved all disagreements via a third coder (S. C.
B.), and continued with coding only when $ 75% agreement was achieved.

Measures

Our evaluation included both OCP and patient-reported outcomes. The
primary outcome was ECS training skill uptake for participating OCPs
(based on SPAs). Secondary outcomes included patient-reported OCP
empathy, satisfaction with communication, and lung cancer stigma
(Table 1). All pretraining data were collected within 2 months prior to
the training, ECS training skill uptake (ie, posttraining SPA) data were
collected immediately following training, and posttraining patient-
reported data were collected within 6 months of training.

questioning, information organization, empathic communication, and
stigma-mitigating skills. The use of skills was scored dichotomously
(absence/presence), and a sum score was computed for the six skill
categories and a total sum score to represent breadth of skills used
(possible range, 0-23).

Perceived OCP Empathy: Perceived OCP empathy was measured by
using the Consultation and Relational Empathy Questionnaire, a well-
validated, 10-item self-report scale that measures patients’ perception
of how empathic their OCP was during a speciﬁc encounter.25 This
measure is rated on a six-point Likert response scale (0 ¼ poor, 5 ¼
excellent). Items were summed, and a higher score indicated greater
OCP empathy (pretraining, mean ¼ 49.3, SD ¼ 2.0, Cronbach a ¼
0.79; posttraining, mean ¼ 49.6, SD ¼ 1.6, Cronbach a ¼ 0.89).

Satisfaction With OCP Communication: Satisfaction with
communication was measured by using the Consumer Assessment of
Health Care Providers and Systems Program.26 Patients responded to
six items focused around satisfaction with different aspects of OCP-
patient communication on a four-point Likert response scale (1 ¼
never, 4 ¼ always).
Items were summed, and a higher score
indicated greater satisfaction with OCP communication (pretraining,
mean ¼ 23.5, SD ¼ 1.4, Cronbach a ¼ 0.87; posttraining, mean ¼
23.9; SD ¼ 0.40; Cronbach a ¼ 0.50).

Lung Cancer Stigma: Lung cancer stigma was measured by using the
Lung Cancer Stigma Inventory.27 This 25-item scale includes three
subscales, creating by summing respective scores: internalized stigma

(pretraining, mean ¼ 24.3, SD ¼ 10.5, Cronbach a ¼ 0.74;
posttraining, mean ¼ 24.2, SD ¼ 11.3, Cronbach a ¼ 0.66),
perceived stigma (pretraining, mean ¼ 16.8, SD ¼ 6.6, Cronbach
a ¼ 0.89; posttraining, mean ¼ 15.8, SD ¼ 5.1, Cronbach a ¼ 0.92),
and constrained disclosure (pretraining, mean ¼ 11.6, SD ¼ 5.2,
Cronbach a ¼ 0.75; posttraining, mean ¼ 10.5, SD ¼ 5.4, Cronbach
a ¼ 0.78). Items are rated on a ﬁve-point Likert scale (1 ¼ not at
all, 5 ¼ extremely), and a total score was created by summing all items.

Descriptive Results

Across the 30 OCPs trained, 89 unique patients were
surveyed pretraining and another 86 unique patients
posttraining. All OCPs completed a posttraining SPA,
with one OCP missing a pretraining SPA. OCPs were
roughly equally distributed among medical doctors
(n ¼ 8 [27%]), advanced practice providers (n ¼ 11
[37%]), and nurses (n ¼ 11 [37%]). Demographic
characteristics of patients surveyed pretraining did not
signiﬁcantly differ from those surveyed posttraining,
except that patients in the posttraining group were

signiﬁcantly more likely to be male (n ¼ 41, 46% male
participants in pretraining; n ¼ 53, 62% male
participants in posttraining; P ¼ .039). Table 1
presents the demographic characteristics of OCPs and
patients, overall and according to group (ie,

aCohen d: small (0.2), medium (0.5), large (0.8).

Secondary Results: Patient-Reported Outcomes

Perceived OCP Empathy and Satisfaction With
Communication: OCP empathy scores were high
pretraining (mean ¼ 49.3 of maximum 50; SD ¼ 2.0),
and thus there was no signiﬁcant difference in perceived
OCP empathy from pretraining to posttraining (P >
.05). Overall satisfaction with communication was
higher at posttraining, compared with pretraining (t ¼
2.15, P ¼ .034, d ¼ 0.35), particularly with OCPs
explaining things in a way that was easy to understand
(t ¼ 2.42, P ¼ .017, d ¼ 0.37) and the OCP knowing
important information about the patient’s medical
history (t ¼ 2.17, P ¼ .032, d ¼ 0.34) (Table 3).

Lung Cancer Stigma: There were no statistically
signiﬁcant differences in stigma scores from pretraining
to posttraining assessments (all, P > .05), although effect

sizes indicate that lung cancer stigma assessed
posttraining was lower than stigma assessed pretraining
(Cohen d for differences in stigma scores ranged from
–0.01 to –0.21) (Table 3).

Post Hoc Analysis

Of the 15 patients who reported current smoking, one
(of six) at pretraining and three (of nine) at posttraining
accepted a referral to the smoking cessation program at
MSK.

Discussion
Research has shown that stigma is a prevalent,
clinically important psychosocial problem for patients
with lung cancer and that OCPs may inadvertently
trigger stigma during routine assessment of smoking

history. The current article presents ﬁndings from the
ﬁrst OCP-focused intervention designed to enhance
empathic communication and reduce stigma among
patients with lung cancer in the context of OCPs taking
a routine assessment of smoking history. The ECS
training was successful in demonstrating
communication skill uptake by OCPs, particularly for
empathic communication and stigma-mitigating skills.
These ﬁndings advance our previous research showing
that communication skills can be learned28 and also
suggest that OCPs can adopt empathic and stigma-
mitigating skills in their routine clinical assessment of
smoking behavior and advisement of cessation in
cancer care.8 Short- and long-term effects of empathic
and stigma-mitigating skills may have beneﬁts for
patients with lung cancer and need to be examined
further. Although the numbers are small, the amount
of participants who reported current smoking and
subsequently accepted referral to the smoking cessation
program at posttraining (three of nine) compared with
pretraining (one of six) indicates potential for ECS
training to improve patient engagement in tobacco
treatment services. A planned randomized clinical trial
with larger sample size and greater representation of
patients who currently smoke will enable examination
of this important outcome.

ECS training can target stigma mitigation through
empathic communication, as shown by the effectiveness
measurements in both OCPs and patients.
Improvement in several salient communication skills,
particularly empathic communication, and stigma-
mitigating skills was evident for OCPs conducting
smoking-related assessments. Although the results
revealed signiﬁcant pretraining to posttraining
differences in lung cancer patients’ satisfaction with
OCP communication, perceived empathy and lung
cancer stigma as measured at the patient level did not
differ signiﬁcantly. Several possibilities exist for these
null ﬁndings.

Patients reported high empathy scores for their
respective OCPs, indicating a possible ceiling effect. All
the OCPs were recruited from a single, large
comprehensive cancer center with a longstanding
institutional commitment to promoting excellence in
communication skills.29 Conducting qualitative
interviews with patients following their clinical
interaction may provide more in-depth information
about patient experience and communication with their
respective OCPs.27

Similarly, there were no statistically signiﬁcant
posttraining differences in lung cancer stigma, although
effect sizes were consistent with a reduction in two
components of stigma (perceived stigma and
constrained disclosure). It is plausible that over time,
multiple encounters with OCPs who are routinely
practicing ECS would mitigate high levels of lung cancer
stigma. It is also possible that complementary, multilevel
stigma-reducing interventions targeting patients, their
social network, and society would be most effective in
reducing patients’ experience of lung cancer stigma.
Psychosocial support interventions that target
internalized stigma in combination with OCP-focused
ECS training may be most appropriate for patients who
experience high levels of lung cancer stigma.

Effects of ECS training on patient-reported outcomes
were limited and only evident for posttraining
differences in satisfaction with communication. In a
larger clinical trial, it would be helpful to examine
improvements in other domains of OCP-patient
interaction, including trust in OCP and higher patient
activation. Subsequent larger trials with adequate
number of patients who currently smoke should
examine whether ECS training improves acceptance of
referral for evidence-based tobacco treatment and
cessation outcomes among patients with lung cancer
who currently smoke.

This study was conducted at a single comprehensive
cancer center in the northeast United States that has a
well-established communication skills training and
research laboratory dedicated to improving the quality
of clinical communication. As such, the results may not
be generalizable to other cancer centers or community
oncology settings. In addition, the patient population
was primarily White and reported a high level of
socioeconomic status, and caution is warranted
regarding generalizing the ﬁndings more broadly. This
study involved a one-time assessment of patient
outcomes. However, it may be beneﬁcial to assess patient
experience repeatedly given that lung cancer stigma may
ﬂuctuate over time. We limited our assessment of ECS
training on patient outcomes to quantitative measures
only. Studies relying on quantitative measurement of
patient outcomes of communication skills trainings
often show ceiling effects,28 and qualitative assessments
are needed to better understand the full impact of ECS
training on the lung cancer patient health-care
experiences. Finally, to reduce burden, no demographic
characteristics were assessed for OCPs. Future studies

should collect data on OCP characteristics to better
understand clinician variation in empathic
communication skills.

Conclusions
Research indicates that perceived stigma within medical
encounters, particularly triggered by routine assessment
of smoking, is frequently reported and problematic for
lung cancer patients’ well-being and quality of cancer
care.2 Given that OCPs exhibited signiﬁcant
improvements in the uptake of several communication
skills from pretraining to posttraining, and that patient-
reported satisfaction with communication was
signiﬁcantly higher at posttraining compared with
pretraining, promoting empathic OCP communication
is a promising intervention target to help improve lung
cancer patients’ satisfaction with communication and
clinical care. These ﬁndings provide a foundation for
further development and testing of a national model for

training thoracic OCPs (and all key members of the
OCP team) in best communication practices for both
assessment of smoking history and engagement of
patients who currently smoke in tobacco treatment
delivery.

Given that persistent smoking is associated with
poor clinical outcomes,30 it is essential that OCPs
exhibit competent and empathic communication
regarding the nature of nicotine dependence and the
importance of smoking cessation for tobacco-
dependent cancer patients, particularly for those
diagnosed with lung and other smoking-related
cancers. Our promising ﬁndings support the
feasibility of conducting ECS with OCPs and suggest
that empathic communication is a modiﬁable
intervention target that requires further testing for
mitigating the impact of stigma experienced during
clinical encounters.8,9
