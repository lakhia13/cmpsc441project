### What is loneliness?


We all experience feelings oflonelinessor isolation from time to time, but when loneliness is severe or lasts a long time, this can negatively affect our mental health.

Being lonely for a long time can lead to a negative spiral: loneliness makes it harder to connect, which leads to people being afraid of social situations, meaning it is harder to find joy in life and escape negative thoughts.

In ourLoneliness UK report 2022we found that loneliness is different for everybody, so there is no one way that we all experience loneliness. Some people can be alone and not feel lonely, while others can be surrounded by people and feel lonely.
