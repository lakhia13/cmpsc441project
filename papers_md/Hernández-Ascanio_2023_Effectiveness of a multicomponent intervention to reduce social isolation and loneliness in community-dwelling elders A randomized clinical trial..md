Abstract

Aims: To assess the effect of a multicomponent intervention on reducing social iso-

lation  and  loneliness  and  improving  the  quality  of  life  in  community- dwelling  older 

adults.

Design: A cluster- randomized controlled clinical trial.

Methods:  A  total  of  56  older  adults  participated  in  the  control  group  and  63  older 

adults in the experimental group. The intervention consisted of 6 home- based face- 

to- face sessions, intercalated with 5 telephone calls and was conducted by nursing 

students and volunteer staff with experience in the subject. The study was conducted 

between April 2018 and December 2019. In terms of statistical analysis, several pro-

cedures were carried out: a statistical analysis per protocol and intention to treat, con-

sidering isolation, loneliness and quality of life as endpoints; a comparison of paired 

means, to analyse the behaviour of the outcome variables at baseline and the end of 

the study; and finally, a binary logistic regression analysis, considering social support 

as a dependent variable.

Results: The study results do not show the effectiveness of the modified CARELINK 

programme, analysed as a whole, on the decrease in social isolation or loneliness or 

the improvement in HRQL. However, a detailed analysis of the behaviour of some of 

the variables during the study indicates some results that deserve to be commented 

on. Comparing the mean confidential support scores between the experimental and 

control group at the initial and final stages shows significant differences in the analysis 

by protocol, and close to statistical significance in the analysis by intention to treat. 

Comparing the paired means obtained in the experimental group, an improvement in 

emotional loneliness scores was found. Finally, the variables associated with the social 

support  of  the  subjects  at  the  end  of  the  follow- up  period  were  as  follows:  having 

people who help them and mobility.

Conclusion: Although the results obtained do not allow us to affirm that the interven-

tion programme is effective, these same results point to improved confidential sup-

port and emotional loneliness in older adults participating in the intervention. Having 

people to help them and a greater degree of mobility are factors favouring the de-

crease in social isolation.

Impact:  This  study  suggested  that  modified  CARELINK,  a  multicomponent  inter-

vention  performed  by  trained  volunteers,  could  improve  confidential  support  in 

community- dwelling  older  adults.  It  also  reports  the  importance  of  considering  the 

level of mobility and support networks as determinants of the improvement caused 

by the intervention.
