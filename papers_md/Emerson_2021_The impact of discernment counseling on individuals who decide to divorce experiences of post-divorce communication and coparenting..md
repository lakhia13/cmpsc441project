Abstract
Discernment counseling is designed to help couples con-

sidering divorce arrive at a greater sense of clarity and con-

fidence in their decision making about the future of their 

marriage.  Possible  outcomes  include  making  no  change 

to  the  marriage,  divorcing,  or  attempting  reconciliation 

through  couples  therapy.  To  date,  no  research  has  been 

done on whether or not discernment counseling helps cou-

ples  who  decide  to  divorce  with  their  post-divorce  fam-

ily  life  (i.e.,  coparenting).  We  surveyed  11  people  (from 

male–female  couples)  and  conducted  in-depth  interviews 

with  eight  who  had  undergone  discernment  counseling 

and  subsequently  divorced  to  see  what  impact  discern-

ment  counseling  had  on  their  post-divorce  coparenting 

relationship. We analyzed the data from a phenomenologi-

cal  perspective.  Respondents  described  their  discernment 

counseling  experience  as  helpful  for  achieving  clarity 

and honesty in the divorce decision-making process, they 

shared their appreciation for the structure of the interven-

tion, and indicated that it led to a greater coparental coop-

eration post-divorce.

INTRODUCTION

There is a general agreement that about half of all first marriages in the United States will end in di-
vorce and approximately 67% of second and subsequent marriages will as well (Amato, 2000, 2010; 
Copen et al., 2012; Kreider & Ellis, 2011). Divorce is a common occurrence in American families 
and its causes and impacts have been thoroughly researched (Amato, 2000, 2010). Divorce decision 
making, or divorce ideation, is a less researched topic but has garnered more attention lately (Hawkins 
et al., 2017). Couples who decide to divorce are often unable to make a divorce decision with clarity 
and confidence (Harris et al., 2017). The discernment counseling protocol was developed to help these 
couples in their divorce decision-making process (Doherty & Harris, 2017; Doherty et al., 2016). The 
current  study  investigates  the  perceived  impact  that  discernment  counseling  has  on  the  process  of 
divorce and the coparenting relationships of individuals who divorce.

Coparenting and divorce

Research suggests that at least 1 000 000 children are affected by divorce every year in the United 
States (Fagan & Churchill, 2012; McBroom, 2011). Additionally, there is an ample literature suggest-
ing that divorce can negatively impact adults and children in numerous ways (Amato, 2000, 2005; 
Cui et al., 2011; Konstam, 2009; Thomas & Woodside, 2011; Wallerstein & Lewis, 2004), including 
weakened parent–child and extended family relationships due to less frequent contact, exposure to 
parental conflict, and loss of emotional support and financial resources (Amato, 2000, 2010; Fagan 
& Churchill, 2012).

But divorce itself does not necessarily lead to all these negative outcomes in every divorce sce-
nario  (Strohschein,  2007);  rather,  when  parents  exhibit  ongoing  conflict,  that  is  when  divorce  and 
the associated transitions it can introduce, become even more detrimental to the children involved. 
Therefore, whether coparents stay married or not may not always be as important as the quality of their 
coparenting relationship for their child's continued cognitive, emotional, and physical development 
(Strohschein, 2007). Understanding the dynamics of divorce and coparenting is imperative because 
any changes in these processes may influence the outcomes associated with divorce adjustment for 
children (Ahrons, 1994; Clarke-Stewart & Brentano, 2006).

Research about divorce outcomes not only shows its possible negative effects but also highlights 
the  importance  of  maintaining  quality,  cooperative  post-divorce  coparent  relationships  to  benefit 
children's  adjustment,  and  ongoing  development  during  and  after  the  divorce  transition  (Ahrons, 
1994, 2006; Bonach, 2005; Sigal et al., 2011). While there are variations in how these relationships 
function between different parents and within families, the most cooperative coparenting relation-
ships are characterized by a high level of mutual support between coparents for one another's house-
hold rules, disciplinary practices, and daily routines (Clarke-Stewart & Brentano, 2006; Feinberg, 
2002).  Researchers  consistently  show  that  high-quality,  cooperative  coparent  relationships  are  an 
important mediator of some of the potentially negative outcomes of divorce (Ahrons, 1994, 2006; 
Amato, 2000, 2010). However, developing a quality, cooperative coparent relationship after divorce

can be difficult for some former marriage partners due to the hostile and acrimonious nature of the 
divorce process.

Discernment counseling

Discernment counseling is a relationship-focused treatment protocol for couples on the brink of di-
vorce. It is specifically targeted toward engaging “mixed-agenda” couples (Doherty & Harris, 2017) 
where one partner is leaning-in to the relationship and the other is either leaning-out or ambivalent 
about whether or not to stay in the marriage. The goal of discernment counseling is to help mixed-
agenda couples arrive at greater clarity and confidence in making a decision about the future direction 
of their relationship, based on a deeper understanding of the marital dynamics and each person's con-
tributions to the problems (Doherty & Harris, 2017). In discernment counseling, clients are presented 
with three paths to aid them in their decision making. Path 1 is called the status quo path, meaning 
continuing in the relationship as things have been. Path 2 is called the divorce path. Path 3 is referred 
to as the reconciliation path where partners agree to take divorce off the table and commit to couples 
therapy for at least 6 months to see if they can, together, increase the health of the marriage (Doherty 
& Harris, 2017; Doherty et al., 2016).

When  the  couple,  or  one  member  of  the  couple,  arrives  at  clarity  around  a  decision  to  divorce 
(path 2), discernment counseling is over and the couple is guided on how to proceed with separation/
divorce with the least amount of conflict or contention. Here, couples explore the decision to divorce 
more thoroughly and determine mutually agreed upon principles that will guide the couple during the 
divorce process (i.e., to treat each other with civility, to not talk poorly of a parent to the children, etc.). 
By helping both partners cope with the reality of this decision, and map out how they desire to see the 
process unfold, the discernment counselor helps them proceed on a more cooperative and constructive 
divorce trajectory (Doherty & Harris, 2017). Obviously, a decision to divorce can be challenging for 
all people involved, but it is possible that the discernment counseling process might help divorcing 
couples  have  a  better  divorce  and  perhaps  a  higher  quality  of  coparenting  relationship  afterwards. 
Doherty and Harris (2017) suggest that future research should investigate whether divorcing partners 
who undergo discernment counseling have healthier divorce outcomes than couples that do not re-
ceive discernment counseling:

Discernment counseling can lead to better healing after divorce for all parties involved…
[and] can lead to better choices about both ending the marriage and moving ahead as 
parents…[and] can diminish the kind of anxious attachment that keeps ex-spouses pre-
occupied with one another. (p. 122–123).

Exploring the experiences of people who participate in discernment counseling and ultimately decide 
to  divorce  may  contribute  to  the  emerging  research  on  discernment  counseling  and  to  a  better  under-
standing of how to positively influence or enhance the quality of post-divorce coparent relationships. We 
wanted to pursue answers to the following general questions:

1.  How  do  divorcing  partners  describe  their  experience  of  discernment  counseling  generally?
2.  How do divorcing partners describe any impact that discernment counseling had on their experi-

ence of the divorce process?

3.  How  do  divorcing  partners  describe  any  impact  that  discernment  counseling  had  on  their  post-

divorce coparent relationship?

METH ODS

We  approached  these  research  questions  with  a  phenomenological  lens.  This  analytic  approach  is 
designed to cast light on individuals' subjective views of their world experiences and it emphasizes 
the meaning-making processes that affect an individual's perceptions of future events and interactions 
in their lived experiences (Creswell, 2014; Savin-Baden & Major, 2013). Through analysis of textual 
and interview data gathered from both open-ended questions in an initial screening survey and in-
depth interviews, the researchers explored themes that emerged from participants' descriptions of their 
experiences  of  discernment  counseling,  divorce,  and  coparenting.  Phenomenological  research  pre-
sumes that meaning is shaped through individuals' experiences in the world and knowledge is gained 
through a systematic reflection on one's conceptual consciousness (Savin-Baden & Major, 2013). A 
phenomenological lens allows researchers to explore complex constructs through individuals' con-
crete experiences and the meaning they create for each of them. Specifically, the present research is 
based on the work of van Manen (1990, 2007) in the hermeneutic school of phenomenology.

Researcher reflexivity

Before describing the study and results, it is important that we provide some background on why this 
topic is meaningful to us and how our own experiences have shaped this work to reduce bias in our 
interactions with the data and other stages of this project. Each one of us has experience with divorce, 
either at a personal or a professional level, as well as with families that are managing the challenges 
associated with divorce transitions. The lead author works with children of divorce clinically and has 
seen the impact of healthy versus dysfunctional coparenting in the lives of her clients. The second 
author has clinical experience with discernment counseling, is among the first clinicians trained in 
this model, and is developing a research agenda around this approach's effectiveness in a variety of 
settings. The third author is beginning a master's program in marriage and family therapy and has 
attended an initial training in the discernment counseling model. Each researcher is interested in help-
ing families through the transitions associated with divorce. We understand that our clinical interests 
have shaped this study and we have tried to let the data speak for those we interviewed as opposed to 
us interpreting the data through lenses informed by the value we see in this clinical approach. We did 
this through a thorough review of the results with one another and member checking activities with 
the people we interviewed.

Sample

We (the lead researcher and members of the research team) invited 77 individuals who had undergone 
discernment counseling through the Minnesota Couples on the Brink Project and had decided to pur-
sue divorce, to complete an online screening survey (see supplemental file S1). All participants had 
received discernment counseling services from the creators of the model. At the time services were 
initially provided to this sample, these clinicians were meeting every other week to discuss cases, co-
ordinate service delivery, and make minor changes to the discernment counseling protocol. Because 
of this, we are confident that couples in our sample received a representative sampling of discernment 
counseling. Participants had to meet the following inclusion criteria to be interviewed: (a) they had 
to be pursuing or have completed the legal divorce process; (b) they had to be parents of children; 
and (c) they had to be willing to complete a 1-hour in-depth interview. From this initial invitation, we

received 11 completed survey responses with eight respondents indicating a willingness to participate 
in further in-depth interviews. As the initial survey included places for respondents to briefly share 
something about their experiences of discernment counseling and with coparenting after divorce, this 
information was included in the final thematic analysis of all the textual data collected for the study 
(initial survey responses plus interview transcripts from the eight in-depth interviews).

Each individual's participation in this study was voluntary and participants were informed of their 
right to withdraw from any portion of the research at any time without penalty. Participants who com-
pleted the in-depth interview were compensated with a $20 gift card. The lead researcher contacted 
participants  at  four  different  points  in  the  research  process  as  follows:  (a)  participants  received  an 
email with the research invitation to divorced partners with an accompanying survey link; (b) par-
ticipants who agreed to being selected for the in-depth interview were contacted via their preferred 
method of communication to schedule the interview; (c) participants completed the telephone, video, 
or face-to-face interview; and (d) participants were contacted for follow-up member checking proce-
dures according to the phenomenological approach.

We followed an interview script (supplemental file S2) to ensure standard procedures and to facil-
itate detailed responses from each participant about their experience of the discernment counseling 
intervention, the legal divorce process, and their coparent relationship. The interviews were conducted 
by the lead researcher via telephone and each lasted about 1 hour. All interviews were audio-recorded, 
transcribed, and audited to ensure accuracy.

Data analysis

Following  the  hermeneutic  phenomenological  methods  proposed  by  van  Manen  (1990,  2007),  we 
conducted a thematic content analysis of the textual data obtained from participants about their dis-
cernment  counseling  and  coparenting  experiences.  There  are  six  research  activities  central  to  the 
hermeneutic phenomenological approach, including (a) looking at a phenomenon which is interesting 
and commits the researcher to the world; (b) investigating experience as it is lived (rather than con-
ceptualized); (c) reflecting on the essential themes that characterize the phenomenon; (d) describing 
the phenomenon by writing and re-writing; (e) maintaining a pedagogical relationship with the phe-
nomenon; and (f) balancing the research context by considering it related to the parts and the whole 
(Savin-Baden & Major, 2013).

To increase the trustworthiness of the present study, we conducted member-checking procedures, 
triangulated the data, and utilized two additional coders for interrater reliability in the data analysis 
phase (Creswell, 2014; Savin-Baden & Major, 2013). For member-checking, we provided all inter-
view participants a copy of their transcript to review the content for accuracy and offered them the op-
portunity to revise or amend any portions of their responses. All participants confirmed the accuracy 
of their interview transcripts prior to analyses. Additionally, the confirmability of the present research 
is enhanced by the triangulation of multiple sources of information. This included comparing partic-
ipants' responses from the initial survey, the interview, and from the follow-up member-checking and 
interrater reliability procedures. Furthermore, we recruited two additional doctoral students to review 
the interview transcripts and conduct independent coding procedures. The lead researcher made field 
notes throughout each interview, analyzing and assigning codes and themes to each in-depth interview 
at three separate stages: (a) immediately following the interview, (b) after transcription with the cod-
ing team, and (c) final review with the coding team.

We allowed themes to emerge from the data based on the specific language used by participants as 
well as from the textual meanings that are ascribed to certain statements and phrases. Each question

was designed to help participants consider their real-life experience of the intervention as well as how 
it impacted their divorce process and coparenting interactions with their former spouse. Immediately 
following each in-depth interview, we attached initial codes to describe the overall essence and mean-
ing participants drew from their discernment counseling experiences. In the next phase of data analy-
sis, we had all interviews transcribed. All text files were reviewed and compared to the audio files for 
accuracy. The textual data allowed us to utilize the iterative cycle of writing and re-writing to describe 
the phenomenon being studied.

The lead researcher conducted deliberate independent coding procedures for each interview tran-
script in addition to requesting the same of each member of the coding team. Codes were assigned 
based on the content of participants' responses, their descriptive language, and the overall meaning 
they drew from their discernment counseling, divorce, and coparenting experiences. Reliability pro-
cedures began with the lead researcher and the coding team reading and re-reading each transcript 
to generate a complete list of codes for participants' interviews. Next, the lead researcher compiled a 
complete list of all possible codes generated independently by the lead researcher and the coding team 
for group comparison and discussion. We then discussed each possible code or theme, reflecting on 
how it was supported in the textual data, how common it was among the sample, and how each related 
to the current research questions. Then, the lead researcher conducted a final selection of three themes 
and three subthemes to represent how divorcing partners describe their experience of the discernment 
counseling intervention. After a full and final review, we determined that the data obtained in this 
research offered appropriate data saturation to support the final themes that were selected.

RESULTS

Demographic  information  on  all  participants  is  contained  in  Table  1.  On  average,  participants  at-
tended  3.5  discernment  counseling  sessions.  The  majority  of  the  research  participants  (9/11;  82%) 
reported that their former spouse was the initiator of the decision for divorce. Only two (18%) re-
ported they were the partner who chose divorce. Overall, the sample was mostly White/Non-Hispanic 
women who were mothers, with a relatively high level of education with moderate to high annual 
household incomes. Lastly, most participants (7/11; 64%) characterized their post-divorce relation-
ships with their former spouses as cooperative in some aspects. Although not specifically assessed, 
we are confident that the individuals in this sample were divorced from male–female marriages as 
that configuration was the most often seen by the discernment counselors. Only six couples out of the 
approximately 200 served by the clinicians during this time period identified as same sex couples and 
none of them indicated a willingness to divorce after completing discernment counseling.

Three major themes emerged from the data regarding participants' experiences. Participants de-
scribed (a) achieving clarity and honesty, (b) appreciation for the structure of the intervention, and (c) 
coparent cooperation post-divorce. The first major theme, achieving clarity and honesty, was the most 
common to emerge from the data. The second and third major themes were slightly less common but 
both were still strongly represented.

Achieving clarity and honesty

The  most  common  theme  to  emerge  from  participants'  responses  was  that  discernment  counseling 
provided these individuals with a sense of clarity and honesty. For example, Cara1, a 43-year-old fe-
male participant who was married for 4 years, indicated that “discernment counseling helped provide 

EMERSON Et al. 
 
|  43

clarity to me in a time where I was in a state of shock and everything felt murky.” Holly, a 37-year-
old woman with three children, stated that “it was helpful to get clearer about what each one of us 
wanted…which was helpful for having some support in this process of figuring out what to do next.” 
Jan, a 56-year-old mother of two emphasized the idea that before attending discernment counseling, 
she was not clear about the future direction of the relationship. She reported feeling ambivalent about 
the idea of divorce but that the discernment counseling sessions were helpful. Furthermore, she indi-
cated that she and her ex-husband were “finally able to have the opportunity to be truthful about their 
intentions and desires” for the future direction of their relationship.

This theme was apparent in all participants' responses and three related subthemes were found: 
(a) the intervention helped partners with acceptance and resolution about the decision to divorce, (b) 
it provided partners a forum to express things that needed to be said, but which they were unable to 
articulate before discernment counseling, and (c) it helped them see their own contributions to their 
marital problems and gave them something to consider changing about themselves.

Discernment counseling provided participants a sense of 
acceptance and resolution

This subtheme was the most common. All participants indicated that discernment counseling helped 
them accept the fact that divorce was a possibility and that it had helped them arrive at resolution 
about that decision. Jan mentioned because she “was able to give him a forum to say what he needed 
to say [that he] had not been saying at home…she was able to accept the finality of his decision in 
a better way.” Further supporting this theme, Tom, a 59-year-old father of one said, “I realized we 
had drifted irreparably apart. And I just realized that…and started to accept what our new function 
would be as coparents.” Another participant, Cara, said she began to “accept that he wasn't really 
willing to address his issues.” She described how this realization led her to a place of understanding 
that “divorce was inevitable in [their] situation.”

Andy, a 39-year-old man married for 12 years, indicated that his partner was the initiator of the de-
cision to divorce, and described his discernment counseling experience as “a painful process” but also 
mentioned that he came to a place of acceptance and resolution about the fact that his former spouse 
was not willing to work on the marriage at all. He said this experience helped him to move forward 
in the divorce process and that he “eventually learned to accept and even agreed with her decision to 
end the marriage.” Another participant, Lauren, a 36-year-old woman, divorced after 13 years of mar-
riage, echoed a similar idea about finding resolution as she described a “natural progression” between 
herself and her former spouse saying that even though it was his decision, she “eventually accepted 
and agreed with his decision to get a divorce.” Regardless of how participants remembered their dis-
cernment counseling experience and however much pain or confusion they may have felt at the time, 
they all mentioned that it brought them acceptance and resolution throughout their divorce process.

Discernment counseling was a forum to say what needed to be said

Almost all participants said discernment counseling was a forum to express their thoughts and feelings 
about the marital problems and their divorce decision-making process. Also, participants mentioned 
being able to say things to their spouse in joint portions of sessions that they were unable to say at 
home or prior to participating in this intervention. Several participants described how discernment

44 

| 

counseling provided them a “safe place” to speak and that partners were finally able to say things they 
were not able, or willing, to say before attending discernment counseling.

One participant, Jan, a 56-year-old mother of two adult daughters who had been married for nearly 
30 years explained that her decision to try discernment counseling was because she had been trying, 
unsuccessfully, to talk to her husband about his marital concerns for 2 years. “I would ask him 'is there 
someone else?' and he'd say 'no.' I would ask 'what he wanted to be better between us?' and he could 
not tell me. He would always say 'I don't know.' I had to give him a safe place where he could finally 
say what he wasn't able to say to me at home…and where he could finally be truthful with me about 
his intentions.” Tom, married for over 22 years, stated that discernment counseling “was an essential 
step that we had to go through because we had to communicate better. It was hard because I was 
afraid of her anger and our communication was not functional at that point…so it actually brought 
us to a place where we could finally talk honestly about what was going on.” A similar sentiment was 
repeated by Mary, who decided to divorce after discovering her ex-husband had had an affair during 
their first year of marriage, saying “discernment counseling gave us the space to say all the things that 
we've never said before.”

Several participants' responses were coded within this subtheme of finding a forum to say what had 
not been said before. However, their description of their experience in discernment counseling was 
slightly different. For Andy, this theme of having a forum to say what had not been said before took on 
a more negative and painful tone. He said discernment counseling gave his former wife “a place where 
she could say she wanted to leave me and she could feel better about her decision to get divorced.” 
Regardless of how positively or negatively each participant described it, most said discernment coun-
seling provided a forum to say what needed to be said that was not being discussed otherwise.

Discernment counseling helped partners see their own contributions

We discovered the final subtheme of clarity and honesty present in most of the participants' responses. 
These participants reflected that the discernment counseling process helped them see their own indi-
vidual contributions to the problems that led to the breakdown of their marriage. Several participants 
described arriving at a better understanding about their individual tendencies in relationships, the way 
they acted toward their partners, and some accountability around their contributions to the end of their 
marriages.

Mary described the decision for divorce as a mutual one between herself and her former spouse. 
However, he was the partner who ultimately initiated the decision for divorce and was the person who 
filed the papers. Additionally, Mary said “I am doing individual therapy now and it has been helpful 
for continued understanding about my tendencies in relationships and for gaining more insight as to 
how that played out in my marriage.” She added that she continues to work on this aspect of her re-
lationships with her “family…at work…in new dating relationships and she has gained awareness of 
[her] own needs and feelings.” Another participant, Tom, emphasized repeatedly that he was “finally 
seeing  [himself]  more  clearly  now,  and  the  experience  of  discernment  counseling  helped  create  a 
catalyst for change in [himself] and in future relationships.” Finally, another participant, Cara, whose 
marriage ended due to her ex-husband's drug addiction, revealed that she “realized how important it is 
to remain engaged with [her] partner in her next relationship because [she] sees now how [she] missed 
some clues about his struggles with addiction.” Overall, most participants reported an increased level 
of understanding for their part in the breakdown of the marital relationship.

EMERSON Et al. 
 
Appreciation for the Structure of the Intervention

All of the participants commented in one way or another about the benefits of and their appreciation 
for discernment counseling's structured approach. Three specific subthemes emerged in this area; the 
discernment counseling intervention: (a) helped participants reduce divorce ambivalence, (b) created 
an opportunity to feel heard and acknowledged (by both their discernment counselor and their former 
partner), and (c) offered psychoeducation about the divorce process.

Discernment counseling's structure helped participants reduce divorce 
ambivalence

About half of the participants in this study mentioned that the structure of discernment counseling 
helped reduce their feelings of ambivalence about the decision to pursue divorce within their discern-
ment counseling experiences. Holly (37) talked about the types of conversations she and her partner 
had before discernment counseling, “Before discernment counseling, we were floating around and 
didn't have the structure that [discernment counseling] provided.” She mentioned that through dis-
cernment counseling, they eventually were able to “open up and share what was going on for each 
one of [them].” Holly concluded that discernment counseling “helped us to move forward in a more 
intentional, more structured, and more supportive manner.” Additionally, these participants referred 
to discernment counseling as “a helpful tool…because of the specific focus of each individual session 
and the questions directed toward the future direction of the relationship/marriage.” It seems that the 
structure of discernment counseling—including separate individual and focused conjoint times with 
the counselor—helped these participants reduce feelings of confusion and ambivalence.

Discernment counseling helped participants feel heard and acknowledged

The next subtheme was that participants felt heard and acknowledged, not only by the counselor but 
also by their former spouse. While this subtheme of being heard and acknowledged manifested itself 
in different ways with each participant, it was a clear theme in about half of the participants' responses. 
For example, Jan, who was the leaning-in partner initially, said discernment counseling gave her “the 
chance and tools to express what she wanted to be different [in the marriage] if they opted to work on 
the marital issues.” Jan also said that it was only during these discernment counseling sessions that her 
former husband finally admitted he was not willing to work on the marriage. For Cara, the feeling of 
being heard and acknowledged by the discernment counselor seemed to really help her come to a final 
decision about the future direction of the marriage as she began to see she was not solely to blame for 
their problems. Similarly, Misty, whose former spouse was having an affair, described seeing that “he 
was blaming [her] for much of the problems in the marriage” and through her experiences within this 
intervention, she felt like her perspective was finally heard and acknowledged which helped her see 
that “it was not all [her] fault.”

Not all participants felt they benefited equally from the structure of the approach. There were two 
participants who recommended that the structure of the approach be modified. For Tom, the theme 
of appreciating the intervention's structure was less apparent, as he emphasized thinking the structure 
was too restrictive. He stated he “felt dismissed and not fully heard” and even “ganged up on” during 
the sessions. However, Tom also later mentioned that he has a tendency to ramble and get distracted 
and eventually admitted that the structure and the direct approach of the discernment counselor may 

JOURNAL OF MARITAL AND FAMILY 
   
46 

| 

have been [the counselor's] way of keeping him focused on the important matters which needed to be 
addressed. Another participant, Andy, who was the leaning-in partner, referred to discernment coun-
seling's structure as beneficial to his former wife. However, he struggled to see any personal benefits 
from the intervention given that his wife ultimately chose divorce.

Discernment counseling's structure offered participants psychoeducation 
about divorce

This next subtheme was also reflected by half of the people we interviewed. They mentioned discern-
ment counseling helped them achieve a better understanding and knowledge about divorce through 
psychoeducation. For many participants, it was helpful to have portions of the discernment counseling 
sessions to discuss the various paths ahead of them, and to educate them about how this important 
decision would impact their lives, individually and systemically.

For a few participants, the confusion and fear of the unknown aspects of making this decision were 
not limited to the emotional divorce process but some participants also reported feeling unsure about 
the logistics of the legal divorce process as well. For example, Mary mentioned she found discern-
ment counseling to be “most helpful in terms of helping them both get clearer about what steps [they] 
wanted and needed to take logistically to get the divorce.” She added that “without discernment coun-
seling, the divorce process would have taken longer and been much more chaotic.” Jan mentioned 
learning more about the divorce process in her discernment counseling sessions too as she described 
how discernment counseling gave the former couple “a format for having a critical discussion and 
a better understanding about how to go about getting divorced.” It seems possible that discernment 
counseling can help some partners learn more about what to expect in the legal and emotional divorce 
process so they can be better prepared and possibly more confident in their decision-making process.

Cooperation post-divorce

The final theme was that discernment counseling helped participants achieve a new level of coopera-
tion with their former spouse. This was a relevant theme in 8 of the 11 responses. Within this theme, 
there emerged three subthemes to illustrate where interviewees had experienced greater cooperation: 
(a) within their legal divorce process; (b) within their post-divorce coparent relationships; and finally 
(c) within their communication with their former partners, evidenced by (self-reported) reduced levels 
of conflict.

Partners were cooperative in the legal divorce process

Most participants described maintaining ongoing contact with their former spouse(s) related to the lo-
gistics and final arrangements of the divorce. These partners described cooperative and collaborative 
divorces and a few mentioned the ease of their legal divorce process. Several individuals described 
reaching a mutual decision to divorce, even though they reported being the spouse who was initially 
hoping for reconciliation. For example, Jan stated she and her former spouse filed a joint petition for 
divorce and that he agreed not to serve her with divorce papers. She said, “now I see how lucky I was 
at the time, how respectful we were of one another, and we split everything including his retirement 
account and the equity in the house.” Jan said “there was nothing [they] really disagreed about in the 

EMERSON Et al. 
 
|  47

process.” Finally, she concluded that because of their experience in discernment counseling, she and 
her former spouse “were able to move forward with dignity.” Mary indicated that she and her former 
spouse collaborated on a “do it yourself” divorce process using a “downloaded a packet from [their 
local]  County  Court  website.”  Her  former  “partner  filled  out  his  portion  of  the  paperwork,  [they] 
talked about it together and discussed how to break things up financially.” She indicated that [they] 
“both agreed to everything and have already submitted their final paperwork.” Mary suggested that 
their “divorce would have been less smooth and would have taken much longer” without the guidance 
they received from discernment counseling.

Cooperative coparent relationships

This subtheme references the impact that discernment counseling had on participants' ability to de-
velop cooperative post-divorce coparenting relationships with each other. This was true for over half 
of our sample. Jan, who was married for nearly 30 years prior to her divorce and shares two adult 
daughters with her former husband, described “making a very deliberate choice not to be bitter toward 
him,” even though she learned he had been having affairs for several years. She described how she 
and her ex-husband shifted into roles as mutually supportive coparents. She mentioned that they were 
“able to reach agreements about [their] daughters' college expenses and insurance payments” and 
she talked about maintaining ongoing contact with her ex-husband for the benefit of their daughters. 
Another participant, Tom, a 59-year-old father of a teenage daughter, described a mutual decision 
between him and his former wife to “not be bitter, feuding coparents.” He characterized their post-
divorce coparent relationship as “supportive, cooperative, and overall really good.” Tom added that 
they “vowed to make it as easy for [their] daughter as possible,” saying they “have always put [her] 
interests first.” Like Jan, Tom also described ongoing contact with his former wife for the benefit of 
their daughter, even mentioning taking several trips together and coming together for special events 
in their daughter's life.

In  contrast,  Cara  described  a  highly  uncooperative  divorce  process  but  acknowledged  that  they 
now interact cooperatively for the benefit of their child. Even though Cara did not describe her current 
interactions with her ex-husband as enjoyable or easy, she indicated that she and her ex are “cooper-
ative for the sake of [their] daughter.” In a similar fashion, Andy, who was married for 12 years and 
shares two small children with his former wife, talked about his legal divorce process as “shocking and 
very difficult.” He talked about his feelings of grief and loss surrounding his former wife's decision 
to end the marriage, saying “it felt like a part of me died when she left…I was so lost and grieving 
for a while.” When asked about his post-divorce coparent relationship with his former wife, Andy 
described  it  as  being  highly  cooperative  as  they  “agreed  to  communicate  with  one  another  for  the 
benefit of their children.”

Another participant, Sam, a 38-year-old woman, married for 15 years with two children, indicated 
that before discernment counseling, her relationship with her spouse was highly disengaged. But, after 
the intervention, it was much more cooperative. She said that “even after the second session, we had 
a great conversation outside of discernment counseling that opened up the door for a different type of 
communication.” She added that she and her former husband “are working to reconcile our previous 
friendship in order to be the best coparents possible.” When asked specifically about how discern-
ment counseling impacted their post-divorce coparent relationship, this participant said not only did 
it “open up the lines of communication, it gave [them] labels to describe [their] contributions to the 
state of our relationship without further confusion.”

Finally,  it  is  worth  mentioning  the  outliers  of  this  subtheme.  Not  everyone  reported  experienc-
ing  an  increase  in  cooperation  as  a  result  of  participating  in  discernment  counseling.  One  person 
described having more difficult relationships with their former spouse(s) after participating in dis-
cernment counseling. Holly, who was married for 10 years with three children, described how her 
experiences in discernment counseling were “not beneficial” for them, adding that they “stayed stuck 
for too long….and it just made things worse.” Holly stated that she and her former spouse are not able 
to engage in any type of coparent relationship and still have a lot of conflict. She concluded by saying 
“I would like to be able to coparent with him but we are not there yet…and I am not sure if we ever 
will be there.”

DISCUSS ION

Participants in this study reported generally achieving a greater sense of clarity around their or their 
partner's decisions to end their marriage through the discernment counseling process. Discernment 
counseling was reported to have provided a forum for honest conversations that increased participants' 
understanding  about  getting  divorced  and  offered  much-needed  structure  in  their  decision-making 
process. Participants also indicated that discernment counseling helped them negotiate their post-di-
vorce coparenting relationship. These findings offer some encouraging news about this new treatment 
protocol. Future studies in this area could investigate specific mechanisms of change related to the 
discernment counseling approach. For example, what was it about the discernment counseling expe-
rience that contributed to the clarity and confidence participants achieved in their decision making? 
What about this process, the counselor, or the clients themselves contributed to them becoming better 
coparents than they might have been without going through this process (according to their percep-
tions)? This study also contributes to calls from other researchers about exploring ways that former 
spouses can coparent cooperatively after a divorce (Ahrons, 1994, 2006; Bonach, 2005).

In the popular press and even in society's psyche, there is a belief that divorce is “hard” on children 
and certainly this perspective can be validated in the research. However, the same researchers have 
also provided ample empirical support for the idea that conflicted and distressed marriages are also 
“hard” on children (Amato, 2000, 2005, 2010; Amato & Booth, 1997) and that divorce might offer 
some relief to the children of these marriages. If couples are able to reduce the amount of distress and 
conflict they experience associated with an unhealthy marriage and the resulting choice to divorce, 
and if they are able to meet in agreeable ways in their coparenting, there may be better outcomes for 
children  who  experience  the  divorce  of  their  parents.  We  believe  this  is  the  direction  discernment 
counseling researchers should focus on in the future. Being able to connect what happens in discern-
ment counseling to parents' coparenting and the impact of that improved coparenting on specific child 
outcomes would help validate this approach. Of course, the current study can in no way claim that the 
children of these divorced parents are doing better than they would have without their parents going 
to discernment counseling. That claim is well beyond the scope of this study. But the results of this 
small-scale qualitative inquiry into the perceptions of coparenting among a sample of individuals who 
received discernment counseling is promising and something to build on.

We know that there are a variety of factors that impact the quality of coparent relationships after 
divorce. These include high levels of coparent communication and involvement, low levels of copar-
ent conflict, and parental satisfaction with custody and financial arrangements and with the parenting 
skills of the other parent (Ahrons, 1994, 2006). Several of these factors are specifically addressed in 
the discernment counseling model (communication, reduction in conflict, greater understanding of 
the decision to divorce). Also, the difficulty and duration of the divorce process including attitudes 

EMERSON Et al. 
 
|  49

and  hostility  levels,  and  the  use  of  mediation  or  other  alternative  dispute  methods  during  the  di-
vorce process can have a substantial impact on the quality of a post-divorce coparenting environment 
(Baum, 2004; Bonach, 2005; Emery et al., 2001; Markham & Coleman, 2012). The participants in our 
study reflected that their experience in discernment counseling contributed to reduced conflict and 
greater understanding in the divorce process.

This study's findings suggest that some distressed couples who participate in discernment coun-
seling  may  experience  a  decrease  in  conflict  associated  with  divorce  and  an  increased  measure  of 
cooperation as coparents. Coparenting relationships that are cooperative and low in conflict contribute 
to healthier child and family outcomes (Ahrons, 1994, 2006; Amato, 2005; Bonach, 2005; Sigal et al., 
2011). It is too early to suggest that all who undergo discernment counseling and choose a divorce path 
will experience these same outcomes. However, this study provides some promising preliminary data 
to suggest that communication between former partners and coparenting efforts after divorce could be 
enhanced by going through discernment counseling prior to divorcing.

LIMITATIONS

While the findings from this study are promising they should be regarded cautiously. It should be 
remembered that the participants were from a sample of individuals who were in heterosexual (male–
female) marriages. We still know very little about divorce among same sex couples (as same sex mar-
riage was only legal across the US beginning in 2015) and nothing about how discernment counseling 
impacts  these  couples’  coparenting  relationships.  This  is  an  area  that  could  benefit  from  a  variety 
of  studies  including  both  small  pilot  studies  and  larger-scale  family  studies  on  how  these  families 
experience and manage divorce transitions, including outcomes for children. The limitations of this 
particular  study  include  the  small  and  homogeneous  sample  (mostly  highly  educated  women  with 
moderate- to high-income levels, who were “leaning-in” spouses). Also, the fact that we only inter-
viewed one spouse of the divorced couple. Additionally, we had no assessment of child outcomes or 
children's perspectives on the divorce and their experiences of their parents’ coparenting activities. 
This  key  information  would  provide  a  more  detailed  understanding  of  the  impact  of  discernment 
counseling on former spouses' post-divorce communication and coparenting efforts. We see this lat-
ter  point  as  the  main  contribution  of  this  work.  Healthy  and  cooperative  coparenting  relationships 
benefit children. Discernment counseling may help divorcing couples become better coparents. More 
research is needed on this approach at both process and outcome levels to validate this assertion.
