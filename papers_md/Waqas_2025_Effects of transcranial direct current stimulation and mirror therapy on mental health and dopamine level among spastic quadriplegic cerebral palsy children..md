Abstract
Background  Cerebral palsy (CP) is a neurological condition affecting a child’s motor development, potentially 
disturbing their mental health, which is an emerging challenge for rehabilitation. Transcranial direct current 
stimulation (tDCS) and mirror therapy (MT) are novel neurorehabilitation techniques that enhance mental health and 
motor development.

Methods  A double-blinded randomized clinical trial was conducted on 105 children with spastic quadriplegic CP 
between the ages of three to seven years. The study was conducted in the Physical Therapy Center of Ghurki Hospital, 
Lahore. The patients were divided into three groups of 35 patients: Group A (tDCS + MT + Routine Physical Therapy 
(RPT)), Group B (MT + RPT), and Group C (tDCS + RPT) through Randomized Allocation Software Version 1.0. Patients 
underwent 10 sessions of tDCS and MT, each lasting for 15 min per side (right and left), along with 20 min of RPT five 
days a week, which continued for the next ten weeks on follow-up. The mental health of CP children from different 
age ranges was assessed by the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), a brief and accessible screening tool 
covering a child’s emotional symptoms, conduct problems, hyperactivity/inattention, peer relationship problems, and 
social behavior. Designed for teachers and parents, the self-report versions have a reliability of 0.80. Dopamine was 
measured using a plasma lab test to explore its potential relationship with changes in mental health status following 
the intervention. Assessment was conducted at baseline, after two weeks, and again after ten weeks of follow-up. The 
data was analyzed via SPSS version 26.0.

Results  The results revealed a significant change in the mean score of Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaires 
(SDQ) after ten weeks (P = 0.004) and in dopamine levels after two weeks (P < 0.001). Additionally, group comparison 
revealed statistically significant changes in both SDQ scores (P = 0.001 for group A and P = 0.002 for group C) and 
dopamine levels (P = 0.000 for group A and P = 0.002 for group C) but not group B at the specified time intervals.

Conclusion  The combined treatment of tDCS and MT improved mental health and increased dopamine levels more 
than either treatment alone. Dopamine levels increased initially but decreased during follow-up.

Introduction
CP  is  a  neurological  condition  affecting  an  immature, 
underdeveloped  brain  due  to  vascular  insults  disturbing 
motor development [1]. Impaired motor development in 
children can hinder movement, social behavior, commu-
nication, and daily tasks, leading to increased peer pres-
sure affecting their physical, social, and mental health [2]. 
Spastic  quadriplegic  CP  (SQCP)  is  a  neurological  disor-
der caused by damage to the motor cortex, which affects 
all  four  limbs  and  the  trunk.  They  experience  increased 
muscle  tone,  leading  to  reduced  movement  control  and 
impaired coordination [3]. These challenges significantly 
affect their ability to perform daily activities [4, 5].

In  Pakistan,  the  most  common  types  are  diplegic  and 
SQCP, with a prevalence  of 1.22 per 1000 live  births. In 
India,  the  prevalence  is  higher  at  3  per  1,000  live  births 
[6–8]. Major risk factors for spastic CP include low birth 
weight, placental abnormalities, and hypoxia at birth [9]. 
A  child  with  CP  experiences  neuromuscular  abnormali-
ties in muscle tone, balance, coordination, and strength. 
These  challenges  can  lead  to  social  isolation  and  emo-
tional distress, impacting their overall well-being [10].

Technological  advancements  in  medical  sciences  have 
introduced non-invasive transcranial direct current stim-
ulation  (tDCS)  as  a  novel  neuromodulation  treatment 
for  neurological  patients  with  disturbed  mental  health 
[11].  Impaired  motor  activity  often  leads  to  reduced 
dopamine  levels,  affecting  both  mood,  cognition,  and 
mental  health  [12].  More  than  one-third  of  patients 
with  disturbed  mental  health  do  not  benefit  from  exist-
ing  evidence-based  treatments  [13].  tDCS  may  provide 
high-quality adjunct treatment to enhance the benefits of 
medicines and psychotherapy [14]. The method is afford-
able, portable, and safe, utilizing two scalp electrodes to 
target the desired brain area [15]. Anodal tDCS reduces 
spasticity  in  upper  extremities  as  well  as  improves  bal-
ance and gait parameters in CP patients [16]. The anode 
depolarizes neuronal tissues of the brain that are adjacent 
to  the  stimulation  site,  referred  to  as  excitatory  tDCS 
which  enhances  cortical  excitability  that  is  dependent 
on  N-methyl-d-aspartate  receptor  and  calcium  channel 
activity  [17],  whereas  the  cathode  repolarizes  the  adja-
cent brain region, referred to as inhibitory tDCS, though 
this simplification is still debated [18]. tDCS has a benefi-
cial impact on patients with various mental illnesses and 
strongly promotes mental health. tDCS has been shown 
to benefit patients suffering from a variety of mental ill-
nesses  by  improving  mental  health  [19].  Application  of 

tDCS  lowers  the  physiological  stress  markers  (salivary 
cortisol  and  alpha-amylase)  resulting  in  cortisol  deple-
tion [20] and an inhibitory impact on a radiotracer raclo-
pride,  suggesting  an  increase  in  extracellular  dopamine 
release resulting in a stimulatory effect on dopamine lev-
els among humans [21].

MT activates the mirror neuron system in the premo-
tor  cortex  [22],  which  responds  to  specific  movements 
performed by an individual or observed in a mirror [23]. 
MT  was  introduced  in  1996  for  phantom  pain  [24]  and 
proved to be an effective intervention for CP rehabilita-
tion [25, 26]. In MT, the brain hemisphere contralateral to 
the moving limb exhibits activation in the primary motor 
cortex  and  an  alteration  in  inter-  or  intra-hemispheric 
inhibition  [5].  MT  stimulates  muscle  activity  in  affected 
limbs,  balances  the  ipsilateral  primary  motor  cortex, 
normalizes electrical activity, and activates the posterior 
cingulate cortex [27]. These effects facilitate neuroplastic 
changes,  promote  motor  development,  enhance  mental 
health, and activate dopamine release [28].

Under the umbrella of routine physical therapy (RPT), 
goal-directed  functional  training  and  reflex  inhibitory 
patterns  were  used  in  combination  for  better  rehabilita-
tion  to  constrain  the  financial  burdens  of  CP  treatment 
[29].  Goal-directed  functional  training  comprises  tasks 
such  as  prone  neck  raises,  rolling,  sit-to-stand,  step-
ups,  supine  bridges,  and  transfer  practice  based  on  the 
Canadian  Occupational  Performance  Measure  (COPM) 
[30].  The  reflex  inhibitory  pattern  targets  exaggerated 
or  diminished  primitive,  postural,  or  righting  reflexes 
through repeated stimuli and specific postures [31].

CP  patients  encounter  challenges  such  as  motor  skill 
deficiencies  that  hinder  mobility  and  affect  their  self-
esteem  [32].  This  can  lead  to  increased  stress,  elevated 
cortisol levels, fluctuating dopamine levels, and disturbed 
emotional  and  mental  health  [33,  34].  Movement  acti-
vation  by  these  interventions  tailored  to  CP  child  can 
reduce  stress  by  stimulating  dopamine  release,  thereby 
enhancing their overall health [12, 35]. This study aimed 
to assess the impact of tDCS combined with MT on hor-
monal  changes  and  mental  health  in  SQCP  children. 
These  novel  rehabilitation  approaches  aim  to  enhance 
an  individual’s  functional,  structural,  and  emotional 
states  by  triggering  the  release  of  dopamine  hormone,  a 
factor  directly  linked  to  mental  health  that  can  signifi-
cantly  improve  one’s  quality  of  life  by  fostering  greater 
rationality.

Methods
Study design

A  double-blinded  (assessor  and  caregiver)  randomized 
clinical  trial  was  conducted.  The  trial  was  registered  on 
the Iranian registry of clinical trials with reference num-
ber  IRCT20231227060542N1  and  conducted  according 
to the guidelines of the consolidated standards of report-
ing trials (CONSORT) (Fig. 1).

Sample size

A  pilot  study  was  conducted  with  thirty  patients  to 
ensure  adequate  design  of  a  full  trial  to  test  its  efficacy 
[36].  The  sample  size  was  calculated  using  the  open  epi 
tool [37]. The mean values and standard deviations were 
19 ± 6.93 for group I, and 23.87 ± 6.17 for group II, respec-
tively.  With  80%  power  and  a  95%  confidence  level,  the 
resultant sample size was 29. After adding 20% to account 
for  expected  dropouts,  each  group  size  was  determined 
to be 35, making a total of 105 patients.

Patients

A thorough examination of CP patients was conducted at 
the  Ghurki  Hospital’s  Physical  Therapy  &  Rehabilitation 
Center  in  Lahore,  Pakistan,  by  an  orthopedic  physician, 

neurologist,  psychologist,  and  physical  therapist  from 
January 2024 to July 2024. A systematic awareness cam-
paign  was  launched  through  social  media  to  maximize 
patients’  responses  to  join  this  study.  The  diagnosed 
SQCP  patients  were  referred  to  Physical  Therapy  reha-
bilitation section. Patients aged 3–7 years [8] with SQCP, 
GMFCS  level  I  to  III  [38,  39],  spasticity < 3  on  modified 
Ashworth  scale  [40]  and  with  a  good  understanding  of 
verbal  directions,  or  the  usage  of  communication  aids, 
were  included  in  the  study  [41].  Patients  with  ataxia, 
monoplegia,  diplegic  hemiplegic  CP,  neurosurgery, 
neurolytic  block,  cancerous  history  [8],  musculoskel-
etal  deformity,  skin  ailment,  seizure  history,  metallic 
implant  or  hearing  aid  [38]  use  were  excluded  from  the 
study.  Informed  consent  was  obtained  from  the  parents 
and guardians before participating in the study. Detailed 
descriptions of the intervention protocol were guided to 
the patients to ensure confidentiality.

Randomization and blinding

Randomized  Allocation  Software  version  1.0  was  used 
for  randomization.  105  patients  were  allocated  to 
three  groups  Group  A  (tDCS + MT + RPT),  Group  B 
(MT + RPT),  and  Group  C  (tDCS + RPT)  (35  in  each

Routine physical therapy

Under  RPT,  goal-directed  functional  training  and  reflex 
inhibitory  pattern  techniques  were  applied  to  all  groups 
(A,  B,  and  C)  as  a  standardized  physical  therapy  treat-
ment.  Each  technique  was  administered  for  10  min, 
resulting  in  a  total  therapy  duration  of  20  min  for  each 
group.  tDCS  and  MT  were  applied  for  10  sessions  only, 
whereas RPT continued from week 0 to week 10 to ensure 
sustained  therapeutic  benefits.  Goal-directed  functional 
training  focused  on  tasks  tailored  to  the  patient’s  func-
tional  level  and  competencies  like  (prone  neck  raises, 
rolling, sit-to-stand, step-up, supine bridges, and transfer 
practice)  [30].  In  the  reflex  inhibitory  pattern’s  regime, 
any  exaggerated  or  diminished  primitive,  postural,  or 
righting  reflexes  were  targeted  through  repeated  stimuli 
and  specific  postures  designed  to  develop  reflexes  that 
would help overall development, leading to better mental 
health.

Outcome measures

Patients received 10 sessions of tDCS and MT, each last-
ing 15 min per side (right and left), as well as 20 min of 
RPT five days a week for the next ten weeks as a follow-
up. Every patient was assessed by one independent asses-
sor  using  by  SDQ  with  a  reliability  of  0.80  [47,  48]  and 
a  plasma  lab  test  of  dopamine  [49,  50]  at  baseline,  after 
ten  sessions  or  two  weeks,  and  then  after  ten  weeks  of 
follow-up,  by  extending  the  notion  of  the  standard  of 
care  in  physical  therapy,  which  was  extended  RPT.  The 
extended  RPT  program  was  planned  first  because,  as  a 
matter of ethics, patients had to have the best and maxi-
mum  chance  of  benefit  from  treatment,  and  secondly, 
neural,  mechanical,  biochemical,  and  structural  changes 
for growth start in the second week and mature in 8–12 
weeks [38].

Statistical analysis

The data was analyzed by SPSS 26.0 (Chicago, USA), and 
normality  was  assessed  by  the  Shapiro-Wilk  test.  For 
descriptive  statistics,  categorical  and  nominal  variables 
were  presented  as  frequencies  and  percentages,  while 
the mean and standard deviation represented continuous 
variables. For inferential statistics, A multivariate mixed-
design ANOVA was conducted to see the effects of group 
(A, B, C) and time (baseline, 2 weeks, and 10 weeks) on 
mental  health  and  dopamine  levels.  Post-hoc  pairwise 
comparisons  using  the  Bonferroni  test  were  applied  to 
evaluate  specific  group-wise  differences.  A  95%  confi-
dence interval was considered to analyze the whole data, 
with a significance value of P < 0.05.

group) with a 1:1:1 ratio with a unique identity number. 
Both the outcome assessors and caregivers were blinded 
to the randomization process and the allocation of treat-
ment  groups,  which  helped  to  reduce  bias  and  enhance 
the validity of the study results.

Treatment
Transcranial direct current stimulation

The patients were positioned in a CP chair, with hip and 
knee joints at 90 degrees flexion and forearms resting on 
a  table  in  front.  For  the  group  receiving  tDCS,  a  wire-
less  rechargeable  tDCS  device  (Segal  Stim  SG-2023004 
by  Framed  Company)  was  used.  The  device  consists  of 
two sponge electrodes, each measuring 5*7 cm in length, 
which  were  saturated  with  0.9%  physiological  saline. 
The electrodes were meticulously positioned around the 
patient’s  head  and  firmly  secured  to  guarantee  optimal 
contact and alignment [8].

tDCS  was  administered  with  a  current  intensity  of  2 
milliamperes  to  modulate  cortical  excitability  in  both 
hemispheres  of  the  brain  [36].  The  stimulation  targeted 
the  primary  motor  cortex  (M1)  bilaterally,  with  15  min 
of  stimulation  applied  to  each  hemisphere,  resulting  in 
a  total  stimulation  duration  of  30  min  [42].  For  the  first 
15  min,  to  target  the  right-sided  extremities,  the  anode 
was positioned over the left primary motor cortex (M1), 
facilitating  cortical  excitability,  while  the  cathode  was 
placed  over  the  right  supraorbital  area  to  serve  as  the 
reference  electrode  [38].  Consequently,  the  electrode 
arrangement was reversed to target the left-sided extrem-
ities.  Specifically,  the  anode  was  repositioned  over  the 
right primary motor cortex (M1) to enhance neural activ-
ity in the right hemisphere, while the cathode was placed 
over the left supraorbital area [36]. This electrode place-
ment  protocol  was  implemented  following  the  10–20 
EEG  international  system,  ensuring  precise  localization 
of stimulation sites for better effectiveness and reproduc-
ibility of tDCS [38] (Fig. 2) & (Fig. 3).

Mirror therapy

Left-sided extremities were hidden behind a 35 × 35-cen-
timeter mirror, with the right targeted side in front of it, 
where the movement of the right-sided upper and lower 
extremities  was  mirrored  in  a  mirror  for  15  min  and 
repeated  for  the  left  targeted  side  as  explained  for  the 
right  side  for  the  next  15  min  [43].  The  upper  extrem-
ity  MT  program  included  pronation,  supination,  and 
flexion-extension of fingers, wrist, and elbow [44], while 
the  lower  extremity  MT  program  included  ball  rolling, 
rocker-boarding, and pedaling [45]. Following a 30-min-
ute MT treatment, the patients completed ten sets of 20 
repetitions  of  each  exercise,  taking  two  minutes  off  in 
between, and were given feedback on how to focus better 
[46].

Description of mental health

The Shapiro-Wilk test confirmed that the data were nor-
mally  distributed  (P > 0.05). The  results  of  a  multivariate 
mixed-design  ANOVA  comparing  mean  SDQ  scores  at 
different time intervals (completion of the 2nd and 10th 
weeks)  showed  a  significant  difference  in  group  mean 
scores at 10 weeks. The mean scores of SDQ at baseline 
were  76.9 ± 1.9  for  Group  A,  77.1 ± 1.9  for  Group  B,  and 

Page 7 of 13

77.1 ± 1.9  for  Group  C.  After  10  sessions  or  two  weeks, 
the  mean  scores  were  58.9 ± 4.1  for  Group  A,  58.5 ± 4.4 
for  Group  B,  and  59.4 ± 4.2  for  Group  C,  showing  a  dif-
ference  in  mean  scores  but  not  statistically  significant 
(F = 2.8,  P = 0.064).  After  10  weeks,  during  the  follow-
up,  the  SDQ  mean  scores  were  32.2 ± 5.3  for  Group  A, 
38.6 ± 10.8 for Group B, and 37.9 ± 8.4 for Group C, with 
a  statistically  significant  difference  between  the  groups 
(F = 5.9, P = 0.004) (Table 2) & (Fig. 4).

Description of dopamine level

The results of a multivariate mixed-design ANOVA com-
paring mean dopamine scores at different time intervals 
(completion  of  the  2nd  and  10th  weeks)  revealed  a  sig-
nificant  difference  in  mean  score,  especially  after  com-
pleting the 2nd week of treatment. The dopamine mean 
scores at baseline were 4.2 ± 1.7 for Group A, 4.4 ± 1.6 for 
Group B, and 4.2 ± 1.7 for Group C. After 10 sessions or 
two weeks, the mean scores were 20.6 ± 2.4 for Group A, 
18.3 ± 2.1 for Group B, and 19.1 ± 2.5 for Group C, show-
ing  a  significant  difference  in  mean  (F = 9.1,  P = < 0.001). 
After  10  weeks,  during  the  follow-up,  the  dopamine 
scores  were  10.4 ± 1.6  for  Group  A,  10.2 ± 0.9  for  Group 
B, and 10.4 ± 1.3 for Group C, with a difference in mean 
scores  concerning  baseline  that  was  not  significant 
(F = 0.3, P = 0.762) (Table 2) & (Fig. 5).

Groupwise comparison of mental health and dopamine

The  results  of  the  Bonferroni  test  for  multiple  compari-
sons  between  groups  at  baseline  for  SDQ  revealed  that 
the mean difference between Groups A and B was − 0.14, 
between Groups B and C was − 0.03, and between Groups 
C and A was 0.2, with no significant difference (P = 1.000). 
After two weeks, the mean differences were 0.5 between 
Groups A and B, -2.3 between Groups B and C, and 1.8 
between Groups C and A, with no significant difference 
(P = 1.000,  P = 0.08,  and  P = 0.23,  respectively).  However, 
after ten weeks, the mean differences were − 6.4 between

For a multiple-group comparison regarding dopamine, 
the mean difference between Groups A and B was − 0.2, 
between Groups B and C was 0.2, and between Groups C 
and A was 0.0, with no significant difference (P = 1.000). 
However, after two weeks, the mean differences were 2.3 
between Groups A and B, 0.8 between Groups B and C, 
and − 1.6 between Groups C and A, with statistically sig-
nificant differences between Group A and B and between 
Group  C  and  A  (P = 0.00  and  P = 0.02,  respectively). 
After ten weeks, the mean differences were 0.2 between 
Groups A and B, -0.2 between Groups B and C, and 0.0 
between Groups C and A, with no significant difference 
(P = 1.000) (Table 3).

Pairwise comparison of mental health and dopamine

Pairwise comparisons of SDQ and dopamine levels indi-
cated  statistically  significant  differences  in  all  pairings 
of  these  two  outcomes  (p = 0.001)  at  a  95%  confidence 
interval.  The  mean  difference  between  the  baseline  and 
second-week  pairs  was  17.6,  the  second-week  to  tenth-
week  pair  was  23.2,  and  the  tenth-week  to  baseline  was 
40.8.  For  dopamine,  the  mean  difference  between  the 
baseline and second week was − 15.1, between the second 
and tenth weeks was 8.9, and between the tenth week and 
baseline was 6.1 (Table 4).

Discussion
The  present  study  demonstrated  promising  results  in 
patients with CP through the use of tDCS and MT. Sig-
nificant  improvements  in  mental  health  were  observed 
after 10 weeks, as shown by follow-up assessments. Inter-
estingly, an increase in dopamine levels was observed as 
early as two weeks into the intervention, but this increase

was not consistent at the 10-week mark. The study found 
that tDCS and MT significantly improved mental health 
outcomes in CP patients when combined with RPT, pos-
sibly due to dopamine release, a neurotransmitter known 
for reward and mood regulation. Our results suggest that 
therapies inducing dopamine release could be promising 
for treating mental health issues in patients with CP.

In  support  of  anodal  tDCS,  a  study  was  conducted  to 
discover  its  effects  on  healthy  individuals.  The  findings 

indicated  transient  increases  in  dopamine  levels  during 
rehabilitation,  suggesting  that  anodal  tDCS  may  tem-
porarily  enhance  dopamine  production  or  release.  This 
elevation could potentially improve cognitive and motor 
functions  during  treatment.  These  results  aligned  with 
broader  evidence  supporting  neuroplasticity  and  the 
optimization of brain function during targeted therapeu-
tic  interventions  [51].  However,  in  the  current  study,  a 
significant  increase  in  dopamine  levels  from  baseline  to

two weeks post-treatment was observed, which indicates 
the effectiveness of the combination in enhancing dopa-
mine production and regulation. This rise may be due to 
the initial therapeutic benefit or the natural homeostatic 
response  of  the  body  which  diminishes  the  initial  gains. 
However,  by  the  tenth  week,  dopamine  levels  returned 
to baseline, which suggests that the benefits of the treat-
ment were not sustained. This decrease in dopamine level 
after termination of tDCS may be due to a neuroadaptive 
mechanism in which biochemical effects may not trans-
late  into  long-term  synaptic  modifications  or  neuroana-
tomical  restructuring.  The  frequency  and  intensity  of 
treatment may not be sufficient to induce long-term neu-
rochemical changes.

In  contrast,  a  study  was  carried  out  by  using  cathodal 
tDCS  to  investigate  its  effects  on  dopamine  release  in 
rats.  The  study  found  that  a  10-minute  application  of 
cathodal  tDCS  generates  a  significant  increase  in  extra-
cellular  dopamine  levels  in  the  striatum,  which  lasted 
for over 400 min without affecting serotonin levels. This 
indicates that cathodal tDCS has a notable and prolonged 

effect  on  the  dopaminergic  system,  particularly  within 
the  basal  ganglia  through  direct  stimulation  of  dopa-
minergic  neurons  or  via  indirect  pathways  influencing 
dopamine release, emphasizing the potential of tDCS to 
target specific neurotransmitter systems [52]. In contrast, 
the  current  study  observed  similar  effects  with  anodal 
tDCS  stimulation  rather  than  cathodal  stimulation. This 
contrast is a significant and distinguishing feature of the 
study,  as  it  underscores  the  differential  effects  of  tDCS 
polarity  on  neurophysiological  outcomes,  specifically 
regarding cortical excitability and dopamine change.

In  alignment  with  the  results  of  the  present  study,  a 
study  investigated  the  effects  of  anodal  tDCS  on  corti-
cal  regions  to  improve  mental  health  in  sixteen  patients 
with  psychiatric  disorders.  The  intervention  involved 
ten  sessions  of  tDCS,  with  data  gathered  using  the 
Symptom  Checklist-10.  The  findings  revealed  signifi-
cant  therapeutic  effects  of  anodal  tDCS,  which  results 
in marked improvements in mental health. This empha-
sizes  its  potential  as  a  non-invasive  and  effective  treat-
ment  modality  for  managing  psychiatric  conditions  by

intensities  on  neurotransmitter  levels,  including  dopa-
mine, norepinephrine, and serotonin metabolites, as well 
as oculomotor control in Parkinson’s patients and found 
no significant effect on oculomotor control. However, the 
study found aerobic exercise alters brain neurotransmit-
ters,  particularly  dopamine,  norepinephrine,  and  sero-
tonin metabolites [35]. In our study, a comparable effect 
on dopamine modulation was observed in response to a 
holistic  intervention  that  included  tDCS,  MT,  and  RPT. 
This suggests that integrative approaches involving brain 
stimulation  and  movement-based  therapies  may  have  a 
broader impact on neurochemical modulation across dif-
ferent neurological disorders.

In  support  of  this  study,  a  study  was  conducted  to 
examine the relationship between dopamine release and 
human  movement.  The  study  concludes  that  dopamine 
release  depends  on  the  type  and  intensity  of  physical 
activity. An intense activity level stimulates higher dopa-
mine  release  while  a  low  activity  level  lowers  dopamine 
release.  This  highlights  the  significant  impact  of  activ-
ity  levels  on  dopamine  [28].  In  the  current  study,  tDCS 
and MT are employed to catalyze the movement, which 
enhances  dopamine  release  and  its  impact  on  mental 
health. This dopamine release is hypothesized to contrib-
ute to improved mental health, highlighting the potential 
of these interventions to enhance both physical and psy-
chological well-being.

tDCS  has  demonstrated  significant  improvements  in 
hormone  imbalances,  depression,  anxiety,  and  overall 
mental  wellness  [57].  However,  this  study  focused  on 
individuals  with  spastic  CP,  categorized  by  the  Gross 
Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) as Levels 
I to III, each presenting varying mental ages. This diver-
sity  presents  a  significant  challenge  in  addressing  the 
mental  health  needs  of  this  population.  To  gain  a  more 
comprehensive understanding, further research is needed 
to compare the mental health of individuals with spastic 
CP  across  all  GMFCS  levels,  from  I  to  V.  In  this  study, 
tDCS was administered at 2 mA for 15 min per side, five 
times  per  week  for  two  weeks,  which  could  be  adjusted 
in future investigations. tDCS can be used as an adjunct 
to  other  brain  stimulation  methods,  such  as  repeti-
tive  transcranial  magnetic  stimulation  and  transcranial 
alternating current stimulation for depression and other 
coexisting  neurological  disorders.  Future  studies  should 
be  conducted  to  gain  long-term  release  of  dopamine  by 
changes  in  frequency,  intensity,  and  treatment  doses  of 
tDCS  application.  tDCS  impact  can  be  studied  by  com-
bining  it  with  other  dopaminergic-stimulating  pharma-
cological or neurostimulatory interventions.

modulating cortical activity, offering a promising avenue 
for  enhancing  therapeutic  outcomes  in  mental  health 
[53].  The  current  study  shared  a  similar  concept  which 
observes the application of tDCS led to improvements in 
mental health as measured by the Strengths and Difficul-
ties Questionnaire scores, highlighting its potential as an 
effective  intervention  for  enhancing  mental  health  out-
comes in clinical settings.

A pilot study was conducted to investigate the efficacy 
of tDCS combined with MT on motor development and 
control among CP patients. The study concluded that this 
combination  significantly  improves  motor  development, 
motor  control,  and  muscle  performance,  and  directly 
elevates  movement  capabilities.  This  improvement  is 
important, as enhanced movement outcomes are associ-
ated  with  dopamine  release,  which  can  positively  affect 
the mental health of patients with CP [36]. These findings 
align  with  the  current  study,  which  indicates  that  tDCS 
and MT enhance motor outcomes with overall well-being 
by  potentially  altering  neurochemical  balances  in  CP 
patients. This alignment reinforces the therapeutic value 
of this intervention, emphasizing its potential to address 
both physical and psychological aspects of CP.

tDCS  is  a  user-friendly,  low-cost,  and  low-risk  thera-
peutic  modality  that  improves  spasticity,  balance,  gross 
motor function, and gait. It is related to improved mobil-
ity  and  physical  functioning,  which  connects  to  stress 
management,  reduces  cortisol  function,  and  influences 
mental  health.  Recent  studies  suggest  that  tDCS  may 
have  broader  mental  health  effects  through  neuroplas-
ticity  mechanisms,  enhancing  cortical  excitability  and 
causing  persistent  synaptic  changes,  improving  mood 
and cognitive function, and affecting GABA modulation 
may also contribute to anxiety and stress reduction, com-
plementing  dopaminergic  pathways  [54].  In  alignment 
with  the  results  of  the  present  study,  researchers  found 
significant effects of tDCS on depression symptoms, rais-
ing dopamine levels and improving mental health.

Research on the relationship between physical exercise 
and  dopamine  levels  shows  mixed  results.  A  systematic 
review  was  conducted  in  which  consistently  showed 
a  positive  influence  of  dopamine  on  habitual  physical 
activity.  Therapeutic  interventions  like  tDCS  and  MT 
improved  movement-induced  dopamine  release  in  CP 
patients,  reducing  cortisol  levels,  promoting  relaxation, 
potentially  improving  anxiety  levels,  and  highlighting 
the  therapeutic  potential  of  targeted  interventions  [55]. 
Physical  activity  stimulates  dopamine  release,  which 
helps  to  improve  mood  by  interacting  with  serotonin, 
another mood-regulating neurotransmitter. This process 
enhances  brain  function,  supports  mental  health,  and 
reduces stress [56].

In  support  of  this  study,  a  study  was  conducted  to 
investigate  the  effects  of  aerobic  exercise  at  various 

Waqas et al. BMC Pediatrics          (2025) 25:548 Conclusion
This  study  concluded  that  the  combination  of  tDCS 
and MT effectively improves mental health and elevates 
dopamine  levels  compared  to  either  intervention  alone. 
These  findings  suggested  that  integrating  tDCS  into 
clinical practice could significantly enhance patient care. 
While  dopamine  levels  increased  initially  due  to  the 
treatment,  they  declined  during  follow-up,  indicating 
that  tDCS  and  MT  actively  stimulate  dopamine  release 
in  the  short  term.  This  study  emphasizes  the  necessity 
for  further  research  to  explore  the  long-term  efficacy  of 
tDCS and MT in promoting sustained dopamine release 
and its long-lasting impact on mental health.
