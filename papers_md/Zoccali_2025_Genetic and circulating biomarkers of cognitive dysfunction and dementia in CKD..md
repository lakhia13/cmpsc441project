ABSTRACT 
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is commonly accompanied by cognitive dysfunction and dementia, which, in turn, increase the risk of 
hospitalization, cardiovascular events and death. Over the last 30 years, only four studies focused on genetic markers of cognitive 
impairment in CKD and kidney failure (KF), indicating a significant gap in research. These studies suggest potential genetic predis- 
positions to cognitive decline in CKD patients but also underscore the necessity for more comprehensive studies. Seventeen reports 
have established connections between cognitive function and kidney disease markers such as estimated glomerular filtration rate 
(eGFR), Cystatin C and albuminuria. A rapid eGFR decline has been associated with cognitive deterioration and vascular dementia, 
and mild to moderate eGFR reductions with diminished executive function in elderly men. Various biomarkers have been associated 
to Alzheimer’s disease or dementia in CKD and KF. These include amyloid beta and phosphorylated tau proteins, uremic toxins, gut 
microbiota, metabolic indicators, hypertension, endothelial dysfunction, vitamins and inflammation. However, the causal relevance 
of these associations remains unclear. Overall, the available evidence points to a complex interplay between the different biomarkers 
and cognitive health in CKD patients, underscoring the need for more research to elucidate these relationships. 

Keywords: circulating biomarkers, CKD, cognitive impairment, dementia, genetic biomarkers 

INTRODUCTION 

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) stands as a formidable challenge to 
global health, affecting an estimated 10% of the adult population 
worldwide [1 ]. This insidious condition is marked by a gradual loss 
of kidney function, which in turn heralds a host of complications 
that significantly worsen patient outcomes. The trajectory of CKD 
often leads to increased morbidity and mortality, making it a silent 
yet potent threat to public health [2 ]. 

One of the most concerning aspects of CKD is its association 
with cognitive impairment, including both subtle cognitive prob- 
lems and overt dementia. Cognitive impairment is a broad term 
that describes any condition affecting an individual’s ability to 
think, concentrate, remember or make decisions. It can range 

from mild to severe and may affect various cognitive domains 
such as memory, attention, language and executive function. Mild 
cognitive impairment (MCI) is a condition where cognitive decline 
is noticeable but not severe enough to interfere significantly with 
daily life and activities. MCI can be a precursor to more serious 
conditions like dementia. Dementia is a syndrome characterized 
by a significant decline in cognitive function that interferes with 
daily  life  and  activities.  It  involves  deterioration  in  memory, 
thinking, behavior and the ability to perform everyday activities. 
Studies suggest that cognitive issues may affect between 30% 
and  60%  of  patients  with  CKD, which  is  a  concerningly  high 
prevalence rate compared with the general population [3 ]. These 
cognitive comorbidities are not merely incidental because they 
are  linked  to  an  increased  risk  of  negative  health  outcomes.

Patients with cognitive dysfunction are more likely to experience 
frequent hospitalizations, suffer from cardiovascular events and 
face a higher risk of mortality [4 , 5 ]. These associations underline 
the critical need for a better understanding and management of 
cognitive health within the CKD patient population. 

However, it is important to note that not all studies have found 
a consistent association between CKD and cognitive impairment 
or dementia. In a population-based study by Stocker et al . [6 ] of 
community-dwelling adults, reduced kidney function was asso- 
ciated with increased levels of dementia-related blood biomark- 
ers but not increased dementia risk, indicating that kidney func- 
tion  might  influence  the  accuracy  of  dementia-related  blood 
biomarkers, an observation that should be considered in clinical 
translation. 

The pathophysiology of cognitive decline in CKD patients is 
complex and multifactorial. Vascular disease secondary to old 
age, hypertension and diabetes is a primary driver [6 , 7 ], con- 
tributing to a range of cerebrovascular alterations. White matter 
hyperintensities, silent brain infarcts and microbleeds are com- 
mon findings in these patients, particularly those undergoing dial- 
ysis treatment [8 , 9 ]. Such cerebral changes indicate underly- 
ing vascular damage and are closely associated with cognitive 
impairment. 

Moreover, the retention of uremic solutes, commonly referred 
to as uremic toxins, exacerbates the problem by having direct 
neurotoxic effects. These toxins accumulate as the kidneys fail 
to filter and excrete waste products from the body adequately. 
The neurotoxicity of these solutes can lead to further cognitive 
decline, compounding the already significant impact of vascular 
issues. 

Additionally, there is growing evidence to suggest that CKD 
may contribute to the accumulation of amyloid beta (A β) pep- 
tides which are hallmark biomarkers of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) 
[8 ]. The presence of A β amyloid in the circulation of patients 
with CKD adds another layer to the already complex interplay 
between kidney disease and cognitive health. This accumula- 
tion may not only signal an increased risk for developing AD but 
might also suggest that CKD-related cognitive decline may share 
some  pathophysiological  mechanisms  with  neurodegenerative 
diseases. 

The relationship between CKD and cognitive dysfunction is 
thus  a  critical  area  of  study, with  significant  implications  for 
patient care and outcomes. As researchers continue to unravel 
the intricate connections between renal impairment and brain 
health, it becomes increasingly clear that a holistic approach to 
managing CKD must include strategies to preserve and enhance 
cognitive function. 

Research into genetic and circulating biomarkers of cognitive 
dysfunction or dementia in CKD is crucial since it can lead to 
early detection and targeted interventions, potentially slowing 
or preventing cognitive decline. Understanding the genetic pre- 
dispositions and biomarkers could clarify the pathophysiologi- 
cal mechanisms underlying cognitive impairments in CKD, paving 
the  way  for  personalized  medicine  approaches. This  research 
could also help stratify patient risk profiles, allowing for more 
efficient allocation of healthcare resources and better patient 
outcomes. 

In this review, we discuss the current knowledge on genetic 
variants and body fluid biomarkers associated with cognitive dys- 
function and dementia, peculiarly in the pathophysiological con- 
text of CKD, and integrate this information with knowledge at the 
population level.

KIDNEY FUNCTION AND COGNITIVE 
PROBLEMS IN CKD 

Seventeen  studies  described  the  relationship  between  kidney 
biomarkers  and  cognitive  dysfunction  or  dementia  and  CKD, 
and  six  studies  were  conducted  in  kidney  failure  (KF)  pa- 
tients on dialysis (Box 1 ). The link between cognitive function 
and kidney disease was coherently observed in several cross- 
sectional studies that adopted the estimated glomerular filtra- 
tion  rate  (eGFR)  estimated  by  creatinine-based  methods  [10 –
18 ] or Cystatin C [19 –24 ], or indicators of kidney damage like 
albuminuria [22 , 25 ]. 

Box 1: Brain alterations in CKD and KF patients. 

• MRI studies indicate increased cerebral small-vessel dis- 
ease and changes in grey matter volume in KF patients 
on dialysis.

• Functional MRI studies show alterations in neural net- 
works and improvements in cognitive impairment post- 
hemodialysis.

• NIRS studies suggest that nutritional status and kidney 

function impact cerebral oxygen saturation.

• Brain health correlation : higher eGFR correlates with 
better cognition and slower progression of mild cognitive 
impairment, while albuminuria is linked to hippocampal 
atrophy.

In a large cohort study of 7839 elderly subjects [26 ], low eGFR 
at baseline did not predict an excess incident risk of cognitive 
decline or dementia, while faster eGFR decline during the first 
4 years of the study was associated with global cognitive de- 
cline and incident dementia with a vascular component, sug- 
gesting that vascular mechanisms may mediate this association. 
On the other hand, lower eGFR was associated with worse cog- 
nitive performance and incident cognitive events, independently 
of demographics, cardiovascular risk factors and depression in 
3033 patients with CKD stages 3–4, followed for 5 years included 
in the CKD-Renal Epidemiology and Information Network (CKD 
REIN) cohort [27 ]. In the same cohort, a lower eGFR in CKD pa- 
tients was associated with early impairments in praxis, language 
and attention before an obvious cognitive decline [28 ]. In con- 
trast, in  another  longitudinal  study  of  over  5000  community- 
level elderly men, mild to moderate reductions in eGFR were as- 
sociated with poor executive function at baseline but not with 
global cognitive impairment or risk of cognitive decline in older 
men [17 ]. 

In KF patients, the link between kidney diseases and dementia 
was more solidly established. Indeed, in a study of over 300 000 
KF patients included in the US Renal Data System [29 ], the 5-year 
risk of incident dementia was 16% in women and 13% in men, and 
older patients with dementia had more than double risk of mor- 
tality as compared with dialysis patients without dementia. Simi- 
larly, cognitive dysfunction by the Mini-Mental State Examination 
(MMSE) predicted mortality in another study of 137 hemodialysis 
patients in Italy [30 ]. The risk of dementia was also high in two 
small studies, one in the late 1970s [31 ] and another in 2018 [32 ], 
and in a case series in pediatric patients [33 ].

GENETIC MARKERS OF COGNITIVE 
DYSFUNCTION AND DEMENTIA: STUDIES 
IN CKD PATIENTS AND IN OTHER 
POPULATIONS 

As alluded to before, cognitive dysfunction and dementia are in- 
creasingly recognized as key features of CKD. Identifying genetic 
variants associated with cognitive decline in CKD patients is of 
obvious relevance for improving etiologic, prognostic and thera- 
peutic knowledge of this critical alteration. At least in principle, 
genetic variants can facilitate early diagnosis and development of 
targeted therapies in this population. Until now, only four studies 
[34 –37 ] have specifically discussed genetic markers of cognitive 
dysfunction and dementia. 

Li  et  al . [34 ]  retrieved  gene  expression  datasets  in  327  pa- 
tients with AD and CKD and 318 normal individuals from the 
Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.
nih.gov/geo/) to find shared genetic biomarkers. In this analysis, 
among 150 candidate genes, JunD Proto-Oncogene (a member of 
the JUN family, functioning as a crucial component of the activat- 
ing protein, AP-1, a transcription factor with a wide range of ac- 
tions, from immunological to cell growth and differentiation, and 
gene expression in response to extracellular signals), ALF tran- 
scription elongation factor 1 (a protein that plays a crucial role 
in transcription elongation, i.e. the process of RNA synthesis dur- 
ing gene expression) and zinc finger protein 36 homolog (ZFP36) 
Like 1 (an RNA-binding protein that plays a crucial role in post- 
transcriptional control) are potential co-diagnostic markers for 
AD and CKD. The findings in this relatively small study still need 
external validation. The findings are contingent upon a distinct 
patient cohort and did not consider crucial factors such as age, 
gender, medication utilization and co-existing medical conditions. 
In a two-sample Mendelian randomization study [35 ] investi- 
gating the causal relationship between renal function and various 
neurodegenerative diseases, this study found no causative rela- 
tionship with AD and Lewy body or frontotemporal dementia and 
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis but found an association between 
multiple sclerosis and reduced eGFR. 

Similarly, another Mendelian randomization study [36 ] found 
no large causal impact of human gut microbiota features on car- 
diometabolic traits, chronic diseases or longevity. 

Finally, a genome-wide association study [37 ] based on a large 
database by an international consortium aimed to identify shared 
genetic mechanisms between kidney function and cerebrovas- 
cular disease found that reduced kidney function is potentially 
causally related to an increased risk of large artery stroke and that 
certain genetic loci are associated with both kidney function traits 
and cerebrovascular disease phenotypes. 

Given the limited knowledge of genetic factors in the gen- 
eral population and disease states and the minuscule informa- 
tion on CKD, several areas warrant further investigation to bet- 
ter understand the genetic basis of cognitive dysfunction and de- 
mentia in CKD (Table 1 ). Despite significant advancements, sev- 
eral gaps remain in understanding the genetic underpinnings of 
cognitive dysfunction in CKD. Current studies often suffer from 
limited sample sizes, which restricts the ability to identify novel 
genetic  markers  and  validate  existing  ones.  Additionally,  the 
complex interplay between genetic and environmental factors in 
cognitive decline among CKD patients is largely unknown, neces- 
sitating comprehensive investigations into gene–gene and gene–
environment interactions. The role of epigenetic modifications, 
such as DNA methylation and histone modifications, has been 
scarcely explored in this context. To address these gaps, lever- 

aging advances in genomics and bioinformatics is crucial. This 
includes conducting larger and more diverse genome-wide asso- 
ciation studies (GWAS) and promoting interdisciplinary collabo- 
rations between experts in nephrology, neurology, genetics and 
other relevant fields. Furthermore, incorporating genetic mark- 
ers into personalized medicine approaches and fostering inter- 
national collaborations and data sharing will be essential for ad- 
vancing our understanding and developing targeted interventions 
for CKD-related cognitive complications. Research on cognitive 
resilience and cognitive reserve in CKD patients is still in its in- 
fancy. Cognitive resilience, the capacity to maintain or recover 
cognitive function despite neuropathological changes or other 
risk factors, has not been extensively studied in relation to ge- 
netic markers. Similarly, the role of genetic factors in cognitive re- 
serve, which involves the ability to withstand neuropathological 
changes and maintain cognitive function through compensatory 
neural networks and cognitive strategies, remains underexplored. 
Identifying genetic factors associated with cognitive resilience 
and reserve, and understanding their molecular pathways, could 
provide  valuable  insights  for  potential  therapeutic  strategies. 
Additionally, investigating genetic markers linked to specific cog- 
nitive domains, such as memory and executive function, will help 
elucidate diverse neurobiological mechanisms underlying cogni- 
tive decline in CKD patients. 

The influence of demographic factors, such as sex and age, on 
the relationship between genetic markers and cognitive dysfunc- 
tion in CKD patients is not well understood. Investigating how 
these demographic factors interact with genetic markers is cru- 
cial for developing a more nuanced understanding of cognitive 
decline in this population. This research could reveal important 
insights into the differential impact of genetic factors across vari- 
ous demographic groups, ultimately informing more personalized 
approaches to prevention and treatment. 

Mitochondrial  genetics  and  pharmacogenetics  represent 
promising  but  underexplored  areas  in  the  study  of  cognitive 
dysfunction in CKD. Variations in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) 
may  contribute  to  cognitive  decline  and  mitochondrial  dys- 
function  in  CKD  patients,  yet  this  area  has  received  limited 
attention.  Additionally, the  role  of  non-coding  RNAs,  such  as 
microRNAs (miRNAs) and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), in 
the pathogenesis of cognitive dysfunction in CKD warrants fur- 
ther investigation. Understanding how genetic factors influence 
the  response  to  medications  for  cognitive  dysfunction  could 
optimize personalized treatment plans. Research in these areas 
could enhance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms 
driving cognitive decline and lead to more effective therapeutic 
strategies. 

The integrity of the blood–brain barrier and its role in cogni- 
tive decline in CKD patients is another critical area that requires 
further exploration. Genetic factors affecting blood–brain barrier 
integrity and cerebrovascular function could provide insights into 
the mechanisms underlying cognitive dysfunction. Additionally, 
the potential of gene therapy as a novel approach to prevent or 
treat cognitive dysfunction in CKD based on genetic markers is 
an exciting avenue for future research. Investigating these aspects 
could lead to innovative strategies for preserving brain health in 
individuals with CKD. 

Translating genetic findings into clinical practice remains a sig- 
nificant challenge. Assessing the practical application of genetic 
markers for risk prediction, early diagnosis and monitoring cog- 
nitive decline in CKD patients is essential for advancing person- 
alized medicine. Moreover, increasing public awareness about the 
genetic factors involved in CKD-related cognitive decline and the

importance of early detection and intervention is crucial. Public 
education efforts can help promote early diagnosis and timely in- 
tervention, ultimately improving outcomes for CKD patients at 
risk of cognitive decline. Addressing these diverse research ar- 
eas will help identify novel genetic markers, elucidate molecular 
mechanisms underlying cognitive decline, and develop targeted 
interventions to prevent or treat cognitive dysfunction and de- 
mentia in CKD patients. Ultimately, these efforts will improve the 
overall quality of life for individuals affected by CKD and its asso- 
ciated complications. 

IMAGING STUDIES IN CKD 

Fourteen studies based on standard magnetic resonance imag- 
ing (MRI) [38 –41 ] functional magnetic resonance [42 –45 ], diffu- 
sion kurtosis imaging [46 , 47 ], evoked potentials [48 , 49 ], near in- 
frared spectroscopy (NIRS) [50 ] and electroencephalographic and 
radionuclide [51 ] focused on brain alterations in CKD and KF 
(Box 2 ). 

Box 2: Kidney biomarkers and cognitive 

dysfunction/dementia. 

• Cross-sectional  studies :  various  studies  using  eGFR 
(creatinine-based and Cystatin C methods) and albumin- 
uria as markers consistently associated cognitive dys- 
function with kidney disease.

• Longitudinal studies : low eGFR did not predict cogni- 
tive decline, but a rapid decline was associated with de- 
mentia, particularly with a vascular component. Mild to 
moderate eGFR reductions were linked to poor executive 
function but not global cognitive impairment in elderly 
men.

• A solid link has been observed between KF and dementia, 
and KF patients also showed a significant risk of demen- 
tia and increased mortality in KF patients with dementia.

• Various biomarkers related to AD and dementia, such 
as A β peptides, tau proteins, NfL and others, are altered 
in CKD patients, suggesting potential mechanisms link- 
ing CKD to cognitive impairment. However, studies per- 
formed so far are observational and, as such, merely 
hypothesis-generating.

hemodialysis improves these patients’ cognitive impairment and 
neurovascular coupling [44 ]. It is important to reconcile these 
findings with the notion that hemodynamic instability during 
hemodialysis sessions may alter cerebral blood flow and cause 
ischemia, potentially leading to cognitive dysfunction. The ob- 
served improvements in cognitive impairment and neurovascu- 
lar coupling post-hemodialysis suggest that while hemodialysis 
may pose risks, it also has the potential to ameliorate some of 
the adverse effects on brain function. Therefore, the relation- 
ship  between  hemodialysis, cerebral  blood  flow  and  cognitive 
outcomes is likely multifaceted, involving both detrimental and 
beneficial effects. Further research is needed to elucidate the 
precise mechanisms and to optimize hemodialysis protocols to 
minimize hemodynamic instability and its impact on cerebral 
health. 

In a study involving individuals without or with mild cognitive 
impairment and normal renal function, higher eGFR was associ- 
ated with larger hippocampal volume and better cognition [39 ]. 
Additionally, individuals with mild cognitive impairment in the 
highest eGFR group had a lower disease progression rate com- 
pared with those in the intermediate eGFR group. However, an- 
other study found that albuminuria, not the eGFR, was associated 
with hippocampal atrophy [45 ]. 

NIRS has revealed associations between cerebral regional satu- 
ration of oxygen and energy intake, serum albumin concentration 
and haemoglobin levels in predialysis CKD patients [50 ]. This sug- 
gests that nutritional status and kidney function may influence 
cerebral oxygen saturation. 

In a study involving individuals without or with mild cognitive 
impairment and normal renal function, higher eGFR was associ- 
ated with larger hippocampal volume and better cognition [40 ]. 
Additionally, individuals with mild cognitive impairment in the 
highest eGFR group had a lower disease progression rate com- 
pared with those in the intermediate eGFR group. However, an- 
other study found that albuminuria, not the eGFR, was associated 
with hippocampal atrophy [46 ]. 

Interestingly, mild  to  moderate  renal  insufficiency  was  not 
found to be related to brain imaging features of AD in a study in- 
volving community-dwelling older adults without dementia [42 ]. 
These studies highlight the complex relationship between kid- 
ney function and brain health and indicate that further research 
is needed to understand the mechanisms underlying these asso- 
ciations and to develop strategies for preserving brain health in 
individuals with kidney disease. 

CIRCULATING AND BODY FLUIDS 
BIOMARKERS OF AD IN CKD 

These studies provide insights into the relationship between 
kidney function and brain health. The MRI-based studies showed 
that individuals with KF on dialysis have an increased prevalence 
of cerebral small-vessel disease, as indicated by the presence of 
cerebral microbleeds and white matter hyperintensity [41 ]. These 
patients exhibit increased grey matter volume in certain brain re- 
gions, such as the bilateral caudate and thalamus, particularly in 
secondary hyperparathyroidism [39 ]. 

Biomarkers  of  kidney  disease,  such  as  eGFR  and  urinary 
albumin-to-creatinine ratio, have been independently associated 
with  brain  changes  and  microstructural  alterations  observed 
through diffusion tensor imaging [46 ]. 

Functional magnetic resonance studies documented that KF 
patients have alterations in multiple neural networks associated 
with cognitive scores and indicators of kidney function [43 ] and 

Eighteen studies in CKD and KF patients [52 –68 ] focused on the re- 
lationship between biomarkers of AD/dementia and CKD. These 
biomarkers (Fig. 1 ) include (i) plasma A β1–42 and 40 [69 ]—the 
dominant peptide in vascular dementia and the soluble circu- 
lating form of the same peptide (A β40), which is raised in KF 
patients [52 ], (ii) P-tau181 and P-tau217 [70 ], i.e. two phosphory- 
lated tau proteins that have been associated with AD and that 
are increased in CKD [53 , 55 ], (iii) neurofilament light (NfL) [71 ], 
a biomarker of axonal injury that is associated with the preva- 
lent and incident risk for CKD in the Gothenburg H70 Birth Co- 
hort Study [54 ] and, independently of CKD, with cognitive impair- 
ment and a high risk of death in the general population [59 ], (iv) 
S100B [72 ], a marker for glial dysfunction and blood–brain barrier 
disruption that attains high levels and associates with cognitive 
impairment in KF patients [64 ], (v) glycogen synthase kinase-3 β

(GSK3 β), a serine/threonine protein kinase involved in regulating 
glycogen metabolism implicated in AD [73 ] that shows high levels 
in CKD [65 ], (vi) amyloid precursor protein (APP), a biomarker that 
is reduced both in AD [74 ] and in CKD patients [66 ], (vii) ADAM10, 
the main α-secretase that participates in the non-amyloidogenic 
cleavage of APP and is increased in AD [75 ] but paradoxically de- 
creased in CKD patients [66 ], (viii) BACE1, the β-secretase enzyme 
reflecting A β peptides production in AD [76 ] that is increased in 
CKD [66 ], (ix) presenilin 1 (PS1), a key component of the gamma- 
secretase complex that cleaves APP and contributes to the pro- 
duction of A β peptides in AD [77 ] and in CKD patients [66 ] and 
(x) lipid peroxidation (LPO) products that are raised both in AD 
[78 ] and in CKD patients [66 ]. Finally, miRNA related to inflamma- 
tion and senescence are deranged in CKD and KF patients [79 ], but 
their role in cognitive problems has not been specifically investi- 
gated in these patients. 

Overall,  these  studies  should  be  inherently  considered 
hypothesis-generating  rather  than  hypothesis-testing  because 
their  design  was  purely  observational. Furthermore, the  diag- 
nostic value of the same biomarkers remains unknown because 
none of the studies summarized here reported information on the 
diagnostic discrimination of the biomarkers being investigated. 

MISCELLANEOUS BIOMARKERS 

Nineteen  miscellaneous  biomarkers—including  gut  microbiota 
[80 , 81 ], CKD metabolic bone disorder (CKD-MBD) biomarkers [82 –
85 ] metabolic biomarkers, hypertension [86 –88 ], endothelial dys- 
function [89 ], vitamins [90 , 91 ], inflammation [92 , 93 ], and ure- 
mic toxins and other biomarkers [94 –96 ]—have been associated 
with cognitive dysfunction and dementia in the CKD population 
(Box 3 ). 

Box 3: Miscellaneous biomarkers and cognitive 

dysfunction in CKD. 

• Gut microbiota : differences in gut microbiome composi- 

tion may impact cognitive function in CKD patients.

• CKD-MBD  biomarkers :  certain  biomarkers,  such  as 
serum Klotho and FGF23, are associated with cognitive 
performance and the risk of dementia, respectively.

• Metabolic biomarkers : high IGF-1 levels correlate with 
better cognitive status; uncontrolled hypertension im- 
pacts AD biomarkers.

• Endothelial dysfunction : implicated in cognitive impair- 

ment in KF patients on dialysis.

• Inflammation : inflammation markers like CRP are asso- 

ciated with attention impairment.

• Vitamins : vitamin imbalances are not clearly linked to 

cognitive impairment.

Gut microbiota 
In  a  recent  study  [80 ],  differences  in  gut  microbiome  abun- 
dance (the 16S rRNA analysis) and structure between peritoneal 
dialysis and non-dialysis KF patients have been reported, and 
differences among patients with and without cognitive impair- 
ment within the peritoneal dialysis group. Other observations 
[81 ] identified alterations in gut microbiota profiles and serum 
metabolites in haemodialysis patients with mild cognitive de- 
cline.  Specific  gut  bacteria  were  significantly  different  in  pa- 
tients with mild cognitive dysfunction than healthy controls or 
those with normal cognitive function. Twenty-one serum metabo- 
lites were altered in those with cognitive dysfunction, indicat- 
ing  their  potential  as  biomarkers  for  this  alteration  in  these 
patients. 

CKD-MBD biomarkers 
A  recent  study  [11 ]  described  a  positive  relationship  between 
serum α-Klotho and cognitive function in older CKD patients with 
albuminuria. This suggests that higher α-Klotho levels may favor- 
ably impact cognitive performance in this population. In contrast, 
the co-receptor of α-Klotho, fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), 
was directly associated with an increased risk of incident demen- 
tia and AD [82 ] in a large cohort of dementia-free individuals in 
the Framingham offspring study. Low 25-hydroxyvitamin D, a key

alteration in the CKD-MBD scenario, had an unfavorable impact 
on cognitive function in a cross-sectional study in 255 KF patients 
on hemodialysis [85 ]. Hypothetically, serum phosphate has also 
been implicated in cognitive dysfunction in CKD [97 ]. 

Metabolic biomarkers, hypertension and 
endothelial dysfunction 
High levels of serum Insulin Growth Factor 1 (IGF-1), an impor- 
tant growth hormone mediating the protein anabolic effect of pi- 
tuitary growth hormone, correlated with better cognitive status, 
in KF patients on dialysis [88 ]. Uncontrolled hypertension, dyslipi- 
demia, diabetes and CKD all impact biomarkers of AD, including 
A β40, A β42, total tau and NfL chain [86 ]. 

Endothelial dysfunction, an alteration that can lead to reduced 
blood flow to the brain, is another biomarker implicated in cog- 
nitive impairment in KF patients on dialysis [89 ]. High homocys- 
teine, an amino acid that alters endothelial function, is associated 
with cognitive dysfunction in middle-aged and older adults with 
CKD [98 ] and in diabetic patients [99 ]. 

Vitamins 
Deficiencies or imbalances in certain vitamins and other nutri- 
ents may affect brain health and cognitive performance. However, 
neither vitamin B12, folate [90 ] nor vitamin K [91 ] were linked to 
cognitive impairment in CKD patients. 

Inflammation and angiogenesis 
Inflammation plays a crucial role in the pathophysiology of CKD 
[100 ] and cognitive dysfunction [101 ]. In analyses made in the 
Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC), raised high sensitivity 
C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), fibrinogen and interleukin (IL)-1b sig- 
naled an independent risk of impairment in attention compared 
with participants with lower levels of the same biomarkers [99 ]. 

In a recent analysis in the Swedish BioFINDER study [102 ], the 
rate of fall in cognitive function tests was higher in 247 patients 
with mild cognitive impairment at baseline than in a group of 497 
individuals with normal cognitive function. At baseline, higher 
levels cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of Placental Growth Factor (PlGF, a 
marker of angiogenesis), lower levels of soluble fms-related tyro- 
sine kinase (1 sFlt-1, an anti-angiogenic marker) and higher levels 
of IL-8 were associated with more white matter lesions in individ- 
uals without cognitive problems, while in patients with mild cog- 
nitive impairment higher levels of PlGF, IL-16, IL-6 and IL-8, and 
the angiogenic factors Vascular Growth Factor A and D, were all 
associated with the same outcome measure. Longitudinal analy- 
ses over an 8-year follow-up showed independent effects of CSF 
inflammatory markers and white matter lesions on cognition, es- 
pecially in people without cognitive impairment at baseline, indi- 
cating a continuum in the normal range of the link between these 
biomarkers and cognitive function. 

Uremic toxins 
Uremic toxins such as indoxyl sulphate and paracresyl sulphate 
might in theory influence the increased prevalence of cerebrovas- 
cular and neurological signs and symptoms in patients with CKD. 
However, the clinical studies that have evaluated the correlation 
between neurologic symptoms and uremic toxin levels are rather 
scarce and inconclusive [94 ]. 

It is important to note that the biomarkers discussed above 
are not mutually exclusive and may interact with each other and 
with other factors to influence cognitive function in CKD patients. 
Understanding their individual and combined contributions to 

cognitive impairment fully and developing targeted interventions 
for preserving cognitive health in this population remains a chal- 
lenge for future studies in CKD. 

An open question is why dementia is so often accelerated in 
CKD patients and whether CKD patients exhibit an increased risk 
of A β aggregation. In the last decade, the glymphatic system has 
emerged as the most important export route for A β and pro- 
tein waste, such as tau and synuclein involved in neurodegener- 
ative diseases [103 ]. The glymphatic system transports CSF along 
perivascular spaces from where the water channel, aquaporin- 
4, supports the concept that CSF infiltrates the brain’s extra- 
cellular spaces. The excess fluid and waste proteins leave the 
parenchyma along perivenous spaces and cranial nerves, from 
where meningeal and cervical lymphatic vessels drain into the 
venous system. The glymphatic system is primarily active during 
sleep, raising the hypothesis that sleep disturbances that are com- 
mon in CKD patients contribute to the progressive loss of cognitive 
function [104 ]. Glymphatic function was analysed using the diffu- 
sion tensor image analysis—a technique that measures the rate 
and direction of water diffusion in the brain—along the perivas- 
cular space (DTI-ALPS), and the DPTI-ALPS index was significantly 
reduced in patients with KF compared with aged-matched con- 
trols [105 ]. 

Given the shared risk factors and pathological mechanisms be- 
tween AD and CKD, the limited knowledge gathered so far and 
some internal contradictions of the current literature, there is a 
pressing need to identify and validate novel biomarkers of cogni- 
tive dysfunction and dementia in CKD patients. Further research 
should investigate the role of these potential biomarkers, individ- 
ually and in combination, in the early diagnosis, prognosis and 
treatment of cognitive impairment in CKD. Identifying reliable cir- 
culating biomarkers will ultimately facilitate timely interventions 
and improve the quality of life for CKD patients with cognitive 
dysfunction (Table 2 ). 

FUTURE DIRECTIONS AND CHALLENGES 

CKD-related cognitive dysfunction research faces several chal- 
lenges that remain to be addressed. 

Most studies reviewed here were cross-sectional. There is a 
need for large-scale, longitudinal studies to establish the tem- 
poral relationship between CKD progression and cognitive de- 
cline. Such studies would enable the identification of at-risk pop- 
ulations and provide insights into the natural history of cogni- 
tive dysfunction in this population. A recent large study in the 
general population with a 20-year longitudinal observation in 
China [106 ] showed that CSF and imaging biomarkers in AD, in- 
cluding A β42, the ratio of A β42 to A β40, phosphorylated tau181, 
total  tau,  NfL  and  hippocampal  volume  diverged  from  those 
without  cognitive  problems  18  (A β42)  to  9  (hippocampal  vol- 
ume)  years  before  diagnosis. In  comparison, measurable  cog- 
nitive decline  was  detected  only  6  years  before  the  diagnosis 
of AD. 

Combining different types of biomarkers, such as blood-based, 
CSF, neuroimaging  and  genetic  markers, may  provide  a  more 
comprehensive understanding of the pathophysiology of cogni- 
tive  dysfunction  in  CKD. This  integrated  approach  could  lead 
to the development of more accurate diagnostic and prognostic 
tools. 

There is an urgent need for intervention trials targeting modifi- 
able risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes and dyslipidemia, 
as  well  as  investigating  the  efficacy  of  pharmacological  and

non-pharmacological therapies in preventing or slowing cognitive 
decline in CKD patients. 

The  identification  and  validation  of  reliable  circulating 
biomarkers  for  cognitive  dysfunction  and  dementia  in  CKD 
patients  is  an  important  research  priority,  given  the  shared 
risk  factors  and  pathological  mechanisms  between  AD  and 
CKD.  Addressing  these  challenges  will  not  only  improve  our 
understanding of the relationship between CKD and cognitive 
dysfunction  but  also  facilitate  the  development  of  targeted 
interventions to improve the quality of life for CKD patients with 
cognitive impairment. 

CONCLUSION 

Cognitive dysfunction and dementia are significant comorbidities 
in CKD patients, contributing to increased morbidity and mor- 
tality. Circulating biomarkers, including inflammatory markers, 
uremic toxins and metabolic factors, and gut microbiota, offer 
promising avenues for the early diagnosis and monitoring of cog- 
nitive decline in this population.
