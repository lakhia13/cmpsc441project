Abstract: Creation is an important part of many interventions in creative arts therapies (art, music,
dance, and drama therapy). This active part of art-making in arts therapies has not yet been
closely investigated. The present study commits to this ﬁeld of research using a mixed-methods
design to investigate the effects of active creation on health-related psychological outcomes. In an
artistic inquiry within an experimental design, N = 44 participants engaged in active art-making
for eight minutes in the presence of the researcher (ﬁrst author) with a choice of artistic materials:
paper and colors for drawing and writing, musical instruments, space for moving or performing.
Before and after the creation, participants completed a well-being, a self-efﬁcacy and an experience of
creation scale, and in addition found their own words to express the experiences during the activity.
We hypothesized that the experience of empowerment, freedom, impact, and creativity (Experience
of Creation Scale) mediates the positive effect of active creation on the outcomes of self-efﬁcacy and
well-being, and evaluated this assumption with a mediation analysis. Results suggest that the effect
of active creation on both self-efﬁcacy and well-being is signiﬁcantly mediated by the Experience
of Creation Scale. This article focuses on the quantitative side of the investigation. During the
process, qualitative and quantitative results were triangulated for a more valid evaluation and jointly
contribute to the emerging theory frame of embodied aesthetics.

1. Introduction

Creative arts therapies (CATs) are applied in clinical and psychiatric settings and increasingly
report positive health-related outcomes [1]. Despite the effective practice, scientiﬁc research is needed
in order to understand exactly how CATs work [2]. This understanding is relevant not only within
therapeutic work, but also for the positioning of CATs in the health sector [3].

Trudi Schoop, a pioneer of dance movement therapy, acknowledges creation as a main element in
her therapeutic work [4]. Similarly, creation has been described as crucial in the different creative arts
therapies’ disciplines [5–8]. Based on Schoop’s deﬁnition, the term creation is understood in this study
as an autonomous process of shaping, in which all decisions are bound to the creating person. In order
to frame creation as a therapeutic intervention theoretically, we employed the Model of Embodied
Aesthetics [2] (p. 87), Figure 1.

Figure 1. The Model of Embodied Aesthetics with loosely assigned therapeutic factors [2] (p. 89).

In the model, the active and receptive side of art-making are conceptualized in a circular
manner, with expression and impression forming a unity. Since cognitive science models lack the
conceptualization of the active side of art-making [2], the model of embodied aesthetics is necessary to
represent the main workings of arts therapies and ground the respective therapeutic working factors.
Creation as an aesthetic process is located on the active side. This research focuses on this only recently
modelled active side (expression, art making; see lower part of Figure 1) in order to understand more
closely its factors at work.

There are publications about the therapeutic factors in different CATs: Hillecke and Wilker (2007)
develop a model for music therapy, Koch and Eberhard-Kaechele describe therapeutic factors for dance
movement therapy, and Oepen does so for art therapy [9–11]. Imus describes the creative process as a
general criterion in all CATs and emphasizes that in the different disciplines the creative process is
utilized in a similar way [12]. In the present study, we examined the act of creating and its implications
for the health-related psychological outcomes of well-being and self-efﬁcacy. Our focus lies on the
active and the creative across all creative arts therapies, not the speciﬁcity of each artistic discipline.
Koch hypothesised therapeutic factors of CATs bound to the Model of Embodied Aesthetics, but there
are only very few empirical studies about these factors of CATs [2] (p. 89). This study focuses on the
overarching effect of creation across arts modalities in one single intermodal intervention and asks:
Does creation positively affect our psychological health?

Following the WHO’s multidimensional deﬁnition of health from 1948 we understand health
as physical, psychological and social well-being [13]. In this study, we focused on the health-related
psychological outcomes of well-being, as conceptualized by Goodill [14] and operationalized by Koch
and colleagues [15,16], and of self-efﬁcacy, as Bandura conceptualized it as fundamental for human
health [17], and Schwarzer and Jerusalem operationalized it [18] in the General Self Efﬁcacy-scale (GSE).
Based on working 18 years in the arts creating dances and performances together with both
professionals and amateurs, the ﬁrst author (GL) constructed a scale of four experience- and
observation-based items to be tested in the context of the following research question: Does the
experience of empowerment, freedom, impact, and creativity mediate the positive effect of active
creation on human health?

2. Materials and Methods

The study was set up as a mixed-methods design as described in Figure 2. We used a concurrent
combination of two state-of-the-art methods for analyzing questions on working factors/mechanisms:
mediation analysis [19], as recommended by the National Institute of Health (NIH) of the USA for
analysis of therapeutic mechanisms in the (integrative) health sciences, and artistic inquiry as a
state-of-the-art method development unique to the arts therapies. Within an experimental frame,
artistic inquiry was used for qualitative data collection and analysis [20], and mediation analysis for
quantitative data analysis [19]. A triangulation approach was implemented to let the methods inform
each other. The researchers take a humanistic clinical stance and a transformational epistemological
stance (compare Creswell & Creswell [21]; Mertens & Hesse-Biber [22]).

Figure 2. Process model of the study.

2.1. Sample

Forty-four participants (7 men, 37 women) took part in the study at SRH University, Germany.
The sample consisted of students of dance movement therapy, music therapy, and occupational therapy,
with a mean age of 25.98 years (standard deviation: SD = 6.67, age range: 19–52). They were divided
into an experimental group (EG, N = 21; 19 women and 2 men) and a control group (CG, N = 23;
18 women and 5 men). See Table 1 for details on demographic data. Power estimations indicate that
in a model with one mediator, N = 44 participants reach a power of 0.81 (with an aspired power of
0.80 in this feasibility study), assuming correlations of r = 0.7 between the independent variable X,
the dependent variable Y, and the mediator M (estimated with the online-tool by Schoemann and
colleagues [23]: https://schoemanna.shinyapps.io/mc_power_med/).

We announced the experiment, using students’ mailing lists of SRH University, and went into
students’ courses and addressed students directly on-site at SRH campus during their breaks. A mailing
list was created, and a doodle calendar with an invitation to participate was sent out. We announced
that the study takes a closer look at creating, that they should have previous experience with
artistic media, that the participants would need to improvise alone in an individual setting choosing
movement, music, colors, and/or words, that the researcher would answer in an improvisation,
and that there would be questionnaires to complete. We advertised that we would provide chocolate
bars and course credit (certiﬁcates of participation hours needed by students) as a reward. In order to
recruit as many participants as possible, students could inscribe using a doodle calendar. The sample

The sample was thus not randomized, but t-test and Chi-square test yielded that there were no significant baseline differences between EG and CG (all p-values > 0.279). We identified three Behav.

was thus not randomized, but t-test and Chi-square test yielded that there were no signiﬁcant baseline
differences between EG and CG (all p-values > 0.279). We identiﬁed three systematic outliers in the
EG for the outcome of well-being and excluded them in the according analyses. Thus, 41 participants
(19 EG, 22 CG) remained in the analysis of well-being, and 44 participants (22 EG, 22 CG) remained in
the analysis of self-efﬁcacy. The CG participants participated in one of two regular classes (either on
theories and techniques of supervision or conceptualization of health and sickness) completing the
identical questionnaires at the beginning and in the end of the class. They were contacted through
their professor, and the researcher (ﬁrst author) was present before the start of their classes to raise
attention for the study and clarify questions.

2.2. Procedure

The individual settings were conducted in a 75 m2-music therapy room at SRH University
Heidelberg. It was equipped with mats, a lounge area, materials for visual arts, and 62 instruments.
Two video cameras and an audio recorder were prepared (for exact lists for replication purposes,
please contact ﬁrst author.) EG participants were welcomed. If they did not know the space, they were
invited to look around and get acquainted with the environment. Then, the participant was asked to
sit down with the researcher in the lounge area in order to be introduced to the study. The participant
signed the informed consent sheet and ﬁlled out the ﬁrst questionnaire (t1) after receiving information
about coding. Then the researcher gave a short introduction, asked her counterpart what the term
“Gestalten” (creating) means for him or her and ended with a description of what to expect following a
protocol (please contact the ﬁrst author for German original instructions.). Participants were asked
to improvise with movement, music, colors and/or words for a maximum of eight min. They were
allowed to use any media and could also stop earlier (see Figures 3, 4, 7 and 8 for illustrating examples
of resulting visual art creations). Timing was controlled, movement videotaped, and music recorded.
The opening question for the improvisation was: What happens inside yourself when you create?

words that emerged from the artistic inquiry in this study.

Afterward, participants and researcher (GL) independently phrased an expression in written
words about what they just had experienced followed by a verbal exchange. A questionnaire was
then ﬁlled in for the second time (t2). As a further step, the researcher improvised in reaction to the
participant’s improvisation under the same conditions (8 min; all media). Again, participant and
researcher phrased an expression capturing their experience, had a verbal exchange, and the
questionnaire was then completed for the last time (t3). Ending the session, participants could choose

These two measurement points in EG and CG, served in the quantitative analyses reported here.    Figure 3. These photos show the first four examples/details of the creations with paper, color, and/or words that emerged from the artistic inquiry in this study. 2.3. Materials and Instruments The room was prepared with four pieces of paper. At each wall one of them was attached reading either “Movement” or “Music” or “Words” or “Colors/Forms”. The offered musical instruments were a timbale, a drum set, a kettledrum, 5 congas, 3 djembés, 2 tambourines, a vibraphone, a marimbaphone, a xylophone, a glockenspiel, 6 boomwhackers, 6 chimes, a metallophone, a bass chime, a tomtom, a tympanum the size of a table, a bigbom, 4 claves, a temple block, a pair of maracas, a cabaza, 2 caxixis, a cajon, a triangle, an agogobell, a gong, a singing bowle, a thumb piano, an ocean drum, a kazoo, a rain maker, a piano, a guitar, a bowed psaltery, a lyre, a monochord, an accordion, an aerophone, a soprano recorder, an alto recorder, and a slide whistle. The offered visual arts materials were normal paper in A3, thicker paper in A4, 3 pens, 28 wax oil crayons, 12 water color pencils, 24 pastels, different qualities pencils with eraser, and a sharpener. Technical devices were a Zoom H2n audio recorder, a canon camcorder (Legria HF20) (Uxbridge, UK), and a Fujifilm camera (Finepix S1800) (Minato-ku, Tokyo). Well-being was measured with the Heidelberg State Inventory (HSI; [15,16]; see Appendix A). The six dimensions of positive affect, coping, fear, depressive affect, tension, and vitality were assessed each with four items. Two items were phrased in correspondence with the positive pole of the dimension, two items were inverted. A vitality-item was “Right now I feel full of energy”. An inverted fear-item was “Right now I feel without sorrow”. These items are to be rated on a scale where “1” means “very low well-being” and “5” “very high well-being”. In this study, the HSI showed a high internal consistency of Cronbach’s α = 0.95. Self-efficacy was measured with the General Self-Efficacy Scale (GSE; [18,24]). Sample items are “When I am confronted with a problem, I can usually find several solutions. “or “If I am in trouble, I can usually think of a solution”. Ten items are rated on a scale from “1” ”not at all true” to “4” “exactly true”. Internal consistencies in international studies resulted in Cronbach’s α = 0.86 in a sample of N = 19.120 [25], the same value resulted in this study. For this study, the Experience of Creation Scale (ECS; [26]) has been designed consisting of four items (see Appendix B). These items are “Right now I feel empowered”, “Right now I feel free to Behav. Sci. 2018, 8, x FOR PEER REVIEW  6 of 17 decide”, “Right now I feel I have impact”, and “Right now I feel creative” (translated by first author). Participants rated these items on a scale from “1” meaning “not at all true” to “5” meaning “exactly true”. Its internal consistency was Cronbach’s α = 0.89. The opening question at the start of the improvisation was: What happens inside yourself when you create? The reflective question after creation was: What did you experience while creating? In both cases, the active person had approximately two minutes to write an answer. Resulting statements were collected. 2.4. Statistical Analysis The new measure ECS was tested with factor analysis and reliability analysis. For between-group effects, we computed a repeated measures ANOVA using the Greenhouse-Geisser-value controlling for problems with sphericity. The alpha-level was set at 0.05. To determine correlations between scales, we used Pearson’s correlation coefficient. Mediation analysis [19] was conducted in order to determine the effect of ECS. Mediation analysis is based on regression analysis. Both the indirect and direct effect of the independent variable (X) on the outcome variable (Y) are being reported and interpreted. The indirect effect ab is the product of the regression coefficients of the regression of X on the mediator variable (M) a and the regression of M on Y b. The direct effect is called c’. For mediation analysis, we conducted multiple linear regression analyses with the Macro PROCESS for SPSS 22 (IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY, USA) from Hayes [19]. For all effects, we report unstandardized regression coefficients [19]. We used bias-corrected boot-strapping obtained with 10,000 resamples [19]. 2.5. Mixed Methods Analysis On the background of a transformational epistemological framework [22], data transformation [21] was used as a validation strategy on multiple levels, transforming qualitative into quantitative data; transforming qualitative verbal data into categories, sequencing them and feeding them back into the theory model; transforming qualitative artistic data into different artistic and verbal modalities; and synergizing all data into one final performance of the first author (GL) as an artistic result of the analysis (see [27]) following the leading questions: What is the essence of each creation? How can they be combined into an entity, accommodating each single mode of expression?   Figure 4. Photos of the second four creations with paper, color, and/or words that emerged from the artistic inquiry in this study.   Behav. Sci. 2018, 8, 25

from a choice of chocolate bars. We concurrently provided the certiﬁcates of participation hours,
debriefed the participants, and thanked them for attending. One session took about 45 to 50 min.
CG participants followed regular class without artistic creating and completed two questionnaires at t1
and t2. These two measurement points in EG and CG, served in the quantitative analyses reported here.

2.3. Materials and Instruments

The room was prepared with four pieces of paper. At each wall one of them was attached reading
either “Movement” or “Music” or “Words” or “Colors/Forms”. The offered musical instruments were a
timbale, a drum set, a kettledrum, 5 congas, 3 djembés, 2 tambourines, a vibraphone, a marimbaphone,
a xylophone, a glockenspiel, 6 boomwhackers, 6 chimes, a metallophone, a bass chime, a tomtom,
a tympanum the size of a table, a bigbom, 4 claves, a temple block, a pair of maracas, a cabaza, 2 caxixis,
a cajon, a triangle, an agogobell, a gong, a singing bowle, a thumb piano, an ocean drum, a kazoo,
a rain maker, a piano, a guitar, a bowed psaltery, a lyre, a monochord, an accordion, an aerophone,
a soprano recorder, an alto recorder, and a slide whistle. The offered visual arts materials were
normal paper in A3, thicker paper in A4, 3 pens, 28 wax oil crayons, 12 water color pencils, 24 pastels,
different qualities pencils with eraser, and a sharpener. Technical devices were a Zoom H2n audio
recorder, a canon camcorder (Legria HF20) (Uxbridge, UK), and a Fujiﬁlm camera (Finepix S1800)
(Minato-ku, Tokyo, Japan).

Well-being was measured with the Heidelberg State Inventory (HSI; [15,16]; see Appendix A).
The six dimensions of positive affect, coping, fear, depressive affect, tension, and vitality were assessed

means “very low well-being” and “5” “very high well-being”. In this study, the HSI showed a high
internal consistency of Cronbach’s α = 0.95.

Self-efﬁcacy was measured with the General Self-Efﬁcacy Scale (GSE; [18,24]). Sample items are
“When I am confronted with a problem, I can usually ﬁnd several solutions. “or “If I am in trouble,
I can usually think of a solution”. Ten items are rated on a scale from “1” ”not at all true” to “4” “exactly
true”. Internal consistencies in international studies resulted in Cronbach’s α = 0.86 in a sample of
N = 19.120 [25], the same value resulted in this study.

For this study, the Experience of Creation Scale (ECS; [26]) has been designed consisting of four
items (see Appendix B). These items are “Right now I feel empowered”, “Right now I feel free to
decide”, “Right now I feel I have impact”, and “Right now I feel creative” (translated by ﬁrst author).
Participants rated these items on a scale from “1” meaning “not at all true” to “5” meaning “exactly
true”. Its internal consistency was Cronbach’s α = 0.89.

The opening question at the start of the improvisation was: What happens inside yourself when
you create? The reﬂective question after creation was: What did you experience while creating? In both
cases, the active person had approximately two minutes to write an answer. Resulting statements
were collected.

2.4. Statistical Analysis

The new measure ECS was tested with factor analysis and reliability analysis. For between-group
effects, we computed a repeated measures ANOVA using the Greenhouse-Geisser-value controlling
for problems with sphericity. The alpha-level was set at 0.05. To determine correlations between
scales, we used Pearson’s correlation coefﬁcient. Mediation analysis [19] was conducted in order to
determine the effect of ECS. Mediation analysis is based on regression analysis. Both the indirect
and direct effect of the independent variable (X) on the outcome variable (Y) are being reported and
interpreted. The indirect effect ab is the product of the regression coefﬁcients of the regression of X on
the mediator variable (M) a and the regression of M on Y b. The direct effect is called c(cid:48). For mediation
analysis, we conducted multiple linear regression analyses with the Macro PROCESS for SPSS 22

(IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY, USA) from Hayes [19]. For all effects, we report unstandardized
regression coefﬁcients [19]. We used bias-corrected boot-strapping obtained with 10,000 resamples [19].

2.5. Mixed Methods Analysis

On the background of a transformational epistemological framework [22], data transformation [21]
was used as a validation strategy on multiple levels, transforming qualitative into quantitative data;
transforming qualitative verbal data into categories, sequencing them and feeding them back into
the theory model; transforming qualitative artistic data into different artistic and verbal modalities;
and synergizing all data into one ﬁnal performance of the ﬁrst author (GL) as an artistic result of the
analysis (see [27]) following the leading questions: What is the essence of each creation? How can they
be combined into an entity, accommodating each single mode of expression?

3.2.2. Correlations between Scales

With Pearson’s correlation coefﬁcient the relations between the implemented scales were analyzed
(see Table 3). Noticeable is the strong relation between the variables HSI and GSE at t2 and the theorized
mediator ECS: HSI (t2) correlates signiﬁcantly with ECS (t2) with r(39) = 0.69, p < 0.001. Also GSE (t2)
correlates signiﬁcantly with ECS (t2) with r(39) = 0.65, p < 0.001.

The factor analysis of ECS shows one general factor, that explains 74.66% of the variance.
Internal consistency is high with Cronbach’s Alpha α = 0.89. Item reduction would not increase
Cronbach’s Alpha α as can be seen in Table 4. Based on these ﬁndings ECS is used as mediator in the
following mediation analysis.

We conducted multiple regression analyses for the outcomes well-being (HSI) and self-efﬁcacy
(GSE) at t2, with the mediator of the experience of active creation measured with the ECS, also at t2 (i.e.,
we used the data collected at posttest t2 to assess each component of the proposed mediation model).
For the outcome HSI we found that active creation was positively associated with well-being (HSI;
the total effect c: B = −0.59, t(39) = −3.58, p < 0.001). We also found that active creation was positively
related to ECS (regression coefﬁcient a: B = −0.84, t(39)= −4.51, p < 0.001). Finally, results indicated
that the mediator ECS was positively associated with well-being (HSI; regression coefﬁcient b: B= 0.45,
t(39)= 3.67, p < 0.001). Results are presented in Table 5. Because both, paths a and b were signiﬁcant,
we used mediation analyses with the boot-strapping method with bias-corrected conﬁdence estimates:
B = −0.38, CI = −0.70; −0.16. Results of the mediation analysis conﬁrmed the mediating role of ECS in
the relation of active creation and well-being. The 95% conﬁdence interval of the indirect effect was

obtained with 10,000 bootstrap resamples [19]. In addition, results indicated that the direct effect c(cid:48) of
active creating on well-being (HSI) ceased to be signiﬁcant (B = −0.21, t(39) = −1.19, p = 0.24). Thus,
total mediation is suggested. Figure 5 displays the results.

For the outcome self-efﬁcacy (GSE), multiple regression analysis was conducted to assess each
component, presented in Table 6. First, it was found that active creation was positively associated with
self-efﬁcacy (GSE; the total effect c: B = −0.23, t(42) = −1.85, p = 0.07). It was also found that active
creation was positively related to ECS (regression coefﬁcient a: B = −0.85, t(42) = −4.87, p < 0.001).
Finally, results indicated that the mediator ECS was positively associated with self-efﬁcacy (GSE;
regression coefﬁcient b: B = 0.33, t(42) = 3.46, p = 0.001). Because both paths a and b were signiﬁcant,
mediation analyses were tested using the bootstrapping method with bias-corrected conﬁdence
estimates: B = −0.28, CI = −0.53; −0.12. Results of the mediation analysis conﬁrmed the mediating
role of ECS in the relation between active creating and self-efﬁcacy. The 95% conﬁdence interval of
the indirect effect was obtained with 10,000 bootstrap resamples [19]. In addition, results indicated
that the direct effect c(cid:48) of active creating on self-efﬁcacy (GSE) ceased to be non-signiﬁcant (B = 0.06,
t(42) = 0.41, p = 0.68). For the outcome of self-efﬁcacy (GSE), full mediation was suggested. Figure 6

Zusammenhänge

Resulting statements from the open questions were categorized by a female rater into topics or
themes. She was an independent outside rater proﬁcient in artistic inquiry, who in a content analytic
densiﬁcation, summed these expressions in six categories and labelled them (translation by ﬁrst
author): 1. Only me; 2. An impulse hits me/permeates me—I encounter myself; 3. Between outside
and inside; 4. From inside to the outside; 5. Become quiet, listen carefully, watch, marvel; 6. A change.

German original words: nur ich · ein Impuls stößt auf mich/durch mich hindurch–ich stoße
auf mich · zwischen außen und innen · und von innen nach außen · still sein, zuhören, sehen,
staunen · eine Veränderung.

Sixteen expressions were related to the four hypothesized factors empowerment, freedom, impact,
and creativity. Forty-two expressions captured various processes that cannot be related to these
factors. In addition, there were 38 improvisations in music, movement, colors and/or words that
were captured in different media. In the frame of this research, these improvisations were reduced
to their essentials by data transformation and were then composed to a ﬁnal creation, a one-woman
(GL) multimedia performance of six minutes duration, using projection of artworks of the participants,
music of participants, and movement performance and words generated by participants that related to
and counterweighed the quantitative results. Further details on the qualitative results are reported in
Lange and Koch [27].

4. Discussion

Focusing on the quantitative side of the study, the results of the mediation analysis suggests
that experiencing empowerment, freedom, impact, and creativity could be the mechanism increasing
the psychological health-outcomes of well-being and self-efﬁcacy, when a person actively creates.
Because of the feasibility character of the study, the results are suggestive, not conclusive. While the
results are promising, further studies with bigger samples need to follow.

Koch points out that “it is not easy to separate the therapeutic factors into distinct categories,
because many of these causes and consequences of art are linked together in processes that
intertwine” [2] (p. 90). How about the distinction in this study? We hypothesized that the experience of

Behav. Sci. 2018, 8, 25

12 of 17

empowerment, freedom, agency, and creativity while creating has a positive effect on well-being and
self-efﬁcacy. Are the concepts of mediator and outcome variable distinguishable categories? One can
argue that in order to feel well/healthy, human beings need the experience of the qualities named
above. With the concept of self-efﬁcacy, the danger of redundancy is even bigger: Is not the experience
of empowerment and impact the experience of self-efﬁcacy itself? This study’s results can help with
these questions. Looking at the reliability analysis of ECS it becomes apparent that the highest score of
Cronbach’s Alpha for ECS is the version with all four factors as presented in Table 4. Results can be
interpreted the way that a CATs intervention such as creation is accompanied by a cluster of working
factors that mediate the effect of the intervention. We hypothesize that this cluster is speciﬁc for each
intervention. In this perspective, the experience of empowerment and impact is not redundant, but a
deﬁning part of creation and creating in the context of CATs.

Qualitative results show how several transformational processes of the data (in content analytic
and artistic processes) have led to the emergence of the following categories: 1. Only me; 2. An impulse
hits me/permeates me—I encounter myself; 3. Between outside and inside; 4. From inside to the
outside; 5. Become quiet, listen carefully, watch, marvel; 6. A change. The outside rater proposed
this sequential arrangement. We interpret the sequence as the temporal process of active creation
that can contribute to theory development within and outside of the theory framework of embodied
aesthetics [2]. Further results of the aesthetic transformations and synergizing performance are
discussed in detail in Lange and Koch [27].

4.1. Limitations

We found full mediation for both outcomes HSI and GSE but need to point out that the small
sample is at the lower limit of statistical power. In future studies the sample size would need to be
increased. Also, the imbalance of women and men as well as the lack of random assignment are
limitations of this study. It remains unclear, whether other factors not assessed here have a comparable
effect on well-being and self-efﬁcacy while and beyond creating: qualitative results, particularly the
multitude of self-phrased expressions, capturing the individual experiences of the active person,
suggest more working factors than the four items of the ECS. The fact that the ECS consists of only four
items with two emerging dimensions (see Appendix B) causes reliability constraints. Now that the
usefulness of the ECS-concepts for affecting psychological outcomes has been initially demonstrated,
it would strengthen the measure to elaborate each of the two dimensions into ﬁve to six items and
develop the scale into a ten to twelve item measure. Last but not least, it remains unknown whether
the resulting factors are therapeutic factors since this research was done with a population of CAT
students, and not with a clinical population. Clinical studies need to follow.

Alternative explanations of results may have been the participants wanting to be “good
participants” by providing social desirable answers (expectancy effects). Particular the well-being
measure is quite transparent in study intent, particularly given the fact that we employed it directly
before and after the intervention. Self-efﬁcacy should be less subject to social desirability [24].
Another effect that may have caused increased well-being is the extra attention that the researcher
provided to the participants, and that was not provided in a similar way to the control group, at least
not in a 1:1 context (Hawthorn Effect). Future studies could focus on more concrete outcome variables
that depend less on social desirability such as depression, anxiety, or self-esteem and are appropriate
to the patient population under investigation.

Limitations on the qualitative side of data analysis is the subjectivity of parts of the data
transformation processes (that on the other hand is purposefully employed as part of the method
of artistic inquiry [20,27]; see Figures 3, 4, 7 and 8 for illustrating examples of artistic inquiry).
Future studies should identify points in the process, where the subjectivity can be controlled through
measures of observer agreement and consider the determination of inter-rater-reliability as a possibility
to establish higher objectivity, reliability, and validity of the results.

4.2. Future Research Considerations

Future research should be conducted with a bigger sample that is more balanced between male
and female participants. In addition, participants should be assigned randomly to either experimental
or control group. For better insight in creating in CATs, two more elements need further attention:
this study should be conducted with a patient population in order to obtain results about clinical
mechanisms. We assume that ECS is a therapeutic factor, since creating is a CAT intervention.
This needs to be assessed.

Second, this study should be prolonged in time: creating should be operationalized as a process
in time in which different emotional, cognitive, and intuitive shares get activated at different stages.
Because of the restricted time frame of this study, creation had been operationalized as improvisation
with artistic media by EG participants that had prior experience with improvising with artistic media.

In future studies the sample size would need to be increased. Also, the imbalance of women and men as well as the lack of random assignment are limitations of this study. It remains unclear, whether other factors not assessed here have a comparable effect on well-being and self-efficacy while and beyond creating: qualitative results, particularly the multitude of self-phrased expressions, capturing the individual experiences of the active person, suggest more working factors than the four items of the ECS. The fact that the ECS consists of only four items with two emerging dimensions (see Appendix B) causes reliability constraints. Now that the usefulness of the ECS-concepts for affecting psychological outcomes has been initially demonstrated, it would strengthen the measure to elaborate each of the two dimensions into five to six items and develop the scale into a ten to twelve item measure. Last but not least, it remains unknown whether the resulting factors are therapeutic factors since this research was done with a population of CAT students, and not with a clinical population. Clinical studies need to follow.  Alternative explanations of results may have been the participants wanting to be “good participants” by providing social desirable answers (expectancy effects). Particular the well-being measure is quite transparent in study intent, particularly given the fact that we employed it directly before and after the intervention. Self-efficacy should be less subject to social desirability [24]. Another effect that may have caused increased well-being is the extra attention that the researcher provided to the participants, and that was not provided in a similar way to the control group, at least not in a 1:1 context (Hawthorn Effect). Future studies could focus on more concrete outcome variables that depend less on social desirability such as depression, anxiety, or self-esteem and are appropriate to the patient population under investigation. Limitations on the qualitative side of data analysis is the subjectivity of parts of the data transformation processes (that on the other hand is purposefully employed as part of the method of artistic inquiry [20,27]; see Figures 3, 4, 7, and 8 for illustrating examples of artistic inquiry). Future studies should identify points in the process, where the subjectivity can be controlled through measures of observer agreement and consider the determination of inter-rater-reliability as a possibility to establish higher objectivity, reliability, and validity of the results.

Sci. 2018, 8, x FOR PEER REVIEW  14 of 17 scales are suited for and tested with patients. As described above, the measures in our study are geared toward positive outcomes; in a similar study with patients, it would be advisable to additionally employ appropriate measures of symptom relief (e.g., regarding depression, anxiety, loneliness, or stress reduction). This study lays the groundwork for looking at more complex issues of psychological health paired with self-efficacy and well-being. All in all, the chosen participatory approach is intended and suited to contribute to the empowerment of the patients, and is thus in line with a transformational approach of patient advocacy.

Conclusions The presented work is a feasibility study in the research field of therapeutic factors in CATs. The results are promising: The positive, indirect effect of active creation through ECS is statistically significant for both outcomes well-being (HSI) and self-efficacy (GSE); in addition, a high internal consistency of the ECS can be reported, with Cronbach’s Alpha of 0.89. At the same time, a first theoretical proposal is made about the nature of active factors and the relation of their concrete and abstract implementation in the therapeutic process. Thereupon, future research can build in order to gain insight into how exactly CATs work and where their overarching and specific factors lie.

Also, the improvisation has been framed by the opening question: What happens inside yourself when
you create? This was our attempt to grasp the entity of creating. In future research, the context in which
creation takes place in CATs should be a clinical setting to increase external validity, which includes no
condition of participants having prior experience with artistic media.

The Model of Embodied Aesthetics comes with loosely assigned common therapeutic factors [2]
(p. 89). This feasibility study makes a proposal of how to go about the evidence-base of therapeutic
factors in CATs: In the future, single CATs interventions should be assessed to ﬁnd out about the
speciﬁc and concrete cluster of fundamental mechanisms that then again can be fused into the Model
of Embodied Aesthetics on an abstract level. The hypothesized factors can be based on the empirical
data of qualitative and quantitative results. Furthermore, future research should address the missing
procedural concept of therapeutic factors in CATs: Which factor comes in when and where, and how
does the process differ depending on inter- and intrapersonal situations and circumstances?

Another important question of distinction needs to be asked with regard to active creation and
activity. Does active creation have a positive effect on human health, because being active has a positive
effect on human health? This question cannot be clariﬁed with the results in this study, since active
creation is a possibility of being active but should be taken into future research by implementing
different control settings.

Mediation analysis was used in order to evaluate quantitative data. The design and the modus
operandi ﬁt very well to the question of therapeutic factors in CATs. Hayes emphasizes that statistic
constructions are models that we use for inference: “All we can do is use our data to try to model
what that reality looks like” [19] (p. 53). We would like to encourage future researchers in this line of
thought to employ the possibilities offered by mediation analysis with its parallel and serial models
and moderation analysis in order to approximate the interrelations of the variables.

4.3. Implications for Practice

Since there are joint mechanisms of all arts therapies, it is important to investigate them closely
and also to employ creative arts therapies more as a joint offer in clinical practice: the freedom of choice
of the arts modality seemed to have been an important active factor for our students (Figures 3, 4, 7
and 8 show examples of the chosen media colors and/or words) and can be assumed to be similarly
important for the patients in our clinical institutions. For the patients, one of the working factors
may precisely be the fact that he/she can chose the arts modality, he/she wants to express himself
in. Freedom of choice increases one’s feeling of being taken seriously, and increases the experienced
control, and thus the self-efﬁcacy.

Taking this set-up to the clinical context, one would need to make some relevant adaptations,
the most important one being: to provide patients with more time and a broader introduction to
the creative possibilities and materials. While our students were able to almost instantly immerse
into creative activities across modalities, patients would need more security, explanation and time
to get into the creative process (maybe initially a choice of two arts modalities would be enough
for them, depending on the population). However, in the ﬁeld of creative arts therapies there is
much differentiated knowledge and daily experience on how to accompany patients into creative
processes. The selected health-related psychological outcomes are central to psychological health and
the chosen scales are suited for and tested with patients. As described above, the measures in our
study are geared toward positive outcomes; in a similar study with patients, it would be advisable
to additionally employ appropriate measures of symptom relief (e.g., regarding depression, anxiety,
loneliness, or stress reduction). This study lays the groundwork for looking at more complex issues of
psychological health paired with self-efﬁcacy and well-being.

All in all, the chosen participatory approach is intended and suited to contribute to the
empowerment of the patients, and is thus in line with a transformational approach of patient advocacy.
