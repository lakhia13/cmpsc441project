Abstract

Background:  Accumulating data suggest that the structure of posttraumatic stress disorder 
(PTSD) symptoms may be more nuanced than proposed by prevailing nosological models. 
Emerging theory further suggests that an 8-factor model with separate internally- (e.g., flashbacks) 
and externally- (e.g., trauma cue-related emotional reactivity) generated intrusive symptoms may 
best represent PTSD symptoms. To date, however, scarce research has evaluated the fit of this 
model and whether index traumas are differentially associated with it in populations at high risk 
for trauma exposure, such as military veterans.

Methods:  Data were analyzed from a nationally representative sample of 3847 trauma-exposed 
U.S. veterans who participated in the National Health and Resilience in Veterans Study. 
Confirmatory factor analyses were conducted to evaluate the fit of a novel 8-factor model of 
PTSD symptoms relative to 4-factor DSM-5 and empirically-supported 7-factor hybrid models.

Results:  The 8-factor model fit the data significantly better than the 7-factor hybrid and 4-
factor DSM-5 models. Combat exposure and harming others were more strongly associated with

internally-generated intrusions, while interpersonal violence and disaster/accident showed stronger 
significant associations with externally-generated intrusions.

Limitations:  The 8-factor model requires validation in non-veteran and more diverse trauma-
exposed populations, as well as with clinician-administered interviews.

Conclusions:  Results of this study provide support for a novel 8-factor model of PTSD 
symptoms that is characterized by separate internally- and externally-generated intrusions. They 
also suggest that certain index traumas may lead to differential expression of these symptoms.

1. 

Introduction

Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a mental disorder characterized by heterogeneous 
symptom clusters that include intrusive, avoidance, negative cognition and mood, and 
altered arousal and reactivity symptoms (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). 
Confirmatory factor analytic (CFA) studies, which compare theory-informed structural 
models of a disorder’s phenotypic dimensions, have attempted to clarify the core symptom 
dimensions of PTSD. Since the 4-factor DSM-5 model was published (American Psychiatric 
Association, 2013), more nuanced dimensional structures of PTSD have been proposed and 
tested. These include a 6-factor anhedonia model, which is comprised of separate negative 
affect and anhedonia clusters (Liu et al., 2014) and a 6-factor externalizing behavior model, 
which is comprised of separate externalizing behavior, dysphoric, and anxious arousal 
clusters (Tsai et al., 2015). Both models have been found to fit PTSD symptom data 
better than the 4-factor DSM-5 model. Following these two 6-factor models, a 7-factor 
hybrid model was proposed, which included separate intrusion, avoidance, negative affect, 
anhedonia, externalizing behavior, and anxious and dysphoric arousal clusters, and fit PTSD 
symptom data better than both 6-factor models in two independent samples, thus providing 
further phenotypic nuance to the expression of PTSD symptoms (Armour et al., 2015, see 
Supplemental Table 1 for item mappings). Since then, a growing body of CFA studies 
demonstrated that the 7-factor hybrid model fits better than other models in a range of 
trauma-exposed samples (Bovin et al., 2016; Cheng et al., 2020; Seligowski and Orcutt, 
2016; Wortmann et al., 2016), using both self-report and clinician-administered measures 
of PTSD symptoms (Lee et al., 2019; Weathers et al., 2018) and participants enrolled in 
different countries (Cheng et al., 2020; Mordeno et al., 2017; Soberón et al., 2016).

Despite 10 years of research on the latent symptom structure of DSM-5 PTSD symptoms, 
these advances have largely focused on symptom domains other than intrusive re-
experiencing symptoms (i.e., intrusive trauma memories, nightmares, and flashbacks), which 
are widely considered the defining symptom cluster of PTSD (Bar-Haim et al., 2021; Kleim 
et al., 2013). In 2021, Bar-Haim and colleagues argued that greater attention must be 
paid to intrusive symptoms to improve understanding of the mechanisms and treatment 
of PTSD (Bar-Haim et al., 2021). Specifically, they suggested that intrusions can be 
conceptualized as being either internally-generated (i.e., PTSD criteria B1-B3—intrusive 
trauma memories, nightmares, and flashbacks) or externally-generated (i.e., criteria B4 
and B5—trauma cue-related physiological and emotional reactivity), with these potentially 
representing distinct processes. The rationale for separate intrusion factors is that internally-
generated (I-G) intrusions have an involuntary, strong re-experiencing component, while

externally-generated (E-G) intrusions are less involuntary and not defined by experiencing 
the event as if it is happening again. We recently evaluated the extent to which this newly 
proposed 8-factor model of PTSD symptoms best fit PTSD symptom data in two large 
samples of military veterans (Duek et al., 2022). The 8-factor model retains the seven 
factors of the hybrid model and further divides intrusive symptoms into separate I-G or 
E-G intrusions, thus yielding 8 factors (see Supplemental Table 1 for item mappings). 
Results revealed that an 8-factor model comprised of separate I-G and E-G intrusive 
symptoms fits PTSD symptom data better than the 7- and 4- factor models in both samples. 
Further, E-G intrusions were more strongly associated with avoidance symptoms, while I-G 
intrusions were more strongly associated with dysphoric arousal symptoms. The 8-factor 
model also demonstrated clinical significance where internally-cued intrusive symptoms 
were uniquely associated with dysphoric arousal, and worse physical health functioning; 
while externally-cued triggered intrusions were associated with more avoidance, anxious 
arousal, and increased generalized anxiety symptoms (Gross et al., 2023).

To date, however, no known study has assessed how different index traumas relate 
to this model. In light of data suggesting that trauma exposures are associated with 
different conditional probabilities of developing PTSD (Kessler et al., 1995; Wisco et al., 
2022), examining how index traumas are associated with phenotypic expression of PTSD 
symptoms can help inform whether such exposures may be differentially associated with 
the phenotypic expression of this multi-faceted disorder. Furthermore, this 8-factor model 
requires additional validation in different samples. Toward this end, we analyzed data from a 
large, representative sample of trauma-exposed U.S. military veterans to evaluate the relative 
fit of the 8-factor model of PTSD and identify how specific index traumas are associated 
with these latent factors. Based on prior work (Duek et al., 2022; Gross et al., 2023), we 
hypothesized that the 8-factor model would show superior fit than the 4-factor DSM-5 
and 7-factor models. In light of prior studies showing the centrality of symptoms such as 
nightmares in combat veterans with PTSD (Fontana and Rosenheck, 2008; Schreuder et al., 
2000; Seal et al., 2007), we further hypothesized that veterans who endorsed combat-related 
trauma as their index event would report greater severity of I-G relative to E-G intrusions.

2.  Methods

2.1.  Sample

Data were analyzed from the 2019–2020 National Health and Resilience in Veterans 
Study (NHRVS), which surveyed a nationally representative sample of U.S. Veterans. The 
current study focused on 3847 trauma-exposed NHRVS participants. This sample was 
drawn from KnowledgePanel®, a survey panel with >50,000 U.S. households maintained 
by Ipsos, a research firm. KnowledgePanel® is the oldest and largest probability-based 
online survey panel of a representative U.S. adult sample that covers approximately 98 % 
of U.S. households that have been recruited through national random samples. To permit 
generalizability of results to the U.S. veteran population, Ipsos computed post-stratification 
weights using benchmark distributions of U.S. veterans from the 2019 Veterans Supplement 
of the Current Population Survey. Item-level missing data (<3 %) were imputed using 
chained equations. Additional details regarding the NHRVS sampling methods are described

2.2.  Assessments

2.2.1.  Life Events Checklist for DSM-5 (LEC-5): The LEC-5 is a self-report measure 
used to screen for potentially traumatic events (PTEs) that may precipitate trauma-related 
psychopathology (Weathers et al., 2013a). It includes 16 events that commonly precede 
PTSD and the option to note other exceptionally stressful experiences not covered by 
the 16 listed events. Psychometric assessment of the original version of the LEC-5—the 
Life Events Checklist—which is very similar to the LEC-5, has found it to have strong 
convergent validity, adequate test-retest reliability, and excellent agreement between items 
(Gray et al., 2004). Index traumas were assessed by displaying endorsed PTEs and asking: 
“Which of these experiences was the WORST for you?” Index traumas were assessed 
in a mutually exclusive manner and participants could only have endorsed one event. 
They were then categorized into five categories: disaster/accident, interpersonal violence, 
combat exposure, illness/injury, and harm to others (Wisco et al., 2022); see Supplementary 
Methods for further details.

2.2.2.  Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5): The PCL-5 
assesses the presence and intensity of the 20 DSM-5 PTSD symptoms (Weathers et al., 
2013b). It is a self-report measure in which respondents rate the degree to which they have 
been bothered by the 20 items from 0 (Not at all) to 4 (Extremely) in relation to their 
‘worst’ PTE endorsed on the LEC-5. In the NHRVS, lifetime and past-month versions of the 
PCL-5 were administered; given that the average time since index trauma was >30 years, 
we focused on lifetime scores. A score ≥ 31 is indicative of a positive screen for PTSD 
(Bovin et al., 2016). The PCL-5 has demonstrated good reliability and validity (Blevins et 
al., 2015). In this study, Cronbach’s alpha for PCL-5 items was α = 0.96.

2.3.  Data analyses

First, we conducted CFAs to compare 3 different structural models of PTSD (the DSM-5 
4-factor model, the 7-factor hybrid model, and the 8-factor model, see Supplemental Table 
1). These two models were selected for comparison due to their clinical and empirical 
importance in the PTSD CFA literature. As described above, a substantial body of CFA 
studies has revealed that the 7-factor hybrid model fits PTSD symptom data better than 
other models. Further, the DSM-5 model was compared to evaluate the relative fit of the 
8-factor model to the 4-factor model of PTSD symptoms in the current version of the 
DSM. We compared fit statistics (root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA), 
Tucker-Lewis index (TLI), comparative fit index (CFI), chi-square) and chi-square tests of 
difference for each model to identify the latent factor structure that provided the best fit to 
the data. Lower RMSEA and higher TLI and CFI are indicative of better-fitting models. The 
weighted least square mean and variance adjusted (WLSMV) estimator was used for all CFA 
models. Second, we compared the magnitude of the correlations between the I-G and E-G 
intrusion factors with the five index traumas using Steiger’s Z-tests; these tests were used 
as they account for the correlation between the I-G and E-G intrusions (Spearman r = 0.73).

3.  Results

Our sample included 3847 trauma-exposed veterans, 36.0 % of which had served in a 
combat or war zone. They were predominantly male (89.8 %), white, non-Hispanic (78.2 
%), and had a mean age of 62.0 years (SD = 15.7, range = 22–98). The mean number of 
years since worst trauma was 30.7 (SD = 19.7, range = 0–87); mean PCL-5 score was 14.4 
(SD = 15.8, range = 0–80), and 15.3 % screened positive for PTSD.

Regarding the prevalence of index traumas reported, 1492 (42.7 %) reported a disaster 
or accident, 1022 (29.2 %) reported illness or injury, 498 (14.2 %) reported interpersonal 
violence, 457 (13.1 %) reported combat exposure or captivity, and 28 (0.8 %) reported 
causing serious injury, harm, or death to someone else. As shown in Table 1, CFA fit 
statistics suggested that the 8-factor model provided the best fit to the data. Moreover, 
chi-square difference tests indicated that the 8-factor model fit better than the 7- (X2 = 
163.21, p < 0.001) and 4-factor models (X2 = 1349.91, p < 0.001). Correlations between the 
8 factors ranged from r = 0.52 to 0.73, averaging r = 0.60 (see Supplemental Table 2 for all 
factor correlations).

Using a Bonferroni corrected p-value threshold = 0.01 (0.05/5 comparisons), Steiger’s 
Z-tests comparing associations between index traumas and I-G and E-G intrusions revealed 
significant differences between I-G and E-G intrusions for all index traumas except illness/
injury (rI-G = 0.04, rE-G = 0.06, z = −2.34, p = 0.019; Fig. 1). Interpersonal violence (rI-G = 
0.27, rE-G = 0.36, z = −18.21, p < 0.001) and disaster/accident (rI-G = −0.32, rE-G = −0.34, 
z = 4.19, p < 0.001) index events were more strongly associated with E-G intrusions, while 
combat (rI-G = 0.30, rE-G = 0.21, z = 17.51, p < 0.001) and harm to others (rI-G = 0.25, rE-G 
= 0.21, z = 8.31, p < 0.001) were more strongly associated with I-G intrusions.

4.  Discussion

Using data from a nationally representative sample of trauma-exposed U.S. military 
veterans, we found that a novel 8-factor model of PTSD with separate I-G and E-G intrusion 
symptom factors fit the data better than the DSM-5 4-factor model and the 7-factor hybrid 
model. We also found that index traumas were differentially linked to these symptom 
factors.

The refinement of PTSD symptom structure over the past 10 years has found that more 
nuanced models generally provide better fit than more parsimonious models. The 7-factor 
hybrid model, which includes unique features of anhedonia and externalizing behavior 
models, has been perhaps the most well-supported (Armour et al., 2015). However, as Bar-
Haim et al. (2021) pointed out, disagreement surrounding the definition of PTSD remains, 
which may have impeded translating basic research on pathological trauma responses into 
improved clinical outcomes. Refocusing research toward the core symptom dimension of 
intrusion symptoms may be a more fruitful direction. Accordingly, Duek et al. (2022) 
evaluated the fit of this novel 8-factor model by taking the hybrid model and breaking

intrusion symptoms into I-G and E-G intrusion factors. The separation of these factors is 
warranted, as I-G intrusions are involuntary and have a more profound phenomenological 
component of feeling as if the experience is happening again (Bar-Haim et al., 2021). While 
E-G intrusions may have some of these elements, they are differentiated by being less 
involuntary (i.e., one can attempt to avoid some reminders of their trauma), and less marked 
by experiences of reliving the traumatic event. Results of the current study replicate and 
extend Duek et al.’s (2022) finding in treatment-seeking veterans to suggest that this novel 
8-factor model of PTSD symptoms also provides a better representation of PTSD symptom 
structure in a nationally representative sample of U.S. military veterans.

We also examined whether index traumas may be differentially associated with this 8-
factor model, with particular emphasis on I-G and E-G intrusions. We found notable 
differences in the association between the index traumas experienced and the presence 
of I-G versus E-G intrusions, suggesting clinical and potentially mechanistic relevance. 
Combat exposure and causing harm to others were more strongly associated with I-G 
intrusions, while experiencing interpersonal traumas or disaster/accident were more strongly 
associated with E-G intrusions. Nightmares, a core I-G intrusive symptom, are prevalent 
and often considered a defining symptom of PTSD in combat-exposed veterans (Neylan 
et al., 1998) with PTSD severity showing a strong association with the presence of 
nightmares (Criterion B2; (Pigeon et al., 2013). Further, flashbacks—another I-G intrusive 
symptom—were identified as the most influential symptoms in a network analysis of 
treatment-seeking combat veterans (Lazarov et al., 2020). Emerging research has also 
suggested that deficiencies in intrinsic sensory inhibitions may drive overactivation of 
sensory representations of trauma memories, which may in turn lead to greater severity 
of I-G intrusive symptoms in combat veterans (Clancy et al., 2020). One interpretation of 
the finding that causing harm to others was more strongly linked to I-G than E-G intrusions 
is that this experience may directly reflect the experience of harming others in combat. 
The finding that interpersonal violence was more strongly linked to E-G intrusions aligns 
with a study of interpersonal violence survivors, which found that Criterion B4 (trauma cue-
related emotional reactivity) was significantly related to revictimization, while I-G intrusion 
symptoms were not associated with any interpersonal violence characteristics (Matlow and 
DePrince, 2013). Collectively, the current study extends prior work to suggest that certain 
index traumas may be linked to stronger expression of certain intrusion symptoms. They 
also underscore the importance of considering index traumas when assessing the clinical 
expression of PTSD symptoms.

Limitations of this study must be noted. First, although the sample is nationally 
representative of U.S. military veterans, it was comprised of mostly older white men. 
Additional CFA studies in more diverse veteran samples, as well as non-veteran samples, are 
needed to evaluate the replicability of these findings. Second, the analyses performed here 
used a self-report measure of PTSD symptoms; further research using clinician-administered 
measures is needed to evaluate the generalizability of results. Third, our sample had low 
PCL-5 scores and 15.3 % screened positive for PTSD. Further research in larger samples is 
needed to evaluate whether the 8-factor model is invariant as a function of different levels of 
PTSD severity, as well as other parameters (e.g., index trauma, age, sex). Fourth, although 
the 8-factor model fits the data better than the 7- and 4- factor models, the 8-factor model

includes five factors with only two indicator variables. To fully capture the complexity of 
these factors, more items may be needed to optimally assess them.

Notwithstanding these limitations, the current findings provide additional support for a novel 
8-factor model of PTSD, as well as unique associations between index traumas and the 
I-G and E-G intrusion symptoms. Further research is needed to replicate these findings in 
other samples and other methods of assessment; identify mechanisms underlying the relation 
between index traumas and the phenotypic expression of PTSD symptoms; and evaluate 
the potential utility of personalized treatments for PTSD based on more nuanced structural 
models of this multi-faceted disorder.
