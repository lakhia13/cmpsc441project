Unaccompanied immigrant minors (UIMs) are a fast-growing demographic in the 
United States, doubling in population since 2014.1 According to the Office of Refugee 
Resettlement, a UIM is someone under the age of 18 years who enters the United 
States without lawful status and an accompanying guardian.2 Most UIMs in the United 
States originate from the Central American northern triangle (ie, El Salvador, Guatemala, 
Honduras), with violence, extreme poverty, and family reunification as the top 3 reasons 
for migration.1,3 Repeated exposure to stressful and/or traumatic events at home, during 
migration, and upon arrival increases UIMs’ risk for psychological distress and mental 
disorders.3 UIMs’ repeated encounters with race-based trauma (eg, racism, discrimination) 
further heightens this risk.3 The repercussions of these events are compounded by the 
fact that UIMs lack the adversity buffering effect that is traditionally associated with the 
presence of a caregiver.3 Furthermore, UIMs’ mental health risk is augmented by their 
interaction with US systems (eg, legal, immigration, child welfare, educational, healthcare)

that have policies and practices that are discriminatory, exclusionary, propagate the view of 
UIMs as racialized threats to society, and fail to consider their developmental context.3,4 
Considering these risks, it is imperative to the well-being and positive development of UIMs 
that they have access to quality mental health services (MHS).

However, UIMs’ likelihood of service use is limited because UIMs do not access services 
via traditional pathways or in traditional clinical settings. Furthermore, conventional 
approaches to MHS do not offer the sufficient contextualization of mental health concerns 
needed to effectively address UIMs’ unique mental health needs. Racism and discrimination 
perpetrated by mental health providers or organizations, whether implicit or explicit, is 
another deterrent to UIMs’ ability to engage with MHS. Finally, continuity of care is of 
great concern for UIMs because significant environmental instability makes it difficult for 
them to engage in long-term MHS. Thus, the combination of high mental health risk, MHS 
underutilization, and persistent systemic racism aggravates existent mental health disparities 
among UIMs.

To date, efforts to address mental health disparities in historically marginalized populations, 
including UIMs, have focused primarily on increasing workforce diversity, cultural 
competence trainings, and culturally adapting evidence-based interventions.5 Although these 
strategies are important for reducing mental health disparities, they do not fully consider 
the unique environmental, systemic, and structural factors that limit UIMs’ engagement 
with MHS. An anti-racist approach offers guidance for identifying alternative strategies to 
promoting the mental health of UIMs because it recognizes that (1) health disparities are a 
manifestation of larger race-based social inequities, and (2) health systems are structured to 
benefit those with race-based historical power (eg, White, US-born, middle-to-upper class).6 
Applied to mental health practice, an antiracist approach calls clinicians to adjust how they 
provide MHS so as to be most responsive to patient needs in the context in which they 
exist.5,6 To that end, we provide specific antiracist clinical practices that clinicians can use to 
be maximally effective at promoting the psychological well-being of UIMs.

ANTIRACIST CLINICAL RECOMMENDATIONS FOR WORKING WITH UIMs

Engage in Self-Reflection and Recognize Unequal Distribution of Power

An antiracist approach demands that clinicians push beyond their comfort zone, recognize 
the unequal distribution of power and privilege between themselves and their patients, 
and critically examine their positionality with regard that of their patients. This includes 
evaluating their own beliefs about UIMs, the source of these beliefs, and how these 
beliefs influence their provision of services. In doing so, clinicians must acknowledge 
their influence on the lives of UIMs while also centering themselves in the systems 
that proliferate systemic racism against UIMs. Common blind spots for clinicians in this 
self-reflection process include assuming UIMs’ experiences of adversity and/or trauma, 
disregarding their beliefs about immigration processes and pathways to citizenship, failing to 
contextualize UIMs in development, and neglecting to acknowledge their direct or indirect 
representation of the aforementioned systems. Clinicians can begin this process by reflecting 
on their own identity and experiences (eg, race, ethnicity, nativity status, acculturation, 
clinical training, educational background, preferred language). In undertaking this process,

clinicians must also recognize that the demands of other systems may put clinicians in 
competing dual roles that can have an impact on UIMs’ willingness to engage with services. 
Clinicians should use the insights gained from this self-reflection process to inform their 
implementation of the antiracist clinical practices recommended below.

Adopt a Systems Focused Approach

Conventional MHS often intervene at the individual level - failing to incorporate broader 
environmental influences into case conceptualizations and intervention planning. Adopting 
a systems-level approach to working with UIMs means recognizing the individual, 
their developmental needs, and their race-based experiences within the larger systems. 
It limits “blaming” the individual, and recognizes that systems can serve as barriers 
to MHS use.3 Clinicians using this approach should begin by building their structural 
competence. Structural competence is the clinicians’ ability to see health-related issues as 
the downstream effects of structural and systematic policies/practices.7 In building their 
structural competence, clinicians should ensure that knowledge gained is relevant to the 
unique experiences of UIMs and considers the multiple levels of influence described in 
ecological systems theory. This includes developing an awareness of how UIMs interact 
with numerous systems, how these systems interact with each other, and the impact 
of these systems on UIMs’ mental health. A systems-focused approach also calls for 
clinicians to interact with the systems most relevant to the lives of UIMs via regular, 
interdisciplinary “team” meetings with pertinent stakeholders (eg, immigration lawyers, 
teachers, case workers, legal guardians) that are scheduled according to the needs of the 
patient and the complexity of their case. Transparency and education regarding the purpose 
of communication is crucial to building partnerships between all parties. Securing access to 
linguistically appropriate interpreters who use terminology that is familiar to both UIMs and 
stakeholders is essential to ensuring that everyone involved has the information they need to 
make appropriately informed decisions. Of note, when working with stakeholders, clinicians 
should seize opportunities to offer their knowledge of antiracist, best practices as a key step 
toward dismantling systemic health inequities.

Use a Needs-Based, Resilience-Focused, Integrative Therapeutic Strategy

Most evidence-based mental health interventions require patients to commit to numerous 
weekly sessions. As previously mentioned, engaging in long-term MHS can be difficult 
for UIMs; thus, an antiracist approach calls on clinicians to use a needs-driven, integrative 
therapy strategy to promote the mental health of UIMs. An exemplar model is the integrated 
behavioral health model, which emphasizes brief, time-limited interventions that prioritize 
stabilization, psychoeducation, and the development of coping skills.8 This model steers 
clinicians away from using one specific therapeutic approach (eg, cognitive—behavioral 
therapy [CBT], dialectical behavior therapy [DBT]) and instead encourages clinicians to use 
components from a variety of protocols. Because UIMs demonstrate tremendous resilience 
despite the adversity they experience, modifying these components to acknowledge and 
to build on this resilience is necessary.9 For this reason, clinicians must simultaneously 
challenge their assumptions about UIMs’ capacity for resilience, promote resilience by 
expanding UIMs’ use of existing adaptive coping strategies, and introduce new culturally 
and contextually sensitive skills when appropriate. Clinicians can also facilitate UIMs’

resilience by helping them to leverage aspects of their identity (eg, cultural, religious, 
familial) that remind them of their motivations for migrating and that are a source of pride, 
hope and/or happiness. Using this resilience-focused approach is crucial to recognizing that 
clinicians play a vital role in building UIMs’ capacity to endure ongoing system-imposed 
hardships.

Acknowledge and Address Uncertainty

Traditional clinical training and insurance-driven health care practices emphasize 
diagnostically driven MHS. Although UIMs experience high rates of DSM-5 disorders, a 
common driver of psychological distress among UIMs is the persistent uncertainty that 
transcends multiple facets of their lives. Albeit not a traditional target of intervention, 
acknowledging and addressing this uncertainty is crucial to promoting UIMs’ mental health. 
Clinicians should start by validating and normalizing psychological responses to uncertainty 
and increasing UIMs’ capacity to cope with uncertainty using the aforementioned resilience-
focused strategies. Of note, although maladaptive thoughts related to uncertainty may be 
present, changed-based therapeutic approaches (eg, CBT) can be invalidating of UIMs’ lived 
experiences and can undermine UIMs’ confidence in MHS’ ability to provide support and 
symptom relief. As such, value-based protocols (eg, acceptance and commitment therapy) 
should be explored as suitable alternatives. Furthermore, although trauma histories are 
common among UIMs, traumatic experiences often persist across much of UIMs’ lives, 
and fear of future trauma is common. Although clinicians may be inclined to immediately 
address UIMs’ trauma histories, clinicians are strongly discouraged from doing so because 
of their time-limited interactions with UIMs. Similar caution should be exercised when 
prescribing medications for trauma-related symptoms. Clinicians are instead urged to adopt 
a trauma-informed (but not trauma-focused) approach to address the psychological distress 
that often accompanies the high degree of uncertainty that UIMs experience.

CONCLUSION

Although policy change is crucial to making the systemic and sustainable impacts required 
to eliminate mental health disparities for UIMs, clinicians are well positioned to begin 
this systematic transformation by developing greater self-awareness and intentionally 
implementing antiracist practices in each clinical encounter. In doing so, clinicians can begin 
to make a more immediate impact in reducing mental health inequities as they impact UIMs.
