Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a debilitating condition that occurs following exposure to traumatic events. Current
treatments, such as psychological debrieﬁng and pharmacotherapy, often have limited efﬁcacy and may result in unwanted side
effects, making early intervention is a more desirable strategy. In this study, we investigated the efﬁcacy of a single dose of pulsed
(10 Hz) 810 nm laser-phototherapy (P-PT) as an early intervention for preventing PTSD-like comorbidities in rats induced by single
inescapable electric foot shock following the single prolonged stress (SPS&S). As indicated by the results of the open ﬁled test,
elevated plus maze test, and contextual fear conditioning test, P-PT prevented the development of anxiety and freezing behaviors
in rats exposed to the SPS&S. We also compared the effects of P-PT and continuous wave 810 nm laser-phototherapy (CW-PT) in
preventing PTSD-like comorbidities in rats. The results revealed that P-PT was effective in preventing both freezing and anxiety
behavior in stressed rats. In contrast, CW-PT only had a preventive effect on freezing behavior but not anxiety. Additionally, P-PT
signiﬁcantly reduced the c-fos expression in cingulate cortex area 1(Cg1) and infralimbic cortex (IL) of stressed rats, while CW-PT had
no signiﬁcant effects on c-fos expression. Taken together, our results demonstrate that P-PT is a highly effective strategy for
preventing the occurrence of PTSD-like comorbidities in rats.

INTRODUCTION
Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a mental health condition
that can be triggered by exposure to traumatic events, such as
combats and natural disasters [1, 2]. Studies suggested that a
signiﬁcant proportion of individuals (ranging from 37 to 92%)
experience a traumatic event during their
lifetime [3], and
approximately 7% of American adults currently have PTSD [4].
Certain population, such as veterans, are at a high-risk of
developing PTSD due to the nature of their work. For instance,
up to 30% of Vietnam War veterans have been diagnosed with
PTSD, and 15% still experience symptoms after 15 years since the
war. Among Gulf War veterans, the incidence of PTSD is around
intrusive
8% [5]. The symptoms of PTSD include avoidance,
symptoms and ﬂashbacks, mood and cognitive disruptions, and
hyperarousal/reactivity symptoms [6]. These symptoms can lead
to numerous problems for patients, including depression, alcohol
and substance abuse, conduct problems, social phobia, panic
disorder, and even suicidal thoughts or self-harm [7, 8].

Psychotherapy is a commonly used intervention for PTSD
patients and can alleviate the symptoms [9]. However, individual
reactions to psychotherapy vary. Some PTSD patients may feel

antidepressants, anxiolytics, and selective serotonin reuptake
inhibitors (SSRI) can also provide relief from symptoms. However,
the long-term use of medication may result in unwanted side
effects [12–14]. As a result, it is urgent to explore non-invasive and

Photobiomodulation (PBM), also known as low level

laser
therapy (LLLT), was discovered by Endre Mester in 1967. He found
that LLLT could enhance hair regrowth and wound healing in
tumor-implanted rats [15]. The mechanism of PBM involves the
activation of cytochrome c oxidase (CCO) of mitochondria by laser
irradiation, leading to increased adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and
reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, which improves cell
viability and cellular proliferation through activation of several
signaling pathways in cells [16–19]. Over the past two decades,
transcranial PBM emerged as a promising non-invasive treatment
option for various brain disorders, such as stroke, traumatic brain
injury (TBI), Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease, and
psychiatric disorders [20, 21]. Although continuous wave (CW)
near-infrared (NIR) light/laser has been commonly used in PBM
[22], a study by Takahiro et al. has shown that the therapeutic
effect of LLLT for traumatic brain injury with an 810 nm laser was
more effective at 10 Hz pulse frequency than at CW and 100-Hz in
mice [23]. Anita et al. have also demonstrated positive outcomes

10 Hz pulsed, light-emitting diodes [24].

PTSD is unique among brain disorders in that it can be directly
linked to a causal event for up to one month following the event,
which provides an opportunity for early intervention [25].
In a
recent study, Yong Li et al. reported that early CW 808 nm laser
transcranial irradiation can prevent the occurrence of PTSD-like
comorbidities in rats [26, 27]. However, whether pulsed laser
transcranial irradiation has an effect on the prevention of PTSD
remains unknown. Therefore, the objectives of this study are to
investigate the effect of pulsed 810 nm laser
transcranial
irradiation (10 Hz) on the prevention of PTSD in rats and to
compare its therapeutic effect with that of CW 810 nm laser
irradiation. Our results showed that a single dose of pulsed
810 nm laser-phototherapy (P-PT), as an early intervention,
displayed a better therapeutic effect in the prevention of PTSD-
like comorbidities in rats induced by an SPS&S procedure. This is
the ﬁrst study to demonstrate that P-PT is an effective strategy for
preventing the occurrence of PTSD-like comorbidities in rats.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Animals
Male Sprague–Dawley rats (7 weeks old, 220–250 g body weight) were
obtained from SPF (Beijing) Biotechnology Co., Ltd. The rats were housed
individually and had free access to food and water under a 12-h light/12-h
dark cycle at 23 ± 2 °C and 55 ± 5% humidity. The rats were assigned to
one of four groups with random number method: Control (Ctrl), Stress (Str),
Stress + Continuous Wave Phototherapy (Str + CW-PT), and Stress +
Pulsed Phototherapy (Str + P-PT). The animal experimental protocol was
approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of
Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) General Hospital, and all the
procedures were carried out in accordance with the approved guidelines.

Single inescapable electric foot shock following the single
prolonged stress procedure (SPS&S)
To induce PTSD-like symptoms,
the rats underwent a multi-stressor
protocol based on a previous study [28]. The protocol consisted of
followed by forced
immobilization in a plastic container for 2 hours,

swimming for 20 minutes in water at 24 ± 1 °C and a depth of 50 cm. The
rates were then given a 15-min rest period. After the rest period, they were
anesthetized until they lost consciousness and subjected to 10 random
electric shocks at 1 mA for 6 s each in a 15-min interval. Following the
stressor, the rats were returned to their cages and provided with enough
food and water for another week before the behavior evaluation.

Apparatus and phototherapy
The light source for irradiation was a semiconductor laser (810 nm, HOP-
100, L.H.H. MEDICAL Tech Co., Ltd., Beijing, China). The study included four
groups of rats: Ctrl, Str, Str + CW-PT, Str + P-PT, with 6 rats per group. Rats
in the phototherapy groups were anesthetized and received irradiation
immediately after SPS&S. The laser output was coupled into an optical ﬁber
(Medlight, S.A. Switzerland) with a lens for an even 3 cm2 irradiation area
that covered the shaved scalp of rat (Fig. 1A). Both CW and pulsed mode
(10 Hz) were applied at a power density of 25 mW/cm2 on the rat scalp.
The irradiation time lasted 30 min for both phototherapy groups. Rats in
the Ctrl and Str groups were sham-operated, but the laser was not turn on.

Open ﬁeld test (OFT)
Following a 60-min acclimation period in a room with dim light (15 lux),
the rats were placed in the center of a plastic box and allowed to explore
the arena for 10 min. The rats’ behavior was monitored and recorded by an
infrared camera placed above the box, and the number of entries and
duration of stay in the center was measured and analyzed using Any-Maze
software.

Elevated plus maze (EPM) test
After a 60-minute acclimation period to a dark room, the rats were placed
on the central platform of the maze, facing the same open arm, and
allowed to explore the maze for 10 min. The rats’ behavior was monitored
and recorded with an infrared camera positioned above the maze, and the
number of entries and duration of stay in the open arm (OA) and closed
arm (CA) during the 10 minutes of exploration was measured and analyzed
using Any-Maze software. Time in open arm% = (Time in OA)/ [(Time in
OA) + (Time in CA)] * 100%.

Fear conditioning test
Freezing behavior of rat was assessed in the electroshock chamber. The
time of rats stayed in the chamber for 6 minutes. The freezing time was

measured and analyzed using Freeze frame software for both the full
6-minute period and per minute. The percentage of freezing time was
plotted to evaluate the fear level of rat.

Immunohistochemical staining
The rats were sacriﬁced in 1–1.5 h after the behavioral tests, and their brain
sample were preserved using paraformaldehyde perfusion. The c-fos
antibody was purchased from Synaptic systems (226003). Immunoﬂuores-
cence staining with c-fos was performed to assess changes in the
activation level of neurons in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC),
including Infralimbic cortex (IL), Prelimbic cortex (PrL), and Cingulate
cortex, area 1 (Cg1).

Statistical analysis
Descriptive statistics, including mean and standard error of the mean, were
used to describe the results of behavior tests. The normal distribution and
estimate of variation were checked before statistical analysis. Differences
between the four groups were compared using one-way ANOVA, with
multiple comparisons performed using HSD. A p-value < 0.05 was
considered statistically signiﬁcant. To ensure the degree of freedom of
ANOVA, the number of rats in each group was set as 6. Statistical analysis
was performed using SPSS 26.0 software, and the results were plotted
using GraphPad Prism 9.4.0.

RESULTS
810 nm light irradiation apparatus developed for the
treatment of PTSD in rats
An 810 nm laser with continuous and pulsed wave was used to
irradiate anesthetized rats with a power of 2.0 W and a pulse
frequency of 10 Hz (Fig. 1A). The transmittances of continuous
810 nm laser to the scalps and skulls of sacriﬁced rats were
measured using an optical power meter, with transmittances
23 ± 1.0, 21.2 ± 1.1 and 23.3 ± 0.8% obtained at power densities of
10, 25 and 50 mW/cm2, respectively (Fig. 1B). The results indicated
that the irradiance at the brain was approximately 5 mW/cm2
when the scalp irradiance was set at 25 mW/cm2. Thus, a power
density of 25 mW/cm2 was used in the experiments. After 7 days
of adaptation, all rats except for the control group, were exposed
to SPS&S procedure. The rats in phototherapy groups received
810 nm laser irradiation with continuous or pulse in 30 min of
SPS&S. Behavioral tests were performed on all rats in 14 days.
Finally, the rats were sacriﬁced to take the brain tissue for analysis
of c-fos expression (Fig. 1C).

P-PT prevented PTSD-like anxiety in OFT
To investigate the effect of transcranial phototherapy on anxiety-like
behavior, the open ﬁeld test, as a classic method, was performed
[29]. The heatmap of the rats’ activities in open ﬁeld are presented in
Fig. 2A–D. The rate of moved distance in center area (distance%),
which is calculated as (moved distance in center area) / (moved
distance in total area), was applied to describe the mobility of rats.
Statistical analysis revealed that stressed rats showed less central
zone entries, time visiting the center area, moved distance, and the
rate of moved distance in center area compared to the Ctrl group
(P < 0.01, Str vs. Ctrl), indicating serious anxiety (Fig. 2E–H). Stressed
rats treated with CW-PT had signiﬁcantly increased central zone
entries, time visiting the center area, moved distance, and rate of
moved distance in center area, while those stressed rats treated with
P-PT showed the similar behavior to the rats in control group (Fig.
2A and D). Statistical analysis showed no signiﬁcant difference in
rats’ behavior between Str + P-PT and Ctrl group (Fig. 2E and H).
These results suggested that P-PT completely prevented the PTSD-
like anxiety in rats and CW-PT alleviated the PTSD-like anxiety in rats.

P-PT but not CW-PT prevented PTSD-like anxiety in EPM test
The elevated plus maze (EPM) test, another classic method to
assess the anxiety in rats, was used to further evaluate the effects
of transcranial phototherapy on anxiety-like behavior [30]. In the

EMP test, the rats’ behavior was assessed by monitoring their
activities in the cross, and the results were presented in Fig. 3A–D.
The following four statistical measures from the EPM test were
analyzed and presented in Fig. 3E–H. Our results showed that the
stressed rats had a reduced tendency to enter open arms, while
P-PT signiﬁcantly increased the number of entries (Fig. 3E) and
time spent in the open arms (Fig. 3F) in stressed rats. The four
statistical measures from the EPM test indicated that there was no
signiﬁcant difference in behaviors between the Str and Str + CW-
PT groups, suggesting that CW-PT failed to prevent the occurrence
of anxiety. However, there was a signiﬁcant difference in behaviors
of rats between the Str and Str + P-PT groups. More importantly,
there was no signiﬁcant difference in behaviors between Ctrl and
Str + P-PT groups (Fig. 3E–H). The results suggested that P-PT
prevented the PTSD-like anxiety, but CW-PT was unable to prevent
the occurrence of anxiety in rats.

higher freezing time compared to the Ctrl group (P < 0.001, Str vs.
Ctrl), indicating a serious fear-inﬂuenced memory. However, rats
treated with CW-PT or P-PT had signiﬁcantly lower freezing time
than stressed rats (P < 0.001, Str + CW-PT vs. Str; P < 0.001,

and the Ctrl group (Fig. 4A). We also analyzed the time course of
freezing time in four groups and found that CW-PT or P-PT
signiﬁcantly reduced the freezing time of stressed rats at each
time point (Fig. 4B). These results suggested that both P-PT and
CW-PT prevented the occurrence of PTSD-like fear in rats.

P-PT but not CW-PT prevented the expression of c-fos in the
hippocampus and amygdala

Hyperactivity in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC)
characteristic of PTSD psychopathology [32], and the expression
of c-fos is a biomarker of reﬂecting neural activity [33]. The Fig. 5A
showed the expression of c-fos in mPFC (Cg1, Prl, IL) of the rats in
four groups. The expression of c-fos in Cg1 and IL of stressed rats is
signiﬁcantly higher than that in Cg1 and IL of control rats (P < 0.05,
Fig. 5B, D). There was no signiﬁcant difference in the expression of
c-fos in Prl of four groups (P > 0.05, Fig. 5C). P-PT prevented the
upregulation of c-fos in Cg1 and IL of stressed rats. However, CW-
PT did not signiﬁcantly decrease the c-fos expression of stressed
rats (Fig. 5B, D). These results suggested that P-PT can prevent the
upregulation of c-fos in Cg1 and IL induced by SPS&S in rats.

DISCUSSION
This study explored the preventive effects of pulsed 810 nm laser
transcranial irradiation (10 Hz) on PTSD in rats and compared it with
that of CW 810 nm laser irradiation. Our results suggest that a
single dose of pulsed 810 nm laser transcranial irradiation was able
to prevent the development of anxiety and freezing behaviors in
rats exposed to the SPS&S. In contrast, CW-PT only had a preventive
effect on freezing behavior but not anxiety. Furthermore, P-PT
signiﬁcantly reduced the c-fos expression in Cg1 and IL of stressed
rats, whereas CW-PT had no signiﬁcant effects on c-fos expression.
Several stimulation methods have been employed to develop
rodent animal models that can reﬂect the symptoms of PTSD
patients, including foot shock (FS), underwater trauma (UT), social
defeat
(SPS), and time-
dependent sensitization (TDS) [34] Among of them, the SPS model
is widely employed as animal model of PTSD [12]. In this study, we
established the SPS&S model by subjecting the rats to electric foot

symptom and provides a more accurate evaluation of
fear
symptoms in subsequent experiments [28]. Our results showed
that the stressed rats present obvious PTSD-like anxiety and fear
after SPS&S in OFT (P < 0.001, Str vs. Ctrl) and fear conditioning test
(P < 0.001, Str vs. Ctrl) (Figs. 2 and 3),

and skull of rat (Fig. 1B). Previous study reported that an irradiance
of 25 mW/cm2 was applied in experiments since an irradiance of
3–7.5 mW/cm2 is known to reach the brain without increasing the
temperature during laser irradiation in mice [23]. Transcranial non-
invasive PBM is known to allow about 3% of near-infrared photons
to penetrate the scalp, bones, and dura mater to reach the surface
of the cerebral cortex [38]. In total 808 nm infrared light exhibits a
good penetration effect, with an effective depth reaching 4–5 cm
below the scalp of human [39].

The therapeutic effect of CW [40, 41] and pulsed [42] laser on
diverse neurological diseases has been studied extensively, with
pulsed laser showing superior therapeutic outcomes in some cases.
For instance, Kymplova et al. demonstrated that a 670-nm pulsed
laser at different frequencies (10, 25, and 50 Hz) was more effective
in promoting wound healing than a CW light source in a clinical
trial [43]. Similarly, Takahiro et al. compared the therapeutic effect
of 810 nm CW and pulsed lasers (10 and 100 Hz) on the
neurological and histological outcome of the traumatized mice,

and found that 10 Hz pulse frequency was the most effective [23].
In our study, we observed that pulsed 810 nm laser (10 Hz) was
more effective in preventing PTSD-like comorbidities in rats than
CW-PT. P-PT prevented both freezing and anxiety in stressed rats,
while CW-PT only prevented freezing (Figs. 2 and 3). These results
suggest that the therapeutic effects of P-PT may not be solely
attributed to PBM, but also to other yet unknown beneﬁts.

The pulsed frequency of 10 Hz has shown to be effective in
some neurological diseases. For instance, Tao et al. reported that
1070 nm light pulsed at 10 Hz could improve cognitive impair-
ment via reducing the cerebral Aβ load in Alzheimer’s disease
mouse model [44]. It is possible that the electroencephalogram
(EEG) is involved in the therapeutic effect of pulsed laser. The
human EEG comprises several frequency bands, including alpha

wave (α, 8–13 Hz), beta wave (β, 14–30 Hz), delta wave (δ,
0.5–3.5 Hz), and theta wave (θ, 4–7 Hz) [45]. Resonance may occur
between the frequency of the pulsed light and that of the brain
waves, particularly in the hippocampal region, where all mammals
exhibit prominent theta wave oscillation23. Although the neuro-
physiological etiology of PTSD is unclear, some studies reported
that the theta frequency band activity was decreased in both
resting and working condition in people with PTSD compared to
control subjects [16, 25]. The rats treated with SPS&S showed a
signiﬁcant decrease in delta and theta power spectra have been
demonstrated [46]. Our results suggest that 10 Hz (alpha wave)
pulsed laser transcranial irradiation prevented the occurrence of
PTSD-like comorbidities in rats. Therefore, the low frequency of
EEG waves may serve as potential therapeutic targets for PTSD.

The immediate-early gene c-fos is a widely used biomarker to
reﬂect
the level of brain activation in response to external
stimulation [47]. Normally, c-fos expression is low, but
is
upregulated after external stimulation, peaking around 1.5 h
post-stimulation. Consequently, assessing c-fos expression after
1.5 h of behavioral testing is an effective method to evaluate brain
activation levels during the test [48]. Several studies have reported
increased c-fos expression in the mPFC of animal models of PTSD
[49, 50]. Our study found that the stressed rats had a higher c-fos
expression in the Cg1 and IL than control rats. P-PT, but not CW-PT,
signiﬁcantly decreased the expression of c-fos in the Cg1 and IL of
stressed rats. This result suggests that the preventive effect of P-PT
on PTSD may be associated with the regulation of c-fos expression.
In conclusion, this study demonstrates that a single dose of
10 Hz pulsed 810 nm laser-phototherapy (P-PT) can prevent the
occurrence of PTSD-like comorbidities in rats. Both P-PT and CW-
PT are effective in the prevention of PTSD-like fear, but P-PT has a
in preventing anxiety in stressed rats. More
better effect
importantly, these results suggest that P-PT (10 Hz, 810 nm) has
the potential to be a non-invasive early intervention treatment for
preventing the occurrence of PTSD-like comorbidities in humans.
