Abstract
Aims: To provide an overview of published research on migration and health conducted in Norway and identify gaps in the 
research field. Methods: Applying a scoping review methodology, we searched Medline for articles on migration health in 
Norway published between 2008 and 2020, and assessed them according to research topic, methodology, user-involvement 
and characteristics of the populations studied (country or area of origin, type of migrant/immigrant status). Results: Of the 
707 articles retrieved, 303 met the inclusion criteria. Most studies (77%) were within the clinical disciplines reproductive 
health, mental health, infectious diseases and cardiovascular diseases, or on socio-cultural aspects and the use of healthcare 
services.  One  third  of  the  papers  (36%)  pulled  participants  from  various  geographic  backgrounds  together  or  did  not 
specify the geographic background. Among those who did so, participants were mostly from The Middle east, south and 
southeast Asia and sub-saharan Africa. Only 14% of the articles specified the type of migrant/immigrant status and those 
included refugees, asylum seekers and undocumented migrants. A total of 80% of the papers used quantitative methods, 
of which 15 described an intervention; 15 papers (5%) described different types of user-involvement. Conclusions: Our 
findings suggest gaps in research related to migrant subgroups, such as those from Eastern-Europe and labour 
and family reunification migrants. Future studies should further investigate the self-identified health needs of 
different migrant groups, and might also benefit from a methodological shift towards more intervention studies 
and participatory approaches.

Introduction

Migration trends

In  the  last  15 years,  international  migration  has 
increased to include today approximately 272 million 
people, or 3.5% of the world’s population [1]. These 
migrants  are  distributed  unevenly  between  and 
within countries. In Norway, the number of migrants 
and their descendants has increased tenfold since the 
1950s [2]. In 2020, migrants and their descendants 
accounted for approximately 15% of the Norwegian 
population, with backgrounds from a variety of dif-
ferent countries or regions [2]. Polish labour migrants 
account for the largest migrant group in Norway [2]. 
These  diverse  populations  also  have  heterogenous 

reasons for migration. Both globally and in Norway, 
labour migrants account for the largest percentage of 
international  migrants,  followed  by  people  who 
immigrate  due  to  family  reunification,  refuge  and 
education [1,2].

The relationship between migration and health 
is complex and dynamic

The health of migrants is important to consider in a 
society,  both  from  a  human  rights  perspective  and 
because it affects the host society as a whole [3]. In 
Norway,  as  internationally,  the  health  status  of 
migrants  differs  from  the  health  status  of  the  host 
population [4,5]. These differences are complex and

simple  cause–effect  explanations  are  insufficient. 
Theories  and  hypotheses  to  explain  differences  in 
health  status  and  health  care  use  between  migrant 
and  host  populations  include  ‘healthy  migrant 
effect’, 
and 
load’, 
‘Genetics’ [6]. Clearly, the health of migrants is influ-
enced  by  various  aspects  such  as  reasons  for,  and 
nature of, migration, origin countries and conditions 
of the places they came from and travelled through, 
as  well  as  individuals’  initial  health  condition  [7]. 
Importantly, migrants’ health is further influenced by 
conditions in their new host country: social inequali-
ties, language difficulties, unstable living conditions, 
discrimination, ‘cultural crash’ or the ability of health 
care systems to meet the migrants’ needs [3].

Research on migration and health

research on migrant health is important to inform 
policy makers and healthcare personnel about how 
to  improve  the  health  of  migrants,  and  may  also 
inform  public  discourse  [5,8]. The  increased  inter-
national  attention  paid  to  this  field  in  the  last  two 
decades is reflected in a growing number of publica-
tions [8], including evidence produced by the rela-
tively newly launched Lancet Commission on Migration 
and Health [5].

Collecting  and  mapping  available  international 
research  on  migration  and  health  can  help  reveal 
gaps  in  our  understanding,  and  suggest  future 
research activities to address health needs of inter-
national migrants to a larger extent [5,8]. however, 
the  health  of  migrants  varies  across  national  con-
texts. This depends on many factors associated with 
major migrant groups, host societies and their inter-
action [9]. National research activity should there-
fore  include  health  needs  of  migrants  in  a  specific 
national context. There are already a few reviews on 
in  Norway 
migration  health-related 
[3,7,10–12]. These focus mostly on different health 
challenges migrants in Norway have, or include only 
certain  migrant  groups.  None  of  them  provide  an 
overview over characteristics of the actual research 
activity and resulting research gaps in Norway. such 
an  overview  can  help  to  facilitate  more  effectively 
coordinated future research in the field in Norway, 
and can be an inspiration for other countries to map 
research  activity  on  migration  health  in  their  own 
context.

Aim

The overall aim of this study is to provide an over-
view  of  peer-reviewed  research  on  migration  and 
health  conducted  in  Norway  in  the  last  12  years. 

specifically, we aim to describe the research field the-
matically  in  terms  of  research  topics,  populations 
studied, user-involvement and methodologies used.

Methods

This  is  a  scoping  review,  which  is  useful  to  rapidly 
map existing evidence concerning a research area, to 
examine the nature, range and extent of the research 
activity  and  to  identify  gaps  in  knowledge  [13]. We 
applied  the  following  steps,  as  described  by Arksey 
and  O’Malley  [13]:  Identifying  the  research  ques-
tion,  identifying  relevant  studies,  study  selection, 
charting the data, summarizing the results.

group’, 

‘Minority 

Our research question was ‘Which and what type 
of evidence is available in Norway regarding migrant 
health?’. As a next step, we designed a search strategy 
built on Medical subject headings (Mesh) and rel-
evant free text words, and searched in Medline includ-
ing  abstracts,  key  words  and  titles.  Basically,  we 
combined Mesh terms and free text words to cover 
different  types  of  migrant  groups  (‘emigrants’, 
‘Immigrants’, ‘Migrants’, ‘ethnicity’, ‘ethnic group’, 
‘Multiethnic’, 
‘ethnology’, 
‘refugees’, ‘Transients and migrants’, ‘Asylum seek-
ers’, ‘Labour  Migrants’, ‘undocumented  Migrants’, 
‘unaccompanied  minors’)  with  the  free  text  word 
‘Norway’. see Figure s1 in the supplemental material 
for  the  complete  search  strategy. We  conducted  the 
systematic search on 18 October 2018 in Medline to 
identify  all  publications  that  concern  health  related 
topics for all types of international migrants in Norway 
as  defined  by  the  authors  of  the  retrieved  publica-
tions. Limiting the search to Medline only was chosen 
due  to  capacity  reasons,  and  we  are  aware  that  a 
search  in  other  databases,  such  as Web  of  science, 
could  have  provided  additional  articles,  especially 
from  social  sciences,  using  qualitative  methods. The 
search was limited to the period 2008 to the date of 
search, as we expected the number of publications in 
the field to be largest within the last decade [8]. We 
repeated the search on 22 september 2020 using the 
same  search  strategy  but  limited  to  publications 
between 2018 and date of search.

Further,  we  read  the  title  and  abstract  of  all 
retrieved documents to assess eligibility, applying the 
following inclusion criteria:

Figure 1.  Inclusion process.

We read through titles, keywords, abstracts and method 
sections of included articles and sorted them by research 
topic,  population  studied  (country  or  area  of  origin, 
gender,  age,  type  of  migrant)  and  methodology  used 
(quantitative,  qualitative,  mixed  methods,  interven-
tion). We also assessed whether or not involvement of 
users in the research was described in the papers. We 
defined ‘users’ as all other types of persons/institutions/
organisations except researchers, and ‘involvement’ as 
all  types  of  activities  that  bring  the  users’  perspective 
into the research. We used a ‘bottom-up’ approach for 
assessing  research  topics  and  populations  studied, 
meaning  that  we  developed  analytical  labels  as  they 
emerged from the studies. For studies fitting more than 
one category (for instance mental health AND use of 
healthcare services, or cardiovascular risk factor AND 
endocrine  diseases),  we  chose  the  topic  that  was  the 
main priority in the study as described in its aim and 
conclusion. When still in doubt, the thematic focus of 
the journal it was published in determined the category. 
For  instance,  if  a  study  on  mental  health  and  use  of 
healthcare services was published in a journal dealing 
with psychiatry, mental health was chosen as category. 
In  terms  of  study  participants’  geographical  back-
ground,  we  grouped  studies  that  did  not  specify  the 
geographical  background  of  participants  with  those 
that did so but did not report their findings/conclusion 
according  to  geographical  background  into  the  cate-
gory ‘various’. We categorised studies including partici-
pants  from  one  or  several  countries  or  geographic 
regions,  and  studies  reporting  findings/conclusions  to 
the  participants’  geographical  background,  according 

to how this was described in the papers. For assessing 
the  geographical  background  quantitively,  we  based 
calculations on country representations instead of num-
ber  of  studies,  as  many  studies  included  participants 
from  more  than  one  country/geographical  region. We 
pre-defined categories regarding research methodology 
as  either  quantitative,  qualitative,  mixed  methods  or 
review,  whether  or  not  the  study  was  an  intervention 
study and whether or not the involvement of users was 
described in the methods’ section.

results

Figure 1 shows the process of inclusion and exclusion of 
papers. We  retrieved  541  articles  from  the  search  in 
Medline in 2018, of which 239 documents were included 
in the study. The search in Medline in 2020 revealed  
an additional 166 articles, of which 64 were included  
in  the  study.  In  total,  303  peer-reviewed  articles  were 
included (see Table I in supplementary material).

Research topics

The bottom-up assessment of research topics resulted 
in 22 categories (see Figure 2). Most studies covered 
the  clinical  disciplines  reproductive  health  (20%, 
n = 60),  mental  health  (17%,  n = 51),  cardiovascular 
diseases/risk factors (11%, n = 34), infectious diseases 
(7%,  n = 20),  gynaecologic  health  problems  (5%, 
n = 16) and endocrine diseases (5%, n = 15). The two 
other dominating categories included a variety of top-
ics  related  to  understanding  patients’  or  providers’

perspectives  and  social  and  cultural  aspects  relevant 
for patient care (‘socio-cultural aspects’ 12%, n = 36) 
and  to  use  of  healthcare  services  among  migrant 
patients  (‘use  of  healthcare  services’  10%,  n = 31). 
The  thematic  areas  with  fewer  than  10  publications 
were  ‘Pain’  (3%,  n = 9),  ‘Dental  health’  (2%,  n = 5), 
‘Cancer’  (1%,  n = 4),  ‘Neurologic  disorders’  (1%, 
n = 4), ‘substance abuse’ (1%, n = 4), ‘Nutrition’ (1%, 
n = 3), ‘Multimorbidity’ (0.7%, n = 2), ‘Quality of life’ 
n = 1), 
(0.7%, 
‘Forensics’  (0.3%,  n=1),  ‘Geriatrics’  (0.3%,  n = 1), 
‘Orthopedics’  (0.3%,  n = 1),  ‘Vaccinations’  (0.3%, 
n = 1) and ‘use of medications’ ‘(0.3%, n = 1).

‘Otolaryngology’(0.3%, 

n = 2), 

Reproductive  health.  Predominant  topics  within  this 
field were pregnancy-related conditions or complica-
tions,  such  as  gestational  diabetes,  lifestyle  factors/
overweight and physical activity, pre-eclampsia, hyper-
tension,  hyperemesis,  depression,  Helicobacter  pylori 
infection related to pregnancy, incontinence and defi-
ciencies of vitamin D, iron and folic acid. Other topics 
covered  delivery  complications  (stillbirth,  preterm 
labour,  termination  and  perinatal  mortality),  contra-
ception and breastfeeding. see Table I.

Mental health.  studies on mental health dealt mostly 
with  either  the  prevalence  of  various  mental  health 
conditions or the role of various risk factors for develop-
ing  mental  illness  (discrimination,  childhood  trauma,  

asylum  process,  stressful  life  experiences,  accultura-
tion hassles). There were also studies on coping strat-
egies/resilience/social  support,  one  study  on  the 
validity  of  screening  for  psychiatric  disorders  and  a 
review on what is known and not known about men-
tal health problems among migrants. see Table I.

Cardiovascular diseases and risk factors.  studies in this 
category dealt mostly with prevalences or moderating 
risk factors for cardiovascular diseases (diabetes type 
2,  physical  activity,  overweight).  Other  studies 
explored  barriers  to  healthy  eating  and  there  were 
two  randomised  controlled  trials  (rCTs)  on  nutri-
tional habits and physical activity (see Table I).

Infectious  diseases.  This  category  included  first  and 
foremost  studies  on  tuberculosis  among  migrants 
(related mostly to screening). There were a few stud-
ies  on  aspects  related  to  sexually  transmitted  dis-
eases,  and  one  study  on  methicillin-resistant 
Staphylococcus aureus MrsA (see Table I).

Endocrine  disorders.  studies  in  this  category  dealt 
mostly with vitamin D related topics (vitamin D sta-
tus, nutritional rickets and vitamin D supplementa-
tion) including two rCTs on the effect of vitamin D 
on  muscle  strength  and  thyroid  autoimmunity, 
respectively. Other studies dealt with type I diabetes 
(see Table I).

studies 

Gynaecology.  Most 
examined  different 
aspects  of  female  circumcision.  some  focused  on 
migrant women’s participation at cervical cancer or 
breast  cancer  screening  programs,  including  one 
rCT to increase attendance rates for cervical screen-
ing programs (see Table I).

Pain.  This topic included studies on use of analgesic 
drugs, chronic pain and long-term sick leaves as well 
as  effects  of  vitamin  D  on  musculoskeletal  pain. 
There was also a rCT protocol on treating pain dis-
orders among migrants (see Table I).

Dental health.  studies in this category looked mostly 
at  children’s  dental  health,  especially  in  relation  to 
their parents’ attitudes (see Table I).

Socio-cultural aspects.  A variety of topics were found in 
this category, including cultural barriers to providing 
good health care from the perspectives of healthcare 
personnel and to the influence of culture on the use of 
medication, managing illness, health literacy, navigat-
ing  the  healthcare  system  and  on  tailoring  health 
information to migrants. Moreover, it included topics 
related to the Norwegian welfare state and experiences 
of living in the Norwegian society (see Table I).

Use  of  healthcare  services.  These  studies  assessed 
either  migrants’  utilisation  of  different  healthcare 
services  compared  with  the  native  population,  with 
different  aspects  regarding  access  to  healthcare  ser-
vices  (barriers/facilitators,  motivations)  or  experi-
ences of migrants with healthcare (see Table I).

Populations studied

Country  or  region  of  origin.  As  many  as  110  studies

ter of all studies (23%, n = 69) had participants from 
one  country  only,  while  37  studies  (12%)  included 
people from more than one country in various com-
binations. Another 23% (n = 71) described the back-
ground  of  their  participants  in  larger  geographical 
regions or continents without further specification of 
the country. Moreover, 4 studies described the back-
ground of their participants as high-income, middle-
income or low-income countries, and 13 studies were 
on perspectives of Norwegian healthcare profession-
als  on  migrant  health  related  topics  (including  1 
which studied both the perspectives of migrants and 
Norwegian healthcare personnel).

In the 106 studies specifying participants’ country 
of origin, 29 countries were represented at least once 
(either alone or in combination with other countries). 
Migrants from Pakistan (n = 53) and somalia (n = 41) 
were  most  often  represented,  followed  by  Turkey 
(n = 18),  sri  Lanka  (n = 15),  Iraq  (n = 11),  the 
Philippines  (n = 9),  Poland  (n = 9), Thailand  (n = 8), 
Afghanistan  (n = 8),  Vietnam  (n = 6),  India  (n = 5), 
Iran  (n = 5),  sweden  (n = 5),  Tamil  people  (n = 4), 
sudan  (n = 3),  ethiopia  (n = 3),  Indonesia  (n = 2), 
syria (n = 2), kosovo (n = 2), eritrea (n = 2), Germany 
(n = 2),  russia  (n = 2),  Yugoslavia  (n = 2),  Chile 
(n = 2),  Bosnia  and  herzegovina  (n = 2),  Myanmar 
(n = 1),  Morocco  (n = 1),  Gambia  (n = 1),  slovenia 
(n = 1) and kurdistan (n = 1) (see Figure 3).

When  dividing  origin  countries  into  larger  geo-
graphic  regions  (as  defined  by  the  united  Nations 
statistics  Division  [14],  we  find  that  Asian  migrants 
account  for  66%  of  the  total  224  representations  of 
geographic regions or continents (southern Asia 40%, 
n = 90;Western  Asia  14%,  n = 32;south  eastern  Asia 
12%,  n = 26),  followed  by  African  migrants  (sub-
saharan  Africa  22%,  n = 50;Northern  Africa  0.4%, 
n = 1),  europe  (eastern  europe  5%,  n = 11;Northern 
europe 2%, n = 5;southern europe 2%, n = 5;Western 
europe 1%, n = 2) and south America (1%, n = 2).

There were 71 studies describing the geographical 
background  of  study  participants  in  one  or  several 
larger regions or continents. Altogether, we found 11 
different  geographic  regions  described  alone  or  in 
various combinations. We sorted them based on how 
the regions were described in the publications. Asia 
was the region most often represented (see Figure 4).
Altogether,  we  found  20  representations  of  the 
terms  ‘western’  or  ‘non-western’  for  describing  the 
geographic  origin  of  study  participants  (Western 
countries n = 8, non-Western countries n = 12). Four 
studies  (in  total  12  representations)  described  their 
participants’ background in terms of income and one 
study described its participants as being from ‘devel-
oping countries’.

Gender and age.  Most studies (61%, n = 183) included 
adults  of  both  genders.  Approximately  one-quarter 
(26%, n = 79) included women only, with many studies 
on Pakistani and somali women. We found 36 studies 
(12%) on children or adolescents of both genders, and 
4 studies (1%) that included (Pakistani) men only.

Type  of  migrants/immigrant  status.  We  classified  for 
this paper type of migrant/immigrant status as both 
the  reason  for  migration  and  the  legal  status  of  the 
migrants. Only 42 studies (14%) provided informa-
tion regarding the immigrant status of their partici-
pants. All but two of them included people with one

ers  n = 10,  unaccompanied  minors  n = 10,  undocu-
mented  migrants  n = 3),  and  two  studies  included 
both refugees and asylum seekers.

Methodology

Of the 303 studies, 242 (80%) used quantitative meth-
ods,  55  (18%)  qualitative  methods,  4  (1%)  mixed 
methods  and  2  studies  (0.1%)  were  reviews. There 

were 12 papers describing results of two rCTs [15–
26], and 1 of a non-randomized controlled trial [27]. 
Two papers were protocols of rCTs [28,29], and one 
paper described a new municipal care program [30]. 
We  found  a  description  of  user-involvement  in  15 
papers (5%), based on 13 individual studies. The type 
of  user-involvement  varied  from  performing  qualita-
tive studies with users or collaboration with users to 
inform the researchers about challenges as a basis for 
an  intervention  [15,25–27,30,31],  collaboration  to 

develop an intervention [28], or to learn more about 
the subject of investigation, i.e. female genital mutila-
tion  [32].  In  five  papers,  users  were  involved  as 
research  assistants  to  recruit  participants  or  collect 
data [33–37]. In one study, users were involved in the 
whole  research  process  (‘including  the  adaption  and 
translation  of  tools,  recruitment  and  data  collection, 
transcription and translation of data, and primary data 
analysis’ [38].

Discussion

Summary of results

This scoping study provides an overview of research 
conducted  in  the  field  of  ‘migration  health’  in 
Norway. We found that studies focus thematically on 
a few clinical disciplines (reproductive health, mental 
health,  infectious  diseases  and  cardiovascular  dis-
eases  and  risk  factors),  but  also  on  socio-cultural 
aspects and the use of healthcare services. Most stud-
ies include migrants from south and southeast Asia 
and  sub-saharan  Africa,  often  pooling  participants 
from several countries together. Many studies do not 
specify  either  the  participants’  geographical  back-
ground or immigrant status. Most studies are descrip-
tive, very few are intervention studies and few papers 
describe user involvement in their methods section.

Are we addressing the real health needs of 
migrants?

Our  finding  that  migrant  health  research  is  domi-
nated by certain clinical fields is in line with two pre-
vious  reviews  from  Norway  [3,10],  one  review  on 
existing  research  on  migration  health  from  the 
republic of Ireland [39] and one bibliometric analy-
sis on migration health research on a global basis [8]. 
The clinical fields of mental health or infectious dis-
eases  may  indeed  cover  important  health  needs  of 
some  migrants,  as  for  instance  tuberculosis  is  more 
prevalent among some groups of migrants from low-
income countries, and mental health issues are truly 
a  great  challenge  for  migrants  with  a  flight  back-
ground or victims of human trafficking [5]. Yet, exist-
ing  studies  suggest  that  it  is  rather  musculoskeletal 
complaints, pain, stress, psychosocial conditions and 
complex  unexplained  health  problems  that  are 
among the most prevalent health problems of many 
migrants.  [40–43]. While  acknowledging  that  these 
less  studied  health  problems  may  not  affect  all 
migrants,  they  have,  however,  great  societal  rele-
vance,  as  they  for  instance  can  negatively  influence 
migrants’ participation in the labour market [41,44]. 
We  found  very  few  studies  which  explicitly  address

these complex health problems, even though studies 
within  some  of  our  categories  (‘mental  health’  or 
‘socio-cultural aspects’) also address stress and psy-
chosocial aspects. It is difficult to make a clear state-
ment about what the most significant health needs of 
migrants  actually  are,  given  the  small  number  of 
studies [40–43] that explore self-rated health, due to 
the  migrant  population’s  heterogeneity,  and  since 
what  is  perceived  as  ‘most  significant’  can  vary 
between whether one applies a public health perspec-
tive  or  the  perspective  of  the  individual.  however, 
our  findings  indicate  a  mismatch  between  existing 
research  priorities  and  significant  health  needs  of 
migrants  and  societal  challenges  related  to  migrant 
health in Norway. One explanation may relate to lack 
of information on migrant related aspects in existing 
health  registries.  For  instance,  The  Tromsø  study 
[45] with its assessment of health related factors and 
conditions for a whole municipality over five decades 
does not include information about nationality, lan-
guage or ethnicity (besides sami and Finnish Origin). 
It is also a general challenge in health research and 
clinical care that some health problems (such as dif-
fuse and complex health problems which do not eas-
ily  fit  into  disease  categories)  receive  less  attention 
than others without this being justifiable by the indi-
vidual or societal illness burden [46]. We suggest that 
to  develop  systematic  and  ethically  sound  ways  to 
ensure migrant health research in Norway and make 
it more ‘needs-driven’ [47] is an important task for 
the research community.

system  adaptations 

A  considerable  number  of  studies  address  socio-
cultural aspects or use of healthcare services. These 
are  important  topics  to  address  to  fully  understand 
health  challenges  of  migrants.  Importantly,  com-
pared with the scoping review from The republic of 
Ireland  which  finds  that  most  research  relates  to 
social  determinants  of  health,  public  health  prepar-
[39], 
edness  and  health 
Norwegian  studies  on  socio-cultural  aspects  focus 
mostly  on  ‘culture’  as  a  determinant  of  health  and 
healthcare. however, there is a need for better con-
sideration  of  structural  and  socio-economic  factors 
such as education or income as interdependent but 
different  variables  linked  to  health  and  disease  in 
order  to  deepen  our  understanding  of  the  determi-
nants of health for migrants as much more than being 
a question of ‘culture’. having a focus on ‘culture’, 
particularly the migrants’ culture, as the main barrier 
to health equity entails the risk of narrowly focusing 
on  migrants’  culturally 
influenced  behavior  to 
improve health, and of placing the responsibility for 
good health with the individual only while overlook-
ing structural factors [48]. In fact, the interventions 
we  found  in  our  review  aim  mostly  at  changing 

388 

  J. Laue et al.

migrants’  behavior  [26,28,30],  increase  their  health 
literacy  [23]  or  test  treatments  [19,29],  while  only 
one  intervention  turned  around  to  address  health 
service organization [15]. Also, as pointed out earlier 
[3,48], increasing attention to societal factors such as 
discrimination  in  future  research  could  expand  the 
existing  knowledge  base  and  serve  as  an  important 
step towards reducing health disparities and achiev-
ing equitable services for migrant populations.

Methodological aspects

The dominance of descriptive studies, mostly quanti-
tative, is in line with the reviews from Norway [3,10] 
and  Ireland  [39].  The  use  of  methodological 
approaches consistent with a positivist epistemology 
comes  with  the  risk  of  toning  down  complexities 
within the field, here migration health, and can leave 
out  important  relational  aspects,  such  as  how  peo-
ple’s  social  reality  is  shaped,  and  how  they  under-
stand  their  own  and  others’  actions  [49].  Lack  of 
research that provides necessary complementary per-
spectives  and  a  deeper  understanding  of  migrants’ 
health outcomes in Norway has earlier been identi-
fied and criticized [3].

Few  papers  describe  involvement  of  users,  and 
ways  in  which  users  were  involved  were  mostly 
quite  peripheral  (only  in  the  first  stages  of  the 
research  process  or  to  collect  data). Thus,  except 
for  one  study,  user-involvement  in  Norwegian 
migration health research seems to rather reflect a 
‘tokenistic’  [50]  way  to  involve  users  instead  of  a 
true  commitment  to  involve  users  in  the  whole 
research  [50].  underrepresentation  of  migrants 
and ethnic minorities in Norwegian research activ-
ity  has  been  described  recently,  and  the  authors 
identify  several  barriers  to  user-involvement  that 
includes  all  stages  of  the  research  process  [51]. 
According  to  our  findings,  knowledge  on  users’ 
perspectives (both migrants and healthcare provid-
ers)  seems  to  be  generated  almost  solely  through 
qualitative  studies,  which  can  indeed  give  insight 
into migrants’ and healthcare providers’ needs, yet 
may not be able to benefit from the advantages of 
‘true’ user-involvement [50].

We  also  found  very  few  intervention  studies. 
Methods that go beyond observation and description 
are needed to be able to adapt services to multicul-
tural populations and to secure that the measures are 
in line with the needs [52]. Overall, our findings sug-
gest  that  research  communities  should  shift  their 
methodological  focus  towards  more  intervention 
studies and participatory approaches through which 
migrants themselves can contribute in various stages 
of research processes [52,53].

Disproportionate focus on a few groups of 
migrants

We found an overly focus on migrants from south and 
southeast  Asia,  sub-saharan  Africa  and  the  Middle 
east. Yet,  migrants  from  eastern  europe  and  other 
european countries are the largest migrant groups in 
Norway, often immigrating as labour migrants or due 
to family reunification [2]. We found few studies on, for 
instance,  Polish  labour  migrants,  although  many  of 
them indeed have health problems and can experience 
significant barriers to accessing health care [4,42,54–
58]. health of labour migrants, especially those from 
less affluent countries, who often work in sectors with 
high exposure to occupational hazards and have jobs 
characterized by poor working conditions and limited 
legal rights [55,57–59], should be a priority in future 
research on migrant health. There is also little research 
that specifically addresses other large and small migrant 
groups, such as family reunification migrants or undoc-
umented migrants.

Many  studies  included  migrants  with  various  geo-
graphic  backgrounds  or  immigrant  status  or  pooled 
data  from  participants  from  different  backgrounds 
together. This finding is in line with a bibliometric anal-
ysis of global migration health research [8]. On the one 
hand, a generalising approach to understanding health 
issues  can  add  important  information  about  overall 
aspects, and pooling data may help generate statistical 
power. It can in fact be adequate to pool migrant groups 
when the study’s aim is to, for instance, address factors 
that are known to significantly affect several groups of 
immigrants  in  Norway.  On  the  other  hand,  when  the 
majority of studies is based on data with little granular-
ity  (for  instance,  when  grouping  migrants  from  one 
continent together); this will result in a knowledge base 
which  can  hide  important  details  and  differences 
between subgroups of migrants [60]. Lack of migration 
specific  details  in  for  example  registry  data  has  been 
pointed our previously [60].

Strengths and limitations

We  used  a  broad  search  strategy  and  followed  the 
methodological steps rigorously. Yet, we limited our 
search  to  one  database  only  and  we  may  therefore 
have missed some publications, especially regarding 
psychosocial  aspects  of  health  or  studies  from  the 
social sciences using qualitative methods to a larger 
extent, which could be indexed in other, non-medi-
cal, databases. As a result, the research gaps may be 
narrower  than  we  found  in  this  review.  Moreover, 
our  search  does  not  include  reports  from  national 
bodies  such  as The  Norwegian  Institute  of  Public 
health,  which  are  not  published  in  research  data-
bases.  however,  they  usually  build  upon  research 

papers, and we do not think that additional searches 
would have altered the overall picture of the research 
landscape significantly. We consider our bottom-up 
strategy for categorising the studies as most reason-
able  for  developing  an  understanding  of  what  is 
actually researched. This approach differs also from 
previous  reviews,  which  mostly  used  pre-defined 
categories  for  assessing  research  [3,39],  and  thus, 
adds to existing knowledge on the research field. Yet, 
other researchers might have developed other cate-
gories, especially for the category of ‘system/culture/
society/language’,  and  might  have  interpreted  the 
description  of  study  participants  and  user-involve-
ment  differently,  both  of  which  could  have  led  to 
slightly different results.

conclusion and implications

Our findings suggest significant gaps in research related 
to  migrant  subgroups,  such  as  those  from  eastern 
europe and labour and family reunification migrants. 
Future studies should explore and further investigate 
the  self-identified  health  needs  of  different  migrant 
groups.  A  methodological  shift  in  migration  health 
research  towards  more  intervention  studies,  and  par-
ticipatory approaches could be useful to better under-
stand the complexities in migration health issues and 
to effectively reduce the health disparities that still exist 
between migrants and the Norwegian population.
