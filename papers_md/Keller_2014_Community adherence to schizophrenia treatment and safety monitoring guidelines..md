Abstract

The 2003 Schizophrenia PORT treatment recommendations and Mt. Sinai Conference Safety 
Monitoring recommendations generated guidelines for pharmacological treatment of 
schizophrenia and monitoring of antipsychotic side effects. This study examined rate of 
recommendation adherence and impact of adherence on outcomes of outpatients with 
schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder in community mental health centers. Clinical practice 
was assessed as conformant, non-conformant, or not applicable. Treatment practices were 
conformant for antipsychotic dose (83%), use of antiparkinsonian (97%), antidepressant (100%), 
and antianxiety agents (90%), but not clozapine for residual positive symptoms (31%), monitoring 
weight gain (48%), glucose dysregulation (53%), hyperlipidemia (34%), or extrapyramidal 
symptoms (11%). Community mental health center treatment practices were largely conformant 
with 2003 Schizophrenia PORT treatment recommendations. There is less evidence patients who 
receive treatment in the community are adequately monitored for antipsychotic side effects per 
Mt. Sinai recommendations.

Introduction

Page 2

The paradigm of adherence to treatment based upon informed science is a general tenet of 
medicine (Sacket et al., 1996). Professional organizations and government agencies have 
established guidelines for the treatment of many diseases based upon the current available 
evidence, including diabetes, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia (American Diabetes 
Association 1990; Joint National Committee on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of 
High Blood Pressure 1977; Report of the National Cholesterol Education Program Expert 
Panel on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Cholesterol in Adults 1988) 
but, until recently, there was no general agreement on the best treatments for individuals 
with schizophrenia (American Psychiatric Association 2004, Lehman et al., 1998; Miller et 
al., 1999; McEvoy et al., 1999). Of the recently published guidelines or algorithms, the 
Schizophrenia PORT treatment recommendations are unique in that they are limited to 
evidence-based guidelines for best practices in the treatment of schizophrenia (Buchanan et 
al., 2010; Dixon et al., 2010; Lehman et al., 1998; Lehman et al., 2004). These guidelines 
were based on a review of available empirical data and assessment of the data by an expert 
panel. There are no comparable set of evidence-based practices for the monitoring of side 
effects associated with antipsychotic medications. The Mt. Sinai Conference Safety 
Monitoring recommendations are based upon expert review of the available evidence and 
consensus expert opinion and provide guidelines for commonly occurring side effects or 
medical conditions observed in people with schizophrenia.

In a previous study, we evaluated four 1998 Schizophrenia PORT pharmacological 
treatment recommendations: 1) acute inpatient antipsychotic treatment, 2) acute inpatient 
antipsychotic dose, 3) maintenance outpatient antipsychotic treatment and 4) maintenance 
outpatient antipsychotic dose for conformance and outcome (Buchanan et al., 2002). This 
study was cross-sectional, identified participants by medical record review, and had eligible 
participants undergo the PORT Mental Health Survey (a quality of life assessment); the 
majority of participants were treated with first generation antipsychotics. The study found no 
associations between treatment recommendation conformance and outcome; however, 
treatment with first generation antipsychotics at doses below the lower end of the 
recommended dosage range (i.e., less than 300 chlorpromazine equivalents) was associated 
with increased employment, indicating that those well enough to work probably required 
less medication. In contrast, outpatients treated with doses above the upper end of the 
recommended dosage range (i.e., greater than 600 chlorpromazine equivalents) had 
significantly more positive symptoms, indicating a degree of treatment resistance.

The purpose of this study was to examine the care of people with schizophrenia in 
community-based clinics to determine if treatment was in compliance with the 2003 
Schizophrenia PORT treatment recommendations and side-effect monitoring was in 
accordance with the Mt. Sinai Conference Safety recommendations. This study is unique 
since participants were assessed with ratings in person and not solely by chart or database 
review. Furthermore, we investigated the extent to which conformance with these 
recommendations affected clinical outcomes including symptoms, quality of life, and 
severity of medication side-effects.

Methods

Participants

Page 3

Participants with a chart diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, age 18 years 
or older, and currently being treated with a second generation antipsychotic (clozapine, 
risperidone, olanzapine, quetiapine, ziprasidone, or aripiprazole) were recruited from four 
local community mental health centers. Study sites are in suburban areas of Baltimore 
County Maryland and recruitment was from October 2007 to December 2011. Each clinic 
has 3–4 psychiatrists and clinics are not affiliated with a medical school. The psychiatrist 
caseload is typical of mental health clinics with approximately 15–20 patients per day. 
Possible participants were referred by their clinicians. The Institutional Review Boards of 
the University of Maryland School of Medicine and the Sheppard Pratt Health System 
approved the study protocol and informed consent procedures. Written documentation of 
informed consent and capacity to provide consent was obtained from all participants after 
study procedures had been fully explained and prior to study participation.

Assessments

Trained research staff completed all assessments. Scheduled reliability meetings for 
assessments are a routine part of training. Each participant had their psychiatric medication 
and medical history abstracted from their clinic records. The psychiatric medication history 
included current medications and medications for the preceding year. If a participant had 
been treated at the site for less than one year, then the medication history only included 
medications from the start of their treatment at the clinic. All current medical conditions and 
their associated treatments were also recorded.

The Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) (Overall and Gorham, 1962) total score and the 
Clinical Global Impressions (CGI) were used to assess global psychopathology. The BPRS 
positive symptom items (i.e., conceptual disorganization, hallucinations, unusual thought 
content, and suspiciousness) and the Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms 
(SANS) (Anderson, 1982) total score were used to assess positive and negative symptoms, 
respectively. Cognitive impairment was evaluated with the Repeatable Battery for the 
Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS) (Gold et al., 1999) and general well-
being was measured by the Level of Function Scale (LOF) (Heinrichs et al., 1984) and 
Quality of Life Interview (QOLI) (Lehman, 1983). The Simpson Angus Scale (SAS) 
(Simpson and Angus, 1970), Barnes Akathesia Scale (BAS) (Barnes, 1989), and MPRC 
Involuntary Movement Scale (MIMS) (Cassady et al., 1997) were used to measure 
movement disorder side-effects, while fasting glucose and lipid profile, prolactin level, 
EKG, and vital signs (including height, weight, and waist circumference) were collected to 
assess other side-effects and medical conditions.

Study Design

This was an observational study. Five 2003 Schizophrenia PORT treatment 
recommendations (Buchanan et al., 2010) and four Mt. Sinai Conference Safety 
recommendations (Marder et al., 2004) were chosen for conformance assessment. We

selected these recommendations because a conformance evaluation could be conducted 
through chart review.

The PORT recommendations selected were: 1) antipsychotic outpatient maintenance dose; 
2) antiparkinsonian agent use for movement disorders; 3) clozapine for people with residual 
positive symptoms; 4) antidepressant use in people with co-occurring depression; and 5) 
anti-anxiety use in people with co-occurring anxiety disorders. The Mount Sinai 
recommendations selected were monitoring the patient for: 1) increases in weight, BMI, and 
waist circumference; 2) glucose dysregulation; 3) hyperlipidemia; and 4) movement disorder 
side-effects.

Conformance was assessed for each recommendation based upon a predetermined 
algorithm, which consisted of one or more queries (see Table 1 and Table 2). The queries 
were answered in a stepwise manner until a determination could be made whether current 
treatment was conformant or non-conformant with the recommendation. If a 
recommendation did not pertain to an individual participant, then the recommendation was 
deemed to be “not applicable” for the individual. There were three circumstances under 
which a Schizophrenia PORT treatment recommendation could be deemed “not applicable”: 
1) clozapine for residual positive symptoms if participants did not have a score of 4 or more 
on at least one of the BPRS positive symptom items; 2) adjunctive antidepressants if major 
depressive criteria were not met; and 3) adjunctive anti-anxiety agents if generalized anxiety 
disorder criteria were not met.

The Mt. Sinai Conference Safety recommendations potentially not applicable included the 
following: 1) glucose dysregulation recommendation if there was no documentation of pre-
existing diabetes or risk factors other than antipsychotic treatment; and 2) hyperlipidemia 
recommendation if the BMI of the participant was less than 25.

Statistical Analysis

Descriptive statistics were used to describe patterns of antipsychotic and other psychotropic 
medication use. Schizophrenia PORT and Mt. Sinai Conference Safety recommendation 
conformance rates were categorically evaluated as either yes or no. The effect of 
conformance on clinical assessments and side effect assessments was evaluated using t-tests 
or ANOVA.

Results

Seventy-three subjects participated in the study. The demographic characteristics, 
medication data, and clinical and side effect ratings are presented in Table 3.

Schizophrenia PORT Treatment Recommendations

Schizophrenia PORT treatment recommendation conformance was generally high (83%–
100%), except for the use of clozapine for residual positive symptoms which had 31% 
conformance with the recommendation (see table 4). In terms of antipsychotic dose, 83% of 
participants were treated within the recommended dose range. Of those outside of the dose 
range, 50% (6 out of 12) were above and 50% (6 out of 12) were below the recommended

dose. Four of the six individuals whose dose was above the recommended range were 
treated with olanzapine. Of the two individuals whose treatment was not conformant with 
the antiparkinsonian recommendation one individual was treated with olanzapine above the 
recommended dose and the other was treated with risperidone long acting injection within 
the recommended dose. All of the participants meeting criteria for treatment with an 
antidepressant were conformant and 90% of participants meeting criteria for treatment with 
antianxiety medications were conformant.

Conformance with PORT recommendations was minimally associated with clinical 
outcomes. The only significant association was observed for clozapine treatment for residual 
positive psychotic symptoms. Individuals who were conformant with clozapine treatment 
had a significantly lower BPRS positive symptom item and total scores. The BPRS positive 
symptom item score for conformant individuals was 9.9 ± 4.0 compared to 12.3 for ± 2.8 for 
non-conformant individuals (t(49)= −2.6, p=0.013, 95% CI [−2.5, −2.3], effect size −0.3). 
The BPRS total score for conformant individuals was 36.3 ± 10.3 compared to 41.6 ± 8.0 for 
non-conformant individuals (t(49)= −2.1, p=0.046, 95% CI [−5.7, −4.9], effect size −0.6). 
Conformance with clozapine treatment recommendations resulted in improved Level of 
Functioning Scale total score (conformant =9.7, nonconformant=18.6). The other PORT 
recommendation with a trend toward improvement for conformant individuals was using 
antianxiety medications for individuals experiencing anxiety. Conformance with the 
antianxiety medication recommendation trended towards improvement in SANS anhedonia 
subscale (7.9 ± 4.1 versus 13.0 ± 4.2; t(34)= −1.7, p=0.093).

Mt. Sinai Safety Recommendations

Conformance with the Mt. Sinai Safety recommendations was generally poor with most 
recommendations having a conformance rate of approximately 50% or less. Monitoring for 
extrapyramidal side effects, akathesia, and tardive dyskinesia was especially poor with only 
11% conformance to the recommendation (see table 5).

The participants who were conformant for glucose dysregulation monitoring had worse 
metabolic parameters compared to the non-conformant group. The conformant group 
weighed more (229 ± 55.7 lbs. versus 202 ± 35.2 lbs.; F(2,68)=10.7, p<0.01); and had larger 
waist circumference (45.4 ± 5.5 in. versus 42 ± 3.7 in.; F(2,63)=17.2, p<0.01), higher BMI 
(35.3 ± 8.6 kg/m2 versus 30.6 ± 5.2 kg/m2; F(2,61)=11.7, p<0.01), higher VLDL (37.2 ± 
16.1 mg/dl versus 34.4 ± 18.9 mg/dl; F(2,63)=4.1, p=0.022), higher triglycerides (195.5 ± 
98.0 mg/dl versus 176 ± 96.3 mg/dl; F(2,61)=3.54, p=0.035), and a higher fasting glucose 
level (112 ± 41.9 mg/dl versus 101 ± 25.0 mg/dl; F(2,67)=2.2, p=0.12).

The participants who were conformant with hyperlipidemia monitoring weighed 
significantly more than the non-conformant group (230.7 ± 45.3 lbs. versus 217.4 ± 44.5 
lbs.; F(2,69)=19.1, p<0.01), had significantly higher waist circumference (45.5 ± 4.9 in. 
versus 43.8 ± 4.5 in.; F(2,64)=21.2 p<0.01), and significantly higher BMI (36.1 ± 7.7 kg/m2 
versus 33.3 ± 7.3 kg/m2; F(2,62)=17.3, p<0.01). The conformant group also had 
significantly lower HDL (46.3 ± 12.3 mg/dl versus 47.9 ± 15.2 mg/dl; F(2,69)=3.5, 
p=0.035). There was no difference in total cholesterol or triglycerides between the 
conformant group and non-conformant group for hyperlipidemia monitoring.

The participants who were conformant for weight monitoring weighed significantly more 
than the non-conformant group (225.9 ± 55.5 lbs. versus 189.8 ± 44.5 lbs.; t(70)=3.1, 
p=0.003). Too few participants were monitored for movement disorder sided effects to 
determine if there was any relationship between conformance and extrapyramidal side 
effects, akathisia, or tardive dyskinesia.

Discussion

The major finding of our study was that people with schizophrenia treated in outpatient 
community mental health clinics were generally conformant with the 2003 Schizophrenia 
PORT treatment recommendations, except for the use of clozapine for the treatment of 
residual positive symptoms. In contrast, conformance with the Mt. Sinai Conference 
recommendations for side effect monitoring was generally poor with providers following 
these recommendations less than fifty percent of the time.

Two other studies have examined the rate of conformance with Schizophrenia PORT 
pharmacological treatment recommendations in individuals receiving treatment at local 
community mental health centers. West et al evaluated conformance to the 1998 
Schizophrenia PORT treatment recommendations and the APA 1997 Practice Guidelines for 
the Treatment of Schizophrenia and found similar results: 83% of patients were treated 
within the target range of antipsychotics, 100% of patients with depression were receiving 
an antidepressant, and 71% of patients on a second generation antipsychotic were not 
receiving antiparkinsonian medications (West et al., 2005).

Goldman et al evaluated 1998 Schizophrenia PORT treatment recommendation, Texas 
Medication Algorithm Project (TMAP), and Expert Consensus Guideline Series 
conformance in a community mental health clinic (Goldman et al., 2003). In contrast to the 
current study and West et al (West et al., 2005), they found only 43% of patients had 
maintenance antipsychotic medication in the recommended range of 300–600 
chlorpromazine equivalents per day.

Our observation of poor adherence to the Mount Sinai side effect monitoring guidelines is 
consistent with previous studies. Cuffel et al found only 8.5% of 8166 patients had baseline 
lipid profiles 6 months after the ADA/APA Consensus statement was released and only 
22.5% had glucose testing after the release of the American Diabetes Association/American 
Psychiatric Association (ADA/APA) Consensus Statement recommendations (Cuffel et al., 
2006). In a Veterans health study evaluating lipid and blood glucose monitoring, 59% of 
veterans had their lipids monitored in the following 12 months after switching second 
generation antipsychotics. The veterans also had 80% monitoring of fasting blood glucose 
and 31% monitoring for hemoglobin A1C (Hsu et al., 2008). The CATIE study found the 
prevalence of metabolic syndrome to be approximately 40% depending upon the criteria 
used to define metabolic syndrome and found the associated diseases of metabolic syndrome 
– diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia - had a high rates of non-treatment in the 
schizophrenia population (McEvoy et al., 2005; Nasrallah et al., 2006). The present study, 
Hsu et al, and Cuffel et al all show very poor conformance to guidelines for monitoring 
physical health of individuals with schizophrenia in general psychiatric practice, which is

important given the side effect profile of second generation antipsychotic medications and 
concurrent medical comorbidities. Mortality for individuals with schizophrenia is higher 
compared to the general population and this difference can be directly attributed to an 
increased risk of death from comorbid medical conditions (Saha et al., 2007).

This is the first study to directly evaluate conformance to PORT and Mt. Sinai guideline 
recommendations of treatment and medical monitoring in the same population. Overall there 
was little relationship between conformance to the Schizophrenia 2003 PORT treatment 
recommendations, Mt. Sinai Safety Conference recommendations, symptom scores, 
cognitive measures, side effect evaluations, or quality of life rating scales. The only 
significant relationship between 2003 Schizophrenia PORT treatment recommendation 
conformance and outcome was for the clozapine treatment recommendation. Conformance 
was associated with lower BPRS positive symptom item and BPRS total scores. The 
observed benefit of conformance with the clozapine treatment recommendations was 
statistically and clinically significant and supports the importance of clozapine as a 
treatment option for people with continued positive symptoms. Clozapine continues to be 
underutilized in clinical practice despite clearly having a beneficial effect on treatment 
resistant symptoms (Conley et al., 2005; Joober and Boksa 2010; Nielsen et al., 2010; 
Rosenheck et al., 1999). Conformant participants also had a numerically, but not 
statistically, higher Quality of Life Interview global score and Level of Functioning Scale 
total score; these results are consistent with prior studies evaluating clozapine and quality of 
life (Rosenheck et al., 1999).

In a previous Medicaid database study, Dickey et al (Dickey et al., 2006) found adherence to 
the 1998 Schizophrenia PORT antipsychotic dosage recommendations were generally 
unrelated to measures of health status. Physical health was better, but not significantly, in 
the group whose dose was within the guideline recommendations. Patients in the high dose 
group had more non-movement-related side effects.

Stiles et al (Stiles et al., 2009) evaluated APA practice guidelines for schizophrenia using a 
Medicaid database and found treatment consistent with the recommended guidelines was 
associated with a small, but significant, reduction in mental health symptoms. In a review of 
psychiatric guidelines on provider performance and patient outcomes, there was insufficient 
evidence to draw firm conclusions on the effects of implementing specific psychiatric 
guidelines (Weinmann et al., 2007).

Although the rate of conformance with the Mt. Sinai Conference Safety Monitoring 
recommendations was low, participants who were conformant with the weight gain and 
obesity, glucose dysregulation, and hyperlipidemia recommendations had significantly 
elevated weight, waist circumference, and BMI compared to the non-conformant group. 
Other side effect measures were also elevated for those who were conformant with these 
recommendations. For the weight gain and obesity recommendation, the conformant group 
had significantly higher cholesterol and higher LDL. The conformant group for the glucose 
dysregulation recommendation had significantly elevated VLDL and elevated triglycerides, 
but lower HDL with no difference in glucose levels between groups. Conformant 
participants for the hyperlipidemia recommendation had significantly lower HDL compared

to the nonconformant and not applicable group. A plausible explanation for this finding is 
that patients who presented with objective indices for risks factors of metabolic disorders 
were more likely to be monitored than those without abnormal indices, i.e., in the context of 
limited resources, patients who were most in need received the required monitoring services.

Tosh et al (Tosh et al., 2010), working with the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group, evaluated 
all randomized or quasi-randomized clinical trials focusing upon physical health monitoring 
versus standard of care or comparing self-monitoring versus monitoring by a health 
professional or simple versus complex monitoring or specific versus non-specific checks or 
once only versus regular checks or comparison of different guidance. There were no studies 
that fulfilled the review criteria, so they could not evaluate the impact of health monitoring 
on quality of life. The impact of monitoring physical health as a means to reduce morbidity 
and mortality and improve quality of life is not clear, but at this time conformance to 
recommendations evaluating side effects is poor.

Guidelines for medical treatment based upon empirical evidence are meant to improve 
medical care and patient outcomes. Refinement of medical guidelines is a continuous 
process of improvement. Since this study was completed the 2009 Schizophrenia PORT 
Recommendations have been published. There are slight differences between the 
recommendations evaluated for the 2003 Schizophrenia PORT recommendations and the 
2009 Schizophrenia PORT recommendations. The 2009 recommendations differ by not 
recommending adjunctive treatment with antidepressants or anti-anxiety medications due to 
insufficient evidence to support their use in schizophrenia.

This is the first study to evaluate, through direct patient assessment, how conformance to 
treatment and side effect monitoring recommendations affected psychiatric symptoms, 
medical outcomes, and quality of life. It is critically important to determine if conformance 
to recommended treatment and monitoring guidelines alters patient outcomes and if these 
effects are clinically significant. Borenstein (1998) argues that many studies make the 
unfortunate mistake of equating clinical significance with statistical significance. Treatment 
guidelines and recommendations are based upon these primary studies. Therefore, in order 
to provide appropriate guidance to clinicians, guideline authors should strive to ensure that 
treatment and monitoring recommendations lead to clinically meaningful differences in the 
care of patients.

This study suggests poor patient outcomes are not prevented by conformance to 
recommended side effect monitoring guidelines, but, rather, poor outcomes may encourage 
late conformance to side effect monitoring guidelines. In addition, the population at risk for 
these side effects would probably benefit from increased monitoring. They often have 
difficulty obtaining medical care and some of the participants may already have 
undiagnosed medical issues, specifically metabolic abnormalities, at the time of their 
participation in the study. One way to enhance side effect monitoring and increase diagnosis 
of medical illnesses would be to have primary care physicians embedded in mental health 
clinics. This would ensure that appropriate referral, diagnosis, and treatment are easily 
completed in the same clinic were mental health services are administered.

Due to the cross-sectional design of the study the impact of more adherent monitoring 
practices over time could not be evaluated, but this would be an important area of future 
research. It is unclear if prospective implementation of these guidelines is most pertinent to 
overall patient well-being. The medications used to treat psychotic symptoms have a 
plethora of side effects, specifically metabolic, and this current study does not address the 
question of conformance and non conformance secondary to side effects from medication. 
Conformance to the PORT recommendations may have been affected by patient’s inability 
to tolerate side effects. As with other areas of medicine, psychiatry is continuously weighing 
the risks and benefits of treatment. Future studies are needed to address the impact of 
conformance to recommended guidelines and guidelines need to be continuously revised and 
updated so guidelines accurately reflect the link between guideline conformance and 
outcomes of patient health.
